5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, the Book of the Dead was updated, {{revised and}} standardised. Spells were {{consistently}} ordered and numbered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> standardised version is {{known today as}} the 'Saite recension', after the Saite (26th) dynasty. In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the Book of the Dead remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book of the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E

5|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{failed to}} reach the quarter-final stages of a ranking event <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> season: losing 4–5 to Joe Swail in the last 16. This began a run of poor form that saw O'Sullivan lose in the opening round of the Masters 2–6 to Jimmy White {{and then in the}} second round of the Thailand Masters 4–5 to Shokat Ali (losing the {{deciding}} frame on a re-spotted black). O'Sullivan returned to winning ways, by capturing the Irish Masters title by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, before he experienced another dip in form losing to Mark Davis in opening round of the Scottish Open.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{could only}} manage a 1–1 draw at Wimbledon on 3 April as Beckham’s well-drilled shot {{cancelled}} out Jason Euell's opener {{in the fifth}} minute. Despite several of the first-team members being rested for the Juventus tie, United won 3–0 at Old Trafford against Sheffield Wednesday and battled well to earn a point against Leeds at Elland Road after the midweek tie at Juventus.

5|$|Samuel Adams {{emerged as}} an {{important}} public figure in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763).

5|$|The FA Charity Shield {{was founded}} in 1908 as a {{successor}} to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield.

5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144.

Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 873), Büchel (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1202), Broich (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1442).|$|R

5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Big Four {{held the}} top four places in the rankings for a whole {{calendar}} year <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> also prompted the first uses of the term 'Big Four' {{to refer to the}} players, although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray who themselves were still regarded ahead {{of the rest of the}} tour. At the Australian Open, Nadal won his first Australian Open title in another 5-set epic, obtaining a third consecutive Major final victory over Federer, while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier on. Nadal continued to dominate early in the season, but suffered from injury in June, allowing Federer to take the upper hand for the rest of the season. Federer subsequently passed the record for most Grand Slam tournament wins, taking his 14th Grand Slam title at the French Open, thus completing the Career Grand Slam after Nadal had prevented him from achieving this feat at the previous 4 French Open tournaments, and 15th title at Wimbledon respectively. Federer finished the season having reached all four Major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} the first Whig {{president}} would give that party the opportunity to fill federal jobs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He made a very public progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the President-elect and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he filled his cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he had been promised the position of Postmaster General.|$|E

5|$|For 1924–25, the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve {{teams from}} the competition. York {{finished}} sixth in the Principal Competition that concluded in February 1925 and were runners-up to Denaby United in the North Subsidiary Competition. The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and generosity of the directors. John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925–26 and York finished in 16th place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926–27, when they finished in sixth place and scored 96 goals in 38 league matches. They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> season, being beaten 2–1 by Second Division team Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. In 1927, the club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League, but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected instead. Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927–28, York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager. York finished ninth in 1928–29, and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with 49 goals. This was York's last season in the Midland League as the club won election to the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North.|$|E
5|$|The species {{first arrived}} in North America in 1941 (these early {{sightings}} were originally dismissed as escapees), bred in Florida in 1953, and spread rapidly, breeding {{for the first time}} in Canada in 1962. It is now commonly seen as far west as California. It was first recorded breeding in Cuba in 1957, in Costa Rica in 1958, and in Mexico in 1963, although it was probably established before that. In Europe, the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century it expanded back through the Iberian Peninsula, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe; southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981 and Italy in 1985. Breeding in the United Kingdom was recorded {{for the first time in}} 2008 only a year after an influx seen in the previous year. In 2008, cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into Ireland <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> trend has continued and cattle egrets have become more numerous in southern Britain with influxes in some numbers during the non breeding seasons of 2007/08 and 2016/17. They bred in Britain again in 2017, following an influx in the previous winter, and may become established there.|$|E
