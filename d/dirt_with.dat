5|$|Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, {{in terms}} of access, {{stratovolcano}} in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. Highway 12 passes about 25 {{miles to the north}} of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town of Trout Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or <b>dirt,</b> <b>with</b> varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles. Two small towns, Glenwood and Trout Lake, are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.|$|E

25|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} (Solenopsis invicta), {{also known as}} the fire ant or RIFA, is a species of ant native to South America. A member of the genus Solenopsis in the subfamily Myrmicinae, it was described by Swiss entomologist Felix Santschi as a variant in 1916. Its current name invicta was given to the ant in 1972 as a separate species. However, the variant and species were the same ant, and the name was preserved due to its wide use. The red imported fire ant is native to South America but it has been accidentally introduced in Australia, New Zealand, several Asian and Caribbean countries and the United States. The red imported fire ant is polymorphic as workers appear in different shapes and sizes. The ant's colours are red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or black gaster. However, males are completely black. Red imported fire ants are dominant in altered areas and live {{in a wide variety of}} habitats. They can be found in rain forests, in disturbed areas, deserts, grasslands, alongside roads and buildings, and in electrical equipment. Colonies form large mounds constructed from <b>dirt</b> <b>with</b> no visible entrances because foraging tunnels are built and workers emerge far away from the nest.|$|E

25|$|Early {{information}} of Charlotte Charke {{can be found}} in the autobiography called a Narrative of The Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke by Charlotte Charke herself, she wrote this and published it as a male author. In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, they talk to us about her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but she also felt as though she had been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. She was a great shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens <b>dirt.</b> <b>With</b> the absence of her father due to business endeavours and the lack of a mother figure due to constant illnesses, Charlotte became as independent as a young child her age could be, only to put up with nagging maids that watched over her every once and while.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{road from}} 1900 to 1910 was the Old Chicago Road, later renamed the Dunes Highway. [...] The Dunes Highway Association engineers envisioned the Dunes Highway a [...] "state of the art" [...] concrete highway with a [...] right-of-way. [...] In August 1919, Commission director H.L.

Narrower than anticipated, the new concrete highway was still superior to most Indiana roads, {{which in the}} mid-1920s were gravel or <b>dirt</b> <b>with</b> paved sections only between the larger towns.

500|$|Other American POWs were {{similarly}} tortured and maltreated {{in order to}} extract [...] "confessions" [...] and propaganda statements. [...] Many, especially among {{those who had been}} captured earlier and imprisoned longer – such as those in the [...] "Alcatraz Gang" [...] – endured even worse treatment than McCain. [...] Under extreme duress, virtually all the POWs eventually yielded something to their captors. [...] There were momentary exceptions: on one occasion, a guard surreptitiously loosened McCain's painful rope bindings for a night; when, months later, the guard later saw McCain on Christmas Day, he stood next to McCain and silently drew a cross in the <b>dirt</b> <b>with</b> his foot. In October 1968, McCain's isolation was partly relieved when Ernest C. Brace was placed in the cell next to him; he taught Brace the tap code the prisoners used to communicate. On Christmas Eve 1968, a church service for the POWs was staged for photographers and film cameras; McCain defied North Vietnamese instructions to be quiet, speaking out details of his treatment then shouting [...] "Fu-u-u-u-ck you, you son of a bitch!" [...] and giving the finger whenever a camera was pointed at him. McCain refused to meet with various anti-Vietnam War peace groups coming to Hanoi, such as those led by David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, and Rennie Davis, not wanting to give either them or the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection to his father. [...] McCain was still badly hobbled by his injuries, earning the nickname [...] "Crip" [...] among the other POWs, but despite his physical condition, continued beatings and isolation, {{he was one of the}} key players in the Plantation's resistance efforts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I find {{differences}} between illegal trash dumping on <b>dirt</b> roads <b>with</b> dwellings compared to dirt roads without dwellings. I researched all dirt {{roads in the}} Rabbit Creek area by using Google Earth. I then qualified each road into two categories. First I measured {{the length of the}} road, then I researched the number of dwellings which can only be accessed by that road. After this information was compiled the number of dwellings was divided by the length of the road in miles to give an average number of dewllings per mile for each dirt road. The roads were then separated into two categories; 1) <b>dirt</b> roads <b>with</b> less than three dwellings per mile, 2) <b>dirt</b> roads <b>with</b> three or more dwellings per mile. I compiled both lists of roads and randomly picked two roads out of each category and visited each to view the trash or litter. For the purposes of this project I classified illegal dumping as a single piece of debris weighing at least five pounds or a pile of debris measuring one cubic yard or more. These roads were then inspected and I concluded that the <b>dirt</b> roads <b>with</b> three or less dwellings on them had a significantly larger amount of illegal dumping than <b>dirt</b> roads <b>with</b> three or more dwellings...|$|R

2500|$|Because of {{the weather}} and the poverty of the soil, the plateau is mostly heath and bare <b>dirt</b> <b>with</b> only a few common juniper shrubs and some moor birches. The {{principal}} vascular plants one encounters are snowbed willow, Alpine bearberry, Alpine hawkweed, crowberry, cowberry, blue whortleberry and alpine azalea. But that which renders the vegetation of the Fulufjället plateau particularly unique in Sweden is its richness in lichens, with in particular the vast carpets of reindeer lichen and of fönsterlav, not affected there by the pasture of domestic reindeer, unlike most of the Swedish mountains.

Aretaeus of Cappadocia, writing in the first century AD, observes among [...] "Celts, which are men called Gauls, those alkaline substances that are made into balls [...] called soap".

2500|$|While BMX Action's {{deliberate}} boycott was damaging, {{it was not}} {{the only}} reason the ABA was receiving reduce coverage in the BMX press, including in BMX Action's biggest competitors BMX Plus! and Super BMX. Many ABA nationals coincided with important NBL nationals and considering there was an informal pro boycott of ABA nationals with the most prominent pros competing in the NBL and second tier sanctioning bodies like the United Bicycle Racers (UBR) and with those races were often scheduled on the same weekend as ABA events, the press followed. This led to a further decrease in coverage with the ABA events only getting one page, half page or even just a blurb in the [...] "Breaking News" [...] section of a major BMX publication, for instance BMX Plus! 's [...] "Check Point", which as previously mentioned due to lack of top pros at ABA events did not cover any ABA races in depth for eight months. The BMX industry noticed this of course. In consequence, there were fewer BMX and non-BMX companies willing to sponsor, i.e. invest in, ABA events with the fewer direct and indirect advertising possibilities like a race team and/or particular racer they were sponsoring having a win reported in detail or even a company banner appearing in the background of a photograph by happenstance that would be printed in a major BMX magazine. Those companies could not only stop sponsoring and co-sponsoring ABA races, but also stop sending their expensive race teams to ABA Nationals. Also, the rank and file non-sponsored BMX racers-the vast majority-could stop attending ABA events if they perceive a lack of press coverage and a lack of big name pros and amateurs they wanted to see and race against stop participating. The in house ABA Action newspaper was not enough since it was restricted to ABA members and therefore it had a limited audience in comparison to a newsstand magazine. The obvious solution afforded to the ABA was to create its own magazine. In 1982 Mennenga created Bicycles and Dirt to circumvent the established press and attract advertisers. The first issue of Bicycles and Dirt or BAD, premiered with the September 1982 issue. Contrary to Mennenga's expectations, advertisers did not flock to the new magazine, despite its built in audience. Like the newspaper ABA Action it was a subscription only magazine at the time. With this in mind the ABA put BAD on newsstands a year after its premier with Stu Thomsen on the cover of its September issue. It did not change the situation. The financial woes of BAD only grew worse and worse. However, instead of cutting one's losses after a few issues as most publishers would do, Mennenga continued to throw good money after bad and pump ABA funds into the ill-conceived and ill-executed venture. Eventually, it became clear to Mennenga that the ABA could not sustain the loss and there was no hope of a turnaround, and an agreement with BMX Action magazine cease publication as a condition to end its editorial boycott he folded Bicycles and <b>Dirt</b> <b>with</b> the September 1984 issue.|$|E
