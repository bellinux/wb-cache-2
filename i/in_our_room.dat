60|$|MABEL. That beast, De Levis! I was <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> {{next door}} all the time.|$|E
60|$|I {{guess the}} people in the next rooms must have thought there was {{something}} of a rumpus <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> when I caught him.|$|E
60|$|Our {{hotel was}} pleasant--opening on a walk shaded by double rows of trees. We ordered {{a nice little}} tea <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> arid waxed quite merry over it.|$|E
2500|$|... "At night, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> we can't sleep. We twitch {{and dance}} and jig about {{as though we}} were doing St Vitus's Dance..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These are not <b>our</b> parade manners. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{as we say}} in the Guard, all men are men. Outside we are {{officers}} and men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} back, girls, and dress for dinner--an unusual luxury, isn't it? Our trunks {{arrived at the}} hotel two weeks ago, and are now <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> doubtless, {{awaiting}} us to unpack them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Snowe," [...] said Paulina to me (she had now {{got into}} the habit of {{occasionally}} chatting with me when we were alone <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> at night), [...] "do you know on what day in the week I like Graham best?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something that dragged a chain {{behind it}} and came {{up out of the}} cellar and tried to get <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> on the second floor," [...] {{explained}} the youth. [...] "It almost got us, too," [...] he added, [...] "and it did it all night." ...|$|E
60|$|In Europe {{we do not}} go down to {{the office}} or bar room, when we are ready to leave a hotel, to call for and settle our bill there, as we do in America, but we ring the bell <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> and ask the waiter to bring the bill to us.|$|E
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE [scornfully]. Yes: there WOULD be. Suppose we {{must put}} up with that: sinks <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> and pipes that rattle and bang and guggle {{all over the house}} {{whenever}} anyone washes his hands. I know.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, Morton, we've never asked him. What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over, you know. We go on that principle, and smoke <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> with the doors shut and windows open. Come along!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is another}} {{trick of the}} monster Zog," [...] {{answered}} the Queen calmly. [...] "He has made the water <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> boiling hot, and if it could touch us, we would be well cooked by this time. Even as it is, we are all made uncomfortable by breathing the heated air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} {{anything about a}} tumble," [...] said Tom, slowly. [...] "I--I--thought I was <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> at Brill, old number twenty-five. And it wasn't winter either. Say, I can't understand all this. Are we {{out in the woods}} back of Brill? Hadn't we better get back? See how it's snowing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what I cannot exactly see, Sir John. An armed guard remains <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> all night. But, in {{the first}} place, he might be himself in the plot, and if not, the slaves would almost {{certainly}} overpower him and kill him, as a preliminary {{to the work of}} knocking off their chains." ...|$|E
6000|$|She led the {{way into}} the room where the boy lay in a low bed near a larger one. His {{crutches}} lay beside it. [...] "Win sleeps <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> yet. He can take care of himself quite well. But when he wakes in the night he likes to reach out and touch his father's hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, it bolted, and was {{cared for}} by one of your neighbors. We must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which might {{interest}} you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Recorded mostly <b>in</b> <b>our</b> living <b>rooms</b> (George's too), plus Bear Creek Stuidios, Pine Forest studios, CC's {{recording}} studio and Angelhouse Studios ...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{they took}} part in the Virgin 1 show A Restaurant <b>in</b> <b>our</b> Living <b>Room,</b> {{catering}} for 25 people in their home.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the next}} day wasn't no better. We staid <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> all day, for we didn't care to meet Mrs. Jackson an' her crazy brother, an' I'm sure we didn't {{want to see the}} mean creatures who kept the house. We knew well enough that they only wanted us to stay so that they could get more board-money out of us." ...|$|E
60|$|The reader may praps recklect a very {{affecting}} letter {{which was}} published in the last chapter of these memoars; in which the writer requested a loan of five hundred pound from Mr. Algernon Deuceace, and which boar the respected signatur of the Earl of Crabs, Mr. Deuceace's own father. It was that distinguished arastycrat who was now smokin and laffin <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{account of}} the cross on the mantelpiece <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> I suppose," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine. [...] "But whether they're given to idols or prayer-books, I know they've got a mighty nice house; and considerin' the {{distance}} from stores, there's {{a good deal more}} in that pantry than you'd expect to find in any house I know of, when the family is away." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were sitting}} at <b>our</b> {{editorial}} desk <b>in</b> <b>our</b> inner <b>room,</b> quietly writing up our week's poetry, when a stranger looked in upon us.|$|R
6000|$|... "By experience," [...] she {{answered}} gravely. [...] "On the fifth of October these fears of his {{come to a}} crisis. For years back {{he has been in}} the habit of locking Mordaunt and myself up <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> on that date, so that {{we have no idea what}} occurs, but we have always found that he has been much relieved afterwards, and has continued to be comparatively in peace until that day begins to draw round again." ...|$|R
60|$|The next evening, {{when we were}} quietly sitting <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own <b>room,</b> Euphemia {{remarked that}} she did not wish to have {{anything}} to do with French flats.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me think}} a moment," [...] said Isabel not {{thinking}} an instant. She {{had taken a}} fancy to {{at least two of}} these people from the first, and in the last hour they had all become very well acquainted now she said, [...] "I'll tell you: there are two beds <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> also; we ladies will take one room, and you gentlemen the other!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We sat {{talking for}} a little while <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> and John's {{headache}} got worse and worse. I persuaded him to go to bed, and I put out the candle (the fire giving sufficient light to undress by), so that he might the sooner fall asleep. But he was too restless to sleep. He asked me to read him something. Books always made him drowsy at the best of times.|$|E
60|$|The town of Como lies, a {{swarm of}} lights, behind us; the hills and shadows gloom around; the lake is a sheet of tremulous silver. There is no telling how {{we get back to}} our hotel, or with what {{satisfied}} hearts we fall asleep <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> there. The steamer starts for the head of the lake at eight o'clock in the morning, and we go on board at that hour.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Feltz and Ofoedu {{won their}} {{episode of the}} Virgin 1 show A Restaurant <b>in</b> <b>our</b> Living <b>Room,</b> {{preparing}} a dinner at their home for 25 people.|$|R
5000|$|... "About {{the time}} I {{arrived at the}} school, inside {{plumbing}} had been installed and toilet accommodation had been modernized and enlarged. An adequate supply of water was also ensured by the erection of a windmill at Duffins Creek...which delivered some eight thousand gallons of water daily. This was {{in addition to the}} reserve supply in the main well and cisterns at the school. Nevertheless, we still used pitchers and basins <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> for washing and we filled our own jugs at a tap in the bathroom." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. You will STILL {{have them}} {{coming to the}} house, will you? You will still let them trample <b>in</b> <b>our</b> private <b>rooms,</b> will you? Bah! I ought to leave you to your own devices. (Exit.) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first time}} I ever met a bull-dog--to speak to, that is--was many years ago. We were lodging {{down in the}} country, an orphan friend of mine named George, and myself, and one night, coming home late from some {{dissolving}} views we found the family had gone to bed. They had left a light <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> however, and we went in and sat down, and began to take off our boots.|$|E
6000|$|A {{little before}} twelve o'clock last night, my husband {{dictated}} {{to me the}} last words of [...] "The Yellow Mask." [...] I laid down the pen, and closed the paper thoughtfully. With that simple action {{the work that we}} had wrought at together so carefully and so long came to a close. We were both so silent and still, that the murmuring of the trees in the night air sounded audibly and solemnly <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Ada being <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> with a cold, Mr. Skimpole {{was left}} alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and {{sometimes}} singing to them (as we heard at a distance) with great expression and feeling. When we rejoined him in the drawing-room {{he said he would}} give us a little ballad which had come into his head [...] "apropos of our young friend," [...] and he sang one about a peasant boy, ...|$|E
6000|$|We felt {{we stood}} for a new movement, not {{realising}} how perennially this same emancipation returns to those ancient courts beside the Cam. We were the anti-decency party, we discovered a catch phrase that we flourished about in the Union and made our watchword, namely, [...] "stark fact." [...] We hung nude pictures <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> much {{as if they had}} been flags, to the earnest concern of our bedders, and I disinterred my long-kept engraving and had it framed in fumed oak, and found for it a completer and less restrained companion, a companion I never cared for in the slightest degree....|$|R
60|$|At Alexandria and Cairo {{we found}} him invaluable. He looked after our luggage, which he gallantly rescued from the lean hands of fifteen Arab porters, all eagerly {{struggling}} to gain possession of our effects; he saw us safe into the train; and he never quitted us till he had safely ensconced us <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> at Shepheard's. For himself, he said, with subdued melancholy, 'twas to some cheaper hotel he must go; Shepheard's wasn't {{for the likes of}} him; though if land in County Clare was wort' what it ought to be, there wasn't a finer estate in all Oireland than his fader's.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{witnessed}} {{one of my}} uncles, my cousin, and my grandfather, on {{his very}} first trip to London from Stoke, down every drop of liquor <b>in</b> <b>our</b> dressing <b>room.</b> Consumed <b>in</b> full, <b>our</b> booze rider <b>in</b> those days would have killed anyone but us." ...|$|R
