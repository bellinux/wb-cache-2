Worldwide sales of all the Bond books rose throughout the sixties as Dr. No and the subsequent films – From Russia with Love and Goldfinger – were released: in 1961 500,000 books had been sold, which rose to six million in 1964 and seven million in 1965. Between the years 1962 to 1967, a total of nearly 22.8 million Bond novels were sold.|$|E
5|$|Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine (4 February 1740 – 28 August 1793) was a French general. As a young {{officer in}} the Bourbon Royal army, he served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Years' War. In the American Revolutionary War he joined Rochambeau's Expédition Particulière (Special Expedition) {{supporting}} the American colonists. Following the successful Virginia campaign and the Battle of Yorktown, he returned to France and rejoined his unit in the Royal Army.|$|E
5|$|After {{involving}} itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France {{found itself}} financially ruined. Attempts {{to pass an}} economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in turn by the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E

5|$|After its victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire {{was deeply}} in debt. Looking for {{new sources of}} revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the stern had become deeply embedded in the sand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E

5|$|Britain's successes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Years' War {{had left}} it with {{expensive}} commitments in the Americas {{that had to be}} paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe.

Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.|$|E

5|$|Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia's borders. The {{boundaries}} were unclear as {{laid out}} by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described.

The disputes over Acadia flared into open conflict during King George's War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Years' War.|$|E
