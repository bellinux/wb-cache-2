5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> very well.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

500|$|The general {{pattern of}} {{reaction}} has been typified by Bob Kerrey, {{president of the}} New School and former Senator from Nebraska, who originally stated that Hsu had been [...] "a terrific member" [...] of the New School board.

[...] After Hsu became a two-time fugitive, Kerrey remarked, [...] "I thought that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> but obviously I didn’t." ...|$|E

In The Sunday Times in February 1969, Paul Jennings wrote of him: [...] "If I ever knew a gentleman, it was Kenneth Horne.... He gave you his whole attention, his whole courtesy. And what a courtesy it was!... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> {{in the context of}} panel games, to which his marvellous unforced humour, spontaneous but beautifully timed, always added sparkle." ...|$|E

500|$|Debbie Rowe met Michael Jackson in the mid-1980s, {{while working}} as an {{assistant}} for the pop star's dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe treated Jackson's vitiligo, {{which he had been}} diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life. Rowe supported Jackson, providing answers to the questions Jackson asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman, who hung it on the walls of her office. According to Rowe's friend Tanya Boyd, the dermatologist's assistant would obsess over Jackson, gushing over him and his traits. She would say to her friend, [...] "If people knew him like <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> they would not think he was strange. He's unique, kinky, actually." ...|$|E
500|$|The Violin Concerto (1910) was {{commissioned}} by Fritz Kreisler, {{one of the leading}} international violinists of the time. Elgar wrote it during the summer of 1910, with occasional help from W. H. Reed, the leader of the London Symphony Orchestra, who helped the composer with advice on technical points. Elgar and Reed formed a firm friendship, which lasted for the rest of Elgar's life. Reed's biography, Elgar As <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>Him</b> (1936), records many details of Elgar's methods of composition. The work was presented by the Royal Philharmonic Society, with Kreisler and the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer. Reed recalled, [...] "the Concerto proved to be a complete triumph, the concert a brilliant and unforgettable occasion." [...] So great was the impact of the concerto that Kreisler's rival Eugène Ysaÿe spent much time with Elgar going through the work. There was great disappointment when contractual difficulties prevented Ysaÿe from playing it in London.|$|E
500|$|Poe's {{characterization}} as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed. His drinking companion for a time, Thomas Mayne Reid, {{admitted that}} the two engaged in wild [...] "frolics" [...] but that Poe [...] "never went beyond the innocent mirth in which we all indulge... While acknowledging this as one of Poe's failings, I can speak truly of its not being habitual". Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine. He only drank during difficult periods {{of his life and}} sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol. Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe's use of alcohol was his membership in the Sons of Temperance {{at the time of his}} death. William Glenn, who administered Poe's pledge, wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond. Suggestions of a drug overdose have also been proven to be untrue, though it is still often reported. Thomas Dunn English, an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor, insisted that Poe was not a drug user. He wrote: [...] "Had Poe the opium habit when <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere – I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander." ...|$|E
