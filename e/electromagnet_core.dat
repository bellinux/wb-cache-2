40|$|This study {{presents}} the design, development {{and testing of}} a magneto-rheological (MR) damper for an off-road vehicle. The MR damper developed {{in this study is}} expected to enhance the capability of the suspension system by allowing variable damping due to inherent properties of the MR fluid. MR fluids exhibit a reversible behaviour that can be controlled with the intensity of an external magnetic field, causing a change in the effective viscosity and thereby also in the forcevelocity characteristics of the damper. The characteristic of this damper design distinguishes the damper developed in this study from the conventional damper used in the suspension system of a passenger car by having a controllable damping characteristic instead of a fixed one. The damper is designed to be used on the hydro-pneumatic 4 State Semi-active Suspension System (4 S 4) that was developed by the University of Pretoria. Another additional feature of the damper developed in this study is the ability of the damper to act as a fluid flow blocking device so as to enable semi-active control of the suspension springs as required for the 4 S 4 system. A mathematical model of the proposed damper has been developed using a modified Bingham plastic model. This model is used to determine the necessary geometry for the damper designed in this study, using the fluid flow rate and current to the electromagnet as the two main input variables. Furthermore, the model is used to compute the pressure drop over the MR valve {{as a function of the}} coil current and fluid flow rate. For manufacturing and size considerations, the proposed design incorporates a triple pass layout valve-mode damper with the MR fluid flowing through the three passages that are arranged in an S-shape so as to minimize the cross section of the <b>electromagnet</b> <b>core</b> while maintaining the required width and length of the valve to perform adequately. An experimental setup has been built to test the validity of the analytical model. Experimental results confirm the applicability of the analytical model to accurately predict the pressure drop over the MR valve for given operating temperature and fluid properties. Experimental results show that the original MR damper designed for this study provides the required range of damping as compared to the reference system used for this study, with the only error being that the values of damping, both in the on-and off-state, are lower than expected. By using the validated theoretical model it has been seen that the whole range of damping characteristics can be shifted upwards by reducing the MR fluid passage height inside the valve which should yield the required characteristics.

40|$|Rotating {{machinery}} systems experience {{torsional vibrations}} with varying frequencies {{to some degree}} during normal operation. These vibrations if not controlled properly may cause severe system performance limitation and reduction of the fatigue life. Attenuation of torsional vibrations in these systems is a challenging engineering problem and raises several important issues in industrial applications. The present research aims at developing a novel hybrid torsional vibration damper incorporating a conventional Centrifugal Pendulum Vibration Absorber (CPVA) with the Magnetorheological (MR) damper capable of suppressing torsional vibrations at different excitation frequencies. In fact, CPVA and torsional MR damper have been investigated separately in previous research, however, {{there has been no}} study reported on integrating the two systems for the attenuation of torsional vibration. In this research study, first, the governing equations of motion for both horizontal and vertical CPVA have been derived using Lagrange’s principle to investigate the effect of gravity on the dynamics and performance of CPVA. Moreover, softening nonlinear behavior of the pendulum absorber and its effect on the natural frequency of the system has been investigated. Next, a rotary MR damper prototype was optimally designed, manufactured and tested. The design process of the rotary MR damper included several critical factors, particularly, analysis and design of the magnetic circuit of the MR damper. In order to ensure efficient design of the proposed damper, a finite element (FE) model of the rotary MR damper was developed to accurately evaluate the magnetic field distribution in the MR fluid and <b>electromagnet</b> <b>core</b> generated by the built-in electromagnet. The developed FE model enables to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design configuration as well as the selected material for the MR damper components. In addition, the equation of transmitted torque has been derived and utilized to evaluate the MR damper performance. In order to obtain the optimum geometric dimensions of the designed MR damper, an optimization problem has been formulated. The combined Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) have been employed to accurately capture the global optimum solution. An experimental test set up has been designed to evaluate the fabricated rotary MR damper performance by measuring the generated damping torque and to validate simulation results obtained from the model. Subsequently, the hybrid torsional MR damper incorporating both conventional CPVA and rotary MR damper has been proposed. The CPVA has been connected to the cylindrical housing of the MR damper. The governing equations of motion of the system consisting of a rotor with attached hybrid torsional dampers have been derived to evaluate the performance of the system under current off and maximum current applied to the MR damper’s electromagnet. The results are also compared with those obtained from rotor systems with only attached CPVA and rotary MR damper. Finally, a feedback control system using the semi-active skyhook control algorithm has been developed to adaptively control the proposed hybrid torsional damper under varying external excitations. It has been shown that the suggested closed-loop feedback control algorithm can significantly improve the damper performance compared with the open-loop (current off and on) system...|$|E

Such plasmas are dominated by both electron scale and ion scale physics as well as finite beta effects.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} tuned {{vibration absorber}} (ATVA) {{can be used}} to suppress unwanted vibrations. If the excitation frequency is time harmonic but the frequency changes with time, it is desirable to retune the ATVA so that the natural frequency of the ATVA always coincides with the excitation frequency. One way of achieving this is to adjust the stiffness of the ATVA. The key challenge is to change the stiffness in real-time. Tunable fluids such as Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids, whose properties can be controlled by a magnetic field, may be used to address this challenge. The subject of this thesis is an ATVA exploiting the changeable properties of MR fluids in the pre-yield state. The ATVA is designed as a three-layer beam with elastic face plates and MR fluuid in the <b>core.</b> <b>Electromagnets</b> are attached to the top and the bottom layers to generate a magnetic field. By varying the current supplied to the electromagnets, the shear stiffness of the MR fluid and hence the stiffness of the ATVA can be varied. The vibration characteristics of the ATVA {{as a function of the}} magnetic field strength are predicted by a finite element model together with an empirical model for the shear modulus of the MR fluid and a model for the magnetic field applied to the fluid. An MR fluid-filled ATVA was manufactured and tested to validate the predictions. This ATVA design allows the natural frequency to be changed by 40. 6 %. The self-tuning of the MR fluid-filled ATVA can be achieved by integrating an adaptive-passive controller with the ATVA so that its stiffness can be continuously adjusted in real-time. The control aims to drive the cosine of phase angle between the velocities of the host structure and the ATVA to zero. Various control algorithms, i. e. non-linear proportional, derivative, and proportional-plus-derivative controls, are investigated. Computer simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the MR fluid-filled ATVA is able to retune itself in the order of 0. 2 seconds. The ATVA can also maintain the tuned condition within a reasonably wide frequency range between 110 and 146 Hz in the face of changes in the forcing frequency. The MR fluid-filled ATVA has the potential to substantially reduce vibration of a host structure. The proportional-plus-derivative control was found to be the best control approach for the ATVA.
