5|$|Donaggio had no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> soundtracks for films at the time, but was {{introduced}} to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out {{and asked him to}} write something for the beginning of the film.

The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
