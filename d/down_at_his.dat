5|$|In rural Alberta, Canada, a {{telephone}} lineman is stung by a bee {{as he works}} {{at the top of}} a pole. Five identical boys approach and watch as the lineman adversely reacts to the sting, causing him to fall to the ground and die. The boys look <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> body, then walk off silently.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{visits a}} Seattle hospital {{to pick up}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), who works there as a counsellor. Rothenburg is brought in on a stretcher by paramedics. Black notices a peculiar slash across her palm, and glances <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own, which bears a scar matching the woman's cut exactly. Rothenburg then dies of her injuries.|$|E
25|$|In the event, {{no major}} trouble materialised, perhaps {{thanks to the}} {{precautions}} put in effect. By September 1970 {{it was reported that}} Freeland was to step <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own request, due to extreme stress. He was succeeded by Vernon Erskine-Crum on 4 February 1971. This proved to be a short-lived appointment as Erskine-Crum suffered a heart attack soon afterwards and was replaced, in turn, by Lieutenant-General Harry Tuzo on 2 March. Freeland was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1971 Queen's Birthday Honours, and retired from the army on 21 June 1971.|$|E

25|$|On 19 September 1936, while {{preparing}} for the race, Tom Campbell Black was killed at the U.K's Liverpool, Speke Airport, in a ground collision with another aircraft. A RAF bomber that had landed ran into Black's Mew Gull as he taxiied out for take off. Black was reputed to have been looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> map at the time. The propeller of the large biplane tore through the side of Black's cockpit, striking and mortally wounding {{him in the chest}} and shoulder. He died on the way to hospital. He left a widow, the English actress Florence Desmond, whom he had married in 1935.|$|E
25|$|In February 1976, Haley's {{saxophone}} {{player and}} best friend, Rudy Pompilli, {{died of cancer}} after a nearly 20-year career with the Comets. Haley continued to tour {{for the next year}} with a succession of new sax players, but his popularity was waning again, and his 1976 performance in London was critically lambasted in the music media, such as Melody Maker. That year, the group also recorded an album, R-O-C-K at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio for Sonet Records. In early 1977, Haley announced his retirement from performing and settled <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> home in Mexico. According to the John Swenson biography of Haley, the musician was quoted as saying that he and Pompilli had an agreement that if one died, the other would retire.|$|E
25|$|The {{first player}} moves {{the number of}} spaces along the track {{according}} to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instruction. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand {{at any time during}} the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.|$|E

25|$|She {{was ordered}} from Henry Adams, of Lepe on 16 December 1761, laid <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> yards in February 1762, and {{launched}} there on 21 April 1765. By {{this time the}} Seven Years' War was over and she was ordered to be fitted for ordinary rather than entering active service immediately, a process completed by 5 May 1765. She had received the name Europa on 18 April 1763, while under construction. The outbreak of the American War of Independence led to {{a need for more}} ships, and an Admiralty order was issued on 19 September 1777 for her to be refitted and then prepared for sea. She was taken in hand at Portsmouth Dockyard, which had already been working on a small repair since October 1776, and she was commissioned in September 1777 under her first captain, Timothy Edwards. She was renamed HMS Europe on 9 January 1778, and completed her fitting out in March that year.|$|E
25|$|From {{the opening}} bell Liston {{attempted}} to close with Ali, looking {{to land a}} hard punch to the head to end the fight quickly and decisively. Though Ali often carried his gloves <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> waist, seemingly open to attack, he proved very difficult to hit. With Ali quickly ducking his head left, right or away, Liston's leading left jabs largely failed to land. As Liston pursued his target Ali retreated away, using his foot speed to slip away into open space in the ring, largely circling {{to the left and}} away from the threat of a Liston left hook. Though the opening round saw Ali largely on the defensive, it was soon established that Ali could reverse roles quickly and take to the offensive with a remarkably fast series of combinations delivered to Liston's head. A sudden violent combination delivered with 30 seconds left in the round electrified the crowd. The opening round was fought an extra 20 seconds, as both fighters and referee Barney Felix apparently did not hear the bell.|$|E
25|$|After confronting his wife, Gavrik {{locks the}} door and {{strangles}} Elena to death. Sasha is unable to stop it. Meanwhile, Ruth joins Harry outside the bunker, and they both decide to leave the intelligence service and live together. However Sasha, armed with {{a large piece of}} broken glass and blaming Harry for his mother's death, tries to stab him. Ruth intervenes and is stabbed instead. She dies from her injuries before help can arrive, leaving Harry to mourn the loss of his love. In a telephone conversation with Towers sometime later, it is evident that Harry is considering leaving the service. It also becomes clear that Harry has engaged an outside agency to assassinate Mikhail Levrov (Jeffry Wickham) and his co-conspirators. Towers requests he not be informed of the details of these actions. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is shown walking into Levrov's house for an appointment with him. Harry is then seen entering the memorial area of Thames House with the names of all the MI5 officers who died in service, some of whom were characters who were killed during the series (Danny Hunter, Fiona Carter, Colin Wells, Zafar Younis, Ben Kaplan, Adam Carter, Jo Portman, Ros Myers, Ruth). He then walks onto the Grid, sits <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk and answers the phone, indicating he intends to continue working in the service.|$|E

500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E
500|$|Blackburn {{remained}} in Canada to avoid prosecution by U.S. authorities, but {{he returned to}} his home country in 1868 to help combat a yellow fever outbreak along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. Although the charges against him had not been dropped, he was not arrested or prosecuted. He rehabilitated his public image by rendering aid in yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873, Fernandina, Florida, in 1877, and Hickman, Kentucky, in 1878. Dubbed the [...] "Hero of Hickman", Blackburn's ministrations propelled him to the Democratic gubernatorial nomination the following year. In the general election, he defeated Republican Walter Evans by a wide margin. As governor, Blackburn won passage of several reforms in the areas of state finance and internal improvements, but his signature accomplishments were in the area of penal reform. Troubled by the conditions at the penitentiary in Frankfort, Blackburn attempted to ease overcrowding through liberal use of his gubernatorial pardon, earning him the derisive nickname [...] "Lenient Luke". He also secured approval of {{the construction of a new}} penitentiary at Eddyville, the adoption of a warden system to replace the corrupt private oversight of the old penitentiary, and the implementation of the state's first parole system. Although his record of reform led historians to laud him as [...] "the father of prison reform in Kentucky", his liberal pardon record and expenditure of scarce taxpayer money to improve the living conditions of prisoners was unpopular at the time, and he was booed and shouted <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own party's nominating convention in 1883. After his term as governor, {{he returned to his}} medical practice and died in 1887. The Blackburn Correctional Complex, a minimum-security penal facility near Lexington, Kentucky, was named in his honor in 1972.|$|E

2500|$|Tolstoy {{began writing}} War and Peace in 1862, {{the year that}} he finally married and settled <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> country estate.

2500|$|Welterweights Claude Patrick and Brian Ebersole then {{faced each}} other.

[...] After all three rounds of the fight were completed, a split decision victory was given to Brian Ebersole.|$|E
2500|$|The Cassel Report {{states that}} {{convictions}} were obtained in only {{nine of the}} 25 cases it investigated and that several of those convictions are suspect as erroneous and incomplete. A month before Nairac's killing, a Catholic chemist, William Strathearn, was gunned <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> home in Ahoghill, County Antrim. SPG officers Weir and McCaughey were charged and convicted for the killing. Weir named Jackson as having been the gunman but Jackson was never interrogated for [...] "reasons of operational strategy". The Special Patrol Group was disbanded in 1980 by the RUC after the convictions of Weir and McCaughey for the Strathearn killing.|$|E

2500|$|Following John Lennon's {{announcement}} {{in a band}} meeting on 20 September 1969 that he wanted a [...] "divorce" [...] from the Beatles, Paul McCartney withdrew to his farm in Campbeltown, Scotland. Author Robert Rodriguez describes his frame of mind as: [...] "brokenhearted, shocked, and dispirited {{at the loss of}} the only job he had ever known". While the announcement was not made official, partly for business reasons, McCartney's period in seclusion with his family coincided with widespread rumours in America that he had died – an escalation of the three-year-old [...] "Paul Is Dead" [...] conspiracy theory. The rumour was broken only by journalists from BBC Radio and Life magazine tracking him <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> farm, High Park.|$|E
2500|$|In 1858 Jastrow moved {{again as}} rabbi to the leading Orthodox {{congregation}} in Warsaw, and {{threw himself into}} {{the study of the}} Polish language and of Polish conditions. By February 27, 1861, national feeling had risen so high in Poland that the government called out the military; five victims fell in the Krakowskie Przedmieście, Warsaw, and their burial and the memorial service were turned into patriotic demonstrations, in which, for the first time, [...] "the Old Testament Brethren" [...] of the Poles participated as a community. Though it was Sabbath, three rabbis, including Jastrow, joined the funeral cortège; at the memorial service in his synagogue, also on a Sabbath, Jastrow preached his first Polish sermon, which aroused such great enthusiasm that on Sunday his auditors reassembled and took it <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> dictation. Circumventing the censor, they distributed ten thousand manuscript copies within a week.|$|E
