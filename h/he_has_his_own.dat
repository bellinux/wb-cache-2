25|$|The Great Caesar is {{the head}} of the Los Angeles {{division}} of the TNT group. He is a former Chicago mobster who made his fortune during the Prohibition era.

25|$|Paul's icon {{continues}} the Apostles tier {{on the right}} side. He {{was not one of}} the twelve disciples of Jesus; Paul, a Roman citizen, was arrested in Jerusalem because he was accused of preaching against the Jewish law and traditions. However, as a Roman citizen by birth, he exercised his right to appeal to Caesar. He was brought to Rome, and after six years' imprisonment, the curia sentenced him to death. Considering his Roman status, they chose the most pious way to execute him: Paul was beheaded with a sword according to tradition. This is the reason he is shown with a sword in his right hand. In his left hand he holds his epistles from the New Testament. The next icon portrays John. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> gospel in his left hand. Legend has it that John was the only apostle who was not martyred as he died after a long life in Ephesus. Nevertheless, he was unable to escape persecution and had to defend his faith before Domitian. The emperor told him that he should prove the strength of his God with deeds and not just words. John asked for a cup of poisoned wine that he blessed and then drank; the strength of his faith protected him and he remained unharmed. The empty chalice on his gospel is symbolic of this miracle. Luke the Evangelist appears in the next image. As in the icons of Mark and Matthew, he holds a quill and his gospel. The icon of James the Elder follows Luke's image. He was painted with a pilgrim's staff, holding a pack and a letter of pilgrimage in his right hand. James was John's brother, and he was beheaded in Judea in 44 AD. His relics were translated to Spain, where one of the first pilgrimage sites in Europe was born to venerate him. The Camino de Santiago leads to his shrine. Simon's icon is the next on the tier; he preached the Word in Egypt, and he was martyred in Armenia. Simon was put to death by a saw and is portrayed with the symbol of his martyrdom. The last image on the Apostles tier depicts Philip. He lived and spread Jesus' teachings in today's Turkey, and according to Christian traditions he was crucified upside-down. He holds a Latin Cross to commemorate his martyrdom.|$|E
500|$|Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, one of few {{mainstream}} {{critics to}} {{have read the}} comic-book miniseries, said that the film compared poorly with the source material. Noting that the hero in the comic goes even further, [...] "breaking the fourth wall and positioning himself so that he's 'prison-raping' and taunting the reader for having liked the series", Lovece found that, [...] "hile Millar may have contempt for his readers—and, by extension, the medium in which he works—at least <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> vision, and gets it across with style and wit"; qualities that, in Lovece's opinion, the movie lacked.|$|E

2500|$|Bharavi's [...] "power of {{description}} and dignity of style" [...] were {{an inspiration for}} Māgha's Shishupala Vadha, which is modelled after the Kirātārjunīya and seeks to surpass it [...] While Bharavi uses 19 different types of metres, Māgha uses 23; while Bharavi praises Shiva, Māgha extols Vishnu; and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> instances of one-consonant (dādadoduddaduddādī…) and sarvatobhadra palindromic verses.|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} her son, Félix {{went on to}} comment: Enrique is a very gifted man, with admirable common sense. He's my best friend. I have so much fun with him. He's not a [...] "mama's boy" [...] as many believe. Self-employed, fight like being independent. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> career, his audience, his poster and assumes his {{responsibilities}} without relying on me. The unexpected death of Enrique {{as a result of}} a heart attack in 1996, plunged Félix into deep sadness, although in public she always showed great fortitude.|$|E

He wields {{a cooking}} knife {{attached}} to a chain, which emits loud clinking sounds meant to distract the opponent during battle and perhaps make up for a lack of physical strength. He flaunts himself as a master cook. As the story progresses, Ah-Gi becomes more of a comic relief character than an actual threat. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pages, located {{at the end of the}} Manhwa, called [...] "Ask Ah-Gi," [...] a short comical strip of few pages where he (supposedly) answers questions from the readers, often involving Ah-Rin and Ah-Ran, and ends up getting beaten up/stabbed/slashed/etc. by the two girls.|$|E
