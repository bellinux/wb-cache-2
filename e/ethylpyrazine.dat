40|$|N-Acetylglucosamine was pyrolyzed at 200 °C for 30 min. Thermal {{degradation}} products were isolated and analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The volatile compounds that were identified included pyrazines, pyridines, pyrroles, and furans. The compound 3 -acetamido- 5 -acetylfuran {{was found to}} be the major degradation product, with 2 -acetylfuran, 3 -acetamidofuran, pyrazine, pyridine, <b>ethylpyrazine,</b> methylpyrazine, 2 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyrazine, 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine, and acetamide in decreasing order. The compound 3 -acetamido- 5 -acetylfuran was isolated by preparative column chromatography, and its NMR spectrum was obtained to confirm its structure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate and {{identify}} odour active compounds from French fries at mouth conditions. Volatile compounds were released from French fries by purge-and-trap, trapped on Tenax TA, and identified with GC–MS. GC–olfactometry was used to determine odour active compounds with a trained panel using the detection frequency method. A total of 122 compounds were identified of which 85 % originated from either sugar degradation and/or Maillard reaction and 15 % from lipid degradation, based on relative areas. About 50 odour active compounds were, due to coelution, responsible for 41 odours perceived by the panel. 3 -Methylbutanal and 2 -methylbutanal, hexanal, 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine, 2 -methylpropanal, 2, 3 -butanedione, pyridine, heptanal, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine and/or 2, 6 -diemethylpyrazine and/or <b>ethylpyrazine,</b> dimethyl trisulfide, octanal, phenylacetaldehyde, 2, 5 -diethylpyrazine, (E) - 2 -nonenal, 3 -methylbutanoic acid and/or 2 -methylbutanoic acid, (E,Z) - 2, 4 -heptadienal, (E) - 2 -octenal, 5 -ethyl- 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine and/or 2 -ethyl- 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, nonanal, and tentatively 2 -methylpyrrole had the highest detection frequencies. This resulted in a strong malty and fried potato note, combined with caramel/buttery, green, spicy, and deep-fried notes. Also chemical and sweaty odours were observed...|$|E
