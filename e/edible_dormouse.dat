There are 75 mammal species, among them marmots, Alpine ibex, and chamois. There are numerous deer, roe deer, boar, and hares. The <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse</b> is often found in the Slovenian beech forests. Trapping these animals is a long tradition and {{is a part of the}} Slovenian national identity.|$|E
500|$|Rodents {{exhibit a}} wide range of types of social {{behavior}} ranging from the mammalian caste system of the naked mole-rat, the extensive [...] "town" [...] of the colonial prairie dog, through family groups to the independent, solitary life of the <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse.</b> Adult dormice may have overlapping feeding ranges, but they live in individual nests and feed separately, coming together briefly in the breeding season to mate. The pocket gopher is also a solitary animal outside the breeding season, each individual digging a complex tunnel system and maintaining a territory.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{northern}} extremes of their range, Eurasian eagle-owls {{tend to have}} a less varied diet than those to the south and the need to catch significant numbers of rodents rises as they are often the only regularly accessible prey in sparse sub-Arctic environments. In northern Sweden, more than 60% of the food was made up of microtine rodents, i.e. the [...] Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus), the field vole, the European water vole and the [...] grey red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus). In one study from western Russia, rodents comprised more than 90% of the diet of the eagle-owls, led by the [...] steppe lemming (Lagurus lagurus) at 24% by number, the [...] narrow-headed vole (Microtus gregalis) at 21% and the European water vole at 17.9%. Similarly in high altitude tundra of the East Austrian Alps, nearly 90% of the food was found to be comprised by microtine rodents, the [...] European snow vole (Chionomys nivalis) being the most frequently identified species in the diet. In Spain, the [...] Algerian mouse (Mus spretus), at up to 41.8% of the prey by number, and [...] wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), at up to 10.5% by number, are often regularly taken, especially in regions where rabbit numbers have declined.

In Slovenia, the <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse</b> was the most regularly-recorded prey species, making up 20.2% of the food but it comprised 9.4% of the biomass. The <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse</b> was also the most regular prey species in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Italy, making up 22.5% of the diet. The smaller [...] garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) and considerably smaller [...] hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) are also occasionally predated in Europe, plus at least a half dozen other dormouse species in eastern Europe, Asia Minor and several points to the east.|$|E
50|$|A glirarium is a {{terracotta}} container {{used for}} keeping <b>edible</b> <b>dormice.</b> These animals were considered a delicacy in the Etruscan period {{and later in}} the Roman Empire.|$|R
50|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>dormice</b> {{are active}} during a six-month period {{and go into}} {{hibernation}} from roughly October to May, depending on local climatic conditions. They are mostly active {{in the summer and}} are active on average 202 min in a 24-hour day, mostly at night. They prepare a den in soft soil or hidden in a cave, and rely on fat reserves to survive through the winter. During hibernation, metabolic rate and body temperature fall dramatically, and the animal may cease breathing altogether for periods up to an hour. In years with low food availability <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> can hibernate longer than 11 month.|$|R
50|$|Luštica {{is largely}} undeveloped with populations of wild boar, mongoose, jackal and <b>edible</b> <b>dormice.</b> Nightingales and Scops-owls {{can also be}} heard in abundance. Olive groves are also {{plentiful}} although many are uncultivated and overgrown.|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habits of}} the <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse</b> have been cited as a possible cause of its unusual pattern of telomere lengthening with age. In humans and other animals, telomeres almost always shorten with age.|$|E
50|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>dormice</b> are nocturnal, {{spending}} {{the day in}} nests taken from birds, or located in hollow trees or similar shelter. They are good climbers, and {{spend most of their}} time in the trees, although they are relatively poor jumpers. The dormouse uses sticky secretions of plantar glands when they are climbing on smooth surfaces to prevent them from falling. They generally stay in the forest and avoid open areas to any extent. They are not generally social animals, although small groups of closely related adults have occasionally been reported. Many <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> mothers form communal nesting areas where they care for their young together.|$|R
50|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>dormice</b> also consume {{large numbers}} of beech tree seeds. A single, large, seeding tree within the home range of a {{dormouse}} can produce enough resources to support the energy requirements of reproduction. The location and age of a beech tree helps dictate where a population of dormice live, since older trees produce more seeds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>dormice</b> inhabit {{deciduous}} forests {{dominated by}} oak and beech, from sea {{level to the}} upper limits of such forests at 1500 to 2000 m. They prefer dense forests with rocky cliffs and caves, but {{may be found in}} maquis vegetation, orchards, and urban margins. They have frequently been reported from caves as deep as 400 m, where they can shelter from predators.|$|R
50|$|The <b>edible</b> <b>{{dormouse}}</b> or {{fat dormouse}} (Glis glis) {{is a large}} dormouse and the only living species in the genus Glis, found in most of western Europe. Its name comes from the Romans, who ate them as a delicacy.|$|E
50|$|Beyond Europe, it {{is found}} in {{scattered}} populations throughout Thrace, located on the southeastern tip of the Balkan peninsula. In this region, two subspecies of the <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse</b> are found, G. g. glis and G. g. orientalis. Northern Anatolia has a different subspecies, G. g pindicus.|$|E
50|$|Park {{is home to}} 211 bird species. Symbol of Fruška Gora is eastern {{imperial}} eagle, {{today with}} only 2 or 3 remaining breeding couples.

50|$|To this day, wild <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> are {{consumed}} in Slovenia, {{where they are}} considered a rare delicacy and where dormouse trapping is a tradition. Slovenians use several methods of trapping. The first used were the hollow-tree trapping method and the flat-stone trapping method. By the 17th century, the peasant trappers had invented the first self-triggering traps, usually made {{of different kinds of}} wood.|$|R
50|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>dormice</b> are {{primarily}} herbivorous, feeding mainly on berries, apples, and nuts. However, they are adaptable, and {{have also been}} reported to eat bark, leaves, flowers, invertebrates, and even eggs. Beech mast, which is rich in energy and protein, is {{an excellent source of}} food for young and lactating females. Some dormice are found to have hair and ectoparasite remains in their stomachs, but this is mainly due to accidental ingestion during grooming.|$|R
5000|$|The {{man-made}} Kaunas Reservoir {{altered the}} local landscape and now {{one can see}} newly formed exposures, altered mouths of tributaries to the Neman River (Nemunas) (what local people now call fiords). The shallower edges of the reservoir are becoming swampy and attract almost all known species of water birds in Lithuania. Old pine forests at Rumšiškės and Dabinta are rich in plant animal diversity. Here lives {{one of the biggest}} population of <b>edible</b> <b>dormouses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse</b> {{is capable}} of limited autotomy; if another animal grasps the tail, the skin breaks easily and slides off the {{underlying}} bone, allowing the dormouse to escape. The exposed vertebrae then break off and the wound heals over, forming a fresh brush of hair.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{that are}} easier to see include red fox, the {{mountain}} hare, the least weasel, the European mole, and the western European hedgehog. Dormice and red squirrel s are also quite frequently seen. Other mammals recorded in the park are the snow vole, the <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse,</b> the wildcat and the crested porcupine.|$|E
5000|$|The Legend of the Seven Sleepers {{has given}} origin to sjusovare or syvsover (literally a seven-sleeper), used in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish {{to refer to}} the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus.

50|$|Following a {{visit to}} Hungary in 1902, Rothschild brought six live <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> (Glis glis) back to Tring. Some of them escaped and started {{breeding}} successfully in the wild. They have now become a localised pest over an area of approximately 200 square miles in a triangle between Luton, Aylesbury and Beaconsfield; there {{are estimated to be}} at least 10,000 of them. Even though considered an invasive species, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981.|$|R
50|$|They {{have adapted}} {{well to the}} {{presence}} of man and now frequently hibernate in insulated attics and even dark shelves in cupboards, particularly if soft materials are on the shelf to make a nest. They can be regarded as a pest in this situation due to the fire risk from gnawed electrical cables and fouling from their faeces. In recent years, they have become resistant to many rodenticides. In the wild, most <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> hibernate for three winters, and then die in the fourth while hibernating, when their cheek teeth are worn out to a degree that prevents normal mastication of food.|$|R
40|$|The Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx (Linnaeus, 1758) is an {{opportunistic}} predator {{that usually}} selects the smallest ungulate available. Its diet varies considerably among different regionstherefore {{it is important}} to study lynx diet {{in different parts of the}} species’ range. We studied the diet of lynx from the endangered Dinaric population in Slovenia and Croatia by analyzing lynx scats, prey remains, and stomach contents. Dinaric lynx mainly killed European roe deer Capreolus capreolus (0. 64 frequency of occurrence, 79 % of all consumed biomass), which were used more frequently during winter and spring. Ungulates were killed more often by adult males than by lynx of other age and sex groups. In contrast to studies from other regions, lynx in the northern Dinaric Mountains also frequently fed on the <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> Glis glis (0. 18 18 frequency of occurrence, 7 % of all consumed biomass). This large rodent appears to be an important alternative prey, especially for females and young lynx, and was the reason for the highest use of rodents reported so far for the Eurasian lynx. <b>Edible</b> <b>dormice</b> in Dinaric forests have highly variable numbers of active animals. Seasonal and possibly annual variation in dormouse availability obviously affects lynx diet. This is a rare example where variability in the availability of the alternative prey and not the preferred prey leads to the dietary shift. This study confirms the opportunistic nature of Eurasian lynx and the regional variability of its 25 diet...|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} season is from late June to mid August, but {{both male and}} female dormice do not produce every year. Variation in food resources strongly influences reproduction because reproduction is tightly linked to the availability of energy-rich seeds. Therefore, <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> breed during the phase of high food availability. Females are able to produce additional young if amino acid-rich foods like inflorescences, unripe seeds, and (or) larval insects, which also increase their numbers by eating the same enriched plant food, are available. An abundance of energy-rich seeds allows newborn dormice to increase their body fat to prepare for their first hibernation. Females reach sexual maturity at 351-380 days old and males significantly lower their body mass during mating season.|$|R
40|$|The {{causes of}} bark {{stripping}} and browsing by squirrels, rabbits, hares, voles and <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> in forests and woodlands are reviewed. Population density and tree characteristics {{are the most}} significant causes of damage, but habitat characteristics, particularly where they contribute to higher densities, are also important. There are still aspects of some forms of damage which are not well understood. Agonistic behaviour {{is thought to be}} as or more important than feeding in contributing to grey squirrel damage, but the difficulties of making observations in the wild have made it impossible to verify the role of behaviour. Improvements in understanding of all forms of damage could come from more investigations on tree quality (including the role of phenols, terpenes and other nutritional components) and the relationships between habitat variables and damage. Methods of predicting the risk of damage are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, {{much of this}} {{ecoregion}} {{has been}} given over to agriculture - with the growing of wheat, barley and rapeseed particularly common - {{as well as to}} the raising of livestock, especially cattle and sheep. In places it is very heavily populated, with towns, suburbs and villages found nearly everywhere - although the plateau of Salisbury Plain remains largely wild. The most significant centre of population is London, at the head of the Thames estuary, one of the largest cities in the world. Due to this high population density, and to a certain amount of depredation caused by the non-native grey squirrel, <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> (in the Chilterns) and deer, this forest ecoregion is considered at high risk, with a critical/endangered conservation status accorded it by the WWF. Air pollution may also be leading to a reduction in beech numbers, through increased susceptibility to disease.|$|R

50|$|Although the <b>edible</b> <b>dormouse</b> is {{the only}} living member of its genus, a number of fossil species are also known. The genus Glis first {{originated}} in the middle Oligocene, although it did not become common until the Pliocene.

50|$|Edible dormice {{that have}} been {{isolated}} on oceanic islands are {{a prime example of}} insular gigantism, in which small animals in isolated locations become larger over the course of many generations.

For example, those in Italy have two to seven, while those in Lithuania have three to six.|$|E
40|$|CLOCK {{protein is}} a member of the bHLH-PAS family of {{transcription}} factors, it is expressed in several tissues including the liver and is essential for normal circadian rhythms. In this study we investigate the distribution of CLOCK protein in hepatocytes of euthermic and hibernating <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> Glis glis as well as in hepatocytes taken from the hibernating animals submitted in vitro to experimental conditions mimicking the arousal process. Our results demonstrate that CLOCK protein is expressed in all animals and is mostly located in the nucleus, in particular, on perichromatin fibrils and nucleoli. During deep hibernation CLOCK protein becomes more abundant but an intracellular redistribution occurs: the protein significantly decreases in all cellular compartments, but it accumulates in the amorphous bodies. These nuclear bodies, typical of the hibernating state, probably represent storage sites for CLOCK protein to be quickly used upon arousal. Accordingly, in hepatocytes submitted to in vitro conditions mimicking arousal CLOCK protein levels rapidly reach the euthermic values, while amorphous bodies disappear...|$|R
40|$|Litter {{sex ratio}} {{is a key}} {{component}} of parental fitness due to its impact on lifetime reproductive success. Multiple causes may lay at the origin of sex ratio variation among species and populations, such as maternal condition, local resource competition, presence of helpers, habitat quality or inbreeding levels. Whereas variation in sex allocation between species is relatively well understood, it is still unclear how and why litter sex allocation differs within species. Here, we present an analysis of litter sex ratio variation in two populations of <b>edible</b> <b>dormice</b> (Glis glis) over nine years of study. Populations are situated in the Montnegre and Montseny massifs in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). The Montnegre population is nowadays an isolated population located at the southernmost range edge of the species in the Iberian Peninsula. Litter sex ratio was male-biased in Montnegre but balanced in Montseny, whereas both populations showed a balanced adult sex ratio. We suggest that this differential sex allocation investment in Montnegre, may be a strategy to overcome isolation effects in this massif, as males are the dispersing sex in this and other rodent species...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether particular Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. genospecies associate solely with rodent reservoir hosts, {{we compared the}} genospecies prevalence in questing nymphal Ixodes ticks with that in xenodiagnostic ticks that had fed as larvae on rodents captured in the same site. No genospecies was more prevalent in rodent-fed ticks than in questing ticks. The three main spirochete genospecies, therefore, share common rodent hosts. The several genospecies of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, that infect people in Eurasia produce {{a broad spectrum of}} human disease. Particular genospecies have been associated with characteristic symptoms; chronic skin disease, for example, results from infection by Borrelia afzelii (1). Rodents (e. g., various Apodemus mice [2], Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus [3, 4], <b>edible</b> <b>dormice,</b> Glis glis [5]) serve unambiguously as reservoir hosts for Lyme disease spirochetes. Although each major European genospecies has been associated with birds (6), B. afzelii is thought to perpetuate in rodents and B. garinii is thought to perpetuate in avian reservoir hosts (7, 8). The European vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes ricinus, maintains an unusual diversity of pathogens in an extraordinarily broad array of hosts. The vertebrates that are infested most frequently by arthropods generally also serve as reservoir hosts for any pathogens transmitted by these vectors. The transmission cycle would likely be broken if some vector acquired a pathogen from one host but injected it into an illadapted host. If B. afzelii thrived mainly in rodents (7), transmission might not be sustained if a larval tick acquired these spirochetes from...|$|R
