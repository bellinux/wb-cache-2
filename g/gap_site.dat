40|$|Wh-dependencies {{are known}} to be formed rapidly in {{real-time}} comprehension. The parser posits the location of <b>gap</b> <b>sites</b> in advance of the bottom-up evidence for missing constituents, and must therefore have a means of deciding when and where to project dependencies. Previous studies have observed that the parser avoids building ungrammatical wh-dependencies, for example, by restricting the search for <b>gap</b> <b>sites</b> from island domains. This paper tests the stronger claim that constraints are not merely respected, but that grammatical knowledge actively prompts the con-struction of some representations in advance of the input. Three self-paced reading experiments examined patterns of wh-dependency formation in multiple-dependency constructions: obligatory across-the-board (ATB) extraction from coordinated verb phrases, and from optional parasitic gaps in post-verbal adjunct clauses. The key finding is that comprehenders immediately enforce the requirement for extraction from coordinates, and hence actively search for multiple <b>gap</b> <b>sites</b> within a coordinate VP; but they do not search for post-verbal parasitic gaps. This difference cannot be attributed to relative differences in acceptability, as comprehenders rated both o...|$|R

50|$|Over the years, many {{archaeologists have}} been {{involved}} with the work at the Hell <b>Gap</b> <b>site.</b> The first two discoverers were avocationalists James Duguid and Malcolm McKnight, but professional archaeologists soon took over excavations after they showed several projectile points to George Agogino, professor of Archaeology at the University of Wyoming. Henry Irwin, Cynthia Irwin-Williams, George Agogino, John Brew, C. Vance Haynes, Jr., and H.M. Wormington worked on the project from 1962 to 1966. Their papers give a meticulous insight into the projects underpinnings including an inventory of complexes discovered, photographs, maps, thorough descriptions of stratigraphy and artifacts, and detailed sketches of lanceolate points found there.|$|E
50|$|Much of Hell Gap's modern {{excavation}} {{is under}} {{the purview of the}} George C.

Since 2009, a team has been reinvestigating the Hell <b>Gap</b> <b>site</b> in hopes that it will shed light on new aspects of Paleoindian culture and prehistory. The focus of recent excavations since 2009 have been to uncover new campsites and projectile points of the Frederick, Hell Gap, and Cody assemblages and to reevaluate past descriptions to update information. George Frison was given a grant from the National Geographic Society in 1995 to collect and produce data accumulated from past excavations at Hell Gap. Much remains to be learned from Hell Gap on Paleoindian lifeways and complexes, and there are several institutes exploring and quantifying the data found there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effect of}} {{alignment}} gaps on phylogenetic accuracy {{has been the}} subject of numerous studies. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the total number of <b>gapped</b> <b>sites</b> and phylogenetic accuracy, when the gaps were introduced (by means of computer simulation) to reflect indel (insertion/deletion) events during the evolution of DNA sequences. The resulting (true) alignments were subjected to commonly used gap treatment and phylogenetic inference methods. Results (1) In general, there was a strong – almost deterministic – relationship between the amount of gap in the data and the level of phylogenetic accuracy when the alignments were very "gappy", (2) gaps resulting from deletions (as opposed to insertions) contributed more to the inaccuracy of phylogenetic inference, (3) the probabilistic methods (Bayesian, PhyML & "ML ε, " a method implemented in DNAML in PHYLIP) performed better at most levels of gap percentage when compared to parsimony (MP) and distance (NJ) methods, with Bayesian analysis being clearly the best, (4) methods that treat <b>gapped</b> <b>sites</b> as missing data yielded less accurate trees when compared to those that attribute phylogenetic signal to the <b>gapped</b> <b>sites</b> (by coding them as binary character data – presence/absence, or as in the ML ε method), and (5) in general, the accuracy of phylogenetic inference depended upon the amount of available data when the gaps resulted from mainly deletion events, and the amount of missing data when insertion events were equally likely to have caused the alignment gaps. Conclusion When gaps in an alignment are a consequence of indel events in the evolution of the sequences, the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis is likely to improve if: (1) alignment gaps are categorized as arising from insertion events or deletion events and then treated separately in the analysis, (2) the evolutionary signal provided by indels is harnessed in the phylogenetic analysis, and (3) methods that utilize the phylogenetic signal in indels are developed for distance methods too. When the true homology is known and the amount of gaps is 20 percent of the alignment length or less, the methods used in this study are likely to yield trees with 90 – 100 percent accuracy. </p...|$|R

50|$|SR-130 {{begins at}} the south Cedar City {{interchange}} with Interstate 15 (I-15). Following Main Street through the city, it starts to the northeast before turning north {{through the center of}} the city. As the highway reaches the north end of the city, it meets I-15 in another interchange, continuing north through Enoch as the Minersville Highway. After leaving Enoch, (at the northern end of Cedar Valley), the highway continues north through sparsely-populated areas, intersecting Gap Road, an extension of the old Lund Highway about 12 mi north of Enoch. Gap Road connects to Parowan, and is named for the pass it traverses, Parowan <b>Gap,</b> <b>site</b> of ancient petroglyphs, evidence that it was on a major thoroughfare of early Native Americans. SR-130 continues in a generally north-northwest direction through the Black Mountains, entering Beaver County and arriving in Minersville, ending at its intersection with SR-21.|$|E

The Mockingbird <b>Gap</b> <b>site</b> discovered in the 1950s southeast of Socorro, New Mexico is described as “one of the largest and perhaps least known Clovis sites in the southwestern United States.” Initial excavations revealed hundreds of Clovis artifacts such as projectile point bases, fluted point preforms and gravers from an area 800 meters by 80-150 meters. A 2004 visit led the Holliday and collaborator B.B. Huckell (University of New Mexico) to believe there was more to be learned from the site about Clovis occupation and in 2005 excavationsbegan which continued throughout the 2006 and 2007 field seasons. Their initial beliefs were validated when results of these excavations show significant Clovis age deposits at the site.|$|E
