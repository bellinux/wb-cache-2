60|$|In {{half an hour}} {{neither side}} would yield one point; but then at last the Egyptian began to show that, noble as he looked, he was made of stuff compressible. He {{gradually}} gave up, para by para, till he allowed <b>donkeys,</b> <b>men,</b> and women to clamber over {{the sides of his}} boat at the exact price named by him of the black coat. Never did the church have a more perfect success.|$|R

50|$|In the Barbados Tuk Band, {{the regular}} costumed figures are Shaggy Bear (who is {{sometimes}} called the Bank Holiday Bear), the <b>Donkey</b> <b>Man,</b> Mother Sally, a masked man dressed up like a woman with an exaggerated behind, and the Stiltman.|$|E
50|$|The Donkey Cart was an {{important}} means of transportation in the past, and the <b>Donkey</b> <b>Man</b> {{is representative of the}} island transportation that was used by the locals. Mother Sally represents the female fertility, and with an exaggerated back end. Mother Sally is always good for a laugh, and a favorite among Bajans and visitors alike.|$|E
5000|$|This {{presents}} [...] "All men are donkeys" [...] as {{the first}} logical operand and [...] "men and donkeys are donkeys" [...] as the second one. Both of the logical operands connected by [...] "or" [...] are false, and therefore the whole sentence is also false. The first logical operand is false because all <b>men</b> are not <b>donkeys.</b> The second logical operand [...] "men and donkeys are donkeys" [...] is a logical conjunction on its own and is also false. This is because although <b>donkeys</b> are <b>donkeys</b> <b>men</b> are not <b>donkeys.</b> Because it is connected by [...] "and" [...] this logical conjunction with one true logical operand and one false indicates that the sentence is false.|$|R
5000|$|... "All <b>men</b> are <b>donkeys</b> or <b>men</b> and <b>donkeys</b> are donkeys" [...] is {{an example}} of the second class of sophismata; an {{ambiguous}} sentence that is open to more than one interpretation and could be either true or false depending on what interpretation is chosen.|$|R
5000|$|In {{accordance}} with step 1, {{in order to}} prove that the sophisma [...] "All <b>men</b> are <b>donkeys</b> or <b>men</b> and <b>donkeys</b> are donkeys" [...] is false then it should be looked at as a logical disjunctions sentence. In this case the sophisma could be interpreted as [...] ("All men are donkeys") or ("men and donkeys are donkeys") ...|$|R

'Nor never vill; and there's {{another thing}} that no man never see, and that's a dead <b>donkey.</b> No <b>man</b> never see a dead donkey 'cept the gen'l'm'n in the black silk smalls as know'd the young 'ooman as kep' a goat; and that wos a French donkey, so wery likely he warn't wun o' the reg'lar breed.' ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{followed}} another {{noise and}} uproar, from beggars, musicians, mule and <b>donkey</b> <b>men,</b> guides, and boys, who gathered about the carriage {{in a crowd}} {{as soon as it}} stopped, all clamoring for money or employment. Mr. George paid no attention to them, but assisting Mrs. Gray and Rosie to descend, he led the way into the house. There was a boy at the door to receive him. The boy led the way up a narrow flight of stone stairs to a sort of hall, surrounded on every side by massive walls of stone. There were two or three desolate-looking rooms opening from this hall. The room doors were open. The floors were all of stone. There were tables set in these rooms, and different parties were seated at them, partaking of refreshments that they had brought up with them in their carriages--the bags and baskets in which they had brought them up lying at their feet.|$|R

50|$|All <b>men</b> are <b>donkeys</b> or <b>men</b> and <b>donkeys</b> are donkeys (Omnes homines sunt asini vel homines et asini sunt asini) is a sophisma {{that was}} first {{proposed}} and solved by the 14th century philosopher Albert of Saxony.

60|$|Such is, {{and such}} was, the now world-forgotten Shaston or Palladour. Its {{situation}} rendered water the great want of the town; and within living memory, horses, <b>donkeys</b> and <b>men</b> {{may have been}} seen toiling up the winding ways {{to the top of}} the height, laden with tubs and barrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain, and hawkers retailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful.|$|R
6000|$|Now I do not {{propose to}} narrate at full length all the {{incidents}} of our long travel up to Sitanda's Kraal, near {{the junction of}} the Lukanga and Kalukwe Rivers. It was a journey {{of more than a}} thousand miles from Durban, the last three hundred or so of which we had to make on foot, owing to the frequent presence of the dreadful [...] "tsetse" [...] fly, whose bite is fatal to all animals except <b>donkeys</b> and <b>men.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{accordance}} with step 1, {{in order to}} prove that the sophisma [...] "All <b>men</b> are <b>donkeys</b> or <b>men</b> and <b>donkeys</b> are donkeys" [...] is true then it should be viewed as a logical conjunction's sentence that is a two-place logical operator [...] "and". It results [...] "true" [...] if both of its operands are true, otherwise it represents [...] "false".

60|$|At length {{they stood}} in the motley Eastern crowd upon the quay, {{wondering}} where they could find an inn that was quiet and of cheap charges, since they {{did not wish to}} be considered persons of wealth or importance. As they lingered here, somewhat bewildered, a tall, veiled woman whom they had noted watching them, drew near, accompanied by a porter, who led a <b>donkey.</b> This <b>man,</b> without more ado, seized their baggage, and helped by other porters began to fasten it upon the back of the donkey with great rapidity, and when they would have forbidden him, pointed to the veiled woman.|$|R

5000|$|An {{extension}} of this belief {{is the idea}} that the Anzacs set an example for future generations of Australians to follow, laying the bedrock of 'Australian values'. In 2007 the Australian Defence Minister Brendan Nelson articulated this view, stating that the Anzacs [...] "forged values that are ours and make us who we are, reminding us that there are some truths by which we live." [...] Nelson had earlier argued that the story of Simpson and his <b>donkey</b> rescuing wounded <b>men</b> at Gallipoli [...] "represents everything that's at the heart {{of what it means to}} be an Australian".|$|R

60|$|At last we came out, and {{the heavy}} iron door was closed behind us. What a relief {{it was to be}} in the street again, to see the sun and the trees, and to breathe the free air! A cart went by with a great racket, drawn by three mules, and the cries of the driver as he cracked his whip were almost musical; a train of <b>donkeys</b> passed; a <b>man</b> trotted by on a brown shaggy cob, his huge panniers filled with glowing vegetables, green and red, and in a corner was a great bunch of roses. I took long breaths of the free air, I shook myself to get rid of those prison odours.|$|R
