40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the concept and legal {{implications}} of excessive self-defense (private defense) and necessity (distress). The two terms designate two circumstances precluding wrongfulness that the Czech Criminal Code recognizes. They have been intended to allow every person to defend himself and thus protect his rights against an attack {{or other forms of}} danger in case the state authority cannot provide for such protection. If the self- protection is executed within some acceptable boundaries that are provided by the Criminal Code, such behavior can be considered beneficial for the society and therefore nobody should be in any way punished for it. Criminal liability is only established when the given boundaries are crossed and even then there is a certain favored approach towards the perpetrator required. The intention of this thesis is to address the connotations and importance of the given juridical institutes and to evaluate whether they function effectively or not, with <b>eventual</b> <b>suggestions</b> as to how to improve the result. After a short introduction {{the first part of the}} thesis {{deals with the}} concept of wrongfulness as one of the elements of a crime, and circumstances precluding the wrongfulness in general. In the end of the chapter there is a brief reflection on the advisable law [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The origins, processes, and {{outcomes}} of 141 academic research projects that {{were conducted in}} organizations and published in 4 top-tier industrial/organizational psychology and management journals over a 3 -year period are examined. Three outcomes were assessed: 1. implementation of research findings, 2. academic-organizational relationship continuation, and 3. research impact. Results suggest a number of relationships between the way projects began, the relative contributions of organizations and authors to the research process, and <b>eventual</b> outcomes. <b>Suggestions</b> for future research are offered...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of AMCLI {{is to provide}} efficient, high quality continuing education. The CoTeLab has prepared a questionnaire including the main groups of interest of Laboratory Technologists, either of a specific or general nature, {{as well as other}} <b>eventual</b> arguments, <b>suggestions</b> and observations {{in order to understand the}} real necessity of training. The questionnaire was answered by 464 technicians of which 71 % females and 29 % males, most of interviewed were between 41 and 45 years of age with variable experience. Scolarity was not homogeneous due to Italian evolution in the past years. The necessity to up-date knowledge in the laboratory in which day-to-day work is performed and an elevated interest in molecular biology was evidenced. Quality control, biological hazard and hospital infections were the arguments most requested. The procedure of accreditation and/or certification already obtained in many laboratories, and the problems involved in new technologies are certainly factors that bring attention to Quality Control. The response in respect of biological hazards is due to the implementation of DL 626 / 94 and its successive modifications. Hospital infections have always been an important subject of microbiology and have gained much attention thanks to the new technologies offered (molecular epidemiology) Theoretical and practical training is mainly requested and evidences the technician’s need to understand routine procedures and not only to perform them. New technologies are the general arguments most requested and preferred. Surprisingly long distance education is not requested, probably since it has not yet been activated and the modality is not clear. In conclusion this study has hallowed us to have a reliable perspective of the educational needs of technologists and will permit us to gradually construct a high quality, efficient continuing education program that will certainly give positive results in the total quality of results referred to physicians...|$|R
40|$|Background: Western Countries {{are looking}} for more {{effective}} models of healthcare delivery, by structuring them around the patients’ needs, {{in order to minimize}} the waste of resources and to increase the patients’ quality of life. Nevertheless, looking at the practice, most of the services labeled as “patient-centred” have been designed and implemented without the patients’ direct involvement. Aim/s: The aim of the study is to answer to the following research questions: What is the patients’ use and opinion about services designed without their involvement? Are the patients available and ready to contribute proactively to the design of healthcare services? Which are the drivers that better explain the patients’ proactive participation? Method: We selected two services offered by a General Practitioners’ cooperative to its patients: the definition of a personal care plan and the activation of a call center. We set, validated and distributed a survey to 515 patients. The questions were about: the interviewees’ personal details and background; the use, opinion and satisfaction about the new services; the perceived usefulness with respect to their expectations; the interest and availability {{to be involved in the}} service re-organization or improvement. We also collected the <b>eventual</b> patients’ <b>suggestions.</b> Results: Although the two services had been implemented to better respond to the predicted patients’ needs, a substantial misalignment with the patients’ necessities emerges from the data. Around half of the interviewees declared interest toward contributing proactively to the redesign of the service. The more they are satisfied with the service, the more they are keen to participate. The availability is not linked with the patients’ age or educational level. Conclusion: Our study suggests that designing services without the patients’ involvement creates inefficiencies instead of solving them. It shows also that patients are keen to collaborate proactively to the service design or enhancement, regardless of their age and educational qualification. Possible applications or implications: This study provides an interesting contribution about how to maximize the value created in times of resources constraints, since involving patients and designing the services around them is not expensive, and prevents from the inefficiencies related to the implementation of useless services...|$|R
