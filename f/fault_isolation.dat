[...] The contract includes a full-fidelity Maintenance Training Device Suite (MTDS) and a Helicopter Emulation Maintenance Trainer (HEMT) for the Marine Corps. [...] The full-fidelity MTDS provides a true-to-life environment for training and evaluating the maintainers of multiple subsystems on the CH-53K platform. It supports maintenance training as well as remove-and-replace training for avionics systems, electrical systems, hydraulic systems, and other mechanical subsystems. [...] The HEMT uses a 3D virtual environment to support maintenance training scenarios. It will provide Marine CH-53K Enlisted Aircrew and maintainers with an accurate environment to train functional tests, <b>fault</b> <b>isolation,</b> troubleshooting, and remove and installation for 27 subsystems.|$|E
2500|$|For larger film {{capacitors}} {{with very}} high standards for stability and long lifetime, such as snubber capacitors, the metallization {{can be made}} with a special <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> pattern. In the picture on the right hand side, such a metallization formed into a “T” pattern is shown. [...] Each of these “T” patterns produces a deliberately narrowed cross-section in the conductive metallization. These restrictions work like microscopic fuses so that if a point-defect short-circuit between the electrodes occurs, the high current of the short only burns out the fuses around the fault. The affected sections are thus disconnected and isolated in a controlled manner, without any explosions surrounding a larger short-circuit arc. Therefore, the area affected is limited and the fault is gently controlled, significantly reducing internal damage to the capacitor, which can thus remain in service with only an infinitesimal reduction in capacitance.|$|E

40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} {{problems for}} large-scale nonlinear systems have attracted significant attentions from researchers in recent years. Most <b>fault</b> detection and <b>isolation</b> (FDI) {{methods have been}} proposed based on a centralized architecture. However, due {{to the complexity of}} the system, most of these centralized fault detection and diagnosis schemes are not able to delivery effective <b>fault</b> detection and <b>isolation</b> performance for a large-scale nonlinear system, which contains subsystems interacting with neighboring subsystems. In this thesis, a distributed <b>fault</b> detection and <b>isolation</b> method is developed for the automated highway systems (AHS). For each subsystem of AHS, a distributed <b>fault</b> detection and <b>isolation</b> component is designed to detect and isolate a sensor fault in the system. Each component uses the local measurements and communicated information from other neighboring <b>fault</b> detection and <b>isolation</b> components. In each local subsystem of AHS, adaptive thresholds for <b>fault</b> detection and <b>isolation</b> are derived based on the distributed fault diagnosis decision scheme. Simulation results for two case studies show the effectiveness of the distributed FDI method...|$|R
