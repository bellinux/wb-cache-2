Italian arachnologist Paolo Marcello Brignoli (1942-1986) conducted research {{works on the}} cave's biospeleology (1968, 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1978), Austrian zoologist Friederike Spitzenberger (1939- [...] ) researched bat suborders in 1973, Turkish geographist Korkut Ata Sungur (1935- [...] ) its geology in 1974 and French geologist Jacques Choppy (1926-2004) the <b>karstology</b> of the cave in 1978.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to the {{research}} work of the Serbian geographer Jovan Cvijić (1865-1927), the protégé of Albrecht Penck (the Nestor of the Vienna School of Physical Geography), the word uvala - like the words ‘karst’, ‘dolina’ or ‘polje’, popular terms of the Dinarides - became an established international standard. As the father of Karst Morphology and Hydrogeology, Cvijić envisioned the phenomena of <b>karstology</b> in his publications, first in regions of Europe and then all over the world.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, {{he began}} working at the Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography, Georgian Academy of Sciences. At first he headed the {{department}} of Physical Geography and from then onwards the Departments of Geomorphology and Paleogeography until his death.

Almost all the branches of Geographical science were elucidated in his works: geomorphology, physical geography, paleogeography, <b>karstology</b> and speleology, history of geographical discoveries et al.

40|$|Jurij Kunaver: Contribution of Ivan Gams to the {{development}} of slovene karst terminology The stage of the scientific terminology is by all means one of the indicators of {{the development}} of the scientific branch, to which it belongs. Therefore the publishing of the Slovene karst terminology in 1973 was an important event for further development of Slovene <b>karstology.</b> Still more, the efforts for a comparative national karst terminologies of former common state Yugoslavia were successfully achieved in publishing the Serbian and Croatian karst terminology also, a year later. In fact, the former Association of the geographical societies of Yugoslavia decided to give full support to its subcommission in preparing the project Karst terminology of the Yugoslave nations and to a joint Yugoslave symposium on Karst terminology, held in Ljubljana from 22 - 23 th October 1971, both guided and organised by prof. Ivan Gams, who was also the original initiator of this idea. All this efforts were newertheless combined and connected with the international work of that time to find most appropriate terms and definitions for the karst phenomena and to make them comparable in terms of national terminologies. Ivan Gams was therefore not only a most important promoter of the Slovene karst terminology and one of the leading persons of the scientific <b>karstology</b> in the time concerned but was due to his global ideas also one of the central persons in the international <b>karstology...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to address, under a new approach, the contributions of Ibn-Battuta {{to the development of}} certain areas of geography, especially the anthropogenic use of karst as well as the cultural use of caves. Noteworthy to mention is that, most likely, the geographers from medieval Islam were a kind of missing “bridge” in the evolution of geographical thought among the ancient Greeks and the precursors of the great European classical schools in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Thus, this article presents an alternative approach to the work of Ibn-Battuta not only for the study of travel literature but also to the study of <b>karstology...</b>|$|E

The content of information brochure was decided to be as follows: main mailing address, short history, main field of the interest (art. 1 of the Statut), UIS structure, main goals and objectives for near future, relation between normal caver, national organisation and UIS, sportive /scientific problem, all UIS supported publications (BBS, Int.

40|$|Federal Standards of the Russian {{include the}} {{requirement}} of mandatory assessment of the risks induced by natural processes {{in order to make}} sure their values do not exceed acceptable limits. To meet the requirement a number of karst risk assessment methods have been developed for the regions of the country where the most significant hazard is presented by karst sinkholes. For this particular application karst risk is understood as specific probability of sinkhole development on a unit area per a unit time span with account of probable economic, social and environmental components of damage. The probability of sinkhole development is evaluated by specialists in engineering <b>karstology</b> and designers. They make use of the acceptable data on the environmental conditions and apply stochastic laws of sinkhole development in time and space, alongside with focusing on all other relevant specificity of the building or facility to be built. Acceptable limits of karst risks should be specified by a multidisciplinary team including designers, lawyers, economists, insurers, environmentalists, engineering karstologists and other specialists {{on the basis of their}} expert knowledge. It has been demonstrated that a ratio between predicted and acceptable karst risk values can serve a practically meaningful karst risk level indicator for the purposes of building on karst. This ratio can be used with a rather high degree of objectiveness to develop a programme of antikarst activities during both facilities construction and operation...|$|E

According {{to the number of}} participants, the event was the greatest Congress since the beginning of that tradition in 1951, Paris, France. We spent 4 years of intensive caving and/or research, looking forward and thinking on the new Millenium and on the next meeting in 2001 in Brazil, {{for the first time on}} the Southern Hemisphere in South America. Our time was filled with lot of discoveries; we found karst and caves even in the centre of deserts, where the occurrence of caves was accepted only by crazy persons. Now we know lot on fantastic caves e. g., in Saudi Arabia and other regions of Arabian Penninsula. We improved our knowledge on tropical karsts, subterranean flooded world, on speleogensis, hydrothermal karst and on other aspects of caving and <b>karstology,</b> sometimes very special and specific. We push our knowledge on forms similar to karst also in other rocks, in salt, gypsum, sandstones, volcanic rocks, magmatites and metamorphics and even in ice. We contributed important data for deciphering and predicting global changes and evolution of past, modern and future climates and climatic trends. Speleothems represented one of the first objects for such analyses. Commissions and Working Groups have been pushing the limits of our knowledge up, we have to thank all of them.

40|$|Distinction is {{made between}} the {{experiment}} which “demonstrates” having an argumentative value - and the experiment which “questions” nature by isolating one factor and by determining the mode of its action. The concept of experiment in geology and in geodynamics and the distinctions between geodynamics and geophysics are discussed. Karstic geodynamics considers the action of fluids - mainly liquids - on a soluble rock. It is a science bordering the different branches of geochemistry, hydrology, the mechanics of rocks, and geophysics. Researches in karstic geodynamics are based upon measurements obtained through field surveys, or upon the utilization of a subterranean laboratory. However, in the laboratory this hardly surpasses the stage of experimental demonstration. A series of simple experiments are enumerated to exemplify the above statement, like the one where the attack of a diluted acid on a soluble rock is utilized, in order to enable us to classify the major problems encountered in karstic corrosion. The last chapter discusses the bicarbonate equilibriums of Ca-CO 2. Experiment furnishes the empiric criterion on which scientific theory is founded. Each discipline has its own methodology dependent on the object under study having experimental criteria of different nature. This is particularly true in case of such distant phenomena which {{no longer have a}} common ground with human dimensions like space for astronomy or time for geology. In such cases the possibilities of “instrumental” experimentations are very limited. After a brief recollection of the principles of experimental procedure and the history of the experiments attempted by geodynamicians (tectonics, geomorphology, etc.) we will analyze several methods of investigation and by relying exactly on the example of karstic corrosion we shall determine those which have a value for the science of <b>karstology...</b>|$|E
