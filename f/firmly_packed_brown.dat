5000|$|The lens fibers {{form the}} bulk of the lens. They are long, thin, {{transparent}} cells, <b>firmly</b> <b>packed,</b> with diameters typically 4-7 micrometres and lengths of up to 12 mm long. The lens fibers stretch lengthwise from the posterior to the anterior poles and, when cut horizontally, are arranged in concentric layers rather like the layers of an onion. If cut along the equator, it appears as a honeycomb. The middle of each fiber lies on the equator. These tightly packed layers of lens fibers are referred to as laminae. The lens fibers are linked together via gap junctions and interdigitations of the cells that resemble [...] "ball and socket" [...] forms.|$|R

"Sire: I address your Majesty {{from a point}} 430 coprets {{vertically}} {{above the}} site of the famous ancient city of Buffalo, once the capital of a powerful nation called the Smugwumps. I can approach no nearer because of the hardness of the snow, which is very <b>firmly</b> <b>packed.</b> For hundreds of prastams in every direction, and for thousands to the north and west, the land is covered with this substance, which, as your Majesty is doubtless aware, is extremely cold to the touch, but by application of sufficient heat can be turned into water. It falls from the heavens, and is believed by the learned among your Majesty's subjects to have a sidereal origin.|$|R
50|$|A shared-use path or mixed-use path {{is a form}} of {{infrastructure}} that supports multiple recreation and transportation opportunities, such as walking, bicycling, inline skating and people in wheelchairs. Motorcycles and mopeds are normally prohibited. A shared-use path typically has a surface that is asphalt, concrete or <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> crushed aggregate. In the U.S., the 1999 AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities defines a shared-use path as being physically separated from motor vehicular traffic with an open space or barrier. Shared-use paths differ from exclusive bikeways in that shared-use paths are designed to include pedestrians even if the primary anticipated users are cyclists. Some shared paths have been built as rail trails.|$|R
50|$|The {{projectiles}} and wads {{were then}} pushed {{down into the}} breech with a ramrod until they were firmly seated on the propellant charge. Priming powder was usually carried in a separate priming flask and poured into the priming pan and the lock was pushed down to hold the priming powder in place. After the gunpowder and projectile or shot charge {{were placed in the}} barrel a ramrod was used to <b>firmly</b> <b>pack</b> everything down {{at the base of the}} barrel. Then either a priming charge was placed in the priming pan, or a percussion cap was placed on the nipple, the firing mechanism initiated; in a flintlock the hammer was then cocked to make the firearm ready to fire.|$|R

5000|$|Ponticola gorlap, or the Caspian bighead goby, is {{a species}} of goby, a benthic fish native to the Caspian Sea basin. It is {{widespread}} in lower parts of many rivers in Iran, and also found in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. In Russia, it occurred in the lowest part of the Volga River up to Astrakhan until 1977, but has thereafter spread upstream. In 2000 it was recorded as being established in the Ivankovo and Rybinsk Reservoirs in the Moscow region, and already invaded the Don drainage {{by way of the}} Volga-Don Canal in 1972. [...] This species occurs in sheltered environments, such as inshore fresh or brackish waters of estuaries, lagoons, lakes and large rivers, where it prefers habitats with a well vegetated rock or <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> sand substrate. It can reach a length of 20 cm SL, and a common size is 12 cm SL.|$|R
500|$|... 'Boy' Browning landed by gliders with a {{tactical}} headquarters near Nijmegen. His use of 38 aircraft {{to move his}} corps headquarters on the first lift has been criticised. [...] Half of these gliders carried signal equipment but {{for much of the}} operation he had no contact with either the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem or Major General Maxwell D. Taylor's U.S. 101st Airborne Division at Eindhoven. His headquarters had not been envisaged as a frontline unit, and the signals section that had been hastily assembled just weeks before lacked training and experience. In his <b>pack,</b> <b>Browning</b> carried three teddy bears and a framed print of Albrecht Dürer's The Praying Hands.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the spermatozoon of Mugil curema Valenciennes, 1836 was studied using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The spermatic head is rounded and formed by the nucleus containing granular chromatin, <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> resulting in a mass extremely electron dense. The acrossome is absent. The midpiece {{is characterized by the}} presence of two centrioles, a plasmatic canal, very few vesicles, and several mitochondria (9 - 10) with aproximately 0. 50 µm in diameter. The head and the midpiece are aproximately 1. 56 µm in diameter. The flagellum conforms to the 9 + 0 flagellar pattern near the transition region in its midpiece and is 9 + 2 from there on up to the distal region of the axoneme. The electron density in the A tubules 1, 2, 5 and 6 shows the asymetry of this spermatozoa. Its spermatic cell differs ultrastructuraly from those of other Mugilidae species mainly because it has the highest number of mitochondria...|$|R
5000|$|Okara that is <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> {{consists}} of 3.5 to 4.0% protein, 76 to 80% moisture and 20 to 24% of solids. When moisture free, the gritty okara contains 8 to 15% fats, 12 to 14.5% crude fiber and 24% protein, and contains 17% of the protein {{from the source}} soybeans. It also contains potassium, calcium, niacin. Most of the soybean isoflavones are left in okara, as well as vitamin B and the fat-soluble nutritional factors, which include soy lecithin, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, phytosterols, tocopherol, and vitamin D. [...] Okara contains some antinutritional factors: trypsin inhibitors (mostly destroyed by cooking), saponins, and hemagglutinin, which cannot be easily digested. Fermentation (by proper species of bacteria) of okara is not only conducive to digestion and absorption of okara nutrients, but also further improves the nutritional value. It can eliminate the bean’s sense of smell, {{increase the amount of}} edible fiber, free amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, vitamin B12, vitamin B2, and flavoprotein.|$|R

50|$|Western moose do {{not form}} social bonds and only {{come into contact}} to mate or to battle for a mate. Elevated {{testosterone}} levels during mating season mean that bulls may attack anything during mating season, including humans, wolf <b>packs,</b> <b>brown</b> bears, elk, and black bears. They use a subtle mating call to attract females or to announce to other males {{that they are in}} the area. In the event of a fight over mating rights, bull moose risk locking their antlers, which almost always results in them both dying from starvation. Western moose females will have, on average, one or two calves at once. A female may attack if she feels that her calves are threatened, although, at around 10-11 months yearling Western moose are chased off by their mothers to fend for themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{terrestrial}} mammals include wolf <b>packs,</b> <b>brown</b> bear, black bear, and caribou. Mountain {{goats and}} Dall sheep {{are found in}} mountainous areas. Approximately 13,000 Dall sheep inhabit Wrangell-St. Elias, {{one of the highest}} concentrations of the species in North America. Alaskan moose, though unusual, may sometimes be found in areas with willow growth. [...] The smaller mammals include wolverines, beavers, Canadian lynxes, porcupines, martens, river otters, red foxes, coyotes, ground and flying squirrels, hoary marmots, weasels, snowshoe hares, several species of voles and mice, and collared pikas. A few American bison have been established in two herds in the park. Cougars are considered possible but have not been documented. The waters along the coast host whales, porpoises, harbor seals and sea lions. The endangered Steller sea lion may be found in park waters.|$|R

5000|$|Individuals of {{this species}} vary in size from 5-50 cm. Actinostachys pennula ferns range from small sizes living near decomposing leaf and tree matter to larger sizes with ones that live in places that are {{abundant}} in sunlight and are in wide open areas. It is a non-grass herb. The roots are dark and covered with rigid black hairs that are 2-3 mm in length. The rhizome is considered hairy and bristly due to these features. The stems are upright with their hairs in a single line. The stem of the Actinostachys pennula is not a singular structure. The stem is composed of many tiny, narrow stems that are commonly less than 1 mm in diameter. They reproduce rapidly from bases of old leaves. Thus, the stem bears more of a resemblance to a <b>firmly</b> <b>packed,</b> inter-grown bush than a solitary stem. Actinostachys pennula has leaves related to the stem in a cauline design {{which has not been}} observed in any other fern present today. Leaves are like grass and are 1-60 mm in length. The leaves are all fertile, do not have branches, and have long petioles that are [...]5-2 cm in length. The blades of the leaves have rays that are on very short rachis which give the false impression of a whorl-like pattern. The rays can range from 1-12 mm or 4-40 mm in length. All new leaves for the Actinostachys pennula are built from the base of leaves already produced by the plant. The mass of curly petioles gives Actinostachys pennula its nickname as the tropical curly grass plant. There is no main shoot apex as one leaf is produced from the previous one.|$|R
