2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of the 2002 Polo, the GTI model was discontinued and was given no direct replacement. There was however a GT model produced, featuring the same 1.9 TDI [...] engine found in the popular Škoda Fabia vRS and SEAT Ibiza FR TDI as well as a six-speed gearbox. Although this model had a relatively slow 0–100nbsp&km/h (62nbsp&mph) time of over 9 seconds, it did have impressive mid-range clout with torque figures of 310 Nm (228nbsp&lb-ft). This gave the GT very impressive <b>in-gear</b> <b>acceleration,</b> meaning it could make light work of overtaking as well as pull itself out of corners on twisting B roads with ease whilst returning fuel economy of over 50 mpg.|$|E
5000|$|Cosworth and Xtrac {{independently}} analyse the start-line {{performances and}} <b>in-gear</b> <b>acceleration</b> of front and rear-wheel drive cars {{with a view}} to more equalising them through engine management programming.|$|E
5000|$|According to Mike Cooper, this kit {{would create}} [...] "the fastest Mini ever produced" [...] above all {{due to the}} extra torque and <b>in-gear</b> <b>acceleration,</b> which in certain driving {{situations}} will be even faster than the [...] Mini JCW GP.|$|E
5000|$|Also another {{feature of}} it is the Aisin 8 Speed Automatic which will improve fuel {{efficiency}} and not sacrificing <b>in-gear</b> <b>acceleration</b> and also available with 6 Speed Manual. Other goodies include Sunroof, Dual Zone Auto Airconditioning System, Electric Seats, Leather Contoured Seats with Multi-Layer Cushioning, All Around Monitor, All Around Sensors, 7 Seating Capacity, G-Sensors, Multi-Info Display, AVT/Google CarPlay and Android Auto Touchscreen with Navigation, 6" [...] Two-Piston Front Ventilated Disc Brakes and 6” Solid Disc Brakes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, the Aero was introduced, and was {{the most}} {{powerful}} Saab to date upon its introduction. The Aero was powered by a [...] version of Saab's 2.3-litre B234 engine, with more power courtesy of a larger Mitsubishi TD04 turbocharger. Automatic transmission-equipped Aeros were limited to [...] and kept the regular turbocharged models' Garrett AiResearch T25 turbocharger. Aeros were equipped with paint-matched body kit and spoiler, eight-way Recaro-designed heated sports seats, a sport suspension, and 16-inch Super Aero wheels. The Aero's <b>in-gear</b> <b>acceleration</b> was strongly emphasised; the Aero was capable of accelerating from 50 to 75 mph faster than a Porsche Carrera 4 or a Ferrari Testarossa. The Aero was discontinued after 1997.|$|E
