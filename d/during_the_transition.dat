5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition.</b> Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital.

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the evolution of}} spectral and temporal properties of several Galactic black hole transients during outburst decay using the data from well sampled PCA/ observations close to <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to <b>the</b> low/hard state. We find several global patterns of evolution for spectral and temporal parameters before, <b>during,</b> and after <b>the</b> <b>transition.</b> We show that the changes in temporal properties (sudden increase or decrease in the rms amplitude of variability) are much sharper than {{the changes in the}} spectral properties, and {{it is much easier to}} identify a state <b>transition</b> with <b>the</b> temporal properties. The spectral index shows a drop 3 - 5 days before <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> for some of our sources. The ratio of the power-law flux to the total flux in the 3 - 25 keV band increases close to <b>the</b> <b>transition,</b> which may mean that the system must be dominated by the coronal emission for <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to occur.

In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E

He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal seal, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various multi-colour printing and embossing techniques, and he employed several {{members of his family}} in this enterprise.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{possibility}} of generating large scale curvature perturbations induced from <b>the</b> entropic perturbations <b>during</b> <b>the</b> waterfall phase <b>transition</b> of standard hybrid inflation model is studied. We show that whether or not appreciable amounts of large scale curvature perturbations are produced <b>during</b> <b>the</b> waterfall phase <b>transition</b> depend crucially on the competition between the classical and the quantum mechanical back-reactions to terminate inflation. If one considers only the classical evolution of the system we show that the highly blue-tilted entropy perturbations induce highly blue-tilted large scale curvature perturbations <b>during</b> <b>the</b> waterfall phase <b>transition</b> which dominate over the original adiabatic curvature perturbations. However, we show that the quantum back-reactions of the waterfall field inhomogeneities produced <b>during</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>transition</b> dominate completely over the classical back-reactions. The cumulative quantum back-reactions of very small scales tachyonic modes terminate inflation very efficiently and shut off the curvature perturbations evolution <b>during</b> <b>the</b> waterfall phase <b>transition.</b> This indicates that the standard hybrid inflation model is safe under large scale curvature perturbations <b>during</b> <b>the</b> waterfall phase <b>transition.</b> Comment: <b>The</b> discussions of quantum back-reactions are improved and new analysis from Eq (84) to (98) are added, new references adde...|$|R
