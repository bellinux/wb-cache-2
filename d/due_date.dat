5|$|Under the Scotland Act 1998, {{ordinary}} {{general elections}} for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on).

If the Parliament itself resolves {{that it should be}} dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it.

40|$|AbstractIn {{a recent}} paper Hochbaum {{developed}} a polynomial algorithm for solving a scheduling problem of minimizing the total weighted tardiness {{for a large}} number of unit length jobs which can be partitioned into few sets of jobs with identical <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> and penalty weights. The number of unit jobs in a set is called the multiplicity of that set. The problem was formulated in Hochbaum as an integer quadratic nonseparable transportation problem and solved, in polynomial time, independent {{of the size of the}} multiplicities and the <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> but depending on the penalty weights. In this paper we show how to solve the above problem in polynomial time which is independent of the sizes of the weights. The running time of the algorithm depends on the dimension of the problem and only the size of the maximal difference between two consecutive <b>due</b> <b>dates.</b> In the case where the <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> are large, but the size of the maximal difference between two consecutive <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> is polynomially bounded by the dimension of the problem, the algorithm runs in strongly polynomial time...|$|R

30|$|Scheduling is the {{assignment}} of resources over time to perform tasks. In conventional scheduling system, only one resource is considered, which processes the parts. An FMS scheduling differs from conventional job shop scheduling. The complexity of FMS scheduling {{is due to the}} flexibility of an FMS in terms of machine, product, operation and routing (Browne et al. 1984). Scheduling of an FMS is effected by several factors including orders arrivals, <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> and batch size (Liu and MacCarthy 1996). The production management has to set policies whether to handle periodic or continuous orders of the customers. Meeting customers’ <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> play key role in make to order system and the FMSs are mostly suited for MTO system. <b>Due</b> <b>dates</b> are effected by various factors including arrival rate, variability and batch size.

30|$|Scheduling that {{incorporates}} <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> is of permanent interest [46]. The {{problem has been}} investigated since 1965 {{in the work of}} Jackson [47]. In academic research, the incorporation of <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> in scheduling problem acts in a twofold manner: it increases the constraints of the problem and thus it increases computational complexity, and it serves as a milestone against which important indicators are calculated, such as tardiness, earliness, and slack time. In a similar manner, in an industrial context, where the satisfaction of customer needs is the primary concern, the assignment and adherence of <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> determine the efficiency of a factory. Therefore, the assignment of realistic <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> is utterly important. In the literature, few works treat scheduling problems with the due-date assignment decision being of primary focus. Among the most significant contributions, Cheng and Gupta [48] review due-date assignment approaches up to 1990, whereas Gordon et al. [46] review more recent publications (up to 2002). In most works, the due-date assignment problem is treated using benchmarking instances [49], single-resource problems [50, 51] or is focused on assembly shops [52]. Moreover, the calculation of <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> in ETO environments is relatively mistreated. Most studies focus on static problem instances where jobs do not arrive continuously in the system [46], or require significant modelling efforts [53] and simulation experiments [54], which are rarely feasible in actual daily practice for due-date calculation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven {{a single}} machine {{and a set}} of jobs with <b>due</b> <b>dates,</b> the {{classical}} NP-hard problem of scheduling to minimize total tardiness is a well-understood one. Lawler gave a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for it some 20 years ago. If the jobs have positive weights the problem of minimizing total weighted tardiness seems to be considerably more intricate. it. In this paper, we give some of the first approximation algorithms for it. We examine first the weighted problem with a fixed number of <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> and we design a pseudopolynomial algorithm for it. We show how to transform the pseudopolynomial algorithm to an FPTAS for the case where the weights are polynomially bounded. For the case with an arbitrary number of <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> and polynomially bounded processing times, we provide a quasipolynomial algorithm which produces a schedule whose value has an additive error proportional to the weighted sum of the <b>due</b> <b>dates.</b> We also investigate the performance of algorithms for minimizing the related total weighted late work objective...|$|R
