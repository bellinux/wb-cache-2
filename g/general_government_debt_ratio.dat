How much time {{they have to deal}} with these imbalances is a central question, the salience of which can only have been increased by the ongoing fiscal crisis and bailout in Greece and the immediate fiscal adjustments being discussed or already undertaken in several other countries. There is little doubt that much of the current attention to fiscal imbalances is attributable to the rapid increases in <b>debt</b> to GDP <b>ratios</b> arising from the recession, either directly through the automatic tax and spending responses to slow growth, or indirectly through the countercyclical discretionary fiscal measures undertaken.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis started. in 2008 {{with the collapse}} of Iceland's banking system. Subsequently, several European countries faced the implosion of financial institutions, high <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and rapidly rising bond yield spreads in government securities. In this context, Greece {{is an example of a}} country whose <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> is a matter of grave concern since it has received the second bailout but still threatens to default. This is ironic since a developed economy like Greece is considered to aide developing economies. The main aim of this dissertation is to conduct an econometric analysis of the determinants of the Greek {{sovereign debt}} crisis while the secondary aim is an extensive literature review of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Regarding the former aim, the variables selected include the government deficit, current account balance, inflation, gross savings and <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> of Greece. This annual data (from 1976 to 2010) was collected from the World Development Indicators, European Commission data base and the International Monetary Fund. The Vector Error Correction Model framework was used to estimate our model. Also, the Granger causality analysis helped to identify the direction of causation. Furthermore, the Variance Decomposition and the Generalized Impulse Response Function were employed to analyze the shocks of all our variables on each other. Finally, for the latter aim, we critically review the evolution, causes, consequences and cures of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and then formulate some suggestions on how to mitigate the effects of this crisis. The results of the econometric analysis show that there is a significant negative relationship between <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> with <b>government</b> deficit and inflation. However, a significant positive relationship between <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and current account balance was found. There is an insignificant negative relationship between gross savings and <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> The past value of the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and <b>government</b> deficit has the ability to determine the present value of inflation; and in turn, pass value of inflation, can predict the present value of current account balance and gross savings. Variation in most of our variables is highly explained by our variables itself, with the exception of current account balance where variation is explained mostly by <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> The response of <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to itself is positive. Gross <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to <b>government</b> deficit and <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to current account balance is negative. <b>General</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to inflation is positive. A shock of gross <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> has an increasing negative effect on gross savings over the study period. Among the causes of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis is the rapid growth of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> levels, trade imbalances, monetary policy inflexibility, and loss of confidence. Consequences of this crisis involve disrupted bond markets and the banking sector, depreciation of the Euro, reduced economic growth, loss of confidence, reduced remittances and tight fiscal measures. Some measures were taken and many are proposed as a cure for this crisis. This dissertation recommends that policies aimed at decreasing the level of <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> should increase expenditure hence deficit in an income generating investment, increase inflation while decreasing current account balance.

40|$|Empirical studies {{typically}} {{find that}} private consumption {{is much more}} sensitive to changes in current disposable income than is predicted by Hall's (JPE, 1978) permanent income hypothesis. Standard explanations for this "excess sensitivity" of private consumption refer to liquidity constraints and/or myopia.

Using a panel of OECD countries in the 1990 s, we estimate a consumption function with the degree of excess sensitivity depending on the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> and the degree of financial liberalisation. We find that a higher <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> leads to more excess sensitivity. This result supports the idea that a higher debt induces private lenders to tighten credit conditions, which raises the incidence of liquidity constraints.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the various concepts of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> in the euro area with {{particular emphasis on}} its size and composition. In terms of size, the paper focuses on different definitions that are in use, in particular the concept of gross <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> used in the surveillance of the euro area countries, the total liabilities from the government balance sheet approach, and the net debt concept which subtracts government fi nancial assets from the liability side. In addition, it discusses “hidden debt” {{in the form of}} implicit and contingent liabilities. In terms of composition, the paper provides information about euro area <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> broken down by maturity, holder or the currency of issue. All these indicators illustrate a sharp increase in <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> in most euro area countries {{as a result of the}} crisis. This in turn has several policy implications: (i) the growing <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> need to be stabilised and put on a downward path which improves market confidence; (ii) fiscal surveillance needs to put more emphasis on <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> indicators than in the past; (iii) government financial assets could play a role when analysing solvency issues; (iv) implicit and other off-balance-sheet government liabilities need to be carefully monitored and reported; (v) the gross debt concept should remain the key basis for fiscal surveillance in the EU and for the Excessive Deficit Procedure in particular; (vi) beyond the size of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> its composition is also a key factor behind public finance vulnerabilities.
