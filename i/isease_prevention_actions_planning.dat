40|$|This annual {{statistical}} publication presents suicide information {{received from}} the New Zealand Mortality Collection, and admissions to hospital for intentional self-harm sourced from the New Zealand National Minimum Dataset. Introduction Suicide and suicidal behaviours {{continue to be a}} major public health issue in New Zealand. Every year more than 500 New Zealanders take their lives and there are over 2, 500 admissions to hospital for serious self-harm. These are not just numbers; they may be our friends, our neighbours, our work colleagues or our family members. Every suicide or act of intentional self-harm is an indication of profound emotional distress. The impact on family, friends and communities can be devastating, far reaching and long lasting. But suicide is preventable. The purpose of this report is to present numbers, trends and demographic profiles of people who die by suicide or seriously harm themselves. Understanding this data is important for policy makers, clinicians and others who work to prevent suicide and intentional self-harm. It is important to recognise that the motivation for intentional self-harm varies, and therefore hospitalisation data for self-harm is not a measure of suicide attempts. Although this report provides statistical suicide and intentional self-harm hospitalisation data, it does not attempt to explain causes of suicidal behaviour or causes of changes to suicide or intentional self-harm hospitalisation rates. Nor does it discuss measures to reduce suicide or intentional self-harm. Numerous factors influence a person’s decision to take their own life or to self-harm. The number of suicides and self-harm hospitalisations can also vary considerably from year to year. It is therefore difficult to quantify the precise effect that programmes such as suicide prevention-related initiatives and significant events, for instance the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes in the Canterbury region, have on suicide and suicidal behaviour. Suicide prevention in New Zealand is guided by the New Zealand Suicide Prevention Strategy 2006 – 2016 and the New Zealand Suicide <b>Prevention</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> 2013 – 2016.

40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to bloodborne pathogens {{as a result}} of injuries from needles and other sharp objects are an important public health concern. It is estimated that hospital-based healthcare personnel sustain 385, 000 sharps injuries annually in the United States. Numerous risk factors and prevention strategies have been identified and implemented in order to reduce sharps injuries in healthcare settings. One notable prevention milestone was the passage of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act in 2001. In response to this Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29 CFR 1910. 1030. The revised standard clarifies the need for employers to select safer needle devices and to involve frontline employees in identifying and choosing these devices. The updated Standard also requires employers to maintain a log of injuries from contaminated sharps. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a National Sharps Injury Prevention Meeting on September 12, 2005, in Atlanta, Georgia. The purpose of this meeting was to review sharps injury prevention efforts (particularly since the passage of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act in 2001); identify gaps in prevention efforts; and assist CDC in creating a national <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> for eliminating sharps injuries in the United States. Nearly forty representatives from federal and state agencies, healthcare professional associations, healthcare facilities, medical device manufacturers, and other key stakeholder groups participated in the meeting. The meeting was funded by the CDC Foundation through an unrestricted education grant from the Safety Institute, Premier Inc. A series of presentations from representatives of CDC, U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); Massachusetts Department of Public Health; Safety Institute, Premier Inc.; and U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provided detailed information about the epidemiology of sharps injuries, relevant surveillance systems, enforcement and regulatory efforts to prevent sharps injuries, education and training programs, and enhancements of sharps injury prevention program processes. In addition, each presenter was invited to comment on the presence of gaps in knowledge or prevention efforts as they pertained to the subject area of the presenter. These comments were used as a springboard for discussions about recognized knowledge and prevention gaps as well as efforts that are needed to address these gaps in order to eliminate sharps injuries. The principal outcome of the meeting was the formation of four working groups to address surveillance issues, human and organizational factors related to sharps injuries, education and training topics, and device development, implementation, and diffusion issues. Working groups were charged with identifying priority areas and action steps specific to their topic area.

Here we seek to evaluate the air quality improvement and associated health benefits achievable under the <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) area from 2012 to 2017. Measure-by-measure quantification results show that the <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> would promise effective emissions reductions of 34 % of SO 2, 28 % of NOx, 26 % of PM 2. 5 (particulate matter less than 2. 5 μm in diameter), and 10 % of VOCs (volatile organic compounds). These emissions abatements would lower the PM 2. 5 concentration by 17 %, surpassing the 15 % target established in the <b>Action</b> <b>Plan,</b> thereby avoiding more than 2900 deaths and 4300 hospital admissions annually. We expect the implementation of the <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> in the PRD would be productive; the anticipated impacts, however, fall short of the goal of protecting the health of local residents, as there are still more than 33 million people living in places where the annual mean ambient PM 2. 5 concentrations are greater than 35 μg m− 3, the interim target- 3 of the World Health Organization (WHO).

40|$|Background: Trauma to {{the human}} spinal cord {{typically}} strikes out of the blue, leaving those surviving the initial ordeal with permanent or temporary deficits in health and functioning. Because of this, traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCI) impose a significant burden on society. While these facts are well known for certain countries, the International Perspectives on Spinal Cord Injury Report highlights {{the need for the}} remaining countries to establish a foundation upon which injuries could be prevented and functioning problems addressed. In South Africa, the foundation for primary prevention and knowledge of the unmet needs of persons with TSCI are not yet established. Aim: To develop an evidence-based foundation for TSCI in South Africa that addresses prevention both in terms of injury occurrence and problems with functioning. Methods: This thesis utilised a mixed-method approach to answer epidemiologic and functioning questions. A prospective, population-based design was used in Study I and II to determine the incidence, aetiology and injury profiles of newly-injured adults with TSCI in Cape Town, South Africa and Stockholm, Sweden. In the Functioning section of the thesis (Study III), a comparative content validity design was used to define the nature of functioning categories in a generic outcome measure currently used in the South African SCI rehabilitation field, and a standardised measure not yet adopted in the local context, against the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and the brief ICF core sets for SCI in the post-acute context. In Study IV, qualitative description was used to explore the experiences of reclaiming participation in 17 chronic survivors of TSCI by emphasising their met and unmet needs as well as the conditions influencing them. Findings: One-hundred and forty-seven and 49 incident cases, resulting in an annual crude incidence rate of 75. 6 and 19. 0 per million population, were registered for the region of South Africa (study I) and Sweden (study II), respectively. The leading cause of injury in South Africa was assault, accounting for approximately 60 % of all incident cases, compared with the leading cause in Sweden, where falls was responsible for 58 % of all cases. The two cohorts differed significantly with respect to demographic and aetiologic characteristics. Concerning functioning, Study III found that the generic rehabilitation outcome measure was not fully conceptualised within the ICF and did not cover all the essential functioning aspects as contained in the brief core set. In contrast, the standardised outcome measure was fully conceptualised within the ICF and covered, in its entirety, the activity and participation categories contained in the brief core set. In Study IV, clients’ perspectives confirmed 'participation' as a desirable and possible goal by effectively dealing with the new self, negotiating obstacles, identifying facilitators of participation, and becoming an agent. These critical aspects − also categories − were essential for reconstructing meaning and prioritising important life situations. Conclusions: The incidence of TSCI in South Africa is {{among the highest in the}} world and is mainly caused by assault, while the incidence in Sweden appeared consistent to what is proposed for Western Europe. Furthermore, there is a need to raise awareness and facilitate the use of standardised outcome measures in TSCI rehabilitation, since the current operational measure in the South African SCI rehabilitation field presented some shortcomings. It is remarkable to conclude that while participation is indeed a reality after injury, the dimensionality of challenges remains an issue for further discourse. The insights gained from these studies provide an evidence-based foundation for impacting primary <b>prevention</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and the alignment of rehabilitation practices towards addressing the unmet needs of survivors...|$|R

In open-ended, conversational style interviews I asked 10 men, who are/were involved in self-help community based treatment groups at Community Justice Initiatives (CJI), Waterloo Region, to convey their understanding of how sexual abuse could have been prevented in their own lives, and can be prevented in our communities. The participants shared their views about prevention based on their experiences, and their interpretations of these experiences. I based the research results on the stories I was told and paid particular attention to factors which research participants believed to have significantly contributed to the abuse. In essence the research was a life cycle study. Participants shared experiences from their early childhood, marriage, the time preceding and following the abuse, the time around the disclosure, and their involvement at CJI. I analyzed the results qualitatively in terms of thematic content, by keeping close to the original interview transcripts. The emerging themes became the topics for focus groups during a workshop organized by interview participants, CJI volunteers and staff, and myself. During this workshop, service providers and consumers were asked to make recommendations for changes at individual, family, social, and cultural levels of intervention. I summarized these recommendations and reﬂected upon them in terms of (1) a model for primary prevention in child sexual abuse, and (2) primary <b>prevention</b> <b>action</b> research generally. Workshop participants jointly endorsed the utilization of results. The family of origin was a key point of discussion throughout the interviews. Experiences of neglect and abuse were shared by many of the participants and were described as greatly inhibiting future abilities to accept fully others’ rights and one’s own responsibilities when placed in a care-giving role. Many of the participants emphasized that as children they had their experiences denied and invalidated and how this silence put them at risk of justifying and minimizing their own abusive behaviour as adults. The effects of having one’s pain denied was often not actively felt until the onset of adolescence and early adulthood, when dating relationships and friendships became more significant than relationships in the family of origin. However, abused children do not inevitably become abusive parents. Cultural, communal, and social expectations and actions affect families’ approaches to child rearing. Parents are particularly at risk of perpetrating abuse if expression of emotion is and was discouraged in the family context. Traditionally boys are more likely to experience this limitation. Workshop participants highlighted two primary <b>prevention</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> (1) for parents to raise their children to reach their emotional, cognitive, physical, social and spiritual potential, they need to be aware of and able to access community support which fosters their own growth in these areas; and (2) communities have a responsibility to model a child friendly environment which actively recognizes children 2 ̆ 7 s rights for a life characterized by nurturing and age appropriate expectations, Lastly, workshop participants expressed that healthy sexuality, in the holistic sense of the term, can only become a reality in communities which are willing to discuss sexual expression. Deﬁnitions of sexuality in terms of the prohibition of sexual transgression, such as the incest taboo, are negative in focus and inadequate when it comes to setting a sound social and moral climate. Throughout the research a critique of systemic failures was cited by research and workshop participants alike as a critical need in primary prevention work. What began as a research interest on my part soon became a starting point for future social events initiated through CJI. The research process is action in itself and can gain a momentum well beyond its own original narrow focus. An agenda towards an increased and shared sense of empowerment can aid to establish community change if built on the capacity of all parties involved. A phenomenological approach, which is inclusive of the multitude of realities in any situation, lends itself to increasing our understanding beyond the narrow conﬁnes of ofﬁcially sanctioned knowledge. The reality of sexual abuse as it emerged from the research exposed this 2 ̆ 2 private 2 ̆ 2 act as something which is embedded in silence. This silence was and is actively and sometimes violently enforced in many families and ﬁnally the community at large...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: An <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> is an {{agreement}} between clinician and patient that the patient will make a spe-cific behavior change. The goals {{of this study are}} to: determine whether it is feasible for patients to make <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in the primary care visit; determine whether patients report carrying out their action plans; and describe the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> patients choose. Methods: Forty-three clinicians in 8 primary care sites were recruited to hold action-plan discus-sions with patients. Research assistants contacted patients by telephone 3 weeks later to assess whether patients had conducted their <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Results: Eighty-three percent of enrolled patients (228) made an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> during a primary care visit. Of the 79 % who recalled making the <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> when interviewed by telephone 3 weeks later, 56 % recalled the details of their <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> and an additional 33 % recalled the general nature of the <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> At least 53 % of patients making an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> reported making a behavior change consistent with that <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> Conclusions: Most patients reported making a behavior change based on an <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> suggesting that <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> may be a useful strategy to encourage behavior change for patients seen in primary care.

40|$|Objective: <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> is {{regarded}} as an important correlate and predictor of health behaviour, but {{little is known about}} antecedents of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Because personality constructs have been shown to moderate the effect of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> interventions, the present study tested associations of personality dimensions with <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and fruit consumption. Design and setting: Cross-sectional data collected with self-administered questionnaires in a university setting. Method: Undergraduate students (n = 443; mean age = 21. 45 (SD = 2. 96) years, 68. 7 % females) who participated for course credits and completed measures of personality dimensions, <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> intention, and fruit consumption based on validated questionnaires. The first set of analyses focused on antecedents of fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> employing stepwise regression analysis. The second set of analyses focused on intention and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as mediators of the personality-fruit consumption link using structural equation modelling. Results: Higher scores for fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> were found for more conscientiousness and less neurotic individuals. Further, more conscientious individuals consumed more fruits and this relationship was mediated by <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Conclusion: Findings provide support for <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as a mediator in the Conscientiousness-fruit consumption link and suggest that personality influences may need {{to be taken into account}} when developing <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strategies aimed at increasing fruit consumption...|$|R
