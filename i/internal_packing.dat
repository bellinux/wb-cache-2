50|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to as a sexless coupling, because rather than having a male and a female end connected by screw threads, either identical end can be joined to any other end of the same diameter. This is also called hermaphroditic or two-way connection. To couple a Storz connection, the two opposing couplings are pressed together such that the hooks of each one are inserted into the slots in the flange of the other. Then they are rotated in opposite directions until they are tight, or latches engage. This creates a water-tight connection between the <b>internal</b> <b>packing</b> gaskets. To uncouple them, the latches are released and the connectors are turned in the opposite directions from coupling, and then separated when the hooks and slots are aligned. Special wrenches are designed for assisting with use of Storz connectors.|$|E

In the 1990s, Richards and collaborators used a combination of theory and experiment to investigate how the well-packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations.|$|E

5000|$|With {{a lighter}} shelter and {{sleeping}} system, the backpack can consist of lighter material and a less bulky frame or no frame at all. The common ultralight alternative to an <b>internal</b> frame <b>pack</b> is a frameless pack made of ripstop nylon, silnylon, or Dyneema, or cuben fibre with a carrying limit of 25 lb.

25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame <b>packs.</b> The <b>internal</b> construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the <b>pack.</b> <b>Internal</b> frame <b>packs</b> originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|R
40|$|This project {{presents}} {{a vision of}} how New Zealand could work smarter to capitalise on a lucrative global trade opportunity, by offering {{an alternative to the}} current logistics and transportation infrastructure of refrigerated exports. With the aid of a world-first FTA (Free-Trade Agreement) (Barber, 2014), New Zealand frozen lamb exports to China are rapidly growing (Meat Industry Association of New Zealand, 2013). However, the current transportation and logistical systems used to export this product were developed over 37 years ago (Chua, 1978). With significant growth in the Chinese market, these systems are now inefficient and outdated (Levinson, 2006; & Food Science Australia, 2005). New systems and new infrastructures need to be developed to accommodate the needs of the new, lucrative Chinese market. The system designed in this project comprises a flat-pack refrigerated shipping container system with integrated <b>internal</b> <b>packing</b> modules. The flat-pack design of the container increases space efficiency when transporting empty and improves security when transporting export product. <b>Internal</b> <b>packing</b> modules divide and organise the cargo in manageable units which eliminate ergonomic issues and decrease the risk of injury while also increasing product safety and quality assurance...|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of a thiosulfate-oxidizing bioreactor that allowed high elemental sulfur production and recovery efficiency. The reactor system, {{referred to as a}} Supernatant-Recycling Settler Bioreactor (SRSB), consisted of a cylindrical upflow reactor and a separate aeration vessel. The reactor was equipped with an <b>internal</b> settler and <b>packing</b> material (structured corrugated PVC sheets) to facilitate both cell retention and the settling of the formed elemental sulfur. The supernatant from the reactor was continuously recirculated through the aerator. An inlet thiosulfate concentration of 100 mmol l − 1 was used. The reactor system was fed with 89 mmol l − 1 d − 1 thiosulfate reaching 98 to 100 % thiosulfate conversion with an elemental sulfur yield of 77 %. Ninety-three percent of the produced sulfur was harvested {{from the bottom of the}} reactor as sulfur sludge. The dry sulfur sludge contained 87 % elemental sulfur. The inclusion of an <b>internal</b> settler and <b>packing</b> material in the reactor system resulted in an effective retention of sulfur and biomass inside the bioreactor, preventing the oxidation of thiosulfate and elemental sulfur to sulfate in the aerator and, therefore, improving the efficiency of elemental sulfur formation and recovery.

Three types of aluminum foams with different cell sizes, porosity specifications and thermal conductivities were used in the study. The test data were collected and they made it possible to establish the effect of the foam geometry, properties of fluids and flow hydrodynamic conditions on the convective heat transfer process from the heating surface to the fluid flowing by (wetting) that surface. The foam was found to be involved in heat transfer to a limited extent only. Heat is predominantly transferred directly from the duct wall to a fluid, and intensity of convective heat transfer is controlled by the wall effects. The influence of foam structural parameters, like cell size and/or porosity, becomes more clearly apparent under laminar flow conditions...|$|R
