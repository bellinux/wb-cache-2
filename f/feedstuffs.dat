5|$|The Port of Aarhus {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while <b>feedstuffs,</b> stone, cement and coal are among the chief imports. Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the Port of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury {{industrialisation}} came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: the Ceres-grounds). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet (KFK), focused on grain and <b>feedstuffs.</b> KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today. Otto Mønsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on butter export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note included the dockyard Aarhus Flydedok, the oil mill Århus Oliefabrik and the ironworks Frichs.|$|E

40|$|These days {{livestock}} farms {{occupy a}} significant {{place in the}} agricultural sector. The success of such farms depends on management and adequate feeding of livestock.

Some of the major issues facing farmers are: high price of <b>feedstuff,</b> their poor quality. The focus of the study is to calculate the optimal quantity of <b>feedstuff,</b> feed rationing at a low cost, but making sure to satisfy the needs with energy, proteins, amino-acids, mineral matter etc. In order to carry out the study we used Feed-Win InterActive V 1. 03 software.

Both stations grew very quickly. The Seed Control Station in particular developed into a world-renowned institute. Its founder, Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler led it expertly and successfully for 42 years. The topics studied included fertilisers and <b>feedstuffs,</b> soils, milk, wines, farm fertilisers etc.. A focal point was the further development of analysis methods. This provided {{the starting point for}} the subsequent founding of the Reckenholz location of the present-day Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon Research Station (ART). However, the second location, Tänikon TG, was only opened in 1970, at that time as a research station for rural economics and agricultural engineering.|$|E

40|$|Supplementation of cows grazing rangelands {{is often}} {{beneficial}} to overcome nutrient deficiencies or imbalances. However, supplemental feeds and their delivery to the cow herd are expenses and thus supplementation decisions should be carefully made {{to ensure that}} costs are minimized and benefits in terms of cow performance exceed supplementation costs. When supplementing cows, there are questions that producers should ask themselves {{to determine the best}} management practices to provide the most cost effective supplement program for their operation. The first among these is the type of supplement to be provided in terms of whether it will provide the correct nutrient to overcome a deficiency or imbalance. Selection of the correct supplemental <b>feedstuff</b> based on its nutritional composition can improve the cows’ ability to utilize range forage, whereas the wrong <b>feedstuff</b> can reduce utilization of range forage and possibly simply become a substitute for grazed forage. Once the correct supplemental <b>feedstuff</b> is chosen based on its nutrient composition, opportunities to deliver that <b>feedstuff</b> need to be considered to meet two goals: (1) reduce the cost of supplement delivery and (2) ensure that the <b>feedstuff</b> is consumed as uniformly as possible by all cows in the herd. Other goals for cow herd and grazing management may also need to be considered. This paper will address some options for supplement delivery and the economics of those options...|$|R
25|$|A {{liberalisation}} of import tariffs in 1797 {{marked the}} end of mercantilism and further liberalisation in the 19th {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century established the Danish liberal tradition in international trade that was only to be broken by the 1930s. Even when other countries, such as Germany and France, raised protection for their agricultural sector because of increased American competition resulting in much lower agricultural prices after 1870, Denmark retained its free trade policies, as the country profited from the cheap imports of cereals (used as <b>feedstuffs</b> for their cattle and pigs) and could increase their exports of butter and meat of which the prices were more stable. Today, Denmark is part of the European Union's internal market, which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Support for free trade is high among the Danish public; in a 2007 poll 76% responded that globalisation is a good thing. 70% of trade flows are inside the European Union. , Denmark's largest export partners are Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway.|$|E

The first factor was packaging type (guny sack, plastic sack, paper packaging, and plastic packaging). The second factor was storage (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks). The parameters observed were: water content, water activity, particle size, specific density, bulk density, compacted bulk density, angle of repose and insect attack. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and differences between treatments were determined with Duncan test. The results showed that packaging type highly significantly affected (p< 0. 01) the moisture content, water activity, and compacted bulk density.

40|$|Background: The alga Laminaria japonica is {{the most}} {{economically}} important brown seaweed cultured in China, which is used as food and aquatic animal <b>feedstuff.</b> However, the use of L. japonica as a <b>feedstuff</b> in Apostichopus japonicas farming is not ideal because A. japonicas does not produce enough enzyme activity for degrading {{the large amount of}} algin present in L. japonica. In this study, semi solid fermentation of the L. japonica <b>feedstuff</b> employing a Bacillus strain as the microbe was used to as a mean to degrade the algin content in L. japonica <b>feedstuff.</b> Results: The Bacillus strain, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens WB 1, was isolated by virtue of its ability to utilize sodium alginate as the sole carbon source. Eight factors affecting growth and algin-degrading capacity of WB 1 were investigated. The results of Plackett–Burman design indicated that fermentation time, beef extract, and solvent to solid ratio were the significant parameters. Furthermore, the mutual interaction between the solvent to solid ratio and beef extract concentration was more significant than the other pairs of parameters on algin degradation. Optimal values obtained from Central-Composite Design were 113. 94 h for fermentation time, 0. 3 % (w/v) beef extract and 44. 87 (v/w) ratio of solvent to <b>feedstuff.</b> Under optimal conditions, 56. 88 % of the algin was degraded when a 50 -fold scale-up fermentation was carried out, using a 5 -L fermenter. Conclusions: This study provides an alternative and economical way to reduce the algin content in L. japonica through degradation by WB 1, making it a promising potential source of feed for cultured L. japonica...|$|R
