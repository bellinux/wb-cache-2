40|$|Modulation {{detection}} is {{very important}} to many communication and electronic warfare applications. Recent developments in cognitive radio (CR) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) network have also brought much attention to modulation detection of unknown radio frequency (RF) signals. It is well known that using second-order cyclostationary features, e. g., spectral correlation function (SCF) and spectral coherent function (SOF), BPSK modulation can be easily distinguished from <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulations</b> such as QPSK and QAM modulations. However, QPSK and <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulations</b> exhibit similar second-order cyclostationary features, thus these features cannot be employed to distinguish among <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulations.</b> To classify <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulations,</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> cumulants are proposed in the literature. In this thesis, we build a blind hierarchical modulation detector to successfully classify the modulations of the RF signals. Moreover, we use software-defined radio (SDR) to implement and demonstrate a practical blind modulation detector which can accurately distinguish among three popular modulations, i. e., BPSK, QPSK and 16 -QAM. Specifically, second-order cyclostationary features using detailed SOF are applied to distinguish between BPSK modulation and non-BPSK modulations (e. g., QPSK and 16 -QAM modulations) at first level of the hierarchical modulation detector. Then fourth-order cumulant feature is applied to the non-BPSK RF signals: distinguish between QPSK modulation and 16 -QAM modulation. In the implementation, we use Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) hardware and GNU Radio software to realize the blind hierarchical modulation detector. Energy based signal detection is implemented to detect the existence of RF signals, and the hierarchical modulation detector will classify the modulation of the detected RF signal. The SDR based blind hierarchical modulation detector does not require any priori information of the RF signal, and performs real-time accurate modulation detection. The performance of the proposed blind hierarchical modulation detector is analyzed under different conditions, such as the number of samples and the number of symbols. Demonstrations in AWGN channel and realistic multi-path fading channel confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SDR based blind hierarchical modulation detector...|$|R

In the meantime, for the transmission lengths shorter than 50 m, the proposed PN-PAM transmission scheme performs better than the classical PAM with DFE equalization but worse than the DMT transmissions.

The common concept in these proposed models is using the <b>high</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes together with the low order ones at low SNR values. In model (1), the percentage of using the different modulation schemes will be controlled by the SER value only.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} using polar codes with <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulation</b> over AWGN channels. Unlike prior work, we focus on using modulation independent polar codes. That is, the polar codes are not re-designed based on the modulation used. Instead, we propose bit-permuted coded modulation (BPCM) : a technique for using the multilevel coding (MLC) approach for an arbitrary polar code. The BPCM technique exploits a natural connection between MLC and polar codes. It involves applying bit permutations prior to mapping the polar code to a <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulation.</b> The bit permutations are designed, via density evolution, to match the rates provided by various bit levels of the <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> <b>modulation</b> {{to that of the}} polar code. We demonstrate performance of the BPCM technique using link simulations and density evolution for the AWGN channel. We compare the BPCM technique with the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) technique. When using polar codes designed for BPSK modulation, we show gains for BPCM over BICM with random interleaver of up to 0. 2 dB, 0. 7 dB and 1. 4 dB for 4 -ASK, 8 -ASK, and 16 -ASK respectively.
