5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. <b>Employees</b> <b>share</b> multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to obtain an understanding as to the true economic nature of <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> options and the problems surrounding the accounting thereof. The main conclusion {{of this study is}} that <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> options should be expensed in the income statement as and when the employee's services are performed. The reason is that <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> options are valuable financial instruments which the employer has used to compensate the employee for his services. It was also concluded that exercise date accounting and classification of outstanding <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> options as liabilities on the balance sheet is the most appropriate accounting treatment. Such accounting treatment trues up the accounting of <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> options with that of cash-settled share appreciation rights, which are economically equivalent transactions. The measurement of <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> options should be based on their fair value using an option-pricing model adapted for the specific features of <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> options.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to consider the link between employee commitment and motivation, on the one hand, and productivity on the other, and in particular whether <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> ownership can play a positive role in this regard. The focus is, therefore, on the effects of <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> ownership and <b>employee</b> participation on corporate performance. A departure point is the UK government’s policies to promote <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> ownership, which has been presented explicitly as a means to boost productivity via enhanced employee commitment and motivation.

50|$|For {{the first}} {{one and a half}} century of its existence, the Faculty of Law was not {{organised}} into departments, but rather centered on each chair. From the 1950s, a number of departments have been established. All academics are now affiliated with one of the departments. The establishment of the departments was supported by generous grants from shipping magnate (and lawyer) Anders Jahre. For the first decades, the departments had a fairly weak position organisationally. The boundaries between departments in the three traditional higher faculties, i.e. the faculties of theology, law and medicine, are significantly weaker than in the other faculties, and the faculty identity stronger, {{due to the fact that}} most <b>employees</b> <b>share</b> the same profession.

GCARS uses real-time crime statistics to detect patterns and identify geographic areas which require increased police services. This information is disseminated to police personnel by various methods, including publishing the information through email, posting to an in-house Intranet, and printed for watch commanders prior to patrol shift deployments. The reports contain crime maps displaying current and 30-day trends with accompanying information about the crimes. The reports contain detailed information about crime descriptors, heavy police call-for-service locations, and a log through which all police <b>employees</b> <b>share</b> important information.|$|E

The studies were done to see if these bureaucracies are truly representative of the social groups that make up their citizenry. According to one survey there are great differences in the way black and white administrators and citizens view different issues.

There are drastic differences between white and black administrators views and the views of black and white citizens. The study claims black administrators are more similar to their citizen counterparts, white administrators tended to be {{out of touch with the}} views of their citizen counterparts.
