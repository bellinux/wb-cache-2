5|$|Several reviewers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the event. The most {{frequent}} criticism has {{been related to}} the match between The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez, Hulk Hogan's title win, and the Roman togas worn by announcers. Both the pay-per-view buyrate and the attendance for the event dropped from the previous year's WrestleMania.|$|E
5|$|The George C. Marshall Institute and Fred Singer, {{two of the}} subjects, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the book. Other {{reviewer}}s {{have been}} more favorable. One reviewer said that Merchants of Doubt is exhaustively researched and documented, and {{may be one of}} the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best science book of the year. It was made into a film, Merchants of Doubt, directed by Robert Kenner, released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Tim Waterstone and James Daunt <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> tax {{avoidance}} by Amazon.com in the British press. Amazon has received sustained scrutiny {{for the amount}} of its overall sales that are reported by its UK subsidiary, in comparison to those 'processed offshore in Luxembourg to avoid UK tax'. In the 2012-13 financial year, Amazon paid £3.2 million in tax on sales of £4.2 billion and received £2.5 million in grants from the government. In the same period, it was revealed that Waterstones paid £11.9 million in tax, despite an operating loss of £25.4 million and sales of £410.4 million.|$|E

5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} original release in July 2015; critics praised Microsoft's decision {{to provide a}} desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was panned for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, {{as well as the}} functionality and capabilities of Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. However, media outlets <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.|$|E

25|$|Milner has {{the ability}} to pass {{accurately}} and shoot from a great distance from goal. As a result, he usually goes forward for set pieces and is often a candidate to take corners and free kicks. Critical opinion is divided as to Milner's crossing ability.

Stalin was an MLA in 1989 and 1996 when his father Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister, and became Chennai's 44th mayor in 1996. In 2009, he was made the Deputy Chief Minister.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, General Secretary and reformist Hu Yaobang visited Tibet and {{ushered in}} a period of social, political, and {{economic}} liberalization. At the end of the decade, however, before the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, monks in the Drepung and Sera monasteries started protesting for independence, and so the government halted reforms and started an anti-separatist campaign. Human rights organisations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the Beijing and Lhasa governments' approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.|$|E
25|$|In the US, Good Samaritan {{laws have}} been {{implemented}} to protect bystanders who acted in good faith. Many organizations are including bystander training. For example, the United States Department of the Army is doing bystander training with respect to sexual assault. Some organizations routinely do bystander training with respect to safety issues. Others have been doing bystander training with respect to diversity issues. Organizations such as American universities are also using bystander research to improve bystander attitudes in cases of rape. Examples include the InterAct Sexual Assault Prevention program and the Green Dot program. Others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> these laws for being punitive and criminalizing the problem they are meant to address.|$|E

25|$|The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) {{and other}} fire safety experts, {{including}} Roger L. Yow, {{president of the}} Charleston Firefighters Association and a former captain with 25 years of service in the department, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> {{the manner in which}} the fire was handled. Union officials and other fire safety experts claim the City of Charleston Fire Department did not follow procedures consistent with the National Incident Management System. South Carolina governor Mark Sanford directed all state and local emergency response agencies to adopt the system in 2005. Acting state fire marshal John Reich said the state does not inspect the operating procedures of fire departments, but they assume that departments are following guidelines prescribed in the National Incident Management System. Some fire safety experts have also questioned why so many firefighters were in a burning building with a steel truss roof, which is known to be a serious safety hazard for firefighters. A routine fire preplan of the structure in June 2006 made no mention of its roof construction, and it has been suggested that CFD firefighters did not pull the ceiling to check for extension into the roof structure.|$|E
