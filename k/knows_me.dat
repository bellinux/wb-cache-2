Colbert, chose the word truthiness just moments before taping the premiere episode of The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – [...] "truth" [...] – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: [...] "We're {{not talking about}} truth, we're {{talking about something that}} seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: [...] "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who <b>knows</b> <b>me</b> knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen." ...|$|E

New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who <b>knows</b> <b>me</b> that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E

500|$|During {{her final}} years, Dworkin {{suffered}} fragile health, and she revealed {{in her last}} column for the Guardian {{that she had been}} weakened and nearly crippled {{for the past several years}} by severe osteoarthritis in the knees. Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who <b>knows</b> <b>me</b> best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] in my case, possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole my health. I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E

[...] Ueshiba replied: [...] "I know who you are," [...] to which Abbe {{modestly}} retorted: [...] "Everyone <b>knows</b> <b>me,</b> I am Kenshiro Abbe, Champion of All Japan." [...] Ueshiba then introduced himself as the Founder of Aikido, and was told by Abbe that he didn't look strong enough to be a martial arts master. Ueshiba then offered Abbe his little finger, and said: [...] "But young man, you look very strong indeed. Please break my finger." [...] Abbe at first declined, but eventually accepted the challenge, presumably to shut the old man up. Abbe claimed that, as he took hold of the old man's finger and tried to break it, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} carriage and totally immobilised. Whilst on the floor Abbe asked Ueshiba for permission to study under him.|$|E

500|$|On 12 September, Lord Dingwall {{had landed}} at Leith, {{reporting}} that [...] "he {{had come in}} company with the Queen's fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas." [...] Alarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers, kept watch on the Firth of Forth for Anne's arrival, wrote several songs, one comparing the situation {{to the plight of}} Hero and Leander, and sent a search party out for Anne, carrying a letter he had written to her in French: [...] "Only to one who <b>knows</b> <b>me</b> as well as his own reflection in a glass could I express, my dearest love, the fears which I have experienced because of the contrary winds and violent storms since you embarked...". Informed in October that the Danes had abandoned the crossing for the winter, and in what Willson calls [...] "the one romantic episode of his life", James sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally, arriving in Oslo on 19 November after travelling by land from Flekkefjord via Tønsberg. According to a Scottish account, he presented himself to Anne, [...] "with boots and all", and, disarming her protests, gave her a kiss in the Scottish fashion.|$|E

I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who <b>knows</b> <b>me</b> knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time."
