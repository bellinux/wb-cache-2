5|$|It {{is true that}} a {{house that}} is between two {{destroyed}} homes can be undamaged, {{but this is not}} the result of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick {{enrolled}} in Pineville High School in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During {{his sophomore year}} in 1948, he developed an interest in football and made the school's team, though he was small for his age. The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it was stolen from his locker in October 1948. The incident upset Shadrick so much {{he dropped out of}} school, reportedly refusing to return <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> forward. One month later, he and a friend enlisted in the U.S. Army. Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and said he felt it indirectly caused his son's death.|$|E
5|$|The Shaktisamgama-tantra narrates {{the birth}} of Ucchishta-matangini. Once, the god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi visited Shiva and his second wife Parvati (a reincarnation of Sati) and gave them a banquet of fine foods. While eating, the deities dropped some food on the ground, from which arose a {{beautiful}} maiden who asked their left-overs. The four deities granted her their left-overs as prasad, food made sacred by having been first consumed by the deity. This {{can be interpreted as}} the Ucchishta of the deity, although due to its negative connotation the word Ucchishta is never explicitly used in connection to prasad. Shiva decreed that those who repeat her mantra and worship her will have their material desires satisfied and gain control over foes, declaring her the giver of boons. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the maiden was known as Ucchishta-matangini.|$|E

The film premiered on 28 October 2012, during a gathering to celebrate the party's 10th anniversary, and has since been made available in numerous languages.|$|E
5|$|When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Riefenstahl {{was photographed}} in Poland wearing a {{military}} uniform and a pistol on her belt {{in the company}} of German soldiers; she had gone to Poland as a war correspondent. On 12 September, she was in the town of Końskie when 30 civilians were executed in retaliation for an alleged attack on German soldiers. According to her memoir, Riefenstahl tried to intervene but a furious German soldier held her at gunpoint and threatened to shoot her on the spot. She claimed she did not realize the victims were Jews. Closeup photographs of a distraught Riefenstahl survive <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> Nevertheless, by 5 October 1939, Riefenstahl was back in occupied Poland filming Hitler's victory parade in Warsaw. Afterwards, she left Poland and chose not to make any more Nazi-related movies.|$|E
5|$|With Canadian {{industry}} reorganized {{to supply}} the British war effort, Howe decided he needed to journey to Britain to discuss matters with the customers. He embarked on the S.S.

One of those submarines sank the Western Prince on 14 December. Howe survived the sinking and eight hours in a lifeboat. Gordon Scott, his aide, was killed trying to climb from the lifeboat to the rescuing ship.

This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
