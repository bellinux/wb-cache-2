40|$|Abstract – Two Tsigai sheep populations {{exist in}} Serbia: the Old type, called ˇCokan, and the New type. It {{is assumed that}} the New type results from {{upgrading}} Tsigai sheep with exotic ge-netic material. We investigated genetic diversity and differentiation of these types by analysing 23 autosomal microsatellites. Tests for Hardy-Weinberg proportions, linkage equilibrium be-tween genotypes across loci and the calculation of inbreeding coefficients were performed and the deficiency {{in the number of}} alleles within the Tsigai types was examined using a Wilcoxon sign-rank test. The New type displayed a higher level of genetic variability than the ˇCokan in terms of allele numbers, but the New Tsigai showed a pattern of heterozygosity deficiency. The positive f value for the ˇCokan suggests the occurrence of inbreeding in this type. The proportion of linkage disequilibrium was below that expected by chance. Exclusion of two loci in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium did not alter our conclusions based on the entire data set i. e. the two Tsigai types are clearly differentiated and the New Tsigai type has been influenced by cross-breeding. Therefore, the ˇCokan Tsigai should be considered as a distinct endangered breed in the <b>FAO</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|E

Four-row implements were used on a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic Kandiudults; <b>FAO</b> <b>classification</b> Luxic Ferralsols).

The small chamber system showed that trafficked areas exhibited lower CO 2 efflux relative to in-row and untrafficked row positions.

Soil and crop residue samples were taken in December 2009 to investigate the short-term effects of cover crops on soil pH, moisture, NH 4 + -N, NO 3 - -N, soluble organic C and nitrogen (N), total organic C and N, and C mineralization in comparison with a nil-crop control (CK).

The experiment was conducted in the field on a dystrophic red latosol (Ferralsol in <b>FAO's</b> <b>classification)</b> at the Coffee Research Sector, University of Lavras, MG, Brazil. The experimental design was of complete randomized blocks with three repetitions of the following treatments: conventional urea, ammonium nitrate and urea + 0. 15 % Cu and 0. 4 % B, urea + anionic polymers, urea + elementary sulfur (S 0) + polymers, and urea + plastic resin.

This study examines pedodiversity and biodiversity-area relationships {{on a global scale}} using countries as spatial units. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) soil database and International Union for the Conservation of Nature-World Commission on Protected Areas (IUCN-WCMC) biological datasets have been used in this analysis.

When a country has high pedodiversity it has also high biodiversity, and since pedodiversity may be interpreted as an expression of environmental heterogeneity in terms of geological parent material, geomorphology, and climate of a given area, this result suggests that the biodiversity of a country depends both on the extent of its area and on its environmental heterogeneity.

The paper discusses the use of a soil diagnostic model combined with geographic information systems (GIS) to convert the current blanket fertilizer recommendations (0 N - 165 P. O, - 200 K. O kg ha 1) into a more effective recommendation that accounts for local land resources and the actual nutrient requirements of cocoa trees. A digital map of cocoa nutrient requirements was created based on climatic and soil groups/associations data. The results showed that about 95 % of the areas suitable for cocoa production are developed on only seven soil groups and four sub-groups (<b>FAO</b> <b>classification).</b> As inputs, 201 soil chemical analytic data were linked to land units to compute cocoa fertilizer formulae and doses. The number of fertilizer formulae was reduced to 32 using a fuzzy classification. Six fertilizer formulae would be sufficient to cover fertilizer recommendations for 52 % of the cocoa growing areas, while 16 fertilizer formulae will cover 90 % of the cocoa area. The current blanket fertilizer formula is only suitable for 6 % of the cocoa growing areas in Ghana. In western Ghana, where rainfall is over 1800 mm, the climatic influence is predominant and high leaching of soils is probably responsible for greater needs for P, than for K, Ca, and Mg. In eastern Ghana, where soils have high exchangeable cation levels and base saturation, soil diagnostic method suggested application of N fertilizers.
