The NSTC was established in May 1991 by the NASA Headquarters Safety Directorate to provide up-to-date, high-quality, NASA specific safety training on location at NASA centers, or simultaneously to multiple centers over the Video Teleconferencing System (ViTS). Our desire is to establish and maintain a strong, long-lasting relationship with all NASA centers in order to fulfill your safety training needs on a cost-effective basis. Our ultimate goal is to provide a positive contribution to safe operations at NASA. NSTC Course 055 is a 2 -day course discussing the safe usage of <b>hypergols</b> (hydrazine fuels and nitrogen tetroxide). During the course we will identify the hazards associated with <b>hypergols</b> including toxicity, reactivity, fire, and explosion.

[...] Monergols were monopropellants, while non-hypergols were bipropellants which required external ignition, and lithergols were solid/liquid hybrids.

40|$|Hypergolic {{propellants}} (<b>hypergols)</b> are propellants that ignite {{shortly after}} contact. They omit {{the requirement of}} an ignition system, making hypergolic engines simple, reliable and capable of being throttled several times. These advantages make them desirable for deep space missions. However, the applications are severely limited by their toxicity and reactivity. In an effort to increase the safety of manufacturing, shipping, and storing, these propellants can be combined with different gelling agents. The focus of this project is to build an optically accessible combustion chamber pressurized at 200 psi to compare the performance of gelled and neat Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH) and Red Fuming Nitric Acid (RFNA). The fuel samples of MMH will be gelled with either Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC) or fumed silica at various weight percentages and oxidizer samples of RFNA will be gelled with fumed silica. The propellants will be injected at different mixture ratios into the combustion chamber, using an existing impinging jet mechanism, where the reaction will be recorded via high speed cameras focused on the incoming jets of propellants. Data acquired through testing the propellants in this system will allow for calculation of ignition characteristics, combustion efficiency, and specific impulse for both neat and gelled propellants. The final results will help in the further understanding of neat and gelled hypergolic propellants {{in terms of their}} performance and behavior in a high pressure environment. This project is a gateway into the testing of other gelled <b>hypergols</b> and applying the knowledge into building safer and more efficient hypergolic engines...|$|R
50|$|Operational {{tests of}} the Atlas F were mostly successful, but two flights from Vandenberg (Atlas 45F in October 1963 and Atlas 3F in April 1964) {{suffered}} stuck engine valves and tipped over at liftoff. Both failed launches were from OSTF-2, which was repaired in only two months following Atlas 45F. Atlas 3F put the silo out of use for six months. In both cases, the failure {{was found to be}} accumulated <b>hypergol</b> residue in the main fuel valve from previous engine firings. On January 8, 1965, the final Atlas ICBM test, Missile 106F, successfully launched from OSTF-576G. That year, the Atlas was retired from service as an ICBM and remaining missiles used for suborbital and orbital launches over the next few decades. This included tests of ABRES, RMP, and BMRS reentry vehicles at Vandenberg. The OSTF silos were converted into dedicated launch pads for these and Nike/Zeus target missile testing (the latter were never launched with Atlas Fs). Sixty-five such tests took place between 1965 and 1974, roughly half of which used Atlas Fs. Some had a Trident solid upper stage and there were several failures, the most notable being a 1967 test where the Atlas's RSO charges were ignited by static electricity at RV separation, after which cork insulation was added to the RV to prevent a recurrence of this failure mode.|$|E

40|$|Hypergolic {{fuels and}} {{oxidizer}} are emitted {{to the environment}} during fueling and deservicing shuttle and other spacecraft. Such emissions are difficult to measure due to the intermittent purge flow and {{to the presence of}} suspended scrubber liquor. A new method for emissions monitoring was introduced in a previous paper. This paper is a summary of the results of a one-year study of shuttle launch pads and orbiter processing facilities (OPF's) which proved that emissions can be determined from field scrubbers without direct measurement of vent flow rate and <b>hypergol</b> concentration. This new approach is based on the scrubber efficiency, which was measured during normal operations, and on the accumulated weight of <b>hypergol</b> captured in the scrubber liquor, {{which is part of the}} routine monitoring data of scrubber liquors. To validate this concept, three qualification tests were performed, logs were prepared for each of 16 <b>hypergol</b> scrubbers at KSC, the efficiencies of KSC scrubbers were measured during normal operations, and an estimate of the annual emissions was made based on the efficiencies and the propellant buildup data. The results have confirmed that the emissions from the KSC scrubbers can be monitored by measuring the buildup of <b>hypergol</b> propellant in the liquor, and then using the appropriate efficiency to calculate the emissions. There was good agreement between the calculated emissions based on outlet concentration and flow rate, and the emissions calculated from the propellant buildup and efficiency. The efficiencies of 12 KSC scrubbers, measured under actual servicing operations and special test conditions, were assumed to be valid for all subsequent operations until a significant change in hardware occurred. An estimate of the total emissions from 16 scrubbers for three years showed that 0. 3 kg/yr of fuel and 234 kg/yr of oxidizer were emitted...|$|E

Some {{of the reasons}} that drive this interest are the ease of storage of liquid methane when compared to hydrogen, the handling safety when compared to <b>hypergols,</b> in-situ resource utilization and its relative clean burning process. This project is part of the larger goal of the Center for Space Exploration Technology Research (cSETR) to better understand the aspects of using this propellants to create future hardware that are specifically optimized for their use. This paper discusses the testing of a previous iteration of the swirl torch igniter with liquid oxygen and liquid methane. The data and conclusions that led to the design of a new iteration of the swirl torch igniter will be discussed. The purpose of the new design is to replace the previous methane manifold used in the two previous iterations, add a new sparking system, and test the Characteristic Chamber Length (L*).

40|$|Commodity-free {{calibration}} is {{a reaction}} rate calibration technique {{that does not}} require the addition of any commodities. This technique is a specific form of the reaction rate technique, where all of the necessary reactants, other than the sample being analyzed, are either inherent in the analyzing system or specifically added or provided to the system for a reason other than calibration. After introduction, the component of interest is exposed to other reactants or flow paths already present in the system. The instrument detector records one of the following to determine the rate of reaction: the increase in the response of the reaction product, a decrease in the signal of the analyte response, or a decrease in the signal from the inherent reactant. With this data, the initial concentration of the analyte is calculated. This type of system can analyze and calibrate simultaneously, reduce the risk of false positives and exposure to toxic vapors, and improve accuracy. Moreover, having an excess of the reactant already present in the system eliminates the need to add commodities, which further reduces cost, logistic problems, and potential contamination. Also, the calculations involved can be simplified by comparison to those of the reaction rate technique.

The timing of the sparks relative to the pressure/flow conditions also impacted the probability of ignition. Sparks occurring early in the flow could trigger ignition with energies as low as 1 to 6 mJ, though multiple, similarly timed sparks of 55 to 75 mJ were required for reliable ignition.

40|$|The {{collection}} and archiving {{of data from}} personnel dosimeters has become increasingly important {{in light of the}} lowered threshold limit values (TLV) for hydrazine (HZ), monomethylhydrazine (MMH), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). The American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) lowered the TLV from 100 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb and has caused increased concern over long term exposures of personnel to trace levels of these <b>hypergols</b> and other potentially harmful chemicals. An automated system of reading the exposure levels of personnel dosimeters and storing exposure data for subsequent evaluation has been developed. The reading of personnel dosimeter badges for exposure lo potentially harmful vapor concentrations of hydrazines or other chemicals is performed visually by comparing the color developed by the badge with a calibrated color comparator. The result obtained using visual comparisons of the developed badge color with the comparator may vary widely from user to user. The automated badge reader takes the variability out of the dosimeter reading by accurately comparing the reflectance obtained from a colored spot on the badge with a reading on the same spot prior to any exposure to chemical vapors. The observed difference between the reflectance values is used as part of a calculation of the dose value for the badge based on a stored calibration curve. The badge reader also stores bar-code data unique to each badge, as well as bar-code information on the user, as part of the permanent badge record. The start and stop exposure times for each badge are recorded and can be used as part of the calculated concentration, in ppm, for each badge logged during a recording period. The badge reader is equipped with a number of badge holders, each of which is unique to a specific type of personnel dosimeter badge.

40|$|Presented at the AIAA 2000 Missile Sciences Conference, Monterey, CA, November 7 - 9, 2000. Propellant {{toxicity}} is a {{major concern}} in storing, maintaining, and transporting strategic missiles. Many low toxicity green propellants have been developed which hold the potential of increasing the safety and lowering the operation and support costs of liquid-fuelled strategic missile propulsion systems. This study evaluates several green propellants for use in a notional next-generation post-boost propulsion system (PBPS). The mission and physical dimensions for this PBPS were defined by the requirements of the current Minuteman III propulsion system rocket engine (PSRE). Possible propellants were initially screened in terms of toxicity, performance, and technical feasibility for the PBPS application with a multi-attribute ranking method based on an overall evaluation criterion (OEC). Promising propellants were identified, and candidate PBPS concepts were developed and sized for each of these propellants. These concepts were evaluated in terms of weight, cost, and technical risk to determine which concepts, and hence propellants, show the most promise for the application. Probabilistic techniques were employed to explore the effects of uncertainty in the propellant performance and structural weight estimates. The results indicate that high-test peroxide (HTP) combined with either an ethanol-based nontoxic hypergolic miscible fuel (NHMF) or competitive impulse non-carcinogenic <b>hypergol</b> (CINCH) is a very viable propellant solution...|$|E

The standard practice for protecting metallic substrates in atmospheric environments is {{the application of}} an applied coating system.

The primary objective of this effort was to demonstrate and validate alternatives to aliphatic isocyanate polyurethanes resulting {{in one or more}} isocyanate-free coatings qualified for use at AFSPC and NASA installations participating in this project. This joint Test Report (JTR) documents the results of the laboratory and field testing as well as any test modifications made during the execution of the testing.

This JTR is made available as a reference for future pollution prevention endeavors by other NASA centers, the Department of Defense and commercial users to minimize duplication of effort. All coating system candidates were tested using approved NASA and AFSPC standard coating systems as experimental controls. This study looked at eight alternative coating systems and two control coating systems and was divided into Phase I Screening Tests, Phase II Tests, and Field Testing. The Phase I Screening Tests were preliminary tests performed on all the selected candidate coating systems. Candidate coating systems that did not meet the acceptance criteria of the screening tests were eliminated from further testing. Phase I Screening Tests included: Ease of Application, Surface Appearance, Dry-To-Touch (Sanding), Accelerated Storage Stability, Pot Life (Viscosity), Cure Time (Solvent Rubs), Cleanability, Knife Test, Tensile (pull-off) Adhesion, and X-Cut Adhesion by Wet Tape After a review of the Phase I test results, four of the alternative coating systems showed substandard performance in relation to the Control Systems and were eliminated from the Phase II testing. Due to the interest of stakeholders and time constraints, however, all eight alternatives were subjected to the following Phase II tests, along with field testing at Stennis Space Center (SSC), Mississippi: <b>Hypergol</b> Compatibility, Liquid Oxygen Compatibility, 18 -Month Marine Exposure (Gloss Retention, Color Retention, Blistering, Visual Corrosion, Creepage from Scribe, Heat Adhesion), and Field Exposure (6 - and 12 -month Evaluation for Coating Condition, Color Retention, Gloss Retention). The remaining four alternative coating systems determined to be the best viable alternatives were carried on to Phase II testing that included: Removability, Repairability, Abrasion Resistance, Gravelometer, Fungus Resistance, Accelerated Weathering, Mandrel Bend Flexibility, and Cyclic Corrosion Resistance. Of the systems that continued to Phase II, three (3) alternative coating systems meet the performance requirements as identified by stakeholders.
