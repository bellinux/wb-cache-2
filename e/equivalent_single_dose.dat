40|$|Saithe, {{caught on}} the western coast of Norway, was {{filleted}} immediately after killing, packed in plastic bags and irradiated using a cobalt- 60 source at the Institute of Atomic Energy, Kjeller. The doses were 50, 100, 150, 50 + 50 and 50 + 100 krad. All samples were analysed for their total bacterial count, proteolytic activity, ammonia, total volatile acids, trimethylamine oxide, tri- and dimethylamine and formaldehyde. The organoleptic quality was evaluated {{by a panel of}} tasters. Double doses were more effective in reducing the total bacterial count than an <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> <b>dose.</b> A close relation was found between the bacterial count and the proteolytic activity. The trimethylamine oxide concentration was found to vary between 33 and 44 mg/ 100 g muscle, decreasing rapidly in non-irradiated fillets to 3 mg/ 100 g. In non-irradiated fillets trimethylamine oxide was mainly reduced to trimethylamine and in irradiated fillets to dimethylamine and formaldehyde. A split dose of 50 + 50 krad may have a favourable effect on the total bacterial number, but the analyses of proteolytic activity, the volatile acids and the trimethylamine indicated that a higher proportion of spoilage bacteria survive. The low proteolytic activity and the high content of DMA/FA prove that split doses of 50 + 100 krad as compared with single dose of 150 krad, are particularly favourable in the case of saithe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeveral {{clinical}} trials {{have shown that}} the inhaled β 2 -agonists with long-acting properties, formoterol and salmeterol, may be effective in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, {{there is a great deal}} of controversy regarding the timing and optimal dose of inhaled β 2 -agonists in this pathologic condition. In this double-blind, randomised, crossover study, we have compared the bronchodilating effect and the safety of inhaled formoterol administered via Turbuhaler using either a cumulative dose regimen or the <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> in 16 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. On the two consecutive days, the patients received, in a randomised order, each of the following active dose regimens: (A) : 9 + 9 + 18 μg of formoterol via Turbuhaler (36 μg cumulative delivered dose), or (B) : 36 + 0 + 0 μg of formoterol via Turbuhaler. The three doses on each treatment day were administered at 30 -mm intervals, with measurements being made 5 and 30 min after each dose. Contemporaneously, we also measured oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (S pO 2) and pulse rate. Both the high dose and the cumulative one induced a significant bronchodilation expressed as change in FEV 1. The difference between the two regimens was significant (P= 0. 0332) only 60 min after the first inhalation. The trend of FVC and IC was similar to that of FEV 1. All treatment regimens were well tolerated and no adverse events were reported. Neither the administration of the high dose nor that of the cumulative one modified heart rate in a significant manner. Also they did not influence S pO 2. This study indicates that a single high dose of formoterol is as effective as the same dose administered in a cumulative manner in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD...|$|E
40|$|Outbred LACA mice were {{administered}} low (100 ova), medium (1000 ova), high (3000 ova) and trickle (4 ? 250 ova) doses of Toxocara canis ova {{and the effect}} of infection was examined with respect to the number of larvae recovered from the brain and their behaviour. Recovery of larvae from the brain was generally low with the % recovery expressed in terms of the total dose administered being highest for the 3000 dose (6. 1 %) and 1000 dose (6 %), followed by the 100 (4. 4 %) and trickle (3. 5 %) doses. The variation in larval recoveries was large between individual mice receiving similar doses. The level of infection in the brain was lower in mice receiving a multiple as opposed to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of ova. Mice were then divided into three larval intensity groupings based upon the number of larvae recovered from their brain. The ranges for the groups were as follows: low intensity group, 0 ? 15 larvae; moderate intensity group, 27 ? 55 larvae; high intensity group, 66 ? 557 larvae. Three behavioural tests were carried out on control and infected mice. Exploration and response to novelty was examined using a `T? maze and learning was investigated by means of a water-finding task. Anxiety was measured using an elevated plus maze apparatus. Infected mice were less explorative and less responsive to novelty in the `T? maze and this was particularly pronounced for the heavily infected mice. In the elevated plus maze, infected mice displayed reduced levels of anxiety to aversive and exposed areas of the maze, particularly {{in the case of the}} moderate and high intensity mice. There was evidence for impaired learning ability in the water task apparatus for moderate and high intensity mice. In general, the effects of infection on behaviour were more pronounced in the moderate and high intensity groups compared to the low intensity group...|$|E

40|$|Ceforanide (BL-S 786 R) is a new, broad-spectrum, {{parenteral}} cephalosporin. Pharmacokinetic properties {{were determined}} in rats (100 mg/kg), rabbits (30 mg/kg), dogs (25 mg/kg), and humans (2 g or 30 mg/kg) and compared with <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of cefazolin. Plasma half-lives for ceforanide and cefazolin were 1. 1 and 0. 5 h in the rat, 5 and 0. 3 h in the rabbit, 1 and 0. 8 h in the dog, and 2. 6 and 2 h in humans, respectively. The slower elimination of ceforanide, as reflected by longer plasma half-life, larger area under the curve, and peak plasma concentrations, {{was due to}} slower body and renal clearances. The apparent volumes of distribution of ceforanide and cefazolin were comparable. Rats, dogs, and humans excreted 80 to 100 % of the ceforanide dose in the 0 - to 24 -h urine; rabbits excreted only 50 %. Tubular secretion constituted 50 % of ceforanide renal excretion in rabbits, dogs, and humans and 90 % in rats; the remainder was excreted by glomerular filtration. There was no apparent correlation between the extent of tubular secretion and degree of plasma protein binding in different species. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between ceforanide and amikacin in the rat. The slower elimination kinetics of ceforanide are indicative {{of the potential for}} a longer dosing interval and more effective antibiotic therapy as compared with available cephalosporins...|$|R
40|$|The {{underlying}} {{effect of}} serotonergic neurotransmission has {{been implicated in}} several psychiatric disorders. The inability to routinely and non-invasively determine {{the integrity of the}} serotonergic system in vivo has limited our understanding of disorders with a putative serotonergic abnormality. The loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) has been proposed as a reliable measure of central serotonin function in humans. While animal studies suggest that the LDAEP is sensitive to changes in central serotonin neurotransmission, evidence in humans has been indirect and inconsistent. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the sensitivity of the LDAEP to acute augmentation in central serotonergic neurotransmission in humans. The study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, in which healthy subjects were tested under four acute treatment conditions, with pharmacologically <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of placebo, escitalopram (10 mg), citalopram (20 mg) and sertraline (50 mg) to examine the direct effect of acute enhancement of synaptic serotonin on the LDAEP. Furthermore, the outcome of the serotonergic modulatory effects on the LDAEP was also examined using two methods (dipole source analysis (DSA) vs. scalp analysis). Escitalopram, citalopram and sertraline had no effects on the LDAEP and were independent of the analysis method used. These findings question the sensitivity of the LDAEP to acute changes in serotonin neurotransmission and its validity as a reliable measure of central serotonin function in humans...|$|R
40|$|Resveratrol, {{found in}} grape skins and red wine, has {{potential}} chemopreventive activity in vitro at concentrations ≥ 5 μM. This project explored the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of resveratrol in two clinical phase 1 studies. In vivo data {{were supported by}} in vitro studies designed to mimic the daily dosing protocol, using concentrations observed clinically. Forty healthy volunteers received 29 oral daily doses of 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 5 and 5. 0 g resveratrol and 20 colorectal cancer patients 8 oral daily doses of 0. 5 and 1. 0 g prior to surgical resection. The pharmacodynamics of resveratrol were assessed by measuring changes in plasma levels of proteins involved in the IGF system, oxidative DNA damage in whole blood and colorectal tissue (M 1 dG), effects on inflammatory pathways in plasma (PGE 2) and colorectal tissue (COX- 2), as well as colorectal tissue proliferation (Ki- 67). No serious adverse events were reported. In volunteers, mean peak plasma levels of resveratrol across the dose groups ranged from 44. 7 - 954 ng/mL (0. 20 - 4. 20 μM), and for the main metabolite, resveratrol- 3 -sulfate, were 4 - 13 fold-higher. Despite low systemic bioavailability, resveratrol concentrations associated with potential chemopreventive efficacy were observed in colorectal tumour tissue {{with a mean of}} 44. 0 nmol/g detected in patients receiving the 1. 0 g dose (range 0. 30 - 195 nmol/g). Post dosing, IGF- 1 levels were reduced by 8 % (P= 0. 03) in volunteers and by 33 % (P< 0. 001) in colorectal cancer patients. In tissue, a reduction in cell proliferation of 5. 5 % (P= 0. 05) was observed, whilst there was an increase in COX- 2 staining (P= 0. 004). Apart from the 2. 5 g dose in volunteers, where a significant increase was observed in blood M 1 dG (21. 6 %, P= 0. 02), resveratrol did not significantly affect plasma PGE 2 or markers of DNA damage in either study. In cultured colon cancer cells, daily exposure to resveratrol was associated with increased antiproliferative activity compared to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> <b>dose,</b> supporting the indication that chronic administration may cause pharmacodynamic changes in humans. The work presented here suggests resveratrol has potential as a cancer chemopreventive agent and controlled clinical trials are now warranted.

A dose of 5 Sv (5 Gy) is considered approximately the LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of exposed population) for an acute exposure to radiation even with standard medical treatment. A dose higher than 5 Sv (5 Gy) brings an increasing chance of death above 50%. Above 7.5–10 Sv (7.5–10 Gy) to the entire body, even extraordinary treatment, such as bone-marrow transplants, will not prevent {{the death of the}} individual exposed (see Radiation poisoning).

Mean supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) decreased from 103 to 88 mm Hg (p < 0 · 0 l) among guanabenz patients and from 101 to 88 mm Hg (p < 0 · 0 l) among clonidinepatients who completed 6 months ofb. i. d. therapy. Clinically significant individual SDBP decreases occurred in 85 % of the guanabenz patients and in 83 % ofthe clonidinepatients after 6 months. Adverse effects. consistingprimarily ofdrowsiness. dry mouth. dizziness. and weakness. were similar in the two therapy groups. The responses obtained with guanabenz (b. i. d.) were maintained. along with a decrease in adverse effects, by an <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> daily <b>dose</b> of guanabenz during a second 6 months of therapy. Seventy-six per cent (13 / 17) of the patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by guanabenz alone after 8 weeks of therapy subsequently responded {{to a combination of}} guanabenz and hydrochlorothiazide. Similarly, 85 % (17 / 10) of the patients who failed to respond to clonidine alone subsequently responded to guanabenz either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.

40|$|Antenatal {{exposure}} to glucocorticoids, amnionitis, intraamniotic interleukin (IL) - 1 α, or endotoxin can improve postnatal lung function after preterm delivery. The relationship between early lung maturation and the dose {{and duration of}} a proinflammatory stimulus has not been evaluated. The effects of proinflammatory stimuli on fetal plasma cortisol also have not been evaluated. We hypothesized that intraamniotic endotoxin would induce early lung maturation in fetal sheep without increasing fetal cortisol. Intraamniotic injections of 1, 4, 20, or 100 mg of Escherichia coli 055 :β 5 endotoxin caused 2 -fold increases in compliance, 4 - to 5 -fold increases in lung gas volumes, and 20 -fold increases in alveolar saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) when given 7 d before preterm delivery at 125 d gestation. Animals treated with 20 mg endotoxin for treatment to delivery intervals of 5 h to 15 d had no significant elevations in cord plasma cortisol levels. Increases in Sat PC in lung tissue and alveolar washes were detected 2 d after endotoxin treatment and lung function improved 4 d after endotoxin treatment. Two doses of endotoxin given 3 and 7 d or 7 and 15 d before treatment resulted in lung maturation responses <b>equivalent</b> to <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> comparison groups without elevations in cortisol. Early lung maturation induced by intraamniotic endotoxin in fetal sheep occurred without an increase in fetal plasma cortisol, indicating that endotoxin promoted lung maturation by a mechanism independent of cortisol...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the developmental neurotoxic effects of low-dose exposure to ionizing radiation, alone or together with nicotine, during a defined critical period of neonatal brain development in mice.   Investigation of neurotoxic effects following fractionated or acute low-dose radiation, resembling the clinical situation during repeated CT scans or radiation delivered to non-target tissue during radiotherapy, and possible interaction effects with other agents, is of great importance for risk and safety evaluation. During mammalian brain development there are defined critical periods for induction of developmental neurotoxic effects. One of these critical periods is called the brain growth spurt (BGS) and involves extensive growth and maturation of the brain. It is known that neonatal exposure during the BGS to low doses of radiation, as well as nicotine, can {{have a negative impact}} on neonatal brain development, resulting in impaired cognitive function in the adult mouse.   The present studies have shown that developmental neurotoxicity following low-dose irradiation can be induced during the same critical period of brain development as previously has been shown for chemicals. The observed neurotoxicity was manifested as altered spontaneous behaviour and habituation capacity, independent of sex, as well as elevated levels of an Alzheimer-related neuroprotein in the adult mouse. Furthermore, fractionated dose regimes seem to be as potent for induction of neurotoxicity and behavioural disturbances as an <b>equivalent</b> <b>single</b> acute <b>dose.</b> The cholinergic system can be a target system for developmental neurotoxicity of ionizing radiation, either alone or in combination with the cholinergic agent nicotine. Co-exposure to ionizing radiation and nicotine exacerbated the behavioural disturbances and cholinergic system dysfunction observed in these studies. Further studies on developmental neurotoxic effects of low-dose neonatal irradiation and interaction with medical drugs and environmental pollutants are important for the field of radioprotection. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The first {{meningococcal}} serogroup C (MenC) conjugate vaccine was licensed in 1999 {{and introduced}} in the United Kingdom. Countries that have implemented the MenC vaccine since then in their national immunisation programmes use different schedules. Nevertheless, all involved countries seem to experience substantial declines {{in the incidence of}} MenC disease. Discussion Since 2001, the MenC conjugate vaccine has been implemented in the Netherlands by offering a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> to all children aged 14 months. Prior to the introduction of the vaccine into the national immunisation programme, a catch-up vaccination campaign was initiated in which a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of the MenC conjugate vaccine was offered to all children aged from 14 months up to and including 18 years. Since then, there has been no report of any case of MenC disease among immunocompetent vaccinees. Administration of a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of MenC conjugate vaccine after infancy could be beneficial considering the already complex immunisation schedules with large numbers of vaccinations {{in the first year of}} life. The present paper deals with the advantages and critical aspects of a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of the MenC conjugate vaccine. Summary A <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of MenC conjugate vaccine at the age of 14 months in combination with a catch up vaccine campaign appeared to be a successful strategy to prevent MenC disease in the Netherlands, thereby confirming that a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of the vaccine could sufficiently protect against disease. Nevertheless, this approach can only be justified in countries with a relatively low incidence of serogroup C meningococcal disease in the first year of life. Furthermore, a good surveillance programme is recommended for timely detection of vaccine breakthroughs and outbreaks among non-vaccinees, since long-term protection after a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> in the second year of life cannot currently be guaranteed. </p...|$|R
40|$|The murine dose of i. v. C. parvum (466 microgram) was {{compared}} with a <b>single,</b> low, human-equivalent <b>dose</b> of 70 microgram and with repeated weekly low doses. All treatments increased the antibody titre against C. parvum (CP). However, repeated doses stimulated a much higher titre than <b>single</b> <b>doses.</b> In all treated animals spleen weight peaked at 2 weeks and then fell. A <b>single</b> low <b>dose</b> caused a 3 -fold increase, a <b>single</b> high <b>dose</b> or multiple low doses a 6 -fold increase. Liver weight changes followed a similar pattern. Hepatosplenomegaly was prolonged by multiple doses. The effects of these treatments on Lewis tumour metastases were studied. A <b>single</b> high <b>dose</b> and a <b>single</b> low <b>dose</b> {{on the day of}} tumour implantation (Day 0) were equally effective at inhibiting pulmonary metastases. Repeated low doses starting on Day 0 were no more effective than a <b>single</b> <b>dose.</b> The effect of CP on survival after primary-tumour excision on Day 10 was observed. Low dose CP on Day 7 doubled the harmonic mean of survival time. Repeated doses were no more effective than a <b>single</b> <b>dose.</b> Low-dose prophylaxis up to 2 weeks before tumour significantly inhibited metastases. However, when repeated low-dose prophylaxis was combined with a <b>single</b> low <b>dose</b> on Day 0, the anti-metastatic effect was abrogated. This neutralization of the anti-metastatic effect of CP given on Day 0 was found to persist after a 13 -week treatment-free interval. Possible mechanisms for this phenomenon are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The effects'of a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> and of {{prolonged}} {{administration of}} glucocorticoids {{and of a}} <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of salbutamol, theophylline or propranolol on the rate of ethanol elimination and blood acetate concentration were examined in healthy male students. Mean ethanol elimination rate and mean blood acetate concentration were increased significantly after acute intake of glucocorticoids. After chronic administration of glucocorticoids, the rate of ethanol elimination was significantly increased, whereas blood acetate concentration showed a tendency to increase, but did not reach statistical significance. Changes were found neither in ethanol elimination rates nor in blood acetate levels after <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of salbutamol, theophylline and propranolol...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there have}} been reports of the results of {{treating}} trichomoniasis with metronidazole 2 g in a <b>single</b> <b>dose,</b> no randomised double-blind comparison of this treatment with a multiple-dose regimen has been reported. In such a comparison, 96 women were treated with metronidazole 2 g in a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> and 96 women with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for five days. Forty-eight of 52 women followed for 14 days after the <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> were cured, as were 61 of 66 women followed for 14 days after the start of the five-day regimen. These results compare favourably with previous reports. Side effects were trivial, and we recommend the <b>single</b> 2 -g <b>dose,</b> for it is effective, economical, and can be given under supervision in the clinic...|$|R
25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as {{mebendazole}} and albendazole are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These anthelminthics are administered in a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole {{can be given}} with a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a <b>single</b> <b>dose.</b> WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, pyrantel pamoate is also equally effective on ascaris. However, {{it has been reported}} that albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate are not entirely effective against T. trichiura with <b>single</b> oral <b>doses</b> in population-based control.|$|R
