5000|$|The bridge {{had been}} built in a {{difficult}} part of the rapids, and its drawspan was {{at an angle to}} the current, making the bridge hard for steamboats to clear. Many felt that the bridge had been intentionally constructed to interfere with steamboat traffic. On May 6, 1856, the steamer Effie Afton collided with the bridge after one of its paddles stopped. The crew were rescued, but the steamer caught fire, damaged the bridge, and sank. Steamboat companies sued to have the bridge dismantled. The M&M and the Rock Island Line hired Abraham Lincoln to defend the bridge. The case worked its way to the Supreme Court and was decided in the bridge's favor in 1862 during the Civil War. In the meantime, the M&M and Rock Island merged to become the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. [...] Durant took his earnings from the M&M merger to form a new company called the Union Pacific Railroad. Lincoln in doing research as private attorney visited M&M facilities and met with various M&M officials in Council Bluffs. When the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 gave Lincoln the power to decide the eastern terminus of the transcontinental he picked a location that was most favorable to his former clients. The case eventually ended in a hung jury, and was dismissed. The US Supreme Court eventually decided a subsequent suit in December 1862, and the bridge remained operational.The first bridge only lasted until 1866, at which time it was considered inadequate for the ever-increasing loads carried by the railroad. It was replaced by a heavier wooden structure that reused the original piers. In turn, this structure was replaced by an iron, twin deck bridge in 1872 that carried both a single rail line and a separate roadway. This bridge was at a new location on the western tip of Arsenal Island and the original bridge and rail line was abandoned. The relocation was driven by the federal government, which still owned the island and wished to redevelop it into an arsenal. The original bridge and rail line severed the property in two and this <b>development</b> <b>constraint</b> was removed by relocating the bridge to an extreme end of the island. The federal government jointly used this bridge for access with the railroad, giving rise to the current name - Government Bridge.|$|E

Speculation reverses the common intu-ition that elastic housing supply attenuates housing booms. Housing market frictions make land a more attractive speculative investment than housing. As a result, unde-veloped land both facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This insight explains the frequent housing booms and busts that coincide with high construction activity (e. g. Las Vegas, 2000 - 2010).

40|$|What is the problem? South Africa is richly {{endowed with}} biodiversity. However, as {{poverty and the}} demand for urban and {{agricultural}} land increases, habitat and consequently biodiversity are increasingly under threat. South Africa is a chronically water stressed country with between 500 m 3 and 1000 m 3 of water available per person per year. Surface water is heavily committed for use, water is imported from neighboring countries and groundwater sources are limited. As a result, water availability is predicted to be the greatest and most urgent <b>development</b> <b>constraint</b> facing South Africa (Turpie et al. 2008). The introduction of hundreds of species of non-native trees to South Africa has led to conversion of species-rich vegetation to single-species stands of trees. This poses a direct threat not only to biological diversity but to water security, the ecological functioning of natural systems and the productive use of land. It intensifies the impact of fires and floods and increases soil erosion. It is estimated that invasive alien plants have reduced South Africa's mean annual runoff by approximately 7 %. The need for water is further highlighted by the fact that water scarcity in developing countries is closely linked to th...|$|E

In urban areas in Latin America and the Caribbean, the poor are the most likely to both be seriously affected by crime violence and be held respon-sible for the crime and violence committed. This presents challenges for identifying successful urban-focused violence reduction interventions. This chapter first looks at categories of violence, introducing an urban violence roadmap. It then discusses the measurement, trends, and charac-teristics of urban violence. The third section examines the causes, costs, and consequences of the phenomenon, particularly among the urban poor.

40|$|This paper aims to {{estimate}} the impact that the London Heathrow <b>development</b> <b>constraints</b> have on the other airports in the area. Our hypothesis is that lower traffic in London Heathrow due to its limitations induces higher than expected growth in the other airports, and vice versa. To that purpose, this paper introduces a two-stage innovative methodology {{to estimate}} this phenomenon that we called "spillover effect". We test this methodology on passenger traffic from 1990 to 2007, separating intercontinental from European traffic, the latter being also influenced by low-cost expansions. In the intercontinental case, preliminary {{results show that the}} highest spillover effect is that between London Heathrow and Gatwick, as one would expect. Interestingly, we also find a significant spillover effect between Heathrow and Manchester, proving that the impact of the Heathrow <b>development</b> <b>constraints</b> could be felt even further away from the London area. In the case of European traffic, after controlling for the low-cost growth at the other airports of the London area, we do not find any significant spillover effect. The main reason is that since low-cost carriers do not operate at Heathrow, its limitations could not affect their development in other airports...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{overall economic}} growth {{performance in the}} Arab world since the mid 1960 s, with the key objective of developing a better understanding about what drives the growth process in the Arab region. Growth in the region since 1985 has been rather disappointing, both relative to the best performers {{in the developing world}} as well as compared to the pre- 1985 period. Revitalizing growth in the Arab world would, therefore, suggests asking two pivotal questions: why has growth in the Arab world lagged behind those developing countries that could be taken to represent the frontier in terms of the development discourse (East Asia) ?, and why has growth been so erratic and unstable in the Arab world? To address these two questions, I estimate two growth models on the determinants of long-term growth and the persistence of growth, using global panel data drawn from more than 130 countries. Consistent with received wisdom, our results suggest that growth is associated with some broad fundamentals: effective institutions for protection of property rights, stable macroeconomic environment, adequate human capital and favorable initial conditions. In the Arab world, however, our results also show that growth does not happen without deliberate development strategies for exploiting (and/or overcoming) country-specific or regionspecific potentials (constraints).

The results show that the overall level of <b>development</b> <b>constraint</b> is relatively high, and that high-value regions (grades V-VIII) are mainly distributed in the upper and middle reaches of the basin.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{development}} problems of a particular category of developing countries, i. e., the developing small island state (SIS). The thesis seeks to establish their position within development theory emphasising the constraints that they confront in their development efforts. The main argument presented is that although small size is a <b>development</b> <b>constraint,</b> its effects are exacerbated by several other factors that are largely the result of not only size but also having a peripheral location and role within the global economy. A review and discussion of the literature relating to small states and SIS development is made focusing on the period following decolonisation when a plethora of Lilliputian states emerged. Their viability was questioned while more recently the emphasis has shifted to their vulnerability and to the need for sustainable development. Methodologically, the study identifies a range of problems commonly affecting SIS while through the use of statistical techniques a typology of SIS is identified. From this regional example, Zanzibar, the Comoros, the Maldives Seychelles and Mauritius are selected and an in depth comparative analysis is made. Through an historical approach, their post independence development experiences are analysed from which some important lessons are drawn. Focusing subsequently on Zanzibar, an empirical investigation is made focusing on its recent development experiences. The background to independence and the Revolution (1964) is analysed, identifying the socio-economic and political factors which have influenced its development before and after 1964. Three distinct phases are identified in post-Revolution Zanzibar. Though distinct from one another in their respective development strategies, they retain one common denominator, i. e.

40|$|Tuvalu is a {{small island}} {{developing}} state (SID) with least developed country (LDC) status. The island has gained international attention due to the threat to its land territory {{as a result of}} climate change and subsequent sea-level rises. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference, held in Copenhagen in December 2009, Tuvalu was described as being at serious risk of becoming the first state to become uninhabitable due to the impacts of climate change. The majority of climate change scientists agree that a key driver of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels, predominantly for energy production. Energy security is multifaceted and connections can be drawn between the energy demands of the wealthier, industrialised states and the less developed states that are experiencing the detrimental impacts of the meeting of these demands. For Tuvalu, the lack of access to adequate, affordable, reliable, safe and environmentally benign energy is a severe <b>development</b> <b>constraint.</b> Currently, Tuvalu is close to being a totally oil dependent economy (83 % of primary energy), whose energy security is dependent upon foreign aid to ensure its ability to pay international oil companies. Costs of all imported goods are exacerbated by its geographical isolation. This paper analyses the impact of international aid on energy security in Tuvalu and comments on the Tuvaluan Government’s commitment to 100 % renewable energy – “being carbon neutral” – by 2020. Although this is a commendable aspiration it is clear that even if Tuvalu were to end reliance on fossil fuels it would still be at risk of disastrous inundation unless the industrialised states radically reduce their own dependency on such fuels and dramatically reduce the global levels of greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{constraint}} {{through the}} thickness of a specimen effects the cyclic crack-tip-opening displacement (DELTA CTOD). DELTA CTOD is a valuable measure of crack growth behavior, indicating closure <b>development,</b> <b>constraint</b> variations and load history effects. Fatigue loading with a continual load reduction was used to simulate the load history associated with fatigue crack growth threshold measurements. The constraint effect on the estimated DELTA CTOD is studied by carrying out three-dimensional elastic-plastic finite element simulations. The analysis involves numerical simulation of different standard fatigue threshold test schemes to determine how each test scheme affects DELTA CTOD. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) prescribes standard load reduction procedures for threshold testing using either the constant stress ratio (R) or constant maximum stress intensity (K(sub max)) methods. Different specimen types defined in the standard, namely the compact tension, C(T), and middle cracked tension, M(T), specimens were used in this simulation. The threshold simulations were conducted with different initial K(sub max) values to study its effect on estimated DELTA CTOD. During each simulation, the DELTA CTOD was estimated at every load increment during the load reduction procedure. Previous numerical simulation {{results indicate that the}} constant R load reduction method generates a plastic wake resulting in remote crack closure during unloading. Upon reloading, this remote contact location was observed to remain in contact well after the crack tip was fully open. The final region to open is located at {{the point at which the}} load reduction was initiated and at the free surface of the specimen. However, simulations carried out using the constant Kmax load reduction procedure did not indicate remote crack closure. Previous analysis results using various starting K(sub max) values and different load reduction rates have indicated DELTA CTOD is independent of specimen size. A study of the effect of specimen thickness and geometry on the measured DELTA CTOD for various load reduction procedures and its implication in the estimation of fatigue crack growth threshold values is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematics}} of rattail fishes (Teleostei: Gadiformes, Macrouridae) is reexamined focussing on the Coryphaenoides {{group of}} genera, including Albatrossia, Lionurus, Chalinura and Nematonurus. The data matrix consists of 69 osteological characters {{based on personal}} observations, 17 characters, generally of the soft anatomy, from various published sources and 34 characters reported from peptide mapping of muscle-type lactate dehydrogenase. An evolutionary systematics of morphology requires, firstly, a historical concept of homology and secondly, a scientific basis for the recognition of patterns. Viewing the organism as a hierarchy of constraint, homology is a relationship of <b>development</b> <b>constraint</b> inherited by parts of organisms. Taxa are types, relationships of constraint inherited by organisms. If, from the morphological perspective, taxa are relationships not groups, conventional concepts of monophyly and related terms cannot apply to them. In practice they describe comparisons between trees. The creation/discovery of patterns {{is embedded in the}} practice of systematics and has its basis in the intelligent abilities of human beings. Morphology deals with the linguistic aspect of evolution, rather than with its dynamic genetic aspect. Dynamic and linguistic aspects are complementary yet incompatible. The scientific status of morphology is shown to rest on this principle of complementarity. Through cladistic analysis {{of a large number of}} published characters, I investigate the scenarios and relationships of gadiform fishes that have recently been proposed. The results of the rattail analysis are thus placed within the broader context of gadiform ecology and evolution. In cladistics, parsimony plays the role of Popper's-empirical concept of simplicity, as a method of estimating the hypothesis of highest empirical support. Assumptions are made about the likely pathways of evolution in the way the characters are coded. Original classifications of the Gadiformes and the Macrouridae are proposed. Within the gadiforms there is a general trend from jaw precision to jaw protrusion. An index of protrusion/precision shows a negative correlation with depth. Rattails show low values of the index indicating high jaw protrusion. However, within the family the trend is towards higher jaw precision, and the precision/protrusion index is positively correlated with maximum depth. The discovery of cartilage in the exoskeleton of rattail fishes was an unforeseen result of the method of preparation. In rattails alcian blue reveals hyaline cell cartilage at the margins of certain dermal elements where it is gradually replaced by bone...|$|E
