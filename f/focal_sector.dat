30|$|Like {{computerization}} and – {{in general}} – {{the introduction of}} ICT before – digitalization, robotization {{and the introduction of}} artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to increase the productivity in the sectors of application, thereby substituting for particular tasks, but possibly also requiring the introduction of new tasks to exploit complementarities. Because negative employment effects may hinder a DIS to unfold its transformative power, it is important to envisage not only the direct effects within a sector, but to consider in a holistic way the multi-sectorial interdependences. Generally, the introduction of productivity-enhancing technologies is lowering net employment in the <b>focal</b> <b>sector</b> of application (Rodrik, 2016). There will be technological unemployment, if this loss in jobs is not compensated by the creation of jobs elsewhere (Keynes, 1930). Without doubt, it is the ‘narrow focus’ on the (loss of jobs in the) sector of application which gives rise to anxiety about mass unemployment.|$|E
40|$|Fluorescein angiograms were {{performed}} {{on a group of}} low-tension glaucoma and chronic simple glaucoma patients with similar extent of visual field loss, under standardised conditions, to see whether differences attributable to chronic intraocular pressure elevation could be detected. There was no evidence for difference in circulation times between these two groups. There was no evidence that hypoperfusion of the peripapillary choroid contributed to optic nerve hypoperfusion. Low-tension glaucoma patients demonstrated <b>focal</b> <b>sector</b> hypoperfusion of the optic nerve in every case, while the chronic simple glaucoma patients demonstrated a wide range of optic nerve fluorescence, suggesting both focal and diffuse optic nerve head hypoperfusion. It was concluded that, while focal hypoperfusion of the optic nerve may reflect susceptible vasculature at the nerve head with or without intraocular pressure elevation, diffuse hypoperfusion suggested that prolonged intraocular pressure elevation may simultaneously affect the whole of the optic nerve head. This could be a direct effect on blood vessels or a mechanical effect with secondary vascular changes...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{is one of}} the {{cornerstones}} {{essential for}} human life, along with other services such as water and food. Understanding how the different services in the energy-water-food (EWF) nexus interact and are perceived by different actors is key to achieving sustainability. In this paper, we derive a model of the EWF nexus using fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM). Data were collected in a two-step approach from workshops with researchers and stakeholders involved in the three <b>focal</b> <b>sectors.</b> Four FCMs were developed; one for each of the EWF sectors, and one for the interactions that create the nexus between EWF. The FCM represents the combined views of the groups who participated in the workshops, the importance and limitations of which is discussed. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the aggregated FCM was applied to predict the impacts on the EWF nexus of four scenarios under which the United Kingdom would depart from the European Union (i. e. Brexit). The FCM indicated that energy-related concepts had the largest influence on the EWF nexus and that EWF demand will decrease most under a ‘hard-Brexit’ scenario. The demand for energy was shown to decline relatively less than other services and was strongly associated with gross domestic product (GDP), whereas UK population size had a stronger effect on water and food demand. Overall, we found a threefold change across all concepts in scenarios without freedom of movement, contribution to the EU budget, and increased policy devolution to the UK...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how institutional actors interpret, influence {{and respond to}} skills availability in the labour market for graduates. It researches and draws lessons from the Maltese experience of managing graduate employability over three decades, focusing on the three fastest-growing economic sectors, namely, Accountancy, Pharmachem and ICT, {{each of which is}} the subject of a case study. The study investigates the interaction of governments, firms, higher education institutions and professional associations in identifying skills shortages and gaps, as well as in devising policy frameworks and skills regimes at national, sectoral and corporate levels. Drawing upon theories of employability and employee skills, first, there is development of an analytical framework to examine how these institutional actors affect the labour market, which informs the analysis of the three case studies. The qualitative research involved an interpretative analysis of key policy documents related to graduate employability and seventy in-depth interviews with interlocutors positioned in strategic policy making, senior management, academic, expert and professional leadership roles within government, regulators, major corporations, higher education institutions, training providers and professional associations. The data was thematically analysed. Twelve key themes emerged from the in-depth interviews, which included the following: use of different language; the meaning of employability; the value of credentials; the role of the University; perceptions; expectations; competitiveness; modes of training provision; labour mobility; placements and incentives; collaboration and skills gap. The institutional actors across the three <b>focal</b> <b>sectors,</b> namely, accountancy, pharmachem and ICT tended to emphasise some themes more than others, these having previously been identified in scholarly literature (Appendix 1). Both patterns and inconsistencies emerged from a comparison of the accountancy, pharmachem and ICT sectors. In so far as the labour market is concerned, the study revealed a lack of technical skills and major non-technical graduate skills gaps, specifically, in the aspects of communication, teamwork and problem-solving. A number of professional characteristics or behaviours were also identified as lacking with Accountancy, Pharmachem and ICT graduates, namely, attitude, confidence, drive, professional outlook, independent working, personality fit and a ‘can do’ approach. The study revealed the absence of permanent systemic connections between the formulation of national and sectoral economic strategies on the one hand, and higher education and training policies on the other. Consequently, state higher education institutions have been responding reactively to labour market needs, which could explain the endemic skills gap which the study found. The study concludes by discussing limitations and limits to this research as well as recommending policy initiatives and further research that could contribute to the science and practice of public policy in this field. Key words: graduate employability, employability skills, skills gap, policy makers, labour marke...|$|R
40|$|Tea {{production}} and processing is a <b>focal</b> <b>sector</b> in the Kenyan agricultural sector with its' being the largest foreign exchange earner in the sector {{and thus a}} key contributor to the country's GDP. The tea sector is also a key employer with 150, 000 Kenyans employed and a key income source with over 600, 000 farmers. The Agriculture sector performed well from independence accounting for 40 % of GDP in 1963. Its significance in {{the economy has been}} declining over time accounting for 27. 3 % of the country's GDP in the year 2014 (KNBS, 2015) however despite the decline in significance, the sector remains the leading contributor ofGDP in Kenya. Tea was the second leading export commodity earner of the country contributing 20. 4 % of total export value in 2014 (KNBS, 2015). Kenya is the largest exporter of tea by volume producing 32 % of the world's tea exports volume in 2014 (Statista, 2015) and (Andae, 2015) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Non-State Actors (NSAs) is {{relatively}} new within the parlance of civil society organisations (CSOs) or Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) connotations. The term NSA emerged from the 2000 Cotonou Agreement which regulates the cooperation mechanism {{between the two groups}} of countries as it tries to expand the scope of coverage of definitions of CSOs and/or NGOs. Within this context, the place of NSAs in the socio-economic and political transformation of post-military Nigeria as from 1999 has become an issue of public discourse. On the one hand, government is wont to suspect the genuine intensions of civil CSOs whose claim to legitimacy looks tenuous in view of reported lack of transparency, accountability and internal democracy. On the other, the civil society groups accuse government of “hidden agenda” by surreptitiously excluding them from active involvement in development policy initiation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The need for partnership between the civil society and government is however underscored in various international instruments to which Nigeria subscribes. These include the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and the Cotonou Agreement of 2000. A pattern of tripartite cooperation among the government, external development-support funding agencies such as World Bank and the European Commission is evident in the emerging trends. However, without adequate capacity for constructive engagement of state actors and appreciable resources for collaborative initiatives, it is apparent that little or no success would come out of ongoing efforts to make NSAs critical partners in the development process. Broadly, this paper sets out to provide a sectoral study on the NSAs in Nigeria. This paper traces the emergence of NSAs as the broadening of sphere of civil society partnering with state actors within the particular framework of the Cotonou Agreement. It then analyses the strategic position of NSAs and the antecedents to current mutual distrust between state and NSAs. More specifically, the paper attempts a conceptual framework of relations between NSAs and government/donor agencies, the nature and structure of NSAs in Nigeria, and the roles or expected roles of NSAs in the political, social and economic development of the country. Relying mainly on secondary sources, it goes further to classify NSAs in Nigeria and undertakes a broad review of NGO activism based on their <b>focal</b> <b>sectors.</b> A review of emerging trends and implications for NSAs is then undertaken before projecting into the future of NSA participation in development in Nigeria. We supported some of the ideas with analysis of a sample database of NSAs developed by collating different database available in the country. The paper concludes with some recommendations. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To empirically {{investigate}} the impact of: institutional pressures; institutional logics; and institutional complexity; on Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) practices across mixed {{public and private}} sector supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Multi-case study data was collected from three tiers of food and catering supply chains: the customer/consumer tier; <b>focal</b> public <b>sector</b> UK Universities; and private sector suppliers / contractors. Findings: The findings indicate that: normative and mimetic pressures are more prevalent in focal Universities, compared to suppliers; there is typically no single dominant logic across these supply chains; and the multiplicity of institutional logics (e. g., sustainability logic versus financial logic) increases institutional complexity. Therefore, in the atypical case of homogeneity in terms of institutional pressures and logics, e. g. with a dominant sustainability logic throughout the supply chain, radical change in SSCM practices is facilitated. In contrast, in the more typical case when there is heterogeneity, with competing logics at different supply chain tiers, this limits SSCM to more incremental changes in practices. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to three tiers {{of the food and}} catering supply chains of UK Universities. Practical implications: To aid in the successful implementation of SSCM, this study suggests a need for managers to develop an initial understanding of the prevailing institutional logics and pressures at different tiers of the supply chain. Social implications: A number of the SSCM practices studied address social sustainability. Originality/value: No previous studies have empirically investigated the impact of institutional complexity in the context of SSCM practices across supply chains, involving both mixed public and private sector organisations...|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} using the fovea to Bruch's membrane opening (FoBMO) axis as the nasal-temporal midline for 30 ° sectoral (clock-hour) spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) optic nerve head (ONH) minimum rim width (MRW) and area (MRA) calculations. The internal limiting membrane and BMO were delineated within 24 radial ONH B-scans in 222 eyes of 222 participants with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. For each eye the fovea was marked within the infrared reflectance image, the FoBMO angle (θ) relative to the acquired image frame (AIF) horizontal was calculated, the ONH was divided into 30 ° sectors using a FoBMO or AIF nasal/temporal axis, and SDOCT MRW and MRA were quantified within each FoBMO vs. AIF sector. For each <b>sector,</b> <b>focal</b> rim loss was calculated as the MRW and MRA gradients (i. e. {{the difference between the}} value for that sector and the one clockwise to it divided by 30 °). Sectoral FoBMO vs. AIF discordance was calculated as the difference between the FoBMO and AIF values for each sector. Generalized estimating equations were used to predict the eyes and sectors of maximum FoBMO vs. AIF discordance. The mean FoBMO angle was - 6. 6 ± 4. 2 ° (range: - 17 ° to + 7 °). FoBMO vs. AIF discordance in sectoral mean MRW and MRA was significant for 7 of 12 and 6 of 12 sectors, respectively (p< 0. 05, Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction). Eye-specific, FoBMO vs. AIF sectoral discordance was predicted by sectoral rim gradient (p< 0. 001) and FoBMO angle (p< 0. 001) and achieved maximum values of 83 % for MRW and 101 % for MRA. Using the FoBMO axis as the nasal-temporal axis to regionalize the ONH rather than a line parallel to the AIF horizontal axis significantly influences clock-hour SDOCT rim values. This effect is greatest in eyes with large FoBMO angles and <b>sectors</b> with <b>focal</b> rim loss...|$|R
