5|$|The cloudy {{catshark}} feeds {{primarily on}} molluscs, followed by crustaceans and bony fishes. A predator of both this shark and its egg cases is the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). A known parasite {{of this species}} is the myxosporidian Chloromyxum scyliorhinum. Reproduction is oviparous; adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts. As a prelude to mating, the male bites at the female's pectoral fin, side, and gill region. Once he has a grip, he wraps his body around hers and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation may last between 15 seconds and 4 minutes. The claspers of the male are unusual in that each has a row of around a hundred hooks running along the <b>inner</b> <b>margin.</b> These hooks likely serve to anchor the male to the female during copulation. The female is capable of storing sperm within her nidamental gland (an organ that secretes egg cases) for many months.|$|E
5|$|The molars are high-crowned (hypsodont) and planar, {{with the}} main cusps {{as high as the}} crests {{connecting}} them, a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the anteroloph on the first upper molar, the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar, and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two—the posteroflexid on the lower second molar and the entoflexid on the lower third molar—are closed by a wall, or cingulum, at the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: yellow, {{variable}} in tint from sulphur to rich lemon yellow according to locality {{with a light}} or heavy rainfall. Forewing: apex and termen deep black, this colour continued narrowly along the costal margin to base of wing, near which it often becomes diffuse; the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of the black area from costa to vein 4 very oblique and irregular, between veins 2 and 4 excavate on the inner side, this excavation outwardly rounded between the veins and inwardly toothed on vein 3; below vein 2 the black area is suddenly dilated into a square spot which occupies {{the whole of the}} tornal angle; the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of this dilatation is variable, in the typical form slightly concave. Hindwing: terminal margin with a narrow black band which is attenuated anteriorly and posteriorly; dorsal margin broadly paler than the ground colour.|$|E

25|$|The {{underside}} {{is black}} with {{and on the}} base of the cell in the forewing is an elongate spot of dark red; the postdiscal transverse series of streaks as on the upperside but grey tinged with ochraceous and extended right up to the costa; in some specimens similar but narrow streaks also in the cell. Hindwing with five irregular small patches of red at base, the outer three-fourths of the wing grey touched with ochraceous, but generally narrower than the blue on the upperside; the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of the grey area crosses the wing beyond the cell; the postdiscal and subterminal black spots as on the upperside. In some specimens this grey area is greatly restricted, its <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> crossing the wing well beyond the apex of the cell; the subterminal spots merged completely with the terminal spots and form a comparatively broad terminal black band. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen blackish brown.|$|E
25|$|Upperside of {{both sexes}} brown of varying depths of colour. Forewing: cell with one pair of subbasal and one pair of apical {{transverse}} sinuous fasciae, the outermost defining the discocellulars; a short, broad, dark, oblique fascia beyond to vein 4, its <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> diffuse, its outer sinuous but sharply defined; below vein 4 a sinuous, transverse, more faint fascia, followed by a discal blackish fascia, very broad and diffuse, below costa, bordered by a row of faint ocelli, and a postdiscal and a subterminal similar fascia following {{the outline of the}} termen. Hindwing with a slender blackish loop near apex of cellular area; a broad inwardly diffuse, outwardly well-defined short discal fascia in continuation of the one on the forewing; a series of postdiscal somewhat ochraceous ocelli with black pupils minutely centred with white; postdiscal and subterminal broad lines as on the forewing.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: ground colour {{similar but}} of a {{slightly}} paler shade in all the specimens I have seen. Forewing: costal and terminal margins edged more broadly with black than in thetis, the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of this colour forms a regular strongly curved arch from base of wing to tornus, not angulate at all opposite apex of wing, the edging of the costal margin not jagged on the inner side. Hindwing: the costal margin not pale but somewhat broadly dusky black; the terminal black edging broader than in thetis, not linear, produced for a very short distance up each vein. The irroration of dusky scales at the bases of both forewings and hindwings and along the dorsal area of the hindwing heavier and more broadly diffused, especially on the latter. Underside: as in the typical form. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen similar.|$|E

25|$|This species resembles Papilio palinurus, but {{the male}} {{generally}} has, on the upperside {{of the outer}} half of the forewing, cottony or hairy scent-streaks {{similar to those in}} Papilio polyctor, only the streak in interspace 1 is always missing. Other differences are seen in the upper wing. The forewing has the discal transverse bluish-green band slightly sinuous, narrower, more curved than in P. palinurus and more distinctly decreasing in width towards the costal margin; in the female it is more sinuous than in the male. The hindwing has the transverse bluish-green band very variable in width but the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> is much straighter than in P. polyctor; this band that in P. polyctor stops short of vein 7, continues to the costal margin, it is however much and abruptly narrowed above vein 7; tornal ocellus claret-red with a large black centre inwardly edged with blue; the bright ochraceous subapical lunule of P. polyctor replaced by a dull whitish spot; the subterminal diffuse green lunules restricted to interspaces 2,3 and 4; the spatular apex of the tail with a small patch of bluish-green scales.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} measures [...] {{and most}} of the folios were originally gathered into quires of eight leaves each. In modern times it was rebound into sets of six leaves each. The material is thin, fine, and very beautiful vellum, often discoloured at the edges, which have been damaged by age and more so through the ignorance or carelessness of the modern binder, who has not always spared the text, especially at the upper <b>inner</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|E
500|$|The peristome of N. rajah has {{a highly}} {{distinctive}} scalloped edge and is greatly expanded, forming an attractive red lip around the trap's mouth. [...] A series of raised protrusions, known as ribs, intersect the peristome, ending in short, sharp teeth that line its <b>inner</b> <b>margin.</b> The inner {{portion of the}} peristome accounts for around 80% of its total cross-sectional surface length in this species. Two fringed wings run from the tendril attachment to the lower edge of the peristome.|$|E

500|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare is {{a medium-sized}} hare, measuring [...] in length, and weighing [...]The skull is [...] long, {{and the head}} is mottled tawny, similar to the back, with whitish chin, tawny nape, and cinnamon tinged lips. A few individuals have white eye-rings. It has medium-sized ears measuring [...] in length, with the upper quarter being black, and the outer surface having white fringe hairs at the outer margin, and wide, whitish or buff colored fringe hairs at the <b>inner</b> <b>margin,</b> except at the tip. In a few hares, the black color of the upper quarter extends along the inner surface's <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> and along the outer surface's outer margin, reaching up {{to the base of}} the ear. It has grizzled, buff white dorsal pelage which is spotted and streaked with black. The dorsal hairs are [...] long, and have whitish gray bases, with black, wide subterminal bands, white terminal bands, and black tips. The ventral pelage is pure white and fluffy. The flanks have pale gray hairs at the base, with buff or whitish subterminal band, and black or white tips. The lower flanks are cinnamon russet, with white hairs having cinnamon tips. The underparts are white, and the rump is gray. The nuchal patch is brightcinnamon or reddish brown in color, and does not extend to the neck-sides. It has gray or grayish white, denseunderfur. It has a [...] medium-sized tail which is completely white for that occurring in the Shoa Province, and white with a mid-dorsal black stripe for that occurring in the Bale Mountains.The feet are densely padded with brown hairs.The forelimbs are long, pale cinnamon colored.

500|$|Like that of {{all other}} ceratopsids, the skull of Achelousaurus had a parietosquamosal frill or [...] "neck shield", which was formed by the parietal bones at the rear and the squamosal bones at the sides. The parietal {{is one of the}} main bones used to {{distinguish}} centrosaurine taxa from each other and resolve relationships between them, whereas the squamosal is very similar across taxa. In Achelousaurus, the squamosal bone was much shorter than the parietal. Of its <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> the rear portion formed a step in relation to the front part, with the suture between the squamosal and the parietal showing a kink to behind at the level of the rear supratemporal fenestra, a typical centrosaurine trait. The squamosal and the jugal bone, by touching each other, excluded the quadratojugal from the edge of the lateral temporal fenestra, i.e. the opening at the rear of the skull side.|$|E
2500|$|Epermeniidae {{are small}} narrow-winged moths, 7-20mm. in wingspan, with {{conspicuous}} whorls of bristles on their legs, lacking spines on the abdomen unlike some similar moths. The smoothly scaled head bears no ocelli or [...] "chaetosemata". They can be most easily confused with Stathmopodinae (Oecophoridae), which unlike epermeniids have the tarsi of the forelegs and midlegs without the whorls of spines, and whose proboscis is scaled {{at the base}} (Robinson et al., 1994, for further details). The projecting scale tufts on the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of the hindwing is the easiest field character (Common, 1990).|$|E
50|$|The {{forewings}} are black, but orange yellow {{from the}} base to beyond the middle. The hindwings are orange yellow, the apex, outer margin and anal angle broadly bordered with black, and with several black spots along the costal and <b>inner</b> <b>margins.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 30 mm. Adults are completely white, {{except for the}} black compound eyes and some brown hairs along the <b>inner</b> <b>margins</b> of the forewings. The abdomen starts white, but often becomes black. There is a yellow tuft on {{the tail of the}} females.|$|R
2500|$|The {{wingspan}} {{ranges from}} [...] with females being the larger sex. Southern individuals {{are larger than}} northern ones. Males are yellow with four black [...] "tiger stripes" [...] on each forewing. The {{outer edge of the}} forewing is black with a row of yellow spots. The veins are marked with black. The postmedian area of the hindwing is black with yellow spots along the margin. The <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of the hindwing has small red and blue spots. The ventral forewing margin has a yellow bar that is broken into spots. This broken bar is present in both sexes, and is used to distinguish P. glaucus from its close relatives.|$|E

2500|$|Rosette {{and lower}} {{pitchers}} are variable in shape: {{they are usually}} wholly ovate or , but may also be [...] They grow up to 15cm high by 6cm wide, but are often considerably smaller. A pair of wings up to 12mm wide runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. These wings bear [...] fringe elements up to 10mm long. The pitcher mouth is oval to circular and up to 6cm across. It rises at the rear to form a conspicuous neck. The peristome is cylindrical to slightly flattened and up to 2cm wide {{for most of its}} length, becoming broader towards the neck (≤2.5cm wide). It bears ribs up to 2mm high and spaced up to 2mm apart, which terminate in teeth (≤4mm long) on the peristome's <b>inner</b> <b>margin.</b> The digestive zone of the inner surface usually extends for around two-thirds of the pitcher's height, although some specimens may be wholly glandular. The pitcher lid or operculum is elliptic and measures up to 5.5cm in length by 3.5cm in width. It lacks appendages or a keel. A spur is inserted near the base of the lid. It measures up to 9mm in length, with a basal diameter of up to 3mm, although it may be much smaller.|$|E

2500|$|Rosette, {{lower and}} {{intermediate}} pitchers remain unknown {{as they do}} not form part of the examined herbarium material. Upper pitchers are subcylindrical with an ellipsoid base. They measure [...] 16.4cm in height by 5.5cm in width. They are broadest in the basal portion, becoming slightly constricted in the middle (4.1 cm wide), and expanding again to around 5cm below the peristome. Sessile glands {{similar to those found}} on the stem are also present on the exterior of the upper pitchers, where they occur at a density of 3–4 per mm². In these aerial traps the wings are reduced to a pair of ridges on the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. The pitcher mouth is [...] and has an oblique insertion. It measures around 6cm by 4cm. The peristome is cylindrical in cross section and slightly lobed, with tightly infolded inner and outer margins. It is rather narrow, measuring only 2.5–4mm in diameter. The peristome bears low ribs only 0.1mm high. These are tightly packed, occurring at a density of two per millimetre. The <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> of the peristome lacks conspicuous teeth. The peristome is elongated into a short neck and here the apertures of the marginal nectar glands are clearly visible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} generously scaled [...] letter forms vary between 0.3 and 0.4cm in height, lines are spaced {{approximately}} 0.5cm apart, {{and there is}} a margin of 2cm at the top. It can be determined that there were eighteen lines to a page. C. H. Roberts commented: [...] ".. to judge from the spacing {{and the size of the}} text, it is unlikely that the format was affected by considerations of economy". There are no apparent punctuation marks or breathings shown in the fragment; but the diaeresis is applied to an initial iota at both the second line of the recto and the second line of the verso; and possibly too on the first line of the recto. Taken together with the over-scaled writing, this suggests that the manuscript may have been intended for congregational reading. If the original codex did indeed contain the entire text of the canonical Gospel of John, it would have constituted a single quire book of around 130 pages (i.e. 33 large folded papyrus sheets written on both sides); measuring approximately 21 by 20cm when closed. Roberts noted a glued vertical join in the papyrus slightly inside the <b>inner</b> <b>margin</b> and visible on the verso, indicating that the large sheets used for the codex were likely to have been specially prepared for the purpose, each having been constructed from two standard sized sheets measuring approximately 21cm by 16cm, with a central narrower sheet approximately 21cm by 8cm constituting the spine. Roberts describes the handwriting as [...] "heavy, rounded and rather elaborate", but nevertheless not the work of [...] "a practised scribe" [...] (i.e. not a professional bookhand). [...] Roberts notes comments that had recently been made by the editors of the Egerton Gospel (P.Egerton 2); and says similarly it could be said of 52 that it [...] "has a somewhat informal air about it and with no claims to fine writing is yet a careful piece of work".|$|E
