5|$|In the {{southern}} part of Asia including Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, crickets are commonly eaten as a snack, prepared by deep frying the soaked and cleaned insects. In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, with an estimated production of 7,500 tons per year and United Nation's FAO has implemented a project in Laos to improve cricket farming and consequently food security. The <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) is 1.7, some five times higher than that for beef cattle, and if their fecundity is taken into account, 15 to 20 times higher.|$|E
5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|E
5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US.

40|$|Individual growth rates, {{feeding rates}} (%BWd− 1) and <b>food</b> <b>conversions</b> for {{cuttlefish}} (S. officinalis) hatchlings and juveniles were determined during this study. A flow-through system was used. Water temperature reached 30 °C during the hottest {{part of the}} day, gradually decreasing to 25 °C during the night; salinity varied between 37 ± 3 ppt and lights were kept on for 14 h day− 1. Hatchlings were placed in separate compartments with a water volume of 1. 2 L. Juvenile cuttlefish (from 0. 5 to 25 g) were placed in bigger baskets, with a water volume of 5. 2 L. Water flow was 120 L h− 1. The biggest cuttlefish used in these experiments (> 25 g) were gathered in groups of five and placed in circular tanks (water volume of 250 – 300 L). Thus, results obtained in this case are means and not individual data. During the first 10, 20, 30 and 40 days, mean growth rates (of all individuals sampled by age group) decreased consistently (11. 8 ± 4. 1, 9. 8 ± 1. 8, 8. 1 ± 2. 2 and 7. 3 ± 0. 7 %BW− 1 respectively); in similar fashion, mean feeding rates decreased with age group (33. 7 ± 13. 5, 22. 0 ± 7. 9, 17. 3 ± 3. 9 and 16. 7 %BWd− 1 respectively). Mean <b>food</b> <b>conversions</b> varied between 3. 6 and 2. 5 between the age groups. When grouping results by weight class, similar patterns occur, as growth and feeding rates decrease consistently as cuttlefish grow bigger. Highest mean growth and feeding rates are obtained by hatchlings (< 0. 1 g) with 12. 4 ± 4. 5 and 35. 3 ± 15. 1 %BWd− 1, respectively, while the lowest growth and feeding rates were recorded for the largest animals, between 15 and 25 g (3. 4 ± 1. 1 and 10. 8 ± 4. 1 %BWd− 1 respectively).

25|$|Insects {{generally}} {{have a higher}} <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency than more traditional meats, measured as efficiency of conversion of ingested food, or ECI. While many insects can have an energy input to protein output ratio of around 4:1, raised livestock has a ratio closer to 54:1.

Additionally endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates need to use a significantly greater amount of energy just to stay warm whereas ectothermic (cold blooded) plants or insects do not. An index which can be used as a measure is the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance: for example, only 10% of ingested food is converted to body substance by beef cattle, versus 19–31% by silkworms and 44% by German cockroaches. Studies concerning the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) provide further evidence for the efficiency of insects as a food source. When reared at 30°C or more and fed a diet of equal quality to the diet used to rear conventional livestock, crickets showed a <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> twice as efficient as pigs and broiler chicks, four times that of sheep, and six times higher than steers (oxen) when losses in carcass trim and dressing percentage are counted.|$|E

40|$|The {{intake of}} the dry matter (DM), the crude protein (CP) and the metabolizable energy intake (ME) in megacalories per day (Mcal/day) were not {{affected}} by the diets. In contrast, the intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), in g/kg BW, increased linearly. An increasing linear effect was also observed for the ether extract (EE) intake, whereas a decreasing linear performance was observed for the non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) intake. The digestibility of DM, organic matter and NFC decreased linearly with the sunflower cake inclusion, whereas the digestibility of CP, NDF, and EE were not influenced by the diets. No effect was observed for the concentration of serum glucose or urea nitrogen serum. No effect was observed on the urea nitrogen serum in the hours after feeding; however, including sunflower cake in the diets resulted in a quadratic performance for the serum glucose concentrations in the hours after feeding.

40|$|Abstract. -"Shrinkage, " or unaccounted-for {{losses of}} fish during cage rearing, is widely {{acknowledged}} among fish culturists who rear salmonid fishes, but {{the extent of}} such losses has not been documented. Over 60, 000 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were reared in floating cages at four locations in Puget Sound, Washington, and were hand-counted {{at the beginning and}} end of 200 + d of rearing. Average unexplained losses were 8 - 38 % for individual locations (three to four cages each) and 2. 5 - 46. 5 % for individual cages. When cage netting remains intact, unexplained losses are probably the result of decomposition of carcasses (particularly during disease outbreaks); scavenging by birds, mammals, and fishes; and to a lesser extent, escapes. The economic consequences of losing fish can be important in terms of lost harvest and increased food costs, resulting in true <b>food</b> <b>conversions</b> 10 - 68 % higher than anticipated. It is widely known among commercial fish culturists that when fishes are held within nets in a body of water, a certain portion of fish assumed to be in cages disappears. Though this unexplained loss of fishes has been recognized for decades (Institute of Fisheries Economics 1971; Kennedy 1975; Secretan 1979), it has never been accurately documented.
