25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews.

On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>world.</b> The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E

His expedition to Redcastle had convinced him that the young lady lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>world,</b> entirely beyond his reach, and in the reaction of his hopelessness, he had thrown himself into the excitement of the mission, and it had worked on him a zealous purpose to dedicate himself totally to a religious life, giving up all worldly aims, and employing the small capital he could call his own in preparing for the ministry.
