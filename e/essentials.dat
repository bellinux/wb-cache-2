Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security <b>Essentials</b> 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings.

Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks personal firewall and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability.

40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} <b>essential</b> genes {{is important}} in many aspects of biology, medicine and bioengineering. In previous research, we have developed a machine learning based integrative algorithm to predict <b>essential</b> genes in bacterial species. This algorithm lends itself to two approaches for predicting <b>essential</b> genes: learning the traits from known <b>essential</b> genes in the target organism, or transferring <b>essential</b> gene annotations from a closely related model organism. However, for an understudied microbe, each approach has its potential limitations. The first is constricted by the often small number of known <b>essential</b> genes. The second {{is limited by the}} availability of model organisms and by evolutionary distance. In this study, we aim to determine the optimal strategy for predicting <b>essential</b> genes by examining four microbes with well-characterized <b>essential</b> genes. Our results suggest that, unless the known <b>essential</b> genes are few, learning from the known <b>essential</b> genes in the target organism usually outperforms transferring <b>essential</b> gene annotations from a related model organism. In fact, the required number of known <b>essential</b> genes is surprisingly small to make accurate predictions. In prokaryotes, when the number of known <b>essential</b> genes is greater than 2 % of total genes, this approach already comes close to its optimal performance. In eukaryotes, achieving the same best performance requires over 4 % of total genes, reflecting the increased complexity of eukaryotic organisms. Combining the two approaches resulted in an increased performance when the known <b>essential</b> genes are few. Our investigation thus provides key information on accurately predicting <b>essential</b> genes and will greatly facilitate annotations of microbial genomes...|$|R

40|$|Citrus peel <b>essential</b> oils are {{considered}} to constitute the most important resistance factor of citrus fruits against fruit flies. <b>Essential</b> oils were obtained from three sweet orange varieties, one bitter orange and one lemon variety. Yield, chemical composition and toxicity against neonates of the Mediterranean fruit fly were determined. Based on chemical analysis, the toxicity of commercially purchased major and minor components (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) of <b>essential</b> oils was determined. In addition, fractions were prepared to evaluate the role of minor components in the toxicity of crude <b>essential</b> oils. Limonene {{was by far the}} most abundant ingredient (96. 2 - 97. 4 %) in all sweet orange varieties and in bitter orange, while the concentration of limonene was much lower in lemon <b>essential</b> oils (74. 3 %). Orange and bitter orange <b>essential</b> oils were more toxic than lemon <b>essential</b> oils. The toxicity of orange and bitter orange <b>essential</b> oils was similar to that of their major component limonene. In tests of commercially purchased chemicals, the oxygenated components of <b>essential</b> oils were more toxic than hydrocarbons but their low concentration in citrus <b>essential</b> oils could not affect the toxic activity of <b>essential</b> oils. The presence of alpha-pinene and beta-pinene seems to account for the lower toxicity of lemon <b>essential</b> oils in relation to other citrus <b>essential</b> oils.
