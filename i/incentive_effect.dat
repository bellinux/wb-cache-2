2500|$|As wages {{increase}} {{above the}} subsistence level (discussed below), {{there are two}} considerations affecting a worker's choice of how many hours to work per unit of time (usually day, week, or month). The first is the substitution or <b>incentive</b> <b>effect.</b> With wages rising, the tradeoff between working an additional hour for pay and taking one extra hour of unpaid time changes in favor of working. Thus, more hours of labour-time will be offered at the higher wage than the lower one. The second and countervailing effect is that the hours worked at the old wage rate now all gain more income than before, creating an income effect, which encourages more leisure to be chosen {{because it is more}} affordable. Most economists assume that unpaid time (or [...] "leisure") is a normal good and so people want more of it as their incomes (or wealth) rise. Since a rising wage rate raises incomes, all else constant, the attraction of unpaid time rises, eventually neutralising the substitution effect and causing the backward bend.|$|E

50|$|An {{incentive}} system is thought of inducing two important effects: an <b>incentive</b> <b>effect</b> and a sorting effect. Incentive effects are direct effects {{resulting from the}} {{incentive system}} that improve performance. Sorting effects are rather indirect effects. They describe that individuals with particular characteristics may be attracted to particular incentive systems. For instance, higher skilled individuals are rather attracted to variable than fixed compensation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of pension {{systems are}} usually {{estimated}} {{under the assumption}} that the institutional environment provides a single optimal 'pathway' for retirement. However, many countries provide competing pathways which may include several early retirement options in addition to normal retirement. Moreover, early retirement options often comprise special provisions for disabled and unemployed workers that can be strategically manipulated by the employer and the employee while ultimate eligibility for such provisions is uncertain in advance. This paper shows that ignoring the endogeneity and/or uncertainty in the relevant institutional setting can severely bias the estimates of <b>incentive</b> <b>effects.</b> Ignoring the endogeneity leads to overestimated <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> that unduly exaggerate the 'pull' view of early retirement. In turn, when the uncertain option set is specified too generously, <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> are underestimated. The paper proposes several estimates to bound the true <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of social security on early retirement, and applies them to the German public pension system. ...|$|R
40|$|Employee stock bonuses (ESBs) and {{employee}} stock options (ESOs) are {{the means for}} high-technology companies in Taiwan to reward their employees. This research connects the Ohlson (1995) model and Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) model to investigate these effects of ESBs and ESOs, respectively, for a sample of high-technology companies in Taiwan. I generate two empirical generalizations. (1) The <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of ESBs are significantly associated with performance, thus enhancing firm value; in addition, the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of ESBs are greater than the dilution <b>effects.</b> (2) The <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of ESOs are also significantly associated with performance, whereas the dilution effects of ESOs are insignificant. Although evidence supports the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of providing ESOs and ESBs, it is debatable whether ESOs and ESBs dilute shareholders' equity.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of taxes, previous studies may {{give the impression}} that the impact on capital intensity of converting an income tax to either a consumption or wage tax depends solely on the difference in such <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> on the representative person. This paper shows that tax conversion may also alter capital intensity by shifting disposable income from low to high savers.

50|$|As the {{probability}} of default is higher when debt is higher, there exists a level of lending that maximises expected return to the lender, and so the credit ceiling will depend on {{the probability}} of default. If desired lending is higher than the credit ceiling, some countries will not receive funds, and credit rationing will occur. This setting is reminiscent of Stiglitz and Weiss, as the interest rate has an <b>incentive</b> <b>effect,</b> and does not play the standard allocational role prices are supposed to play. As in that case, the allocation mechanism in Eaton and Gersovitz is credit rationing, which is not related to interest rate (the price of credit); at the going rate, countries want to borrow more but credit is denied.|$|E
5000|$|Another problem {{relates to}} {{what is known as}} the [...] "compression of ratings". Two related influences—centrality bias, and {{leniency}} bias—have been documented (Landy and Farr 1980, Murphy and Cleveland 1991). The former results from supervisors being reluctant to distinguish critically between workers (perhaps for fear of destroying team spirit), while the latter derives from supervisors being averse to offering poor ratings to subordinates, especially where these ratings are used to determine pay, not least because bad evaluations may be demotivating rather than motivating. However, these biases introduce noise into the relationship between pay and effort, reducing the <b>incentive</b> <b>effect</b> of performance-related pay. Milkovich and Wigdor (1991) suggest that this is the reason for the common separation of evaluations and pay, with evaluations primarily used to allocate training.|$|E

However, the quota of families to receive these subsidies in each community is usually limited and the money typically arrives very late, which greatly reduces the <b>incentive</b> <b>effect.</b> Subsidies in money and kind are also given for other crops (coffee, organic vegetables, and saplings for timber plantations), but {{are subject to the}} same limitations. Inputs have also been given for minor animal husbandry projects. Numerous small economic projects for particular communities have been implemented with a low success rate, as little participatory planning was practised, and there has been little training of community members in the management of such projects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> on firm’s capital structure and default risk. Applying the measure of default probability in Bharath and Shumway (2008), we estimate the default probability for the public firms in the U. S. We focus on {{the impact of the}} <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of stock-based compensation for top managers of each firm. The empirical results show that firms reduce their debt financing when they grant more stock to their executives. In addition, the results also show that the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> would reduce the default probability directly after controlling the indirect impact of capital structure. Finally, only the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> from the executive’s stock holding, however, do have a significant influence on capital structure and default probability. Because there is rare evidence in the literature on the impact of executive compensation on default risk, we contribute to the existing literature by providing the related empirical evidence on this issue. 本文利用 Bharath and Shumway (2008) 所提出之衡量違約機率的簡化模 型，估計美國公開上市公司的違約機率，藉此探討公司經理人誘因效果對資 本結構與違約風險的影響。實證結果顯示經理人持有公司的股數愈多，較易 降低公司對外舉債的程度，經理人為了減少公司所面對的總風險與減緩還債 壓力等原因，進而減少對外舉債的程度。值得一提的是在資本結構調整的過 程當中，本文的實證結果發現經理人誘因效果，除了可透過影響資本結構， 進而間接降低違約風險外，其對違約風險亦存在直接顯著的負向影響。最 後，經理人薪酬的誘因效果對資本結構與違約風險的影響，主要來自公司股 票持有的部分，並非來自股票選擇權的薪酬，此實證結果可彌補現有文獻上 的不足，並提供往後相關研究議題的參考...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} literature demonstrates two opposite opinions {{regarding the}} <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of executive stock options (ESOs) on managerial risk taking (such as innovative activities). The management literature shows that various corporate innovations {{are associated with}} different level of risk.

We find that the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of ESOs are significantly and positively associated with corporate innovative activities, with or without taking into account of the endogeneity. In addition, the risk-taking incentives of ESOs in old economy firms are not as significant as those in new economy firms, somehow explaining why some prior studies question the <b>incentive</b> <b>effects</b> of ESOs on managerial risk taking...|$|R

On the contrary, the wealth <b>incentive</b> <b>effect</b> provided by managerial shareholdings decreases the hedging likelihood.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} analysis {{considers the}} impact of a typical system of redistributive "fiscal equalization" transfers on the taxing effort of local jurisdictions. More specifically, it shows that the marginal contribution rate, i. e. the rate at which an increase in the tax base is reducing those transfers, might be positively associated with the local tax rate while the volume of grants received is likely to be inversely related to the tax base. These predictions are tested in an empirical analysis of the tax policy of German municipalities. In order to identify the <b>incentive</b> <b>effect</b> the analysis exploits discontinuities in the rules of the fiscal equalization system as well as policy changes. The empirical results support the existence of an <b>incentive</b> <b>effect,</b> suggesting that the high marginal contribution rates induce the municipalities to raise their business tax rates significantly.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{economic}} incentives affect the {{commercial value of}} inventions generated in universities. Using data for 102 U.

We provide evidence that {{this is due to}} the fact that public universities are less effective at commercialising inventions, which weakens the <b>incentive</b> <b>effect</b> of higher royalty shares. Other findings include: 1) there is a Laffer effect in private universities: raising the inventor's royalty share increases the license income retained by the university; 2) the <b>incentive</b> <b>effect</b> works primarily by increasing the quality of inventions, and 3) the <b>incentive</b> <b>effect</b> appears to operate both by raising faculty effort and by sorting academic scientists across universities.
