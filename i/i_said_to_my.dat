500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing.

[...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E

John Virant, {{president and chief executive}} of Rounder Records, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I remember watching the episode when it aired last October, and after it was over, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife, 'That's the best hour of TV I've ever seen. Someone should put that [...] out.' I inquired at Fox, just following up, and they said, 'Well, we tried, it didn't happen. If you want to take a run at it, feel free. AllMusic gives the album five out of five stars, stating that the music is [...] "every bit as fun as the episode itself", praising the voices of Benson, Marsters and Head.

2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E

2500|$|Who You Are {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{anticipated}} releases of 2011, due to Jessie J winning the Critics Choice award at the 2011 BRIT Awards and topping the BBC's Sound of 2011 poll. On Twitter, Jessie J confirmed that it took her 6 years to completely finish the album - it was completed on 19 January 2011. In an interview Jessie J stated that she wrote her first song, [...] "Big White Room", at the age of 17, about when she was in hospital, at 11 years old. A ward mate of hers, a little boy, died. She recalls waking up in the middle of the night and seeing him praying, and her mother explaining that he was having an operation the next day and was asking God to save him. [...] "He died the next day so <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mum 'but God didn't save him'. I was so angry and it really confused me. I always wanted to write a song about the experience, but I knew I had to be of an age where it wasn't tacky or depressing and had a lightness to it." [...] She prefers the song with just an acoustic guitar; stripped down and bare.|$|E
