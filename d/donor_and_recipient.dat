In this paper, we present our findings regarding SGF after pediatric renal transplantation and its predictive variables. From 1985 to 2004, a total of 300 pediatric renal transplants were performed at our institution. A total of 10 cases with SGF and 50 controls that were operated by the same surgeons were enrolled in this study. The {{mean age of the}} <b>recipients</b> <b>and</b> <b>donors</b> was 11. 4 (3 - 15 yr) and 28. 05 yr (20 - 50 yr), respectively. All kidneys were retrieved from living donors. We compared patients with SGF with controls regarding four independent variables: age difference between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients,</b> serum hemoglobin difference between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients,</b> mean blood pressure (systolic blood pressure + 2 diastolic blood pressure/ 3) difference between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients,</b> <b>and</b> weight difference between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients.</b> The mean age of recipients was 10. 5 ± 4. 1 in SGF group and 11. 6 ± 2. 5 in control group (p = 0. 4). The differences between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients</b> regarding weight <b>and</b> mean blood pressure in subjects with SGF were not higher than other patients (42 kg vs. 37. 4 kg, p = 0. 4; - 3 mmHg vs. - 4. 1 mmHg, p = 0. 8). The mean hemoglobin difference between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients</b> was 6. 3 ± 2. 1 g/dL in SGF group and 6. 7 ± 2. 3 g/dL in control group (p = 0. 6).

25|$|Thyroid {{transplantation}} {{became the}} model for a whole new therapeutic strategy: organ transplantation. After {{the example of the}} thyroid, other organs were transplanted in the decades around 1900. Some of these transplants were done in animals for purposes of research, where organ removal and transplantation became a successful strategy of investigating the function of organs. Kocher was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1909 for the discovery of the function of the thyroid gland. At the same time, organs were also transplanted for treating diseases in humans. The thyroid gland became {{the model for}} transplants of adrenal and parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovary, testicles and kidney. By 1900, the idea that one can successfully treat internal diseases by replacing a failed organ through transplantation had been generally accepted. Pioneering work in the surgical technique of transplantation was made in the early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, with Charles Guthrie, with the transplantation of arteries or veins. Their skillful anastomosis operations and the new suturing techniques laid the groundwork for later transplant surgery and won Carrel the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. From 1902, Carrel performed transplant experiments on dogs. Surgically successful in moving kidneys, hearts, and spleens, {{he was one of the}} first to identify the problem of rejection, which remained insurmountable for decades. The discovery of transplant immunity by the German surgeon Georg Schöne, various strategies of matching <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipient,</b> and the use of different agents for immune suppression did not result in substantial improvement so that organ transplantation was largely abandoned after WWI.|$|E
40|$|Background: In living kidney transplantation, {{preoperative}} donors' renal functional reserve (RFR) may {{correlate with}} postoperative residual renal function in both <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the donors' RFR before transplantation and to compare basal and stress renal function before and after transplantation in both <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients.</b> Methods: Seven pairs of living kidney <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients</b> were considered for this observational study. RFR was measured with a renal stress test (RST) before and after the kidney transplantation through an oral protein loading test (1 g/kg of body weight). RFR was defined as the difference between the maximum value of creatinine clearance after protein load (stress glomerular filtration rate, sGFR) and baseline creatinine clearance (basal GFR, bGFR). Results: Before transplantation, a significant difference between sGFR and bGFR (p = 0. 04) was observed in donors, with an RFR = 30. 6 (11. 9 - 41. 5) mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2. After kidney transplantation, sGFR was similar to bGFR for both <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients</b> (p = 0. 13), with a limited RFR (7. 9 [6. 70 - 19. 25] and 14. 90 [- 6. 67 to 25. 53] mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, respectively). The sum of the <b>donor's</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipient's</b> post-transplant sGFR was similar to the pre-transplant donor's sGFR (p = 0. 73). Conclusion: RST is a safe, feasible, easy, and an inexpensive tool that is able to quantify RFR. In living kidney transplantation, it can be used in clinical practice to measure the original global filtration capacity of the <b>donor's</b> kidneys (sGFR) <b>and</b> to quantify the susceptibility of <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients</b> in developing postoperative kidney dysfunction. However, further studies with an adequate sample size and follow-up period are needed to test this hypothesis...|$|R

This project aims at identifying and recommending appropriate information technology features to address the information needs of <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>recipients</b> in live kidney transplantation and assist them in their decision-making.

[...] The RecA/Rad51/DMC1 gene family plays {{a central role in}} homologous recombination during {{bacterial transformation}} as it does during eukaryotic meiosis and mitosis.
