40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{examined}} {{the implications of}} <b>illness</b> centrality for psychological and physical health among male and female early adolescents with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We interviewed 132 adolescents before or after a routine clinic appointment. We measured {{the extent to which}} they defined themselves in terms of their <b>illness,</b> their views of the <b>illness,</b> psychological well-being, self-care behavior, and metabolic control. RESULTS: Females scored higher on <b>illness</b> centrality than males. <b>Illness</b> centrality was related to poor psychological well-being when the <b>illness</b> was perceived in negative terms, but only for females. For males, <b>illness</b> centrality was unrelated to psychological well-being. <b>Illness</b> centrality was related to poor metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS: The extent to which adolescent females define themselves in terms of their <b>illness</b> is most problematic when the <b>illness</b> is perceived in highly negative terms. Future research should examine how <b>illness</b> centrality and views of <b>illness</b> change over the course of adolescence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} a number of socioeconomic indicators (asset ownership, assets purchased, change in income, food shortage, kept job after <b>illness)</b> and two outcomes: improvement in mental <b>illness</b> and stability of mental <b>illness.</b> A sample of urban and rural Ghanaians reporting a mental <b>illness</b> (n= 400) was used. This focus on changes in mental <b>illness</b> differs from much previous work that examines mental <b>illness</b> status (i. e., whether or not a person has a mental <b>illness).</b> It was found that maintaining employment after the onset of <b>illness</b> was associated with both mental <b>illness</b> improvement and stability. Income increases were related to stability of mental <b>illness</b> only. Asset and food shortage measures were not found to be significant correlates of mental <b>illness</b> improvement or stability.

40|$|Background: To improve patients’ {{quality of}} life (QoL) we need to {{identify}} modifiable determinants, such as <b>illness</b> perceptions. Patients’ <b>illness</b> perceptions are known to regulate emotional responses and health-behaviour. <b>Illness</b> perceptions comprise several components: consequences, control, coherence, changeability and emotional representations. Aims: To examine (a) the relation between patient characteristics and <b>illness</b> perceptions, and (b) the independent predictive value of <b>illness</b> perceptions for future QoL. Methods: A longitudinal study in 845 patients with congenital heart disease was conducted. Patients completed three questionnaires: the IPQ-R (<b>illness</b> perceptions) {{and two years later}} the SF- 36 and TAAQOL-CHD (QoL). Linear regression analyses were performed relating <b>illness</b> perceptions to patient characteristics (sex, age, disease complexity and functional status) and QoL. Results: Patients with a complex defect or poor functional status reported poor <b>illness</b> perceptions. Independent of patient characteristics, poor <b>illness</b> perceptions (i. e. a strong belief that the <b>illness</b> has severe consequences; a weak belief that you have a coherent <b>illness</b> understanding and that the <b>illness</b> can be controlled by treatment; and a strong belief that the <b>illness</b> is changeable and causes negative emotions) were predictive of future QoL. Conclusion: <b>Illness</b> perceptions independently predict QoL, suggesting that QoL may be improved by altering patients’ beliefs about their <b>illness.</b> For example, increasing patients’ knowledge regarding their disease and informing them about treatment opportunities may enhance their QoL.

40|$|<b>Illness</b> {{representations}} {{relating to}} the experience of chronic <b>illness</b> may directly influence health and <b>illness</b> behaviour (coping methods), as well as having an indirect influence on psychosocial adjustment to chronic <b>illness.</b> Chronic <b>illness</b> is more than a medical condition: it is a subjective experience occurring against a backdrop of individual, social, and cultural influences that impact on the <b>illness</b> experience. The dynamic framework of the Common Sense Model (CSM) of health and <b>illness</b> makes this model particularly useful for understanding health and <b>illness</b> behaviours, including social and cultural factors that impact on these behaviours. The influence of <b>illness</b> representations on health and <b>illness</b> behaviours, and the processes and outcomes relating to psychosocial adjustment to chronic <b>illness</b> are particularly important when viewed from the perspective of culturally-diverse groups, such as the elderly Greek-speaking male participants in this study. In this thesis, participants’ <b>illness</b> representations and coping methods for their chronic <b>illness</b> are explored, along with the processes and outcomes associated with their psychosocial adjustment to chronic <b>illness.</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted and thematic analysis identified themes relevant to the CSM. These showed how participants’ responses to their chronic <b>illness</b> were influenced by their personal experiences and contextual factors. Findings also identified additional themes not directly related to the CSM, revealing how participants’ adjustment to their chronic <b>illness</b> was influenced by individual, psychosocial, and cultural factors. Implications of the study’s findings include the importance for health care professionals to consider the subjective meanings of elderly male individuals’ chronic <b>illness</b> experience, including wider social and cultural influences on their chronic <b>illness</b> experience, as a way of informing and establishing appropriate health care practices...|$|R

The self-regulatory model {{proposes that}} an individual's {{cognitive}} representations of <b>illness</b> threat (<b>illness</b> representations) influence {{the selection and}} performance of strategies to cope with that <b>illness</b> (Leventhal, Meyer, & Nerenz, 1980).

The aim {{of the present study}} is to test the hypothesis that coping strategies partially mediate the relationship between <b>illness</b> representations and <b>illness</b> outcome in women with rheumatoid arthritis. Design and methods. The study is an observational cross-sectional design. Self-report measures of <b>illness</b> representations, coping strategies, and <b>illness</b> outcome were collected from 125 women with rheumatoid arthritis attending rheumatology outpatient clinics. Clinical measures of disease activity and severity were obtained from hospital records. Results. Avoidant and resigned coping were found to partially mediate the relationship between symptom identity and the <b>illness</b> outcome measures of disability and psychiatric morbidity. As in other studies, strong relationships were found between <b>illness</b> representations and <b>illness</b> outcome. Conclusions. The finding that avoidant and resigned coping partially mediated the relationships between the <b>illness</b> representation dimension of symptom identity and two of the <b>illness</b> outcome measures (disability and psychiatric morbidity) provided some support for the hypothesis. However, the hypothesis was not fully supported, as coping did not partially mediate the relationship between any of the other <b>illness</b> representations and <b>illness</b> outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes Mellitus (DM) {{is one of}} {{the chronic}} {{diseases}} which requires an appropriate strategy in its management.

A consecutive sampling was used to recruit the samples of 147 respondents in Dr. Soeroto and Widodo hospitals in Ngawi, East Java. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Willis, Man-Whitney and multiple regression tests. The results showed that <b>illness</b> belief and <b>illness</b> representation were associated with the quality of life (p-value = 0, 000; α< 0, 01 and p-value = 0, 000; α< 0, 01), and <b>Illness</b> belief was more dominant in improving the quality of life of patients with DM.
