Through exploiting the inherent capabilities of such devices this study investigated the efficacy of multimodal representation of L 2 vocabularies for 158 pre-intermediate level L 2 learners aged 18 - 23. Since short-term memory plays an <b>important</b> role <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning,</b> they were placed into four different short-term memory (STM) ability groups using visual and verbal STM Tests. Also, cell phone-based vocabulary presentations with different annotations, i. e. pictorial vs. written, were adapted to the cell phone screen to render on learners' cell phones via Bluetooth. Finally, the participants took English vocabulary recognition and recall tests. The statistical analysis of {{the results showed that}} presenting learning materials with pictorial or written annotations rather than without annotations to learners with high-visual and high-verbal abilities resulted in better learning. Also, presenting learning materials with pictorial annotation to learners with high-visual ability as well as presenting the materials with written annotation to learners with high-verbal ability resulted in better learning. Low-visual and low-verbal ability groups showed better results under no annotation condition. The findings can provide an appropriate model for designing learning materials for L 2 learners...|$|R

This study used a pre-/post within-subjects design to investigate whether discussion contributed to improved vocabulary knowledge from expository text read alouds and whether the placement of discussion makes a difference <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning.</b> Fifty-five second-grade students participated {{in a total of}} six read aloud sessions. There were two sessions for each of three expository texts. Intact classrooms were randomly assigned to condition by book. All participants experienced each of three discussion conditions, which varied by book. For the Discussion During (DD) condition, students experienced discussion of target vocabulary words during the read aloud sessions. For the Discussion After (DA) condition, students experienced discussion of target vocabulary words after the read aloud sessions. For the No Discussion (ND) condition, students listened to an expository text read aloud without discussing the text at all. An expressive vocabulary measure was used to examine growth <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge. For each book, no difference was found for the ND condition. However, statistically significant treatment effects, with large effect sizes, were found for both the DA and DD conditions, indicating that discussion contributed to greater growth <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge than no discussion. Post-hoc tests revealed that for one book, the DA condition led to significantly greater vocabulary growth than the DD condition.

40|$|In {{learning}} English, one of {{the factors}} is the poor mastery of vocabulary knowledge. Memory sensory has <b>important</b> value <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> The students need balance in usage of the left brain and right brain. The Right brain is for creativity and visualization, whereas the left brain is for logic and reason. Mind mapping utilizes both and stimulates students‟ brains using the creative and logic sides of the brain. In this study, the writer used a quasi-experimentalnon-equivalent-groups pre-test-post-test design. The subjects of this study were the second grade students of Elementary School. The writer used two classes as the sample of this experiment. The experimental group was taught using mind mapping and another was taught using word list. Then, the writer gave a pre-test, and post-test to the two groups. The pre-test measured the students‟ vocabulary mastery before the treatments. The treatments were given nine times (seventy minutes each). The writer used a post-test as {{one of the}} instruments to see the students‟ vocabulary mastery. After that, the writer evaluated the students‟ pre and post-tests of the two groups by using the analytic scoring technique.

40|$|AbstractVocabulary {{learning}} {{is one of}} the most challenging issues that EFL learners face. In the past the learners depended on their teachers but new teaching methodologies encourage learner autonomy. At the university level, learners should become more autonomous <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> foreign language <b>vocabulary</b> and try to find different ways of how to become more successful learners. At the university level learners are forced to become autonomous and make conscious efforts to <b>learn</b> <b>vocabulary</b> outside of the classroom simply because exposure to target language is limited in university classes. Consequently, the autonomy of the learner play an <b>important</b> role <b>in</b> developing and enhancing their vocabulary.

40|$|The second {{language}} learner sometimes have difficulties in understanding and comprehending spoken and written text in English {{when they find}} unfamiliar <b>vocabulary</b> <b>in</b> it. One of the <b>important</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>vocabulary</b> is phrasal verbs. Learning phrasal verbs can be confusing {{because there are so}} many particles that can be used and sometimes those phrasal verbs carry idiomatic meaning in which the meaning is difficult to guess, and it is quite different from the meanings of the verb and the particle they are formed from. This study is carried out mainly to find out two things. The first one is the comprehension of IC students on phrasal verbs before and after learning process using “Up Beat Intermediate” course book and the second one is find out some factors contributing to the achievement of IC students as shown by their post-test. The writer in this study uses mixed-method design: explanatory design. As the subject of this study were the IC students of the English Education study program of Widya Mandala Catholic University from the academic year 2014 - 2015, The research design in this study makes use of two kinds of data: quantitative and qualitative. Therefore, the data of this study were students‟ pretest-posttest score (quantitative) and students‟ interview (qualitative). To get the quantitative data of this study, the writer conducted pretest and posttest as a research instrument. On the other hand, to get the qualitative data of this study the writer conducted open-ended interview as a research instrument to help explain and elaborate on data related to the outcomes of the qualitative data. Based on the result of the pre-test and post-test, the data show that the IC students achieve better result on their post-test than their pre-test even though it is not significant. The result of their computation showed that the mean score of post test (24. 87234) was slightly higher than the pre-test (22. 44681). Meanwhile, from the result of the interview, the writer found out that there were four major factors contributing to their success achievement in learning phrasal verbs as shown by the result of their post-test; the lecturers‟ presenting the material of the phrasal verbs, the sufficient numbers of material review, the benefit of SAC, and self study.

As beliefs and strategies are factors influencing SLA, <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> beliefs (VLB) and strategies (VLS) have drawn continuous attention in SLA {{research in the}} past two decades, especially in China. The present study has continued these foci by investigating VLB and VLS of a new group of English learners <b>in</b> China whose <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> is under-researched － vocational college students. The study aimed to capture the VLB and VLS profiles of such learners by triangulating them with teacher observations. It also aimed to examine the interrelationships between VLB, VLS and learning outcomes. In essence, the consistency in learners’ self-reports and the consistency between learners’ self-reports and their actual <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> behavior perceived by their English teacher were examined. A mixed-method approach was adopted for investigation from different perspectives. Involving student questionnaires and interviews as well as an interview with a teacher, this approach overcame the weakness of reliance on learners’ self-reported questionnaires in previous work. 102 International Trade and Economy majors at a Chinese vocational college completed the questionnaire and the vocabulary test. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 20 % of these students and their English teacher. Synthesis of quantitative data and qualitative data revealed the students predominantly believed in the importance of vocabulary for the tests while tending to disagree that vocabulary should be memorized. They seemed to dwell on dictionary strategies and contextual guessing while using communication/cooperation and wordlists the least. However, teacher observations contradicted their belief in the high use of dictionaries and low use of wordlists. Among the VLBs, self-efficacy showed the most significant correlation with vocabulary proficiency. No VLB showed significant correlation with general English proficiency. In addition, not all VLSs, that significantly correlated with vocabulary proficiency, showed significant correlation with general English proficiency. Furthermore, self-efficacy and interest <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> showed a wide range of correlation with VLSs, while the belief in the importance of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> for the tests and the belief in memorization showed the minimum range of correlation with VLSs.

Comparison of pre-test and post-test results showed that experimental group participants made considerable progress in achieving autonomy <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning.</b> The results obtained are highly significant in Libyan contexts where English is taught as a foreign language and students largely depend on classroom teaching and teachers' support, which create problems for them in university level education. The findings of the study indicate that (i) learner autonomy can be induced; and (ii) autonomous learners acquire new vocabulary faster. The study was conducted at a small scale. The researcher suggests that if the same study is conducted at a larger scale, the results will hold better validity...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} o n {{language learning}} theories played <b>important</b> role <b>in</b> TCFL research. A rticle sort s out and summarize s {{the issues and}} theories on second language <b>learning</b> and <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> ’s strategies from both Western and Chinese scholars. It can be summarized that  Western scholars have started a broad scope research <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> strategies since their early times, then, the research’ results have helped to give a solid and important foundation {{for the development of}} <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> strategies nowadays. Even though TCFL scholars have realized the importance of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> strategies <b>in</b> the process of second language learning and more research are being done, but until now, the amount and quality of research in this field still needs to be improved. There is still a big space in the diversity perspective of research that needs to be filled. A rticle presents  the history and development of the theories of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> strategies to help impel and deepen the research of TCFL.  </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the second phase}} of a preliminary study which had shed light on the significant role of markedness constraints <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> (VL). The present study provides an introduction to the Markedness, Strategy and Input (hereafter MSI) Model, which examines the collective relationship between markedness, determination strategies and the role of input in VL. The interdisciplinary framework of this paper will not only enhance our understanding of second language (L 2) <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning,</b> but also build a bridge between linguistic theory and foreign language teaching. Suggestions for further research within this field and the wider implications of the MSI-model will also be addressed. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study investigated}} the effectiveness of auditory support <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> by comparing acquisition and retention of lexical items studied using a traditional paired-associates memorisation technique to results achieved using an audio-supported paired-associates technique. The subjects were 88 Korean university students. Results indicated that the audio- supported <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> approach leads to significantly higher rates of acquisition. This advantage was retained over the two months following treatment. The largest difference was noticed in pronunciation. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} success in the audio-supported approach was not significantly dependent on learning preferences, and that the approach enjoyed a higher level of acceptance among subjects than non-auditory paired-associates memorisation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{an effort}} {{to look into the}} <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> {{strategies}} (VLS) of Malaysian TEVT- L 2 learners, a mixed-mode research was conducted among 31 German-Malaysian Institute(GMi) students. Data was collected via questionnaires which were then followed by a semi-structured interview. The results of the study revealed that although students saw the importance of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning,</b> a majority relied on discovery strategies such as referring to dictionaries, guessing words, asking friends and teachers. Very few students were familiar with more concrete cognitive strategies which would lend more success <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning.</b> As a result, it is hoped that the study will induce compatibility between <b>learning</b> of <b>vocabulary</b> among students and the approach used by instructors in TEVT institutes; which would enhance the effectiveness of English Language learning...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates ESL {{students}} {{studying in}} the program Teaching English as a Second Language in Universiti Putra Malaysia. This investigation attempts to understand {{the influence of a}} formal language learning environment (classroom, teachers, and peers) on <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> strategies. This study describes how school environments as well as mediating agents interfere <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> strategies of ESL students or support them. This research adopts the qualitative method. The researcher gathered data through in depth interviews and used open coding as well as constant comparative methods to analyze the data. The findings suggest that teaching methods, the level of encouragement students received, peers’ negative and positive behaviors, classroom’s activity and textbooks were significant factors that generally effected the learners’ choice of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> strategies <b>in</b> school...|$|R
40|$|Late talkers (LTs) — {{children}} who show a marked delay <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> — {{have also been}} shown to differ from normally-developing (ND) children with respect to the seman-tic organization of their <b>learned</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> We use a compu-tational model of word learning to study how individual dif-ferences between LTs and NDs give rise to differences in ab-stract knowledge of categories emerging from learned words, and how this affects their subsequent word learning. Our re-sults suggest that the vocabulary composition of LTs and NDs differ at least partially due to a deficit in the attentional abili-knowledge of semantic categories of words...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{intentional}} <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> by Japanese EFL {{high school students}} using vocabulary books, and aims {{to examine the relationship}} between the use of <b>Vocabulary</b> <b>Learning</b> Strategies (VLS) and the attainment <b>in</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning.</b> Explanatory factor analysis showed that VLS were classified into five factors : organization, repetition and concentration, review, use of L 1, and use of context The subjects were given the same vocabulary test twice, at the beginning and the end of the school year, and they were divided into four groups based on cluster analysis of the students' performance on the tests. The difference in use of each VLS between those four learner groups was compared, and it was found that only organization strategy had a significant positive effect on vocabulary retention...|$|R
30|$|Several {{sophisticated}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in order to support}} context awareness in learning (Ogata et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2009; Petersen et al. 2009). Context is important to <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning</b> because students can use it for forming stronger associations between the new word and the objects in the real world (Ogata et al. 2011). <b>In</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>learning,</b> context can take many forms. Researchers have used personalized learning systems that tailor-fit the vocabulary content to students’ internal context, i.e., their current level of competence (Yang 2012). Researchers have also built vocabulary applications that have capitalized on external, physical contexts, such as studying in a library or eating in the cafeteria (Scott and Benlamri 2010).|$|R
