5|$|At least 31mass graves were {{discovered}} in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war. In 1969, the historian Jozo Tomasevich wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed {{that the number of}} victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put the <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> about 5,000. In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some {{estimates of the number of}} those killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav Glišić, placed the <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> about 3,000. In 2007, Pavlowitch wrote that inflated figures of 6,000–7,000victims were advanced and widely believed for many years, but that German and Serbian scholars had recently agreed on the figure of 2,778. In the same year, the curator of the 21stOctober Museum at Kragujevac, Staniša Brkić, published a book listing the names and personal data of 2,794victims. Of the total killed, 144were high school students, and five of the victims were 12years old.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth {{oxychloride}} (BiOCl, see <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> right) and bismuth oxynitrate (BiONO3) stoichiometrically {{appear as}} simple anionic salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO+) which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds. However, {{in the case}} of BiOCl, the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic (see below).|$|E
5|$|By late 1940 Naujocks {{had been}} removed from his {{position}} after he fell out of favour with Heydrich. The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer before he left in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the unit had produced around £3 million in forged notes; the historian Anthony Pirie puts the <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> £500,000. Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was never used.|$|E
5|$|Damage totals in the United States are {{not fully}} known, {{although}} media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, {{and at least one}} study places the <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{difficult}} political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga {{for the first}} time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949. In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina. In June 1950, Barcelona signed Ladislao Kubala, who was to be an important <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> the club.|$|E
5|$|Edward III died in 1377 and was {{succeeded by}} his ten-year-old grandson, Richard II. At Richard's coronation, Suffolk carried the new king's sceptre, {{and he was}} later {{appointed}} to Richard's minority council. Even after the council was disbanded in January 1380, he remained a central <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> court, participating in the negotiations for the king's marriage to Anne of Bohemia, and mediating in a conflict between John of Gaunt and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|Following another {{review of}} {{parliamentary}} representation in Cambridgeshire in 2016, the Boundary Commission for England again made minor alterations {{to the existing}} constituencies to deal with population changes. The electoral wards used to create the modified Peterborough constituency that will be fought at the 2017 general election are: Bretton, Central, Dogsthorpe, East, Eye Thorney and Newborough, Gunthorpe, North, Park, Paston and Walton, Ravensthorpe, Werrington and West. These changes increased the electorate from 70,640 to (unknown <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> this time – being researched).|$|E

5|$|In May2007, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) {{ended their}} five-year {{partnership}} with TNA, which allowed the NWA {{to regain control}} over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships that TNA had controlled since June2002. TNA then introduced a new TNA X Division Championship belt on the May16, 2007 edition of TNA's online podcast TNA Today. Jeremy Borash and Management Director Jim Cornette, TNA's on-screen authority <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> the time, unveiled the new belt and awarded it to then-champion Chris Sabin.|$|E

5|$|Peter Stormare as John Abruzzi (seasons 1–2): Due to {{his role}} as the leader of a Chicago mafia, Abruzzi became a {{prominent}} <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> Fox River State Penitentiary.

He appears regularly {{in the first half of}} the first season and makes selected appearances towards the end of the first season and the beginning of the second season.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{came close}} to making their opponents pay for their profligacy in front of goal with Evans lifting a volley over the crossbar. Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was {{proving to be a}} {{formidable}} <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> the heart of his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss, but he dragged his shot wide.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} a dinitrogen complex to be {{discovered}} was 2+ (see <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one {{lone pair of electrons}} to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers.|$|E

The barbs in the <b>figure</b> <b>at</b> the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the wind is blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|The killings {{were the}} first act of mass murder {{committed}} by the Ustaše upon coming to power. Estimates {{of the number of}} victims vary.

Other historians, such as Ivo Goldstein and Mark Biondich, mention 196 deaths.|$|E
