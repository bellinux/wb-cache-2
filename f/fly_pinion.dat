It might have been twelve, two, half-past four, twenty minutes to six, the Margrave would still have said, [...] "I BELIEVE IT IS FIVE O'CLOCK." [...] The wretched take no count of time: it <b>flies</b> with unequal <b>pinions,</b> indeed, for THEM.|$|R
60|$|This is unborn beauty: she Now in air floats {{high and}} free, Takes {{the sun and}} breaks the blue; - Late with stooping <b>pinion</b> <b>flew</b> Raking hedgerow trees, and wet Her wing in silver streams, and set Shining foot on temple roof: Now again she flies aloof, Coasting {{mountain}} clouds and kiss't By the evening's amethyst.|$|R
6000|$|In Utopia I {{think they}} will <b>fly</b> with {{stronger}} <b>pinions,</b> {{it will not be}} in the superficialities of life merely that movement will be wide and free, they will mount higher and swoop more steeply than he in his cage can believe. What will their range be, their prohibitions? what jars to our preconceptions will he and I receive here? ...|$|R
6000|$|This is unborn beauty: she [...] Now in air floats {{high and}} free, [...] Takes the sun, and breaks the blue;-- [...] Late, with stooping <b>pinion</b> <b>flew</b> [...] Raking hedgerow trees, and wet [...] Her wing in silver streams, and set [...] Shining foot on temple roof.

6000|$|This is unborn beauty: she [...] Now in air floats {{high and}} free.

6000|$|Wide windy {{reaches of}} high stubble field; A long gray road, bordered with dusty pines; A wagon {{moving in a}} [...] "cloud by day." [...] Two city sportsmen with a dove between, Breast-high upon a fence and fast asleep-- A solitary dove, the only dove In twenty counties, and it sick, or else It were not there. Two guns that fire as one, With thunder {{simultaneous}} and loud; Two shattered human wrecks of blood and bone! And later, in the gloaming, comes a man-- The worthy local coroner is he, Renowned all thereabout, and popular With many a remain. All tenderly Compiling in a game-bag the débris, He glides into the gloom and fades from sight. The dove, cured of its ailment by the shock, Has <b>flown,</b> meantime, on <b>pinions</b> strong and fleet, To die of age in some far foreign land.|$|R
6000|$|Where graced {{with many}} a classic spoil [...] CAM rolls his reverend stream along, [...] I haste {{to urge the}} learnéd toil [...] That sternly chides my love-lorn song: [...] Ah me! too mindful of the days [...] 5 [...] Illumed by Passion's orient rays, [...] When Peace, and Cheerfulness and Health [...] Enriched me {{with the best of}} wealth. [...] Ah fair Delights! that o'er my soul [...] On Memory's wing, like shadows fly! [...] 10 [...] Ah Flowers! which Joy from Eden stole [...] While Innocence stood smiling by!-- [...] But cease, fond Heart! this bootless moan: [...] Those Hours on rapid <b>Pinions</b> <b>flown</b> [...] Shall yet return, by Absence crown'd, [...] 15 [...] And scatter livelier roses round. [...] The Sun who ne'er remits his fires [...] On heedless eyes may pour the day: [...] The Moon, that oft from Heaven retires, [...] Endears her renovated ray. [...] 20 [...] What though she leave the sky unblest [...] To mourn awhile in murky vest? [...] When she relumes her lovely light, [...] We bless the Wanderer of the Night.|$|R
6000|$|Youth now flees on {{feathered}} foot. Faint and fainter {{sounds the}} flute; Rarer songs of Gods. And still, Somewhere on the sunny hill, Or along the winding stream, Through the willows, flits a dream; Flits, but shows a smiling face, Flees, but with so quaint a grace, None {{can choose to}} stay at home, All must follow - all must roam. This is unborn beauty: she Now in air floats high and free, Takes the sun, and breaks the blue; - Late, with stooping <b>pinion</b> <b>flew</b> Raking hedgerow trees, and wet Her wing in silver streams, and set Shining foot on temple roof. Now again she flies aloof, Coasting mountain clouds, and kissed By the evening's amethyst. In wet wood and miry lane Still we pound and pant in vain; Still with earthy foot we chase Waning pinion, fainting face; Still, with grey hair, we stumble on Till - behold! - the vision gone! Where has fleeting beauty led? To {{the doorway of the}} dead! qy. omit? [Life is gone, but life was gay: We have come the primrose way!] ...|$|R
6000|$|Dear LONG, in this sequester'd scene, [ii] [...] While {{all around}} in slumber lie, [...] The joyous days, which ours have been [...] Come rolling fresh on Fancy's eye; [...] Thus, if, amidst the {{gathering}} storm, [...] While clouds the darken'd noon deform, [...] Yon heaven assumes a varied glow, [...] I hail the sky's celestial bow, [...] Which spreads {{the sign of}} future peace, [...] And bids the war of tempests cease. [...] Ah! though the present brings but pain, [...] I think those days may come again; [...] Or if, in melancholy mood, [...] Some lurking envious fear intrude, [iii] [...] To check my bosom's fondest thought, [...] And interrupt the golden dream, [...] I crush the fiend with malice fraught, [...] And, still, indulge my wonted theme. [...] Although we ne'er again can trace, [...] In Granta's vale, the pedant's lore, [...] Nor through the groves of Ida chase [...] Our raptured visions, as before; [...] Though Youth has <b>flown</b> on rosy <b>pinion,</b> [...] And Manhood claims his stern dominion, [...] Age will not every hope destroy, [...] But yield some hours of sober joy.|$|R
