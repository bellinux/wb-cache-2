5|$|These trains {{originally}} had no visual passenger information systems; station announcements {{had to be}} made by the train operator. An automatic audio announcement system using voice synthesizers was installed on each train by September 1994. The first iteration of the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> buzzer announcements, which replaced the initial door chimes, was fully introduced by April 1997.|$|E
25|$|The livery of the New Mexico Rail Runner {{depicts a}} stylistic {{roadrunner}} on the locomotive and trailing tailfeathers on the coaches. The <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> tones resemble the signature “Beep-Beep” of the Warner Bros. Road Runner cartoon character.|$|E
25|$|The public {{announcement}} {{system in}} all SMRT operated lines {{was introduced in}} 1994, beginning with the announcement of station names when a train arrives at the station. The <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> announcement was later added in 1997 and the next station announcement in 1999. Over time, however, some sections of the announcements were modified, and finally, the entire announcement system was changed in January 2008 {{in preparation for the}} installation of STARIS on all trains later that year. The new announcement system features a new voice, and a new chime before each announcement.|$|E

5000|$|Electro-{{hydraulic}} - {{the motor}} drives a hydraulic pump, which pressurizes {{the oil in}} a <b>door</b> <b>closer,</b> which in turn turns the <b>door</b> <b>closer</b> and opens the door. This is the preferred type in Europe. (In the US it has a reputation of being prone to oil leaks.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Around 1800 {{the use of}} caisson locks was {{proposed}} by Robert Weldon for the Somerset Coal Canal in England. In this underwater lift, the chamber was 80ft long and [...] deep and contained a completely enclosed wooden box big enough to take a barge. This box moved {{up and down in}} the [...] deep pool of water. Apart from inevitable leakage, the water never left the chamber, and using the lock wasted no water. Instead, the boat entered the box and was sealed in by the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> behind it, and the box itself was moved up or down through the water. When the box was at the bottom of the chamber, it was under almost [...] of water [...] at a pressure of three atmospheres, in total. One of these [...] "locks" [...] was built and demonstrated to the Prince Regent (later George IV), but it had various engineering problems and the design was not put into use on the Coal Canal.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Small, Aunt Hester, {{and their}} cat were left once more alone, {{the sound of}} a <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in the {{distance}} announced the approach of Timothy.|$|E

60|$|When he {{had gone}} Joan Valentine hurried to the door and, having opened it an inch, stood listening. When {{the sound of his}} <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> came to her she ran down the stairs and out into Arundell Street. She went to the Hotel Mathis.|$|E
6000|$|... "O no, indeed. I merely stepped down, Clym, to ask you--" [...] Here he {{followed}} her through the doorway into the private room beyond, and, the <b>door</b> <b>closing,</b> Eustacia and the mummer who sat next to her, the only other witness of the performance, saw and heard no more.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} keys from {{her fingers and}} opened the <b>door,</b> <b>closing</b> it again behind them. She led {{the way into the}} sitting-room. The whole place was in {{darkness}} but she turned on the electric light. The cloak slipped from her shoulders. He took her hands and looked at her.|$|E

60|$|Lucian {{returned}} the salutation, mastered {{by a certain}} latent dangerousness in Cashel, suggestive that he might resent a snub by throwing the offender over the balustrade. As for Alice, she had entertained a superstitious dread of him ever since Lydia had pronounced him a ruffian. Both felt relieved when the house <b>door,</b> <b>closing,</b> shut them out of his reach.|$|E
6000|$|With an effort, {{the slope}} of the rocky passage beyond favouring her, she half-drew, half-lifted the Roman through the entrance. Then it was, as she {{straightened}} herself a little to take breath, that she heard the thud of the rock <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> behind her. Still, as it was dark, she did not guess that Miriam was parted from them, for she said: ...|$|E
60|$|Something {{broke the}} stillness. The {{front door of}} the house she was gazing at opened softly, and there came out into the porch a female figure, wrapped in a large shawl, beneath which was visible the white skirt of a long loose garment. A gray arm, {{stretching}} from within the porch, adjusted the shawl over the woman's shoulders; it was withdrawn and disappeared, the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> behind her.|$|E
60|$|She {{stepped back}} into the house and the <b>door</b> <b>closed</b> behind her.|$|R

5000|$|Another type of <b>door</b> <b>closer,</b> {{a surface}} mounted one, is {{attached}} to the door frame behind the door (where the hinges are) next to the middle hinge. The [...] "arm" [...] rests against the door, and a spring that is bent by the user opening the <b>door</b> <b>closes</b> the <b>door</b> by retracting to its proper shape.|$|R
6000|$|While, one day, {{they were}} so harmlessly and pleasantly occupied, a great whacking of whips, blowing of horns, and {{whirring}} of wheels was heard in the street without. The wheels stopped at their hotel gate; Lady Walham started up; ran through the garden <b>door,</b> <b>closing</b> it behind her; and divined justly who had arrived. The landlord was bowing; the courier pushing about; waiters in attendance; one of them, coming up to pale-faced Lady Walham; said, [...] "Her Excellency the Frau Graefinn von Kew is even now absteiging." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>door</b> <b>closing.</b> Barney's wagon--the wheels {{silent in}} the snow, but the wagon-body rattling. Kennicott {{clicking}} the receiver-hook to rouse the night telephone-operator, giving a number, waiting, cursing mildly, waiting again, and at last growling, [...] "Hello, Gus, this is the doctor. Say, uh, send me up a team. Guess snow's too thick for a machine. Going eight miles south. All right. Huh? The hell I will! Don't {{you go back to}} sleep. Huh? Well, that's all right now, you didn't wait so very darn long. All right, Gus; shoot her along. By!" ...|$|E
6000|$|No {{one who has}} {{appreciated}} the wonders {{of a new world}} of art and association can see, without emotion, the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> upon it, perhaps forever. I lingered long here, and often turned to gaze again; and after going out, went back, once more, to fill my soul with a last, long look, in which I bade adieu to all the historic memories of the old world. I thought of the words, [...] "We have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{are built}} {{on top of a}} {{standard}} <b>door</b> <b>closer.</b> To open the door, the operator forces the closer in the opening direction. Then, the <b>closer</b> <b>closes</b> the <b>door.</b> The user may open the door manually, using just the <b>door</b> <b>closer.</b> In case of power failure while the door is open, the closer itself <b>closes</b> the <b>door.</b>|$|R

60|$|One {{of the men}} {{then stepped}} up beside it, took from his pocket a lump of chalk, and wrote upon the cover the name {{and a few other}} words in a large scrawling hand. (We believe that they do these things more tenderly now, and provide a plate.) He covered the whole with a black cloth, threadbare, but decent, the tail-board of the waggon was {{returned}} to its place, one of the men handed a certificate of registry to Poorgrass, and both entered the <b>door,</b> <b>closing</b> it behind them. Their connection with her, short as it had been, was over for ever.|$|E
6000|$|Gaston, for {{the first}} time in his life, felt himself unable to speak. He crossed the room with slow and {{lingering}} step; then, with a great effort, dashed out at the <b>door,</b> <b>closing</b> his visor as he did so, and, after a short interval, during which he seemed to have stopped on the stairs, Eustace could hear his gay bold tones, calling, [...] "Up! up! my merry men, all! Let not the French dogs find the wolf asleep in his den. They will find our inner bartizan a hard stone for their teeth--and it will be our own fault, if they crack it before the coming of our brave comrades from Bordeaux!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{walked down}} to the town first and spent some time in front of the shop-windows. Tiring of this, she {{proceeded}} to the harbour and inspected the shipping, and then with the feeling strong upon her {{that it would be better}} to settle with Bassett at her own convenience, she walked slowly to the small street in which he lived, and taking up a position nearly opposite his house paced slowly to and fro with the air of one keeping an appointment. She was pleased to observe, after a time, a slight movement of the curtains opposite, and, satisfied that she had attained her ends, walked off. The sound of a street <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> saved her the necessity of looking round.|$|E
