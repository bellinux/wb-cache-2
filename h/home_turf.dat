5|$|As with The Quatermass Xperiment, the {{screenplay}} for Quatermass 2 condenses {{many of the}} events of the original. The most significant change is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass and his assistant, Pugh, use Quatermass's rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens on their <b>home</b> <b>turf</b> whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, at the asteroid to destroy it. Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film, most notably Quatermass's daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh. Conversely, the character of Inspector Lomax reappears in the film version, having previously been in The Quatermass Xperiment, but does not appear in the television version. The character of Sheila the barmaid also appears only in the film version.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 {{season was}} {{arguably the best}} season of Durant's career. He set career highs in touchdowns, with 31, while {{limiting}} his interceptions to only 12. He began the year having attempted 212 consecutive pass attempts without being intercepted joining Dave Dickenson and later Ricky Ray as the only quarterback in CFL history to start 7 consecutive games without throwing an interception. He also set a career-high for passer rating with 95.7 (excluding his 2006 season in which he only completed one pass). He led the Riders to an 11-7 record and home-field in the Western Semi-Finals against the BC Lions where several of his rushing plays won the game for the Riders. After beating Calgary in the Western Final, Durant led the Riders to their fourth Grey Cup championship on their <b>home</b> <b>turf</b> at Mosaic Stadium.|$|E

50|$|The two clubs {{had been}} the main challengers for the league title the {{previous}} season, with Burnley pipping Wolves by just a single point.

5000|$|However, {{an injury}} to John Boyle helped Houseman {{gradually}} establish himself as a regular in the side on the left wing, often acting as the team's [...] "water-carrier" [...] and providing service {{for the likes of}} Ian Hutchinson and Peter Osgood. He didn't miss a match during the 1969-70 season. His most significant contribution to Chelsea came in their FA Cup success in 1970, with Houseman scoring a total of 6 goals in that season's competition. His first 2 goals came when Chelsea faced Burnley in the fourth round; after a draw a Stamford Bridge, the side travelled to Burnley's <b>home</b> ground, <b>Turf</b> Moor, for the replay and, with eighteen minutes left, were trailing 1-0. Houseman picked up the ball in his own half and dribbled through the Burnley midfield, riding several challenges. He reached the opposition penalty area and smashed a shot into the top corner to equalise. In extra time, Houseman provided the cross for Tommy Baldwin to put Chelsea ahead, and then completed the comeback by scoring the third.|$|R

50|$|In prehistoric times, the {{district}} around Tayport was inhabited by Neolithic settlers, whose clay pottery and finely-wrought stone arrowheads {{have been found}} in considerable quantities on Tentsmuir, (once an area of heath and moorland, and now owned by the Forestry Commission). These settlers had not learned how to use metals and did not practise agriculture, but lived by hunting and fishing. The sites of some of the early settlements have been located by large collections of shells and, although nothing remains of their <b>homes</b> (probably primitive <b>turf</b> huts) one of their boats, a hollowed-out tree trunk, was found in a sandbank near Newburgh, further up the Tay, and is on display in Dundee Museum, which keeps a good collection of Neolithic artefacts.|$|R

According to the plans, the first qualifiers will be held in the club's freshly finished ultra-modern stadium.|$|R
