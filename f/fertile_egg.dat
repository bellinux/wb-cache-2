6000|$|There {{is reason}} to believe that insects are {{affected}} by confinement like the higher animals. It is well known that the Sphingidae rarely breed when thus treated. An entomologist (18/60. Loudon's 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 5 1832 page 153.) in Paris kept twenty-five specimens of Saturnia pyri, but did not succeed in getting a single <b>fertile</b> <b>egg.</b> A number of females of Orthosia munda and of Mamestra suasa reared in confinement were unattractive to the males. (18/61. 'Zoologist' volumes 5-6 1847-48 page 1660.) Mr. Newport kept nearly a hundred individuals of two species of Vanessa, but not one paired; this, however, might have been due to their habit of coupling on the wing. (18/62. 'Transact. Entomolog. Soc.' volume 4 1845 page 60.) Mr. Atkinson could never succeed in India in making the Tarroo silk-moth breed in confinement. (18/63. 'Transact. Linn. Soc.' volume 7 page 40.) It appears that a number of moths, especially the Sphingidae, when hatched in the autumn out of their proper season, are completely barren; but this latter case is still involved in some obscurity.

40|$|Abstract: The common {{practice}} of candling chicken eggs during incubation, allows classification of embryonic mortality at three stages: early, mid-term and late embryonic development. The {{purpose of this}} study was to estimate genetic parameters of embryonic mortality at three stages of incubation as well as fertility and hatchability in an ancient chicken breed. Hatchability of <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> had a favourable genetic correlation with early (- 0. 09) and mid-term (- 0. 36) embryonic mortality. Hatchability of eggs set was favourably correlated with mid-term embryonic mortality (- 0. 40) but not with early (0. 22) embryonic mortality. Genetic correlations between fertility and hatchability of <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> and hatchability of eggs set were 0. 20 and 0. 86, respectively. Genetic correlations between late and early embryonic mortality (0. 11) and mid-term embryonic mortality (0. 34) were favourable, but not between early and mid-term (- 0. 78) embryonic mortality. Mid-term embryonic mortality and hatchability of <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> were both candidate traits for effective selection against embryonic mortality in our breed. Benefits are brought by the high heritability value of mid-term embryonic mortality and its advantageous correlation with fertility, late embryonic mortality, hatchability of <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> and hatchability of eggs set. On the other hand, it is more convenient to measure hatchability of <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs,</b> which also has a favourable correlation with fertility, early and mid-term embryonic mortality...|$|R

40|$|Infertile and {{non-viable}} <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> {{within a}} reptile clutch may decrease the incubation {{success of the}} remaining eggs, as (1) opportunistic pathogens may use the nutrient resources provided by dead eggs to colonize the clutch and spread to and kill viable eggs; and (2) odours released by spoilt eggs may attract predators to the clutch. These hypotheses were tested on the Iberian rock lizard (Lacerta monticola) by comparing the incubation success of <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> between clutches composed solely of <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> and clutches containing {{a small number of}} dead eggs. In a laboratory experiment, fungi (Fusarium sp. and Gliocladium sp.) colonized both infertile <b>eggs</b> and <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> that died during incubation and thereafter spread to and killed adjacent eggs. In addition, offspring hatched earlier from fungal infected eggs than from non-infected eggs. The former were smaller and lighter than the latter, as they hatched before using the full egg yolk content.

40|$|Design A {{clinical}} reproductive {{problem in}} a pair of breeding ostriches provided the opportunity to mate the birds at intervals of 5 to 8 days and assess the fertility of the eggs laid. Procedure Following prolapse of the phallus of the male ostrich during the breeding season, the pair were immediately separated. The hen was reintroduced to the cock at intervals of 5 to 8 days over a 6 week period for supervised mating. Records were kept of dates of mating and laying, number of eggs laid, egg weights, and fertility determined by candling after 2 weeks incubation. Results Over the 6 week period, 10 eggs were laid, of which 8 were fertile and 2 infertile. <b>Fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> weighed 1020 to 1285 g (mean 1143). The two infertile eggs weighed 1160 and 925 g. Six <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> were laid 2 to 7 days after mating. The remaining two <b>fertile</b> <b>eggs</b> were laid the same days that mating occurred, suggesting that fertilisation resulted from the last matings 5 and 8 days previously, or from earlier matings.
