5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a docile {{breed of}} dog and {{is fond of}} playing with {{children}} and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However {{it can also be}} used for hunting ducks, <b>hares</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog is content {{with a small amount of}} space and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.|$|E

40|$|Coexistence of ecologically similar {{species is}} {{sustained}} by niche partitioning, a fundamental element {{of which is}} diet. Overlapping of resource requirements between sympatric species can create interspecific competitive or facilitative effects on the foraging behaviour of herbivores. Brown <b>hares</b> (Lepus europaeus) <b>and</b> European <b>rabbits</b> (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are similar in size, morphology, feeding type and occupy the same habitats, but direct evidence of competition for resources between them is lacking. Both species are widespread and simultaneously pests and species of conservation concern {{in different parts of}} their range. We investigated dietary overlap of brown <b>hares</b> <b>and</b> European <b>rabbits</b> in pastures in relation to pasture management <b>and</b> <b>hare</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbit</b> abundance. Grasses were the predominant component in both <b>hare</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbit</b> diets with high overlap of plant species. Both <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares</b> showed some selectivity for particular plants with evidence of consistent selection for Phleum spp. and relative avoidance of Poa spp. However, differences in the smaller components of <b>hare</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbit</b> diet resulted in significant differences in diet overall. There was no evidence that higher relative density of one species led to dietary shifts but pasture management affected the diet of both species. Nutritional composition of diets of both species also differed between cattle and sheep pastures with higher fibre, ash and fat in the former. Our data provide no evidence of competitive exclusion between <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares</b> on the basis of diet, but suggest that the effects of livestock on their respective diets may influence indirect competition in favour of rabbits over hares...|$|R
25|$|The diet is {{generally}} more diverse {{than any other}} co-existing owl but often focuses predominantly on a particular range of prey species, with two to four species often making {{up the majority of}} the diet. Studies conducted over the course of years has shown that the regional diet often changes dramatically from year to year. This is partially driven by the cyclical population trends of much of their prey as well as by habitat changes, which are often due to human activities. The primary prey species varies by region but is comprised mainly by small mammals such as voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. In Europe, the five main prey species are, in order of extent of reporting and numeric abundance in dietary studies: the brown rat (Rattus norvegius), which has now occupied edge habitats (although generally associated with man) in almost every part of Europe excluding the colder north; the common vole (Microtus arvalis), often the most abundant native, small mammal in wild portions of Europe; the European hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), which occupies wooded edges across western Europe alongside the eagle-owls; the European water vole (Arvicola amphibius), a unique, large vole occupying the wetland edges often hunted by eagle-owls; and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which has a very close relationship with the eagle-owls found throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the massifs of France. As the distribution of the Eurasian eagle-owls moves west (and south), the primarily prey species gradually change but often continues to be dominated in number by small rodents and in biomass by slightly larger mammals such as hedgehogs and <b>hares</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} whippets {{were thought}} to be English Greyhounds that were too small for stag hunting in the forests of England. These dogs were frequently returned to their breeders, who were usually peasants and as such could not own hunting dogs under the forest law. Because of this, dogs returned to them were maimed, usually by cutting a tendon in a leg or removing the toes on one paw. The breeders kept these dogs and continued to breed them, producing a smaller version of a greyhound that was suited for rat catching and hunting <b>hares</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits.</b> When the forest law was repealed, the [...] "small greyhounds" [...] became immensely popular. [...] Whippets were then commonly known as [...] "snap dogs" [...] for their tendency to [...] "snap up" [...] nearby prey. In the picture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755) of two dogs presented to Louis XV, they are either whippets or small greyhounds, but are probably related to an early form of whippet. Oudry also painted a second painting of Misse with a different, non-sighthound dog. There is a 1758 painting by Pompeo Batoni entitled Portrait of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton which features a similar whippet-like dog.|$|E

2500|$|In Northern Europe, Easter imagery often {{involves}} <b>hares</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Citing folk Easter customs in Leicestershire, England where [...] "the profits {{of the land}} called Harecrop Leys were applied to providing a meal which was thrown {{on the ground at}} the 'Hare-pie Bank'", late 19th-century scholar Charles Isaac Elton theorizes a connection between these customs and the worship of Ēostre. In his late 19th-century study of the hare in folk custom and mythology, Charles J. Billson cites numerous incidents of folk custom involving the hare around the period of Easter in Northern Europe. Billson says that [...] "whether there was a goddess named Eostre, or not, and whatever connection the hare may have had with the ritual of Saxon or British worship, there are good grounds for believing that the sacredness of this animal reaches back into an age still more remote, where it is probably {{a very important part of}} the great Spring Festival of the prehistoric inhabitants of this island." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{estimated}} {{typical range}} of weights of hares hunted by golden eagles is , whereas rabbits hunted weigh {{a little under}} [...] on average. Except for the occasional Arctic hare, white-tailed or antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), most leporids hunted in North America weigh [...] or less, including the smallest hare in the world, the [...] snowshoe hare, and the smallest rabbit in the world, the [...] pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). In Europe, where the large brown and mountain hares, both sometimes weighing over , are habitually hunted, the prey may be dismembered before being brought to the nest. Across the golden eagle's range, <b>hares</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits</b> are generally known to be hunted via either “high soar with glide attack” or “contour flight with short glide attack”. Leporids are basically solitary animals but they can occur at high densities, such as when jackrabbits are at their peak numbers in brushy areas of Western North America or (historically at least) rabbits in similar brush habitats on the Iberian Peninsula. The goal of the golden eagle while hunting <b>hares</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits</b> is to catch the prey when it is foraging out in the open. If the leporid becomes aware of the eagle's descent upon them {{more than a few}} seconds before the strike, they invariably break into a fast, hopping run. Once contact is made, rabbits and hares will often kick or try to bite the eagle but escape is unlikely once they are pinned to the ground. In some case they are able to reach vegetative coverage and, if the said cover is sufficiently deep and dense, the eagle cannot pursue them any further. Although rare, golden eagles have been known to use the “walk and grab attack” to pull a leporid out of its cover. Many hunts in Scotland of mountain hare involve a somewhat lengthy tail chase. If the golden eagle is able to intercept a rabbit or hare far out in the open, a twisting and turning tail chase frequently occurs but the odds of survival for the prey are smaller the farther they are from coverage. On occasion, breeding pairs have been observed hunting jackrabbits together, where one will stoop on a gathering of them while the other waits out of sight and assaults one of the jackrabbits being made to run.|$|E
