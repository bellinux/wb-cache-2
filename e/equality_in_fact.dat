The left {{represents}} Shakti (energy, power) {{in the form of}} Goddess Parvati (otherwise his consort) and the right half Shiva. Whereas Parvati is the cause of arousal of Kama (desires), Shiva is the killer. Shiva is pervaded by the power of Parvati and Parvati is pervaded by the power of Shiva.While the stone images may seem to represent a half-male and half-female God, the true symbolic representation is of a being the whole of which is Shiva and the whole of which is Shakti at the same time. It is a 3-D representation of only shakti from one angle and only Shiva from the other. Shiva and Shakti are hence the same being representing a collective of Jnana (knowledge) and Kriya (activity).Adi Shankaracharya, the founder of non-dualistic philosophy (Advaita-"not two") in Hindu thought says in his [...] "Saundaryalahari"—Shivah Shaktayaa yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum na che devum devona khalu kushalah spanditam api [...] " [...] i.e., It is only when Shiva is united with Shakti that He acquires the capability of becoming the Lord of the Universe. In the absence of Shakti, He is not even able to stir. In fact, the term [...] "Shiva" [...] originated from [...] "Shva," [...] which implies a dead body. It is only through his inherent shakti that Shiva realizes his true nature.This mythology projects the inherent view in ancient Hinduism, that each human carries within himself both female and male components, which are forces rather than sexes, and it is the harmony between the creative and the annihilative, the strong and the soft, the proactive and the passive, that makes a true person. Such thought, leave alone entail gender <b>equality,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> obliterates any material distinction between the male and female altogether. This may explain why in ancient India we find evidence of homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, multiple sex partnersand open representation of sexual pleasures in artworks like the Khajuraho temples, being accepted within prevalent social frameworks.|$|E

40|$|Meeting Theme: Power, Privilege, and the Pursuit of Justice: Legal Challenges in Precarious TimesPaper session - Comparative Perspectives on Judicial ReviewAlmost every modern {{constitution}} {{contains a}} general equal protection clause {{that seeks to}} guard against arbitrary or discriminatory state practices. In most western democracies, this constitutional guarantee of equality is judicially understood to embody a substantive ideal - courts are required to identify prima facie prohibited bases of legislative differentiations and where they do exist, the onus is on the government to demonstrate how these differentiations are justifiable. Unfortunately, within common law Asia, many territorial courts do not uphold this substantive model of equality. Neither are they homogenous nor consistent in upholding a particular model of <b>equality.</b> <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> {{a survey of the}} constitutional practices of Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong reveals four judicial approaches to equality. First, we may observe a formal model of equality where the courts merely require equal treatment for all persons who are situated within the same legislative category. This is merely a principle for consistency. Second, a corollary of the formal principle, we may find the rational connection model. This model provides that a statutory provision would be deemed arbitrary if the legislative distinctions do not have a rational connection to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question. Third, the “forbidden personal characteristics” model is in essence the substantive model of equality commonly applied in the West – courts seek to identify prima facie forbidden grounds of statutory differentiations based on an individual’s personal traits (i. e. personal characteristics for which individuals have been historically subjected to stereotype and/or prejudice) that requires State justification. Finally, the “fundamental rights” model of equality assumes that all legislative differentiations that affect an individual’s exercise of her fundamental rights are prima facie discriminatory unless justified. In this Paper, I shall argue that the the “forbidden personal characteristics” model of equality serves as the only logical and meaningful constitutional standard of equality for courts in these Asian jurisdictions to apply. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{founders of}} Greek {{scientific}} thought believed justice {{in terms of}} equality. Cosmic <b>equality,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> was conceived as the guaranty of cosmic justice: the order of nature is maintained {{because it is an}} order of equals. That the main components of the universe are equal was an old tradition in popular cosmology. In Hesiod earth and sky are declared equal (Theog. 126); and the distance between sky and earth is equal to that between earth and Tartarus (ibid. 719 - 25). Anaximander’s own cosmology is designed with just such a sense of aesthetic symmetry, with equality as the main motif: the intervals between each of the infinite worlds are equal; the intervals between earth, fixed stars, moon, and sun are also equal; earth and sun are equal. This is exactly the sense in which equality figures in the whole development of early cosmological theory from Anaximander to Empedocles: powers are equal if they can hold another in check, in a way that no one of them is more powerful than any other. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a cosmological interpretation of the term díkē in ancient Greek according to Aristotle, who establishes synonymy between justice and equality through the use of the «dividing line» paradigm. Aristotle reveals, in effect, that the words diksastḗs «judge» and dikaion «just» come from the root díkē, «judgment or sentence», which in their turn are derived from the adverb dīksā, «division into two equal parts». Moreover, the adverb dīksā comes from the Greek root dís-, «divided into two parts, dichotomous», which in its turn is derived from the Sanskrit root *diś-(dik) whose meaning indicates the astronomical concept of the «horizon line», — i. e. the boundary line that divides apparently the cosmos in two equal parts, the Earth and the Sky. As said by Palmer and Gagarin, in effect, the meaning of the word Díkē is associated with making a «judgment or decision» between two contestants, that is, placing a «dividing line» (straight or crooked) between them. Furthermore, this original conception representing justice as a division of the cosmos into two equal parts, or cosmic dasmós, has its roots in ancient cosmogony not only Greek but also Indo-Iranian, Hindus, Old Persian, Egyptian, Babylonian and Chinese.

In the context of care work, the Convention has given little attention to the interconnections between all forms of discrimination against women, unpaid care work, and <b>equality.</b> <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> the CEDAW has not drafted any provision on women´s unpaid care work and it has a very limited gender analysis about what underpins women´s unpaid care and domestic work as a form of discrimination against women. The CEDAW's very comprehensive analysis of discrimination has not been extended to the sphere of women's unpaid care work, despite the fact that distinction as regards unpaid care work operates against women and girls because of gender stereotyping which continues to link care work to women as a natural responsibility or to those within the household with less negotiating power (normally girls). These practices and beliefs also exclude women and girls from taking up opportunities that can be crucial for their human development and independence such as education, participation in matters affecting their interests, accessing paid jobs, enjoy free time for leisure, self-care, and health. Undoubtedly, all these things place serious restrictions upon women in the exercise of their rights. In this respect, there is still a huge gap in the CEDAW as regards the application of a more robust gender analysis which should adopt a care lens perspective as regards the multiple forms of discrimination against women. This research aims to analyse the evolution that the Women's Convention has undergone as regards care work and whether this evolution responds to the needs of a more redistributive agenda on care work for all women independently of their condition. In doing this, I will firstly introduce a theoretical discussion about the principle of equality and non-discrimination in the Women's Convention from a care lens perspective which allows me to better understand the form of equality the CEDAW advocates in order to challenge discriminatory practice as regards women´s unpaid care work. Secondly, I will examine how and if gender stereotypes as regards care are properly treated by the Committee as a means of effectively fighting discrimination against women. Finally, based on the analysis of the CEDAW's general recommendations, I will show the progressive shift the CEDAW has undergone in relation to care work and the challenges ahead for the Women's Convention...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 0413210 T - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Mathematics - Faculty of ScienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to do a literature study on spaces of martingales on Riesz spaces and Banach lattices, using [16, 19, 20, 17, 18, 2, 30] {{as a point of}} departure. Convergence of martingales in the classical theory of stochastic processes has many applications in mathematics and related areas. Operator theoretic approaches to the classical theory of stochastic processes and martingale theory in particular, can be found in, for example, [4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 15, 26, 27]. The classical theory of stochastic processes for scalar-valued measurable functions on a probability space (,# 6;, μ) utilizes the measure space (,# 6;, μ), the norm structure of the associated Lp(μ) -spaces as well as the order structure of these spaces. Motivated by the existing operator theoretic approaches to classical stochastic processes, a theory of discrete-time stochastic processes has been developed in [16, 19, 20, 17, 18] on Dedekind complete Riesz spaces with weak order units. This approach is measure-free and utilizes only the order structure of the given Riesz space. Martingale convergence in the Riesz space setting is considered in [18]. It was shown there that the spaces of order bounded martingales and order convergent martingales, on a Dedekind complete Riesz space with a weak order unit, coincide. A measure-free approach to martingale theory on Banach lattices with quasi-interior points has been given in [2]. Here, the groundwork was done to generalize the notion of a filtration on a vector-valued Lp-space to the M-tensor product of a Banach space and a Banach lattice (see [1]). In [30], a measure-free approaches to martingale theory on Banach lattices is given. The main results in [30] show that the space of regular norm bounded martingales and the space of norm bounded martingales on a Banach lattice E are Banach lattices in a natural way provided that, for the former, E is an order continuous Banach lattice, and for the latter, E is a KB-space. The definition of a ”martingale” defined on a particular space depends on the type of space under consideration and on the ”filtration,” which is a sequence of operators defined on the space. Throughout this dissertation, we shall consider Riesz spaces, Riesz spaces with order units, Banach spaces, Banach lattices and Banach lattices with quasi-interior points. Our definition of a ”filtration” will, therefore, be determined by the type of space under consideration and will be adapted to suit the case at hand. In Chapter 2, we consider convergent martingale theory on Riesz spaces. This chapter is based on the theory of martingales and their properties on Dedekind complete Riesz spaces with weak order units, as can be found in [19, 20, 17, 18]. The notion of a ”filtration” in this setting is generalized to Riesz spaces. The space of martingales with respect to a given filtration on a Riesz space is introduced and an ordering defined on this space. The spaces of regular, order bounded, order convergent and generated martingales are introduced and properties of these spaces are considered. In particular, we show that the space of regular martingales defined on a Dedekind complete Riesz space is again a Riesz space. This result, in this context, we believe is new. The contents of Chapter 3 is convergent martingale theory on Banach lattices. We consider the spaces of norm bounded, norm convergent and regular norm bounded martingales on Banach lattices. In [30], filtrations (Tn) on the Banach lattice E which satisfy the condition 1 [n= 1 R(Tn) = E, where R(Tn) denotes the range of the filtration, are considered. We do not make this assumption in our definition of a filtration (Tn) on a Banach lattice. Our definition yields <b>equality</b> (<b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> a Riesz and isometric isomorphism) between the space of norm convergent martingales and 1 Sn= 1 R(Tn). The aforementioned main results in [30] are also considered in this chapter. All the results pertaining to martingales on Banach spaces in subsections 3. 1. 1, 3. 1. 2 and 3. 1. 3 we believe are new. Chapter 4 is based on the theory of martingales on vector-valued Lp-spaces (cf. [4]), on its extension to the M-tensor product of a Banach space and a Banach lattice as introduced by Chaney in [1] (see also [29]) and on [2]. We consider filtrations on tensor products of Banach lattices and Banach spaces as can be found in [2]. We show that if (Sn) is a filtration on a Banach lattice F and (Tn) is a filtration on a Banach space X, then 1 [n= 1 R(Tn Sn) = 1 [n= 1 R(Tn) e M 1 [n= 1 R(Sn). This yields a distributive property for the space of convergent martingales on the M-tensor product of X and F. We consider the continuous dual of the space of martingales and apply our results to characterize dual Banach spaces with the Radon- Nikod´ym property. We use standard notation and terminology as can be found in standard works on Riesz spaces, Banach spaces and vector-valued Lp-spaces (see [4, 23, 29, 31]). However, for the convenience of the reader, notation and terminology used are included in the Appendix {{at the end of this}} work.

More importantly, terms appearing in the right-hand side in (76) are intertwined so that various valuation adjustments cannot be computed without the prior knowledge of the hedging strategy for the full contract. We thus conclude that the additivity and separation of adjustments, which is visibly suggested by the shape of <b>equality</b> (76), is <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> illusory, unless the underlying trading model has fully linear features so {{that it is possible to}} use the theory of linear BSDEs in order to justify separation. Obviously, this does not mean that separation cannot hold in some models with certain nonlinear features but this should be an exceptional situation, rather than the rule.|$|R

It addresses the problem of {{the relationship between}} the ‘national’ and ‘civil’ aspects of the existing nation state and the problem of separating the national from the civil in some justifications of transnational political integrations. It also examines the thesis of some authors who claim that both the nation and the state are obstacles to asserting citizenship as a universal status in the freedom and <b>equality</b> of all. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> it analyses the crucial issue whether a transnational political organisation is possible as a ‘community of citizens‘ in line with the concept of ‘constitutional patriotism‘, or as an international community in the sense of a ‘Society of Peoples‘ with the ‘right of nations‘ under the assumptions of political liberalism or of a properly ordered state government. The author also analyses the concept of ‘nationalism‘ and the unjustifiableness of its proscription per se. In the final section, he comments on and analyses the observed national (nationalistic) strategies of European integration...|$|R

The economic process of the last half-century, so far as America is concerned has completely justified the generalisations of Marx. There has been a steady concentration of wealth and of the reality as distinguished from the forms of {{power in the hands of}} a small energetic minority, and a steady approximation of the condition of the mass of the citizens to that of the so-called proletariat of the European communities. The tradition of individual freedom and <b>equality</b> is, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>in</b> process of destroying the realities of freedom and equality out of which it rose. Instead of the six hundred thousand families of the year 1790, all at about the same level of property and, excepting the peculiar condition of seven hundred thousand blacks, with scarcely anyone in the position of a hireling, we have now as the most striking, though by no means the most important, <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> American social life a frothy confusion of millionaires' families, just as wasteful, foolish and vicious as irresponsible human beings with unlimited resources have always shown themselves to be. And, concurrently with the appearance of these concentrations of great wealth, we have appearing also poverty, poverty of a degree that was quite unknown in the United States for the first century of their career as an independent nation. In the last few decades slums as frightful as any in Europe have appeared with terrible rapidity, and there has been a development of the viler side of industrialism, of sweating and base employment of the most ominous kind.|$|R
