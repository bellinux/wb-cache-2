500|$|Britten Austin tempers his {{praise for}} Bellman's realism with the {{observation}} that the effects are chosen to work in song, rather than to be strictly correct or even possible. Thus in Epistle 72, [...] "Glimmande Nymf", the memorable rainbow with its glowing colours [...] "of purple, gold and green" [...] is seen after nightfall. He comments [...] "Never mind. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> scene, even if its chronology calls for much poetic license." [...] Or in Epistle 80, [...] "Liksom en herdinna", the farmer is for some reason going to or coming from market on a Sunday, when the market would be closed; and his cart [...] "heavy on staggering wheel" [...] must have been absurdly full if it contained chickens, lambs, and calves all at once. But {{it had to be}} a Sunday to allow Ulla Winblad to step out of her swaying chaise, on an outing from the city. Britten Austin remarks that [...] "until such solecisms are actually pointed out, one does not even notice them." [...] It is the same with the meals, which would cause [...] "terrible indigestion" [...] if the listener actually had to eat them, but [...] "as a feast for mind, eye and ear they are highly satisfactory", the imagination filled with [...] "all the poetic wealth" [...] that Bellman provides.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} between Betty and Rita, and Diane and Camilla have been variously described as [...] "touching," [...] "moving," [...] {{as well as}} [...] "titillating". Film critic Glenn Kenny, {{in a review of}} the film for Premiere, stated that the relationship between Betty and Rita is [...] "possibly the healthiest, most positive amorous relationship ever depicted in a Lynch movie", whereas the French critic Thierry Jousse, in his review for Cahiers du cinéma, noted that the love between the women depicted is [...] "of lyricism practically without equal in contemporary cinema". In the pages of Film Comment, Philip Lopate held that the pivotal romantic interlude between Betty and Rita was made so poignant and tender by Betty's [...] "understanding for the first time, with self-surprise, that all her helpfulness and curiosity about the other woman had a point: desire... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> moment, made all the more miraculous by its earned tenderness, and its distances from anything lurid." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon magazine maintained that the scene's [...] "eroticism [...] so potent it blankets the whole movie, coloring every scene that came before and every one that follows". Betty and Rita were chosen by the Independent Film Channel as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor states, [...] "Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness so soft and velvety it's like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the film's dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring our vision, we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty of the world has been cursed." [...] The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita–which borders on outright obsession–has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) and Robert Altman's 3 Women (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: [...] "The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{continued}} {{attempts at}} maintaining the theatre, it declined {{over the next}} 3 decades. By the 1940s, the performers had to beware of holes in the stage, unsafe wiring, faulty heating, and cockroaches. Unsafe conditions eventually led to a planned demolition. In 1948, Sir Laurence Olivier arrived in Hobart {{as part of the}} Old Vic touring company and spoke passionately about the theatre, launching a national appeal; [...] "We appreciate playing in it not only because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> little theatre; it is more than that.

Although Hanák was treated with suspicion by the more repressive communist authorities that took over after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, he found an early refuge in a topic sufficiently removed from big politics to survive {{on the margins of}} official production and yet, executed with a finesse that gave it a wide international appeal. In the most extraordinary section, an old man talks with great fascination and lucidity about space travel, recalling how two astronauts walked on the moon and collected rocks while a third circled in their spaceship. Tacked to the wall of his crumbling shack is a small photograph of men walking on the moon. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful,</b> elegiac work whose images could apply to Appalachia or any other poor region.|$|E

She recognises him from the hospital, and he reveals his true identity to her. Silas tells her that he wants to help her as he, [...] "knew a Lynsey once before", and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> name. He expresses a deep admiration for her work so far and offers her the chance to go into hiding with him as he feels that with the right tuition from him, the pair would make an unstoppable force. As Lindsey gives him a willing smile, the two serial killers drive off into the night. Lindsey later calls Silas in desperate need of his help after she attempts to convince Kim to steal her son, JJ from her ex-fiancé, Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Silas replies by saying that he knew she would return to him, and hangs up the phone with a sinister smile. Silas turns his attention to Kim, using a fake name [...] "Edward" [...] on social media, to lure her in. Believing that he has information on Lindsey's whereabouts, Kim inadvertently goes along with it. Silas tells her he is a retired policeman and uses her as a decoy so that the two killers can go ahead with their dastardly plans. Silas later meets Lindsey at a car park and tells her that he has Kim on side and that the plan is proceeding perfectly: that sooner or later, Lindsey will be reunited with her son and he will finally get another chance to claim the life of Mercedes.|$|E
