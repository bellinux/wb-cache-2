500|$|Bowfin {{are often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "living fossils", or [...] "primitive fishes" [...] because they retained some of the primitive characters common to their ancestral predecessors, including a modified (rounded externally) heterocercal caudal fin, a highly vascularized gas bladder lung, vestiges of a spiral valve, and a bony gular plate. The bony gular plate is located underneath the head on the exterior of the lower jaw between {{the two sides of the}} lower jaw bone. Other distinguishing characteristics include long, sharp teeth, and two protruding tube-like nostrils.

500|$|Alligator gar have gills, {{but unlike}} {{other species of}} fish, with few exceptions, {{they also have a}} highly vascularized swim bladder lung that {{supplements}} gill respiration.

[...] The swim bladder is connected to their foregut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface, an action that is seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern United States during the hot summer months. [...] The scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales</b> that are diamond-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{taphonomy}} of fishes {{living in}} lacustrine environments {{has been extensively}} studied in both the laboratory and the fossil record; the taphonomy of marine fishes, however, is poorly known. Triassic marine fishes with heavy <b>ganoid</b> and cosmoid <b>scales,</b> which provided protection from rapid taphonomic loss, offer a means to examine marine fish taphonomy in the fossil record. Four genera of Early Triassic fishes (the ray-finned actinopterygians Albertonia, Bobasatrania, Boreosomus, and the lobe-finned coelacanth (sarcopterygian), Whiteia) from the Wapiti Lake, British Columbia locality of the Lower Triassic Sulphur Mountain Formation were examined {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of the taphonomy of fish in marine environments, determine ambient environmental conditions in the region during the Early Triassic, and ascertain the habitat and mode of life of the fish. Results indicate that environmental conditions that contributed to the preservation of the fossil fishes of the current study included deposition in deep, quiet waters, which reduced the odds of disarticulation, colder waters under higher pressure, which slowed decay and limited postmortem floatation, and waters that were anoxic, which discouraged predators and scavengers. In addition, the thickness of the primitive <b>ganoid</b> and cosmoid <b>scales</b> of the fossil fishes also increased their preservation potential. Taphonomic, physiological and environmental indicators suggest that Whiteia, Albertonia, and possibly Bobasatrania lived in deep, cold waters near the oxygen minimum zone, while Boreosomus lived higher in the water column. While the anatomical and physiological characteristics of modern fishes will likely continue to inhibit marine taphonomy studies, examination of ancient fish, particularly those with <b>ganoid</b> or cosmoid <b>scales,</b> may provide future avenues of research {{to gain a better understanding}} of marine fish taphonomy and provide a powerful tool to examine ancient fish behavior and their environment...|$|R

The anisotropy of the outermost prismatic ganoine layer was investigated using instrumented nanoindentations and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations.

Simulation results for nanoindentation representing ganoine alternatively with isotropic, anisotropic, and discrete material properties are compared to understand the apparent direction-independence of the anisotropic ganoine during indentation. By incorporating the estimated anisotropic mechanical properties of ganoine, microindentation on a quad-layered FEA model that is analogous to penetration biting events (potential threat) was performed and compared with the quad-layered FEA model with isotropic ganoine. The elastic-plastic anisotropy of the outmost ganoine layer enhances the load-dependent penetration resistance of the multilayered armor compared with the isotropic ganoine layer by (i) retaining the effective indentation modulus and hardness properties, (ii) enhancing the transmission of stress and dissipation to the underlying dentin layer, (iii) lowering the ganoine/dentin interfacial stresses and hence reducing any propensity toward delamination, (iv) retaining the suppression of catastrophic radial surface cracking, and favoring localized circumferential cracking, and (v) providing discrete structural pathways (interprism) for circumferential cracks to propagate normal to the surface for easy arrest by the underlying dentin layer and hence containing damage locally. These results indicate the potential to use anisotropy of the individual layers {{as a means for}} design optimization of hierarchically structured material systems for dissipative armor.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{designing}} structures that combine the dual functions of mechanical protection and flexibility of motion. The structures {{are inspired by}} principles observed in the <b>ganoid</b> squamation (<b>scale</b> assembly) of an ancient fish species called Polypteridae, which first appeared 96 million years ago. Prior work on Polypteridae has focused on understanding {{the role of the}} inherent material properties (e. g., stiffness, strength, etc.) of the individual bony scales to provide penetration resistance. Here, geometric design is explored at increasingly larger length scales including 1) morphometric features within individual scales, 2) morphometry of the individual scales as a whole, 3) scale-to-scale interconnections and anisotropic ranges of motion, and, lastly, 4) the entire assembled scale squamation and anisotropic ranges of motion of the entire fish body. Experimental, computational, and mathematical methods employed were micro-computed tomography, microscopy, morphometric analysis, and three-dimensional printing of prototypes. The geometrical design principles discovered were related to biomechanical mobility and protection and then implemented into a generalized, functional design system which possesses similar anisotropic distinctive degrees of freedom and ranges of motion as Polypteridae. The design system offers potential for applications in fields of transportation, military, and architecture. by Steffen H. Reichert. Thesis (S. M.)

30|$|In {{biological}} systems, many organisms, {{ranging from}} bacteria and isolated cells to invertebrates and vertebrates, synthesize CaPO 4 (Omelon and Grynpas 2008). Formation of solid CaPO 4 in primitive organisms {{is believed to}} enable the storage and regulation of essential elements such as calcium, phosphorus and, possibly, magnesium. The morphology of precipitates in these organisms (small intracellular nodules of ACP often located in mitochondria) complies with the necessities for rapid mobilization and intracellular control of the concentration of these elements (Rey et al. 2006). In vertebrates CaPO 4 occur as the principal inorganic constituent of normal (bones, teeth, fish enameloid, deer antlers and some species of shells) and pathological (dental and urinary calculus and stones, atherosclerotic lesions, etc.) calcifications (Lowenstam and Weiner 1989; O’Neill 2007; LeGeros 2001; Wopenka and Pasteris 2005; Pasteris et al. 2008; Sun and Hanley 2007). In addition, they are found in <b>ganoid</b> fish <b>scales</b> (in alligator gar and Senegal bichir), turtle shells, {{as well as in}} armadillo and alligator osteoderms (Currey 2010). In minute quantities CaPO 4 exist in the brain (brain sand), without significantly affecting its function (Bocchi and Valdre 1993). Therefore, the expression “having sand in the head” is not without a reason. Except for small portions of the inner ear, all hard tissues of the human body are formed of CaPO 4. Structurally, they occur mainly in the form of poorly crystalline, non-stoichiometric, Na-, K-, Mg- and carbonate-containing CDHA (Young 1975; Danilchenko 2013). It is often called “biological apatite” (Young 1975; Danilchenko 2013; Nakano et al. 2002 a; Grynpas and Omelon 2007; Bazin et al. 2014 a) [which might be abbreviated as BAp (Lee et al. 2009; Basaruddin and Takano 2014)], bioapatite (Eagle et al. 2010; Cherkinsky et al. 2013; Šupová 2014) or dahllite (Lowenstam and Weiner 1985; Fernandez et al. 1998). The latter was named in 1888 by Brögger and Bäckström (1890) after the Swedish mineralogist brothers Tellef and Johan Martin Dahll.|$|R
50|$|Both cycloid and {{ctenoid scales}} are overlapping, {{making them more}} {{flexible}} than cosmoid and <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales.</b> Unlike <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales,</b> they grow in size through additions to the margin.

This fin is divided by rigid spines, which can be raised or lowered at will (often {{in response to a}} threat, or for stability).|$|E
50|$|The shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus) is a {{primitive}} freshwater fish {{of the family}} Lepisosteidae. It is native to the United States where its range includes the Mississippi and Missouri River basins, ranging from Montana {{to the west and}} the Ohio River to the east, southwards to the Gulf Coast. It inhabits calm waters in large rivers and their backwaters, as well as oxbow lakes and large pools. It is a long, slender fish, brown or olive green above and whitish below. It typically grows to about 60 cm and is armoured by rows of interlocking, rhomboidal <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganoid</b> <b>scales</b> {{are found}} in the sturgeons, paddlefishes, gars, bowfin, and bichirs. They are derived from cosmoid scales, with a layer of dentine in the place of cosmine, and a layer of {{inorganic}} bone salt called ganoine in place of vitrodentine. Most are diamond-shaped and connected by peg-and-socket joints. They are usually thick and have a minimal amount of overlap as compared to other scales. In sturgeons, the scales are greatly enlarged into armour plates along the sides and back, while in the bowfin the scales are greatly reduced in thickness to resemble cycloid scales (see above).|$|E
50|$|Gar {{bodies are}} elongated, heavily armored with <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales,</b> and fronted by {{similarly}} elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Their tails are heterocercal, and the dorsal fins {{are close to}} the tail. As their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air, doing so more frequently in stagnant or warm water when the concentration of oxygen in the water is low. They also appear to surface in fast-moving rapids. As a result, they are extremely hardy and able to tolerate conditions that would kill most other fish.|$|E
5000|$|The Asterolepis {{is blind}} and eyes and {{nostrils}} are directed antero-latero-dorsally. [...] Water would reach the nasal sacs directly through the nostrils and exit the sacs laterally along the anterior {{process of the}} sclerotic ring. The tail is covered <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales</b> like the armour which are modified cosmoid scales consisting of a bony basal layer, a layer of dentine, and an outer layer of ganoine. Since the tail doesn't have {{a high degree of}} mineralization in comparison to the scales of the internal skeleton making then less likely to be preserved in the fossil record. The tail is also has a dorsal fin, which is an identifying characteristic of Antiarchs.|$|E
50|$|Declining {{populations of}} {{alligator}} gar throughout their historic range {{has resulted in}} the need to monitor wild populations and regulate commercial harvests.

50|$|Holostei are bony {{fish that}} retain basal {{characteristics}} inherited {{from an early}} time in their evolution. There are eight species divided among two orders, the Amiiformes represented by a single living species, the Bowfin (Amia calva), and the Lepisosteiformes, represented by seven living species in two genera, the gars. Further species {{are to be found}} in the fossil record and the group is often regarded as paraphyletic. Holosteians are closer to teleosts than are the chondrosteans, the other group intermediate between teleosts and cartilaginous fish. The spiracles are reduced to vestigial remnants and the bones are lightly ossified. The thick <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales</b> of the gars are more primitive than those of the bowfin.|$|E
5000|$|Bowfin {{are often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "living fossils", or [...] "primitive fishes" [...] because they retained some of the primitive characters common to their ancestral predecessors, including a modified (rounded externally) heterocercal caudal fin, a highly vascularized gas bladder lung, vestiges of a spiral valve, and a bony gular plate.

50|$|Hesperosuchus was a {{terrestrial}} animal, where it's {{speed and}} ability to run fast is the most advantageous as a fitness trait. Northern Arizona's landscape during the Triassic period was surrounded by numerous bodies of water like lakes and streams. This supports that Hesperosuchus likely lived close to water although being a full on land dwelling animal. The <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales</b> found in the general area where Hesperosuchus was found belong to fresh water fish of the Triassic period, belonging to the genus Semionolus or Lepidolus, which lived in shallow lakes and streams. The phytosaur teeth and small sterospondyl vertebrae found near Hesperosuchus support the presence of lakes or streams crossing a flood plain. Also the many small teeth found, which some, belong to amphibians of the Triassic period supports the occupying of near water habitats.|$|E
50|$|The {{spotted gar}} {{is a part}} of the gar family (Lepisosteidae). They are notable for beingone of the few extant fish species with <b>ganoid</b> <b>scales.</b> They have been known to {{hybridize}} with (and look similar to) Florida gar. It occurs in quiet, clear pools and backwaters of lowland creeks, small to large rivers, oxbow lakes, swamps, and sloughs. It occasionally enters brackish waters.The fish is a voracious predator, feeding on various kinds of fishes and crustaceans. The lifespan for L. oculatus varies between males and females. The maximum lifespan for a gar is 18 years. Males mature at the age of two or three, whereas females mature at three or four years old. Females on average are known to be larger and live longer than the males. Females also have less annual mortality rates.|$|E
5000|$|Bichirs are {{elongated}} {{fish with}} a unique series of dorsal finlets which vary in number from seven to 18, instead of a single dorsal fin. Each of the dorsal finlets has bifid (double-edged) tips, and are the only fins with spines; {{the rest of the}} fins are composed of soft rays. The body is covered in thick, bonelike, and rhombic (<b>ganoid)</b> <b>scales.</b> Their jaw structure more closely resembles that of the tetrapods than that of the teleost fishes. Bichirs have a number of other primitive characteristics, including fleshy pectoral fins superficially similar to those of lobe-finned fishes. They also have a pair of slit-like spiracles used to exhale air, two gular plates, and paired ventral lungs (the left lung shorter than the right). [...] Four pairs of gill arches are present.|$|E
