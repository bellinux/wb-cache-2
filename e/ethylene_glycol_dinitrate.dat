5000|$|Propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (PGDN, 1,2-{{propylene}} <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> or 1,2-propanediol dinitrate) is {{an organic}} chemical, an ester of nitric acid and propylene glycol.

It is a characteristically and unpleasantly smelling colorless liquid, which decomposes at 121 °C, below its boiling point. It is flammable and explosive. It is shock-sensitive and burns with a clean flame producing water, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen.|$|R
50|$|A {{serious problem}} {{in the use of}} {{nitroglycerin}} results from its high freezing point 13 C. Solid nitroglycerin is much less sensitive to shock than the liquid, a feature that is common in explosives. In the past, nitroglycerin was often shipped in the frozen state, but this resulted in a high number of accidents during the thawing process just before its use. This disadvantage is overcome by using mixtures of nitroglycerin with other polynitrates. For example, a mixture of nitroglycerin and <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> freezes at -29 C.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a choice}} between four {{possible}} detection taggant chemicals which must be added to plastic explosives under the 1991 International Civil Aviation Organization's Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{composition of}} dynamite {{consisted of three}} parts [...] "explosive oil" [...] (as nitroglycerin was called), one part diatomaceous earth as the absorbent, and a small admixture of sodium carbonate antacid as the stabilizer. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> was later added to the nitroglycerin to lower its freezing point and keep it from freezing into a slush at low temperatures, which made it unstable, or from sweating out when it thawed. Diatomaceous earth is not usually used today as an absorbent medium {{and it has been}} replaced by cheaper media such as sawdust, wood pulp, flour, or starch. Other stabilizers, such as calcium carbonate or zinc oxide, can be used in the place of sodium carbonate. Sodium nitrate is added to the medium as an oxidizer to improve the dynamite's brisance.|$|E

50|$|Also in {{response}} to international agreements, Semtex has a detection taggant added to produce a distinctive vapor signature to aid detection. First, <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> was used, later switched to 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (3,4-dinitrohexane, DMDNB) or p-mononitrotoluene, which is used currently. According to the manufacturer, the taggant agent was voluntarily being added by 1991, years before the protocol signed became compulsory. Batches of Semtex made before 1990, however, are untagged, {{though it is not}} known whether there are still major stocks of such old batches of Semtex. According to the manufacturer, even this untagged Semtex can now be detected. The shelf life of Semtex was reduced from ten years before the 1990s to five years now. Explosia states that there is no compulsory tagging allowing reliable post-detonation detection of a certain plastic explosive (such as incorporating a unique metallic code into the mass of the explosive), so Semtex is not tagged in this way.|$|E

40|$|A {{mixture of}} {{explosives}} was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) linked to ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry that enabled detection {{in the range}} of 178 - 330 nm. The gas-phase UV spectra of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (DNT), <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (EGDN), glycerine trinitrate (NG, nitroglycerine), triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were successfully recorded. The most interesting aspect of the current application is that it enabled simultaneous detection of both the target analyte and its decomposition products. At suitable elevated temperatures of the transfer line between the GC instrument and the UV detector, a partial decomposition was accomplished. Detection was made in real time and resulted in overlaid spectra of the mother compound and its decomposition product. Hence, the presented approach added another level to the qualitative identification of the explosives in comparison with traditional methods that relies only on the detection of the target analyte. As expected, the decomposition product of EGDN, NG, and PETN was NO, while TATP degraded to acetone. DNT and TNT did not exhibit any decomposition at the temperatures used...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Conventional {{explosives}} 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitroglycerin (NG), and <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (EGDN) sorbed to hair can {{be directly}} detected by an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) in E-mode (for explosives). Terrorist explosive, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), difficult to detect by IMS in E-mode, was detected in N-mode (for narcotics). Three modes of sample introduction to IMS vapor desorption unit were used: (i) placement of hair directly into the unit, (ii) swabbing of hair and placement of swabs (i. e., paper GE-IMS sample traps) into the unit, and (iii) aceto-nitrile extracts of hair positioned on sample traps and placed into the unit. TNT, NG, and EGDN were detected in E-mode by all three sample intro-duction methods. TATP could only be detected by the acetonitrile extraction method after exposure of the hair to vapor for 16 days because of lower sensitivity. With standard solutions, TATP detection in E-mode required about 10 times as much sample as EGDN (3. 9 lg compared with 0. 3 lg).

Factors influencing the separation and detection processes were examined and optimized. Under the optimal separation conditions obtained using a 15 mM borate buffer (pH 9. 2) containing 20 mM SDS, and applying a separation voltage of 1500 V, the four nitrate ester explosives were separated within less than 3 min. The glassy-carbon amperometric detector (operated at - 0. 9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) offers convenient cathodic detection down to the picogram level, with detection limits of 0. 5 ppm and 0. 3 ppm for PGDN and for NG, respectively, along with good repeatability (RSD of 1. 8 - 2. 3 %; n = 6) and linearity (over the 10 - 60 ppm range). Such effective microchip operation offers great promise for field screening of nitrate ester explosives and for supporting various counter-terrorism surveillance activities.

40|$|Abstract — A kinetic dual shutter ion {{mobility}} spectrometer with a {{gas chromatograph}} as a sample pre-fractionation inlet {{was built to}} determine ion lifetimes, energies, and kinetics of decomposition of gas phase ions of energetic materials. Measurements of thermal dissociation of chloride adducts of explosives, namely nitroglycerine (NG), <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (EGDN) and dimethyl nitro butane (DMNB) ions in negative mode, were selected for study, fi rst owing to known sensitivity to thermal dissociation. The dissociations of EGDN·Cl ˉ and NG·Cl ˉ were observed in the temperature ranges of 79 to 97 oC and 111 to 122 oC at ambient pressure. The only decomposition path was the displacement of NO 3 from Cl: NG·Cl ˉ → [NG-NO 3 +Cl] + Cl ˉ and EGDN·Cl ˉ → [EGDN-NO 3 +Cl] + Clˉ. The rate constants determined over the temperature ranges yielded activation energies for the dissociations of NG·Cl ˉ and EGDN. Cl- were 80 ± 3 kJ mol- 1 and 59 ± 1 kJ mol- 1.
