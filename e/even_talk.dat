5|$|Homer {{realizes he}} needs to make amends with Lisa, but she is too hurt to <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> with him. Homer briefly cheers her up, but shows that he still only wants to win a bet. She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E

25|$|William Matheson died in 1930, {{leaving the}} island to his children. There was a flurry of {{interest}} in 1939, when the U.S. Navy approved a proposal to develop Virginia Key as an air base and sea port. There was <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> of putting an air base on {{the north end of}} Key Biscayne, as well. In 1940 William Matheson's heirs donated 808.8 acres (327.3 hectares) of land (including two miles (3.2km) of beach on the Atlantic Ocean) on the northern end of Key Biscayne to Dade County {{to be used as a}} public park (Crandon Park). The county commissioner who negotiated the gift, Charles H. Crandon, had offered for the county to build a causeway to Key Biscayne in exchange for the land donation. Planning for the air and sea complex on Virginia Key was still proceeding, and construction on a causeway to Virginia Key started in 1941. The Attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II stopped all work on the causeway and the development of Virginia Key.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, the Ottoman Empire's Kars region—including Ani—was {{incorporated}} into the Russian Empire's Transcaucasian region. In 1892 the first archaeological excavations were conducted at Ani, sponsored by the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and supervised by the Russian archaeologist and orientalist Nicholas Marr (1864–1934). Marr's excavations at Ani resumed in 1904 and continued yearly until 1917. Large sectors of the city were professionally excavated, numerous buildings were uncovered and measured, the finds were studied and published in academic journals, guidebooks for the monuments and the museum were written, and the whole site was surveyed for the first time. Emergency repairs were also undertaken on those buildings that were most at risk of collapse. A museum was established to house {{the tens of thousands}} of items found during the excavations. This museum was housed in two buildings: the Minuchihr mosque, and a purpose-built stone building. Armenians from neighboring villages and towns also began to visit the city on a regular basis, and there was <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> by Marr's team of building a school for educating the local Armenian children, building parks, and planting trees to beautify the site.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for a Billboard podcast, Nile Rodgers spoke about the song's recording sessions and working with Gaga and Warren. He had met Gaga in a party and she invited him to join them in the studio. During recording, Gaga was singing in a D note, over the F note of the music that was being played. Rodgers suggested to Warren that since the D vocals made the song sound like a country track, they could instead inverse the chords into thirteenth (an octave plus a sixth), thus serving a dominant function. Warren accepted the suggestion and the song was re-recorded. Gaga reportedly struggled while recording the song, since it caused her to recall her own trauma. Warren explained that it was: [...] "very emotional for her. She couldn't <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> through it at times". Gaga told {{an interview}}er with Variety that Warren had helped her feel comfortable about the song and its subject matter, allowing her to transcend the singing and put the correct emotional depth in her performance.|$|E

On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 [...] "Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. He says of Adams, [...] "Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> about; but they all know Doc Adams.

[...] Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot.
