In a manner similar to his preparation for Bird, he again immersed himself in his character's world—he studied Eastern philosophy and meditated for long hours [...] "to hone his inner spiritual hitman." [...] Jarmusch has told interviewers that he developed the title character with Whitaker in mind; The New York Times review of the film observed that [...] "t's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> another actor who could play a cold-blooded killer with such warmth and humanity." ...|$|E

The critic Michael Oliver wrote, [...] "Fauré's Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity." [...] Jessica Duchen calls them [...] "unusual slivers of magical inventiveness." [...] The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play.

500|$|Swanton {{believed}} that Constantine {{was the first}} West Indian cricketer to make an impression on the British public: [...] "he... personified West Indian cricket from the first faltering entry in the Test arena in 1928 until the post-war emergence of the trinity of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott." [...] Swanton continued: [...] "There have been many all-rounders with better records... but it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> one who made a more sensational impact [...] impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere." [...] In 1934 Neville Cardus described Constantine as a [...] "genius" [...] and the [...] "most original cricketer of recent years". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow called Constantine the most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries. This was partly because his style of cricket meant that he could alter {{the course of a}} match in a short space of time, although he developed his technique to minimise risk.|$|E

500|$|Deryck Cooke {{argues that}} Mahler's {{popularity}} escalated when a new, postwar generation of music-lovers arose, untainted by [...] "the dated polemics of anti-romanticism" [...] which had affected Mahler's {{reputation in the}} inter-war years. In this more liberated age, enthusiasm for Mahler expanded even into places—Spain, France, Italy—which had long been resistant to him. Robert Carr's simpler explanation for the 1950s Mahler revival is that [...] "it was the long-playing record [...] rather than the Zeitgeist which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible. Mahler's work became accessible and repeatable in the home." [...] In the years following his centenary in 1960, Mahler rapidly {{became one of the}} most performed and most recorded of all composers, and has largely remained thus. In Britain and elsewhere, Carr notes, the extent of Mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut, bringing problems of over-familiarity. Harold Schonberg comments that [...] "it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a composer who arouses equal loyalty," [...] adding that [...] "a response of anything short of rapture to the Mahler symphonies will bring [...] long letters of furious denunciation." ...|$|E

[...] Mark Ribowsky, another Spector biographer, writes of the producer's contribution to this and other songs on All Things Must Pass: [...] "Phil's rhythmically pounding basses and drum feels sutured George's sentimentality with cheerful energy and made Indian asceticism into dance music." [...] Simon Leng describes [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as a [...] "hot gospel stomper" [...] and [...] "the most successful example of Spector's work on the album". Writing for NME Originals in 2005, Adrian Thrills named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as examples of [...] "a tendency to over-egg the mix" [...] on the otherwise [...] "magnificent" [...] All Things Must Pass, adding: [...] "it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> another big rock album on which the tambourine is shaken quite so relentlessly." ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} dominance effect in relative clause descriptions of concept conjunctions such as peer {{that are also}} birds. It was shown that the dominance effect is a general phenomenon, {{both in terms of}} combined concepts (with 2 / 3 of the 50 conjunctions studied showing the effect) and in terms of different tasks (membership ratings, exemplar generation, and category naming). A considerable amount of the effect could be accounted for by an unweighted sum of the membership ratings for the 2 constituents. The part of the dominance effect that could not be explained by an unweighted sum was best predicted by exemplar-based pairwise differentiation between the 2 constituents, meaning that dominance partly depends on an interactional process. The pairwise differentiation was shown to be interpretable as proportional overlap of the extension: The constituent for which it was <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> exemplars outside the conjunction dominated. Finally, 2 theories were discussed that can explain the results. status: publishe...|$|R

Holly Pittman, an art historian at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says, [...] "they [...] are participating entirely in an Uruk way of life. [...] They are not culturally distinct; the material culture of Susa is a regional variation of that on the Mesopotamian plain". Gilbert Stein, director of the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute, says that [...] "An expansion once thought to have lasted less than 200 years now apparently went on for 700 years. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any colonial system lasting that long. The spread of Uruk material is not evidence of Uruk domination; it could be local choice".|$|E

50|$|When people {{judge whether}} more English words begin with T or with K, the {{availability}} heuristic gives {{a quick way}} to answer the question. Words that begin with T come more readily to mind, and so subjects give a correct answer without counting out large numbers of words. However, this heuristic can also produce errors. When people are asked whether there are more English words with K in the first position or with K in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> words that begin with K, such as kangaroo, kitchen, or kept. It is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> words with K as the third letter, such as lake, or acknowledge, although objectively these are three times more common. This leads people to the incorrect conclusion that K is more common at the start of words. In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. Tversky and Kahneman's interpretation of these results is that judgments of proportion are based on availability, which is higher for the names of better-known people.|$|R

2500|$|The game {{utilized}} a {{new game}} engine; the Dark Alliance Engine, {{which was built}} specifically for Dark Alliance, and {{would go on to}} become the foundation for other games on the PlayStation 2, such as [...] and The Bard's Tale. Graphically, the Dark Alliance engine is a major improvement over the engine used by the original PC Baldur's Gate games, the Infinity Engine. Infinity was only able to render 2D sprite characters and static environments. The Dark Alliance engine, on the other hand, made use of the PlayStation 2's advanced GPU, allowing for such improvements as dynamic lighting, real-time shadowing and 3D models of characters and environments. IGN wrote of the E3 presentation, [...] "None of the problems that are commonly associated with PlayStation 2 games, such as low-res textures, flickering, or aliasing problems, are to be found here. It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a game that pulls off the much-fabled anti-aliasing as well as this game does. Dark Alliance uses a technique similar to what a large number of Dreamcast games did to pull off their clean look: they simply render the scene at a much higher resolution, anti-alias it, then drop it down to a more acceptable resolution for TVs. The result is a beautifully anti-aliased game." ...|$|E
