500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, <b>ground</b> <b>cloves,</b> and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E

40|$|Planting sterilized corn grains in soil, {{treated with}} the mold inhibitors Fix-a-tox (FAT) or Antitox Plus (AP) resulted, in cases, in dwarfed and malformed corn plants and in the {{development}} of deformed, bone-shaped and grain-free corn cobs. Moreover, treating corn grains with the mold inhibitors before storage for one month caused significant changes in some nutritional components of corn grains, i. e. proteins, aminoacids, crude fibers, moisture, fats, ash and carbohydrates. Insignificant differences in protein percetage were detected between control inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and those treated with butyl hydroxyanisole (BHA) antioxidant or FAT treatments, whereas <b>ground</b> <b>clove</b> significantly reduced protein content. In corn grains inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides, previous treatment with FAT resulted in significant reduction in the content of proline, aspartic acid, cysteine, valine, isoleucine and leucine, whereas treatment with BHA significantly reduced the content of threonine, serine, glutamic, glycine, alanine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. In Aspergillus flavus treatments, FAT significantly increased the content of methionine and threonine, whereas, aspartic acid showed 26 percentage decreases, compared to the control. Pronounced reductions in threonine, isoleucine and leucine were also detected in corn grains treated with BHA. Significant increases in fiber content were detected in inoculated corn grains treated with BHA, attaining 1. 34 to 2. 05 -fold over that of control, respectively. Treatment with FAT and BHA led to pronounced reductions in moisture content in corn inoculated with both F. verticilloides and A. flavus trials. However, treatment with <b>ground</b> <b>clove</b> significantly increase...|$|R

5000|$|The Christmas {{market at}} Nuremberg (Christkindlmarkt) is more {{famous for its}} {{gingerbread}} known as Lebkuchen, but the Striezelmarkt's gingerbread has nearly as long a history. Pfefferkuchen literally means [...] "pepper cake": the word [...] "pepper" [...] was used to mean any new foreign spice. The gingerbread sold at the Striezelmarkt comes from Pulsnitz, a town about 50 km from Dresden; it was first mentioned as a speciality from Pulsnitz in a decree issued in 1558 allowing bakers to produce it there. Pfefferkuchen are usually filled with marmalade or jam and covered with chocolate. Unlike gingerbread from other countries, the dough does not usually contain any fat, or indeed ginger, but instead nutmeg, cinnamon, <b>ground</b> <b>cloves</b> and allspice, which are added after the dough has been left up to 6 months to mature. In 1780 eight master bakers came personally from Pulsnitz to sell their wares at the Striezelmarkt; today {{there are many more}} Pfefferkuchen stands, but the gingerbread is usually sold by hired staff.|$|E

At 210 and 240 days, free choice arena and repellency testswere conducted.

25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver with chopped giblet, <b>ground</b> ginger, cinnamon, <b>cloves,</b> wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|R
