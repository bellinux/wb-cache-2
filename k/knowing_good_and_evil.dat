60|$|Fanny's First Play, being but a potboiler, {{needs no}} preface. But its lesson is not, I {{am sorry to}} say, unneeded. Mere morality, or the {{substitution}} of custom for conscience was once accounted a shameful and cynical thing: people talked of right and wrong, of honor and dishonor, of sin and grace, of salvation and damnation, not of morality and immorality. The word morality, if we met it in the Bible, would surprise us {{as much as the}} word telephone or motor car. Nowadays we do not seem to know that there is any other test of conduct except morality; and {{the result is that the}} young had better have their souls awakened by disgrace, capture by the police, and a month's hard labor, than drift along from their cradles to their graves doing what other people do for no other reason than that other people do it, <b>and</b> <b>knowing</b> nothing of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> of courage <b>and</b> cowardice, or indeed anything but how to keep hunger and concupiscence and fashionable dressing within the bounds of good taste except when their excesses can be concealed. Is it any wonder that I am driven to offer to young people in our suburbs the desperate advice: Do something that will get you into trouble? But please do not suppose that I defend a state of things which makes such advice the best that can be given under the circumstances, or that I do not know how difficult it is to find out a way of getting into trouble that will combine loss of respectability with integrity of self-respect and reasonable consideration for other peoples' feelings and interests on every point except their dread of losing their own respectability. But when there's a will there's a way. I hate to see dead people walking about: it is unnatural. And our respectable middle class people are all as dead as mutton. Out of the mouth of Mrs Knox I have delivered on them the judgment of her God.|$|R

60|$|But--paradoxical {{as it may}} seem--the woman's {{yielding}} {{before the}} man is not altogether to her dishonour, as those old monks used to allege who hated, and too often tortured, the sex whom they could not enjoy. It is not to the woman's dishonour, if she felt, before her husband, higher aspirations than those after mere animal pleasure. To be as gods, <b>knowing</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> is a vain and foolish, but not a base and brutal, wish. She proved herself thereby--though at an awful cost--a woman, and not an animal. And indeed the woman's more delicate organisation, her more vivid emotions, her more voluble fancy, {{as well as her}} mere physical weakness and weariness, have been to her, in all ages, a special source of temptation which it is to her honour that she has resisted so much better than the physically stronger, and therefore more culpable, man.|$|E

60|$|Good {{and evil}} {{we know in}} the field of this world grow up {{together}} almost inseparably; and the knowledge of good is so involved and interwoven with the knowledge of evil, and in so many cunning resemblances hardly to be discerned, that those confused seeds which were imposed upon Psyche as an incessant labour to cull out, and sort asunder, were not more intermixed. It was from out the rind of one apple tasted, that the knowledge of good and evil, as two twins cleaving together, leaped forth into the world. And perhaps this is that doom which Adam fell into of <b>knowing</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> that is to say of knowing good by evil. As therefore the state of man now is; what wisdom can there be to choose, what continence to forbear without the knowledge of evil? He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures, and yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better, he is the true warfaring Christian.|$|E
60|$|But {{she was to}} be no more exercised; for Mr. Archer, disclaiming {{any thought}} of flattery, turned off to other subjects, and held her all through the wood in conversation, {{addressing}} her with an air of perfect sincerity, and listening to her answers with every mark of interest. Had open flattery continued, Nance would have soon found refuge in good sense; but the more subtle lure she could not suspect, much less avoid. It {{was the first time she}} had ever taken part in a conversation illuminated by any ideas. All was then true that she had heard and dreamed of gentlemen; they were a race apart, like deities <b>knowing</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b> And then there burst upon her soul a divine thought, hope's glorious sunrise: since she could understand, since it seemed that she too, even she, could interest this sorrowful Apollo, might she not learn? or was she not learning? Would not her soul awake and put forth wings? Was she not, in fact, an enchanted princess, waiting but a touch to become royal? She saw herself transformed, radiantly attired, but in the most exquisite taste: her face grown longer and more refined; her tint etherealised; and she heard herself with delighted wonder talking like a book.|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{so it has}} been, {{under some}} form or other, in every race and clime--ever since Eve ate of the magic fruit, {{that she might be}} as a god, <b>knowing</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> and found, poor thing, as most have since, that it was far easier and more {{pleasant}} to know the evil than to know the good. But that theatre was built that men might know therein the good as well as the evil. To learn the evil, indeed, according to their light, and the sure vengeance of Ate and the Furies which tracks up the evil-doer. But to learn also the good-- lessons of piety, patriotism, heroism, justice, mercy, self- sacrifice, and all that comes out of the hearts of men and women not dragged below, but raised above themselves; and behind all--at least in the nobler and earlier tragedies of AEschylus and Sophocles, before Euripides had introduced the tragedy of mere human passion; that sensation tragedy, which is the only one the world knows now, and of which the world is growing rapidly tired--behind all, I say, lessons of the awful and unfathomable mystery of human existence--of unseen destiny; of that seemingly capricious distribution of weal and woe, to which we can find no solution on this side the grave, for which the old Greek could find no solution whatsoever.|$|E

6000|$|Did it {{not happen}} to us, {{as it did}} to Adam, that a feeling of shame and guiltiness came over us at once? Yes; of shame. We {{intended}} to feed our own pride: but instead of pride came shame and fear too; so instead of rising, we had fallen and felt that we had fallen. Just {{so it was with}} Adam. Instead of feeling all the prouder and grander when he had sinned, he became ashamed of himself at once, he hardly knew why. We had intended to set ourselves up against our parents; but instead, we became afraid of them. We were always fancying that they would find us out. We were afraid of looking them in the face. Just so it was with Adam. He heard the word of the Lord God, Jesus Christ, walking in the garden. Did he go to meet him; thank him for that pleasant life, pleasant earth, for the mere blessing of existence? No. He hid himself among the trees of the garden. But why hide himself? Even if he had given up being thankful to God; even if he had learned from the devil to believe that God grudged him, envied him, had deceived him, about that fruit, why run away and hide? He wanted to be as God, wise, <b>knowing</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> for himself. Why did he not stand out boldly when he heard the voice of the Lord God and say, I am wise now; I am as a God now, knowing good and evil; I am no longer to be led like a child, and kept strictly by rules which I do not understand; I have a right to judge for myself, and choose for myself; and I have done it, and you have no right to complain of me? ...|$|E
60|$|But, says St. Augustine, if {{he tries}} to live {{according}} to himself, he falls into misery, because he was meant to live according to God. So he puts himself into a lie, into a false and wrong state; and because he has cut himself off from God he falls below what a man should be; and puts on {{more and more of}} the likeness of the beast, and is more and more the slave of his own lusts, and passions, and fancies, as the dumb animals are. And, as St. Paul says, the animal man, the carnal man, understands not the things of God. And we need no one to tell us that this is the state of nature which we bring into the world with us. We feel it; from our very childhood, from the earliest time we can recollect, have we not had the longing to do what we liked? to please ourselves, to pride ourselves on ourselves, to set up our own wills against our parents, against what we learnt out of the Bible? Ay, has not this wilful will of ours been so strong, that often we would long after a thing, we would determine to have it, only because we were forbidden to have it; we might not care about the thing when we had it, but we would have our own way just because it was our own way. In short, like Adam, we would be as gods, <b>knowing</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> and choosing for ourselves what we should call good and what we shall call evil. And, my dear friends, consider: did not every wrong that we ever did come from this one root of all sin--determining to have our own way? That root-sin of self-will first brought death and misery among mankind; that sin of self-will keeps it up still: that sin of self-will it is which hinders sinners from giving themselves up to God; and that sin must be broken through, or religion is a mockery and a dream.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the nuances}} of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> in {{literary}} representation has been a trend in the neo-academic circle. Within the framework of Leadership Studies, the present paper locates Shakespeare’s Macbeth (1606) central {{to the understanding of}} the concepts of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> in leading. The first section critically introduces the concepts of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> <b>and</b> their place in leading and Kant’s view on <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b> The second section gives a short summary of the plot of the play Macbeth. In the third and fourth section I argue that Macbeth is a potential text for an emphatic understanding of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> in leading; I highlight the ethical dimension in leading and leadership. It not only argue that the character of Macbeth can be represented as prototypes of understanding the dynamics of righteous <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> leaders, I also suggest that teaching ethical issues of leadership can be strengthened by an analysis of the character of Macbeth. The last section draws parallels with real-life case bringing out the consequences of unethical leading. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{first man}} and woman are in God's garden of Eden, where all {{creation}} is vegetarian {{and there is no}} violence. They are permitted to eat of all the trees save one, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the woman is tempted by a talking serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, and gives some to the man, who eats also. (Contrary to popular myth she does not beguile the man, who appears to have been present at the encounter with the serpent). God curses all three, the man to a lifetime of hard labour followed by death, the woman to the pain of childbirth and to subordination to her husband, and the serpent to go on his belly and suffer the enmity of both {{man and woman}}.

As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly. ” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth. ” But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other. ” So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth. – Genesis 11 : 1 - 9 (NIV) In the third chapter of Genesis, man succumbed to temptation and disobeyed God.

40|$|Ye {{shall be}} as gods, <b>knowing</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> " the serpent promised Eve. Mankind wanted godhood and {{believed}} Satan's half-truth. As eternal existence without {{the power to}} have eternal health is no blessing, so is knowledge {{of good and evil}} without the power to enforce the good. Pretenders to God's throne must have all the divine qualities in full measure. One of God's attributes is infallibility. Anyone who wants to be God will be pressed toward this unattainable goal and will realize only frustration. Medical practice today reveals frustration arising from a pretense of infallibility. Our nation has progressively disowned God and legitimate human authorities whom He has appointed. Thus, we come under increasing pressure to manifest God's powers personally. Though we want His autonomy, we lack the ability and despise the responsibility which goes with it. An escape from our dilemma is to anoint some human institution with improper authority in order to displace responsibility from ourselves. 1 But no sooner has an entity been charged with authority than we rebel. We resent authority whether it is legitimate or not. Medicine is an institutional target for today's rebellion because of its legitimate and illegitimate authority. Physicians ' actual authority over free patients is quite limited and is wholly derived from our patients' responsibility for themselves. Our duty is to encourage patients ' accountability to God as it relates to health. We should not accept responsibility for the patient's self, governance nor can we properly be held by patients to possess God's powers on their behalf.
