All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like {{two or three years ago}} and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at the time that I needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy {{but it sounds like}} it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The No. 88, {{according}} to NASCAR archives, {{was driven by}} Ralph Earnhardt, his paternal grandfather, in 1957. His maternal grandfather, Robert Gee, {{was one of the}} first employees of All Star Racing, initially a Late Model Sportsman (now Xfinity Series) team with Gee as Hendrick's partner, which is now Hendrick Motorsports. Hendrick said about Earnhardt and his uncles, [...] "I can look at Robert Gee Jr., or Jimmy Gee, or Dale Jr., and all I see is Robert Gee. They're the spitting image of him. I go back and look and pictures from when we did things together, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> owe Robert a lot." [...] Starting in the 2008 season, Hendrick Motorsports merged its Nationwide Series team to Earnhardt's JR Motorsports, with the cars coming from Earnhardt's shop, which employs his mother and uncles.|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson's third studio album, My December, was {{released}} on June 22, 2007. The album relied on darker themes and features a heavier rock sound. Clarkson replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks. She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators. Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis. He noted the album's lack of professional production input and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused. Clarkson defended, [...] "I've sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't give a crap about being a star. I've always just wanted to sing and write." [...] The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore. Clarkson later hired the services of talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management. Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend. Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as [...] "a key advisor" [...] in her success.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{controversy}} artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: [...] "As the guy who recorded the record <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions." [...] Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that [...] "Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; {{there are many people who}} work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you." ...|$|E
