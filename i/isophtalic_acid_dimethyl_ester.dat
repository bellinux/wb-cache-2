40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was the {{evaluation}} of personal exposure to chemical pollutants in workers employed in a plant {{for the production of}} terephtalic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester.</b> Chemical agents have been included in the monitoring program {{on the basis of the}} industrial process. In the plant, the oxidation of p-xylene is performed by air and the resulting acid is esterified with methyl alcohol. Purified terephtalic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester</b> is then utilized for the production of polyethylene terephtalate. The environmental monitoring included terephtalic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester,</b> p-toluic <b>acid</b> methyl ester, terephtalic acid, p-xylene, methylacetate, methylbenzoate, formic acid, acetic acid, methanol, and the catalysts cobalt acetate and manganese (II) acetate tetrahydrate. Personal exposure to the cited airborne substances was performed in the breathing zone of six workers. Air samplings were carried out by drawing air through glass fibre filters (terephtalic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester,</b> p-toluic <b>acid</b> methyl ester and terephtalic acid aerosols), by active adsorption (methanol, formic and acetic acids vapours). p-Xylene, methylacetate and methylbenzoate vapours were collected by passive sampling.

The results were evaluated according to the threshold limit values (TLVs) of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and indicated that the environmental levels of the workplace pollutants were well below the threshold limit values-time weighed average (TLV-TWA) adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists for 2002, although for three substances the TLVs were not available...|$|R

40|$|Both α- and β-D-glucose pentaacetate (1. 7 mM each) augmented, {{to almost}} the same extent, insulin release caused by succinic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester</b> (10. 0 mM) in rat {{pancreatic}} islets. The secretory response to these hexose esters largely exceeded that evoked by unesterified D-glucose tested at the same concentration (1. 7 mM). The release of insulin provoked by succinic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester</b> was inhibited, however, by α-D-galactose pentaacetate, whilst being unaffected by β-D-galactose pentaacetate (each also 1. 7 mM). It appears, therefore, that the insulinotropic action of hexose esters is not attributable solely to the catabolism of their carbohydrate moiety, but may also involve a receptor system that displays anomeric specificity and can be directly activated or inhibited by the esters themselves. Hence, it is proposed that selected esters of non-nutrient monosaccharides may represent new tools to either stimulate insulin release in diabetes or prevent excessive hormonal secretion in situations of hyperinsulinemia.

40|$|Conclusion. The polyacetate esters of {{selected}} nonnutrient monosaccharides represent potential tools for either stimulation of insulin release in noninsulin-dependent diabetes or inhibition of insulin secretion in hyperinsulinemic syndromes. Background. The polyacetate esters of several monosaccharides were recently shown to display greater nutritional value or biological efficiency than the corresponding unesterified carbohydrates. Methods. The effects of seven polyacetate esters of monosaccharides, all tested at a 1. 7 -mM concentration, on both 45 Ca efflux and insulin release were investigated in prelabeled rat pancreatic islets perifused {{in the presence}} of 10. 0 mM succinic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester.</b> Results. Both α-D-glucose penta-acetate and, to a lesser extent, β-L-glucose penta-acetate stimulated insulin release. Inversely, α-D-galactose penta-acetate, but not β-D- galactose penta-acetate inhibited insulin secretion evoked by succinic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester.</b> Esters of carbohydrates which are inhibitors of D-glucose metabolism, such as D-mannoheptulose hexa-acetate and the two anomers of 2 - deoxy-D-glucose tetra-acetate also enhanced insulin output, with a preference for the α-anomer of 2 -deoxy-D-glucose tetra-acetate.

The glass transition temperature identified for this polymer was 17. 6 °C lower than that recently determined for a closely related polythiophene derivative, in which the ester substituent arose from acrylic acid rather than from malonic acid. On the other hand, the electrical conductivity of the new material, which was soluble in polar solvents but not in water, was higher than that typically found for poly(3 -alkylthiophene) derivatives. Ab initio quantum mechanical calculations on simple model compounds were used to predict the regiochemistry of the polymer chain, which was in excellent agreement with the experimental observation, and the conformational preferences of both the inter-ring dihedral angle and the bulky side group. Interestingly, calculations predict that the inter-ring dihedral angles adopt a syn-gauche conformation rather than the anti-gauche arrangement typically found in substituted polythiophenes. Thus, in this case the former conformation reduces the strong repulsive interactions induced by the bulky substituent. The lowest π–π* transition energy derived from calculations on an idealized molecular model is in agreement with the experimental estimation determined using UV–vis spectroscopy. This electronic property is significantly higher for poly(2 -thiophen- 3 -yl-malonic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester)</b> than for other substituted polythiophene derivatives, which is consequence of the geometrical distortions induced by bulky side group.

40|$|Recent {{work in our}} {{laboratory}} {{indicated that}} the inhibitory effect of ammonium (NH 4 +) on assimilatory nitrate reductase (ANR) activity in soil is not due to NH 4 + per se but to glutamine formed by microbial assimilation of NH 4 +.

The studies with the L-glutamine analogs showed that all except L-glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester</b> inhibited ANR activity in soil. The sharp contrast observed between the strong inhibitory effect of L-glutamic acid gamma-methyl ester on ANR activity and the complete lack of an inhibitory effect with the corresponding <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester</b> suggests that only the free-acid form of glutamine effectively inhibits ANR activity. The studies with hydroxylamine and methylamine showed that both of these ammonium analogs inhibited ANR activity in soil and that this inhibition was dependent upon glutamine synthetase activity.

40|$|The role of Tyr- 69 of porcine {{pancreatic}} phospholipase A 2 in substrate binding was {{studied with}} the help of proteins modified by site-directed mutagenesis and phospholipid analogues with a changed head-group geometry. Two mutants were used containing Phe and Lys, respectively, at position 69. Modifications in the phospholipids included introduction of a sulfur at the phosphorus (thionophospholipids), removal of the negative charge at phosphorus (phosphatidic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester),</b> and reduction (phosphonolipids) or extension (diacylbutanetriol choline phosphate) of the distance between the phosphorus and the acyl ester bond. Replacement of Tyr- 69 by Lys reduces enzymatic activity, but the mutant enzyme retains both the stereospecificity and positional specificity of native phospholipase A 2. The Phe- 69 mutant not only hydrolyzes the Rp isomer of thionophospholipids more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme, but the Sp thiono isomer is hydrolyzed too, although at a low (~ 4 %) rate. Phosphonolipids are hydrolyzed by native phospholipase A 2 about 7 times more slowly than natural phospholipids, with retention of positional specificity and a (partial) loss of stereospecificity. The <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester</b> of phosphatidic <b>acid</b> is degraded efficiently in a calcium-dependent and positional-specific way by native phospholipase A 2 and by the mutants, indicating that a negative charge at phosphorus is not an absolute substrate requirement. The activities on the phosphatidic <b>acid</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ester</b> of native enzyme and the Lys- 69 mutant are lower than those on the corresponding lecithin, in contrast to the Phe- 69 mutant, which has equal activities on both substrates. Our data suggest that in porcine pancreatic phospholipase A 2 fixation of the phosphate group is achieved both by an interaction with the phenolic OH of Tyr- 69 and by an interaction with the calcium ion. In the mutant Y 69 K the ε-NH 2 group can play a role {{similar to that of the}} Tyr OH group in native PLA 2. The smaller side chain of the Y 69 F mutant can interact with more bulky head groups, allowing for relatively high enzymatic activities on modified phospholipids.

In this method, surface-modified acetic cellulose membranes were used to extract the target analytes in water samples, the extracted analytes were back-extracted into {{a small amount of}} methanol, and gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detector (GCPFPD) was used to determine the concentrations of target analytes in the extracts. The recoveries obtained for the target analytes spiked into the water samples ranged from 66 to 94 %. The method detection limit for each target analyte was 0. 05 mug L- 1. The method developed in this study had shown the advantages of being cheap, simple, fast, and reliable. It had been used successfully to determine the concentrations of target analytes in river water samples...|$|R
