5000|$|The Royal Navy Type <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> {{charge was}} {{designated}} the [...] "Mark VII" [...] in 1939. Initial sinking speed was 7 ft/s with a terminal velocity of 9.9 ft/s {{at a depth}} of 250 ft if rolled off the stern, or upon water contact from a depth charge thrower. Cast iron weights of 150 lb were attached to the Mark VII at the end of 1940 to increase sinking velocity to 16.8 ft/s. New hydrostatic pistols increased the maximum detonation depth to 900 ft. The Mark VII's 290 lb amatol charge was estimated to be capable of splitting a 7/8 inch mm submarine pressure hull at a distance of 20 ft, and forcing the submarine to surface at twice that. The change of explosive to Torpex (or Minol) at the end of 1942 was estimated to increase those distances to 26 and 52 ft.|$|E

This paper presents a multi-baseline, coarse-to-fine stereo algorithm which utilizes any number of images (more than 2) and multiple image scales to recover 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> information. Several "view-selection strategies " are introduced for combining information across the multi-baseline and across scale space. The control strategies allow us to exploit, maximally, the benefits of large and small baselines and mask sizes while minimizing errors.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> cue-based generic {{categorical}} object detection model, which extends our previous 2 D feature-based object detection method for object detection with severe occlusions. Since the novel model integrates complementary 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> cue with 2 D appearance and shape features, it significantly improves the detection performance and robustness {{of the current}} 2 D-based object detection system. The depth cue, derived from the disparity map, is obtained via stereo matching of input image pairs. Disparity map is clustered to different layers, then appearance and shape features are extracted at each layer and matched with the learnt 2 D codebooks. Finally, detection hypotheses at all layers are merged to generate the final detection result.

40|$|A vision based {{approach}} for calculating accurate 3 D {{models of the}} objects is presented. Generally industrial visual inspection systems capable of accurate 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> estimation rely on extra hardware tools like laser scanners or light pattern projectors. These tools improve the accuracy of depth estimation but also make the vision system costly and cumbersome. In the proposed algorithm, depth and dimensional accuracy of the produced 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> model depends on the existing reference model instead of the information from extra hardware tools. The proposed algorithm is a simple and cost effective software based approach to achieve accurate 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> estimation with minimal hardware involvement. The matching process uses the well-known coarse to fine strategy, involving the calculation of matching points at the coarsest level with consequent refinement up to the finest level. Vector coefficients of the wavelet transform-modulus are used as matching features, where wavelet transform-modulus maxima defines the shift invariant high-level features with phase pointing to the normal of the feature surface. The technique addresses the estimation of optimal corresponding points and the corresponding 2 D disparity maps leading {{to the creation of}} accurate depth perception model. <br /...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that both visual feedback {{and the presence of}} certain types of non-target objects in the workspace can affect kinematic measures and the trajectory path of the moving hand during reach-to-grasp movements. Yet no study to date has examined the possible effect of providing non-obstructing three-dimensional (3 <b>D)</b> <b>depth</b> cues within the workspace and with consistent retinal inputs and whether or not these alter manual prehension movements. Participants performed a series of reach-to-grasp movements in both open- (without visual feedback) and closed-loop (with visual feedback) conditions in the presence of one of three possible 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> cues. Here, it is reported that preventing online visual feedback (or not) and the presence of a particular depth cue {{had a profound effect on}} kinematic measures for both the reaching and grasping components of manual prehension—despite the fact that the 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> cues did not act as a physical obstruction at any point.

40|$|ABSTRACT Lameness is a {{major issue}} in dairy herds and its early and {{automated}} detection offers animal welfare benefits together with high potential commercial savings for farmers. Current advancements in automated detection have not achieved a sensitive measure for classifying early lameness. A novel proxy for lameness using 3 -dimensional (3 <b>D)</b> <b>depth</b> video data to analyse the animal’s gait asymmetry is introduced. This dynamic proxy is derived from the height variations in the hip joint during walking. The video capture setup is completely covert and it facilitates an automated process. The animals are recorded using an overhead 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> camera as they walk freely in single file after the milking session. A 3 <b>D</b> <b>depth</b> image of the cow’s body is used to automatically track key regions such as the hooks and the spine. The height movements are calculated from these regions to form the locomotion signals of this study, which are analysed using a Hilbert transform. Our results using a 1 - 5 locomotion scoring (LS) system on 22 Holstein Friesian dairy cows, a threshold could be identified between LS 1 and 2 (and above). This boundary is important as it represents the earliest point in time at which a cow is considered lame, and its early detection could improve intervention outcome thereby minimising losses and reducing animal suffering. Using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary classification model, the threshold achieved an accuracy of 95. 7...|$|E
