5|$|The term {{rumination}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word ruminare, which means to chew the cud. First described in ancient times, and mentioned in the writings of Aristotle, rumination syndrome was clinically documented in 1618 by Italian anatomist Fabricus ab Aquapendende, who wrote of the symptoms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> of his.|$|E
5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E

25|$|Metastatic cancers may {{be found}} {{at the same time as}} the primary tumor, or months or years later. When a second tumor is found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> that has been treated for cancer in the past, it is more often a {{metastasis}} than another primary tumor.|$|E

25|$|Illiterate {{patients}} who cannot read letters and/or numbers will be registered as having very low visual acuity {{if this is}} not known.

25|$|Multiple {{case reports}} of infective {{endocarditis}} caused by unusual organisms have been published.

25|$|Factors that {{increase}} maternal death can be direct or indirect. Generally, {{there is a}} distinction between a direct maternal death that {{is the result of}} a complication of the pregnancy, delivery, or management of the two, and an indirect maternal death, that is a pregnancy-related death <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with a preexisting or newly developed health problem unrelated to pregnancy. Fatalities during but unrelated to a pregnancy are termed accidental, incidental, or nonobstetrical maternal deaths.|$|E
25|$|A {{case report}} has been {{published}} in which mirtazapine reduced visual hallucinations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). This is in alignment with recent findings that inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A receptors are efficacious in attenuating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease psychosis. As {{is supported by the}} common practice of prescribing low-dose quetiapine and clozapine for PDP at doses too low to antagonize the D2 receptor, but sufficiently high doses to inversely agonize the 5-HT2A receptors.|$|E
25|$|A typeII error (or {{error of}} the second kind) is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Examples of type II errors would be a blood test failing to detect the disease it was {{designed}} to detect, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> who really has the disease; a fire breaking out and the fire alarm does not ring; or a clinical trial of a medical treatment failing to show that the treatment works when really it does.|$|E
