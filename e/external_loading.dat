Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E

30|$|When {{scapular}} upward {{rotation and}} SHR were compared according to <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> at 5 ° increments during arm elevation, {{we did not}} observe any significant differences in the scapular upward rotation angle or SHR, which confirms that <b>external</b> <b>load</b> does not influence these parameters. Similarly, Pascoal et al. (2000) analyzed scapular movement using 0 – 4  kg loads and an electromagnetic tracking device, and reported that <b>external</b> <b>load</b> did not influence SHR. Furthermore, de Castro et al. (2014) analyzed scapular movement during scapular plane elevation with a 5  % body weight load and videogrammetry, and reported that the amount of <b>external</b> <b>load</b> did not influence scapular movement. Thus, our findings are in agreement with previously reported findings.|$|R
50|$|The {{second factor}} is the small {{critical}} fiber length of the goethite fibers in limpet teeth. Critical fiber length is a parameter defining the fiber length that a material must be to transfer stresses from the matrix to the fibers themselves during <b>external</b> <b>loading.</b> Materials with a large critical fiber length (relative to the total fiber length) act as poor reinforcement fibers, meaning that most stresses are still loaded on the matrix. Materials with small critical fiber lengths (relative to the total fiber length) act as effective reinforcement fibers {{that are able to}} transfer stresses on the matrix to themselves. Goethite nanofibers express a critical fiber length of around 420 to 800 nm, which is several orders of magnitude away from their estimated fiber length of 3.1 um. This suggests that the goethite nanofibers serve as effective reinforcement for the collagen matrix and significantly contribute to the load-bearing capabilities of limpet teeth. This is further supported by the large mineral volume fraction of elongated goethite nanofibers within limpet teeth, around 0.81.|$|E
50|$|Trabecular is a cancellous and porous type of bone.  It can {{be found}} at the ends of long bones like the femur, where the bone is {{actually}} not solid but is full of holes connected by thin rods and plates of bone tissue. Red bone marrow, where all the blood cells are made, fills the space between the trabecular pores. Even though trabecular bone contains a lot of holes, its spatial complexity contributes the maximal strength with minimum mass. It is noted that the form and structure of trabecular bone are organized to optimally resist loads imposed by functional activities, like jumping, running and squatting. And according to the famous Wolff’s Law, proposed in 1892, the external shape and internal architecture of bone are determined by the external stresses acting on it. The internal structure of the trabecular bone firstly undergoes adaptive changes along stress direction and then the external shape of cortical bone undergoes secondary changes. Finally bone structure becomes thicker and denser to resist the <b>external</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|E

30|$|Inspired by {{the work}} [33] of input {{estimation}} in the inverse heating problem without the time history of external input, we proposed a biomechanical constrained sequential filtering framework which performs multiframe estimation of the nonrigid myocardial kinematic function and <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> of system simultaneously from medical image sequence. Our work is also developed from earlier works like the state-space-based motion recovery algorithms with the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> constructed from boundaries [21, 24] and model-based filtering framework with <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> simulated from an electromechanical coupling model [30]. Contrary to previous approaches using deterministic approximation of <b>external</b> <b>loads,</b> our proposed framework treats <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> as a stochastic input after the biomechanical model is converted into a stochastic state-space representation, which is more rational because of largely unknown knowledge of <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> of each patient's heart. Since the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> in our approach are treated as a stochastic variable, we start to call <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> as input forces from here, which is a proper description in the stochastic control theory [22]. Therefore, the main difference of our work to previous multiframe estimation efforts is that rather than making ad hoc mathematical assumptions {{on the behavior of}} input forces, we allow uncertainties inside input forces because of unobservable loading condition of the heart, which is a better description of clinical situation from the stochastic control theory point of view. To achieve optimal estimation, we cyclically feed the updated estimation of input forces and imaging-derived data into the filtering framework until reaching largely data-driven convergence: a Kalman filter is first used to generate the residual innovation sequences without input forces, followed by a recursive least-square filter which is derived to use the sequences of residual innovation to compute values of input forces to the myocardium. Finally, myocardial kinematic function can be recovered by using the estimated input forces.|$|R

40|$|Tendons possess both viscous (rate-dependent) and elastic (rate-independent) {{properties}} that determine tendon function. During high-speed movements <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> increases both the magnitude (FT) and rate (RFDT) of tendon loading. Purpose The influence of <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> on muscle and tendon dynamics during maximal vertical jumping was explored. Methods Ten resistance-trained men performed parallel-depth, countermovement vertical jumps {{with and without}} additional load (0 %, 30 %, 60 %, and 90 % of maximum squat lift strength), while joint kinetics and kinematics, quadriceps tendon length (LT) and patellar tendon FT and RFDT were estimated using integrated ultrasound, motion analysis and force platform data and muscle tendon modelling. Results Estimated FT and RFDT, but not peak LT, increased with <b>external</b> <b>loading.</b> Temporal comparisons between 0 % and 90 % loads revealed that FT was greater with 90 % loading throughout {{the majority of the}} movement (11 %- 81 % and 87 %- 95 % movement duration). However, RFDT was greater with 90 % load only during the early movement initiation phase (8 %- 15 % movement duration) but was greater in the 0 % load condition later in the eccentric phase (27 %- 38 % movement duration). LT was longer during the early movement (12 %- 23 % movement duration) but shorter in the late eccentric and early concentric phases (48 %- 55 % movement duration) with 90 % load. Discussion <b>External</b> <b>loading</b> positively influenced peak FT and RFDT but tendon strain appeared unaffected, suggesting no additive effect of <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> on patellar tendon lengthening during human jumping. Temporal analysis revealed that <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> resulted in a large initial RFDT that may have caused dynamic stiffening of the tendon and attenuated tendon strain throughout the movement. These results suggest that <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> influences tendon lengthening in both a load- and movement-dependent manner...|$|E

40|$|The solid {{materials}} surfaces will {{be found}} to be rough if magnified sufficiently, no matter how flat they may superficially appear to be. This article establishes a model to {{examine the effect of}} rough surface on the contact behavior of magneto-electro-elastic materials with partial or full contact with an orthotropic solid pressed by <b>external</b> <b>loading.</b> The lack between the two surfaces is featured by the gap at the peaks of the rough surfaces. It is found that when the <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> is far less than the critical loading, which is the minimum loading to approach the full contact, the relationship between the contact width and <b>external</b> <b>loading,</b> and the surface contact distribution have the same form as between two purely elastic cylinders in the theory of Hertzian contact. Numerical experiments are done to demonstrate how the component volume fraction of magneto-electro-elastic materials affects the contact behavior. Numerical results show that the contact region between magneto-electro-elastic materials and orthotropic solid is dominated by the <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> other than the component volume fraction of magneto-electro-elastic materials.

40|$|To {{navigate}} different environments, {{an animal}} {{must be able}} to adapt its locomotory gait to its physical surroundings. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, between swimming in water and crawling on surfaces, adapts its locomotory gait to surroundings that impose approximately 10, 000 -fold differences in mechanical resistance. Here we investigate this feat by studying the undulatory movements of C. elegans in Newtonian fluids spanning nearly five orders of magnitude in viscosity. In these fluids, the worm undulatory gait varies continuously with changes in <b>external</b> load: As <b>load</b> increases, both wavelength and frequency of undulation decrease. We also quantify the internal viscoelastic properties of the worm’s body and their role in locomotory dynamics. We incorporate muscle activity, internal <b>load,</b> and <b>external</b> <b>load</b> into a biomechanical model of locomotion and show that (i) muscle power is nearly constant across changes in locomotory gait, and (ii) the onset of gait adaptation occurs as <b>external</b> <b>load</b> becomes comparable to internal load. During the swimming gait, which is evoked by small <b>external</b> <b>loads,</b> muscle power is primarily devoted to bending the worm’s elastic body. During the crawling gait, evoked by large <b>external</b> <b>loads,</b> comparable muscle power is used to drive the <b>external</b> <b>load</b> and the elastic body.

40|$|A time-domain {{filtering}} {{algorithm is}} proposed to recover myocardial kinematic function using output-only measurements without the time history of <b>external</b> <b>loads.</b> The main contribution of this work is that the overall effect of all the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> on the myocardium is treated as a random variable disturbed by the Gaussian white noise because the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> of the myocardium are usually unknown in practical exercises. The kernel of our proposed algorithm is an iterative, multiframe, and sequential filtering procedure consisting of a Kalman filter and a least-squares filter.
