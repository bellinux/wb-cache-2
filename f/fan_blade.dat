5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 first ran in 1974. In April 1979, {{the joint}} venture had not {{received}} a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved. The program was saved when Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and Flying Tigers chose the CFM56 to re-engine their DC-8s and shortly thereafter it was chosen to re-engine the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet of the U.S. Air Force. The first engines entered service in 1982. Several <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> failure incidents were experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail. Both these issues were resolved with engine modifications.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the project about design and {{fabrication}} of ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> cleaner. 'Ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> cleaner' is device that can clean {{the top and bottom of}} surface ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> The fabrication of this product started with article review. All information about ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> cleaner such as design, price, material that had been used for the product specification analysis, concept designing, detail concept designing and fabrication of the product. From the analysis, a new design of ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> cleaner has been created. The investigation was made in scope of the constraint that may occur for the development of the product and relevance of the product manufacturing processes. This product have been fabricate according to fabrication process such as welding, cutting, drilling and assembling. For development of this project and future works, some suggestion was made for upgrading the product. The suggestion like the flexibility on these ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> cleaner and more lightweight on the holder will competitive with the existing products in the market...|$|R

40|$|The {{resistance}} of current-design Pratt and Whitney Aircraft low aspect ratio advanced fiber reinforced epoxy matrix composite <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> to {{foreign object damage}} (FOD) at STOL operating conditions was investigated. Five graphite/epoxy and five boron/epoxy wide chord <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> with nickel plated stainless steel leading edge sheath protection were fabricated and impact tested. The <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> were individually tested in a vacuum whirlpit under FOD environments. The FOD environments were typical of those encountered in service operations. The impact objects were ice balls, gravel, stralings and gelatin simulated birds. Results of the damage sustained from each FOD impact are presented for both the graphite boron reinforced blades. Tests showed that the present design composite <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> with wrap around leading edge protection have inadequate FOD impact resistance at 244 m/sec (800 ft/sec) tip speed, a possible STOL operating condition...|$|R

40|$|Two engine components, <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> and exhaust systems, were {{selected}} for composite materials development efforts {{in support of the}} supersonic cruise aircraft research (SCAR) engine program.

25|$|Jet engine {{ingestion}} {{is extremely}} serious {{due to the}} rotation speed of the engine fan and engine design. As the bird strikes a <b>fan</b> <b>blade,</b> that blade can be displaced into another blade and so forth, causing a cascading failure. Jet engines are particularly vulnerable during the takeoff phase when the engine is turning {{at a very high}} speed and the plane is at a low altitude where birds are more commonly found.|$|E
25|$|The BAe 146 {{is powered}} by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 {{turbofan}} engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft's high wing. The ALF 502 {{was derived from the}} Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy transport helicopter. Notably, the ALF 502 had a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most other competing aircraft. This was achieved largely {{through the use of a}} geared turbofan engine; the gearbox allows the <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> tip speed to stay below the speed of sound dramatically reducing the aircraft noise. Additionally other sound deadening measures include a high bypass ratio compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound damping layers built into the engine.|$|E
25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the {{required}} pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which {{is familiar to}} most as being used in vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> is too low and cannot be used.|$|E

500|$|Three {{days after}} his {{abduction}} and murder, Till's swollen and disfigured body was found by two boys who were fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very badly mutilated, {{he had been shot}} above the right ear, an eye was dislodged from the socket, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back and the hips, and his body weighted by a <b>fan</b> <b>blade,</b> which was fastened around his neck with barbed wire. He was nude, but wearing a silver ring with the initials [...] "L. T." [...] and [...] "May 25, 1943" [...] carved in it. [...] His face was unrecognizable due to trauma and having been submerged in water. Mose Wright was called to the river to identify Till. The silver ring that Till was wearing was removed and returned to Wright and next passed on to the district attorney as evidence.|$|E

The higher-thrust version will have some modifications to the fan module—it will be the same diameter but will run slightly faster and have a new <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> design—and run at increased temperatures allowed by new materials technologies from Rolls-Royce's research.|$|E

2500|$|The airflow {{created by}} the fans that is {{entering}} the tunnel is itself highly turbulent due to the <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> motion (when the fan is blowing air into the test section – when it is sucking {{air out of the}} test section downstream, the fan-blade turbulence is not a factor), and so is not directly useful for accurate measurements. The air moving through the tunnel needs to be relatively turbulence-free and [...] To correct this problem, closely spaced vertical and horizontal air vanes are used to smooth out the turbulent airflow before reaching the subject of the testing.|$|E
