40|$|The {{quality of}} dental {{prostheses}} {{is essential in}} providing good quality medical services. The metal ceramic technology applied in dentistry implies ceramic sintering inside the <b>dental</b> <b>oven.</b> Every ceramic material requires a special sintering chart which is recommended by the producer. For a regular dental technician {{it is very difficult}} to evaluate if the temperature inside the oven remains the same as it is programmed on the sintering chart. Also, maintaining the calibration in time is an issue for the practitioners. Metal ceramic crowns develop a very accurate pattern for the ceramic layers depending on the temperature variation inside the oven where they are processed. Different patterns were identified in the present study for the samples processed with a variation in temperature of + 30 Â°C to + 50 Â°C, respectively - 30 Â°C to - 50 Â°C. The OCT imagistic evaluations performed for the normal samples present a uniform spread of the ceramic granulation inside the ceramic materials. For the samples sintered at a higher temperature an alternation between white and darker areas between the enamel and opaque layers appear. For the samples sintered at a lower temperature a decrease in the ceramic granulation from the enamel towards the opaque layer is concluded. The TD-OCT methods can therefore be used efficiently for the detection of the temperature variation due to the ceramic sintering inside the ceramic oven. Â© 2014 Copyright SPIE...|$|E
40|$|The type IV {{dental stone}} {{is widely used}} for the {{fabrication}} of dyes and master casts for fixed and removable partial prostheses. It is typically normal to wait at least 24 hours for the casts to dry prior to beginning the laboratory procedures. The waiting time {{has been shown to}} be greatly reduced by using microwave drying. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the influence of drying techniques at room temperature and microwave oven on the linear dimensional change, compressive strength and detail reproduction in type IV dental stones. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three type IV dental stone brands were selected; elite Rock, Shera Premium and Durone IV. Two different drying protocols were tested in 4 groups (n= 10); G 1 - room temperature (25 ± 4 ºC) dried for 2 hours; G 2 - room temperature dried for 24 hours; G 3 - room temperature dried for 7 days and G 4 - microwave oven dried at 800 W for 5 minutes and after 2 hours at room temperature. After drying, the samples were assayed for dimensional charges. The sample surface was submitted to the ImageTool 3. 0 software for compressive strength in a universal testing machine with a cell load of 50 KN at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/minutes and the detail reproduction was analyzed with a stereomicroscope at 25 x magnification. The statistical analysis of the linear dimensional change and compressive strength data were conducted by the ANOVA test followed by the Tukey test (p< 0. 05). Detailed reproduction values were reported in percentages. RESULTS: For the compressive strength test, Elite Rock and Durone IV did not present significant differences between G 2 and G 4, while Shera Premium did not present differences between G 3 and G 4. The best reproduction levels were observed for G 3. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Dental</b> stone microwave <b>oven</b> drying showed a linear dimensional change similar to after room temperature drying for 24 hours and 7 days. The compressive strength of the stone dried in the microwave oven was similar to those dried at room temperature for 24 hours, with the exception of Shera Premium, which had similar results for microwave and room temperature drying for 7 days. For the microwave drying method the detail reproduction levels for samples dried at room temperature for 24 hours and 7 days were similar, except for the Durone IV...|$|R
