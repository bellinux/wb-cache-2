Food Building vendor Epic Burgers and Waffles' cronuts were tainted by Staphylococcus aureus toxin in 2013, a result of third party maple bacon jam. He advocated that the corporation discuss the issue directly and claimed <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> increase the fair's credibility with the public.|$|E
5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E

"Such a {{thing is}} {{impossible}} {{in the nature of}} things," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "for if any one class gets the control of the government of a country, they will of course manage {{it in such a way}} as to get the wealth and the honors mainly to themselves. I should <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> You <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Every body <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> It is human nature.

5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. <b>Doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Amompharetus: The {{leader of}} a {{battalion}} of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, since <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be shameful for a Spartan. Herodotus has an angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon {{the rest of the}} Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus' division behind. Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans. However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.|$|E
5|$|At noon on May 6, 1955, Conant, {{along with}} the high commissioners from Britain and France, signed the {{documents}} ending Allied control of West Germany, admitting it to NATO, and allowing it to rearm. The office of the United States High Commissioner was abolished and Conant became instead the first United States Ambassador to West Germany. His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> not result in a United States withdrawal. Being fluent in German, Conant {{was able to give}} speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.|$|E

5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully {{believe that}} by {{combining}} the surviving aircraft and pilots from Shōkaku and Zuikaku, {{it is likely that}} Zuikaku could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They also note that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which stressed that carriers and their airgroups must train as a single unit (in contrast, American air squadrons were considered interchangeable between carriers). In any case, the Japanese apparently made no serious attempt to get Zuikaku ready for the forthcoming battle.|$|E

5|$|In 1561, Swedish forces {{arrived and}} the noble {{corporations}} of Harrien–Wierland and Jerwen (Järva) yielded to Sweden {{to form the}} Duchy of Estonia. Reval, similarly, accepted Swedish rule. Denmark dominated the Baltic, and Sweden wished to challenge this by gaining territory on the Eastern side of the Baltic. <b>Doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> help Sweden control the West's trade with Russia. This helped to precipitate the Northern Seven Years' War since in 1561, Frederick II had already protested against Swedish presence in Reval, claiming historical rights relating to Danish Estonia. When Erik XIV's forces seized Pernau in June 1562, his diplomats tried to arrange Swedish protection for Riga, which brought him into conflict with Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the Chautauqua {{movement}} {{made its}} way to Gladstone. Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be a boon to the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E

5|$|In late 1990 {{consideration}} {{was given}} to deploying a squadron of F/A-18s to the Middle East {{as part of an}} expanded Australian contribution to the Gulf War. The Department of Defence opposed dispatching the aircraft on the grounds that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> greatly strain the fighter force in Australia, and this option was not adopted by the government. As a result, the Hornets' only role in the war was to support the training of the Royal Australian Navy warships which were sent to the Gulf by conducting mock attacks on the vessels as they sailed from Sydney to Perth.|$|E
5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want to}} deviate from them, as he did not believe <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{stipulated that}} {{researchers}} {{could not be}} prosecuted for cruelty, but that the animal must be anaesthetized, unless the anaesthesia would interfere with {{the point of the}} experiment. Each animal could be used only once, although several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted. The animal had to be killed when the study was over, unless <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> frustrate the object of the experiment. Prosecutions could take place only with the approval of the Home Secretary. At the time of the Brown Dog affair this was Aretas Akers-Douglas, who was unsympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist cause.|$|E

5|$|When Sulla {{returned}} in 82BC, {{he was made}} dictator {{for the purpose of}} bringing order to the Republic's politics. Sulla attempted to concentrate political power into the Senate and the aristocratic assemblies, whilst trying to reduce the obstructive and legislative powers of the tribune and Plebeian council. However, his changes were not to last. With significant popular unrest, the tribunate's powers were quickly restored by 70BC. Sulla passed legislation to make it illegal to march on Rome as he had, but having just shown that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> bring no personal harm so long as one was victorious, this had little effect.|$|E
5|$|A deal {{to upgrade}} {{several of the}} Chinooks was reached in May 1991. Under this arrangement, seven of the {{surviving}} CH-47Cs were sold to the US Army for $A40 million, the funds being used to partly {{cover the cost of}} upgrading the remaining four to CH-47D standard. The total cost of the project was $A62 million, of which $A42 million was required to upgrade the four helicopters and the remainder for spare parts, administration and new facilities for the Chinooks at Townsville. All eleven Chinooks were shipped to the United States in September 1993, and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995. It was decided to transfer the Chinooks to the Australian Army, as by this time the RAAF no longer had significant expertise in operating the type and <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> concentrate all of the ADF's battlefield helicopters with the same service.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
