The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think {{you are in the}} job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Beeman, who {{directed}} the episode, spoke about Remi Aubuchon's hiring. He said that Remi had [...] "a lot of {{ideas about how to}} keep the good stuff we’d established in Season 1", and [...] "diminish the things that weren’t as strong". Steven Spielberg's original conception of Falling Skies was that the characters in the series would be nomadic. The idea for the second season was to [...] "create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag-tag tents." [...] Chris Faloona, who was the Director of Photography in the first season, was unable to return due to commitments on another series, and Nate Goodman was hired. Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season, and soon after, Beeman called Connor Jessup, who plays Ben Mason, and said [...] "I’ve just heard what the plans are for you for this season. [...] And my strong advice <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a trainer and start eating your Wheaties! [...] You are in a HUGE storyline is going to revolve around you… [...] You’re a warrior, you’re a skitter killer and you’re a badass!" [...] Jessup hired a trainer that very day.|$|E
500|$|Barrons {{attained}} general officer {{status in}} 2008, {{when he was}} promoted to the substantive rank of major general and appointed Deputy Commanding General, Multi-National Corps – Iraq. He was posted to Baghdad, where he had responsibility for overseeing joint operations conducted by the multinational force and the Iraqi Army. Having served in Iraq, he returned to the UK to take up a staff post in April 2009 as chief of staff to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), but the appointment was short-lived as, in October 2009, he deployed to Afghanistan at short notice to establish a force reintegration unit, {{part of an effort to}} persuade Taliban fighters to rejoin society by offering alternatives to fighting, such as jobs and training—a role for which he was hand-picked by U.S. Army General Stanley A. McChrystal, then commander of all troops in Afghanistan. Barrons defended the controversial scheme in interviews, saying that it was not [...] "about buying insurgents off the battlefield" [...] and that [...] "the idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the whole community benefiting and turning against the insurgency". In a later interview, Barrons also said [...] "I am absolutely convinced it can be done, and that the time is right. This is an opportunity the Afghan people aren't going to get again. Most of them realize that, and are keen to take it now".|$|E

[...] "It's an old story to me, though. The great beauty of Venice <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> more for your money here than you can {{anywhere else in the}} world.

6000|$|Then, again, {{there is}} the {{personal}} reference. [...] "Meaning me, sir?" [...] Your victim with a blithe heart babbles of this or that.

[...] "Of course," [...] you say, [...] "I saw what you were driving at just this minute, when you mentioned mustard in salad dressing, but if I am peppery I am not mean.

6000|$|... "The {{one thing}} I bar," [...] he said, [...] "is {{having to get}} up at half-past five. And one day in the week, when there's a divisional field-day, it's half-past four. It's hardly worth while going to sleep at all. Still, it isn't so bad as it used to be. The first year I came to camp we used to have to do a three hours' field-day before brekker. We used to have coffee before it, and nothing else till it was over. By Jove, you felt you'd had enough of it before you got back. This is Laffan's Plain. The worst of Laffan's Plain <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to know it too well.

One of the people interviewed was a former volunteer who now works for the film festival. Another stated that the worst part was the pay, which {{was nothing more than}} a T-shirt. Some of the better things though <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to go to the films for free, and there is free food.

50|$|Spread over {{an area of}} 125 acre, the Dargah-e-Hakimi complex {{looks more}} like a five-star resort than a place of {{religious}} significance.

5000|$|Chris Lintott commented that: [...] "One {{advantage}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to see {{parts of}} space {{that have never}} been seen before. These images were taken by a robotic telescope and processed automatically, so the odds are that when you log on, that first galaxy you see will be one that no human has seen before."

So {{this is the first time}} they will have been seen by human eyes.".|$|E
50|$|John Doe (Jamie Bamber) is an {{ordinary}} man who decides to take the law {{into his own hands}} due to frustration with a failing legal system. Doe exacts his justice by killing one criminal at a time, and gaining attention from the media in the process, inspiring other copycat vigilantes. John Doe is a masked vigilante who goes out on the streets and hunts down serial killers so he can somewhat brutally murder them. One of the unique things about this indie film <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to hear both sides of the story, one of them from John Doe who has already been caught and arrested, and another from the media and police, which many films dealing with vigilantes focus less on.|$|E

5000|$|In 1992, King {{replaced}} Lush bassist, Steve Rippon, {{before the}} release of Lush's first proper album, Spooky. In a 2008 interview with Von Pip Musical Express, King recalled how he joined Lush: [...] "Miki called me up at work. I was a picture researcher at the NME at the time. I remember having {{read in the paper}} the story that Steve was leaving. We arranged to meet up in the not-that-famous-at-the-time pre-Britpop [...] "The Good Mixer" [...] in Camden Town. I lived just round the corner... We of course all got very drunk ...and I was in the band". He adds, [...] "It was a bit of an eyebrow raiser - but also a bit of a relief really - that they didn't even want me to do an audition.

5000|$|Squadron {{pilots in}} the Second World War {{considered}} the ready {{room to be}} a clubroom. One personal view from a World War II pilot stated: The funny thing about a ready room <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> attached to the hole. As much as you {{are attached to the}} ship. It's more than sentiment. It's an urge for protection. The loneliest feeling in the whole of a carrier pilot's world is when he's at sea with the gas running low, and he can't see his carrier. You think of the ready room then, and the noisy guys who make it the most desirable place in the world. It's your office, you live in it, it is the big thing in your life. &hellip;You sweat and worry in it, and grouse and argue, and you get mad at it when you can't hear yourself speak because everyone is yelling at once, but you're deeply attached to the place.
