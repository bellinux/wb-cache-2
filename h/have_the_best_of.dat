On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.|$|E
25|$|In Locabail, Mrs. Emmanuel and {{her lawyers}} did nothing after the judge's {{disclosure}} {{of a conflict}} of interest and only sprung into action to complain about bias after learning she had failed in her claims. It was held that the law did not allow Mrs. Emmanuel to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> both worlds by waiting to see how her claims in litigation turned out before pursuing her complaint of bias. Similarly, in Pillai, although the applicant had knowledge of all matters grounding his complaint of bias before judgment was delivered, he only decided to complain after he had lost the appeal. The court found that if he had not lost, it was quite certain that he would not have filed the motion. The doctrine of waiver therefore militated firmly against him.|$|E

[...] A writer for Virgin Media quipped [...] "Wayward teen Toyah rampaged through The Street in the 1990s.

500|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of Cornell University, Ezra Cornell had a large farm on the East Hill above Ithaca, New York. [...] As part of locating New York State's land-grant college in Ithaca, Cornell offered to donate the farm {{for use as a}} campus. [...] In 1862, Cornell's first president, Andrew Dickson White, wrote a colleague that a great university should include a botanical garden: “It must <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> Libraries – collections in different departments – Laboratory – Observatory – Botanical Garden perhaps…” [...] At the university's opening ceremony in 1868, Louis Agassiz, an internationally known naturalist, remarked that no other area could compete with Cornell's surroundings in the opportunities offered for the study of natural history. From its inception, Cornell formed a reputation for creative means of research into the natural sciences, including the establishment of the pioneering College of Agriculture.|$|E

This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> both worlds for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I can get back to Nashville.

The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone.

2500|$|The {{inscription}} {{seems to}} parallel an episode in : Jehoram of Israel makes {{an alliance with}} Jehoshaphat king of Judah and an unnamed king of Edom (south of Judah) to put down his rebellious vassal Mesha; the three kings <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the campaign until Mesha, in desperation, sacrifices to his god Kemosh either his eldest son or the eldest son of the king of Edom; the sacrifice turns the tide, [...] "there came great wrath against Israel", and Mesha apparently achieves victory.
