After Larkins was {{pulled out of the}} dock and had taken on part of her cargo, it was discovered that she was still taking on water. She therefore was pulled back into the dock to be coppered and sheathed.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the memory of my father, and I couldn't do it to myself. If I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E
500|$|While still {{rooted in}} pop punk, Blink-182 finds the band {{expanding}} their sonic template with darker, restless songs. The compositions {{on the record}} {{have been described as}} musically diverse and [...] "borderline experimental," [...] with sullen moodiness and off-kilter hooks the basis for many tracks. The record pulls from a variety of styles, including electronic rock, jangle pop, and [...] "reflective" [...] alternative rock. Experimentation was constantly present: the band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, [...] and turntables. The band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side-projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants.) In a full article about the album in the November 20, 2003 edition of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ben Wener described the music of the album as [...] "expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral." [...] The New York Times considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing popularity of emo pop, while AllMusic regarded it a delve into post-punk. [...] "Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars faded into the corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound", wrote Tom Bryant of Kerrang!. The goal for Blink-182 was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. [...] In addition to the side-projects, the music of the album was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: [...] "It was so weird because we'd all be glued to the TV, watching these bombs explode over another country. So I'd see all this and wonder where he was at, and then we'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day." [...] In addition, it was just inspired by socializing: [...] "We would just hang out for hours talking. It was really cool", said DeLonge.|$|E

2500|$|An {{exception}} to this general trend is the helium-4 nucleus, whose binding energy is {{higher than that of}} lithium, the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are fermions, which according to the Pauli exclusion principle cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons, so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> higher energy states. [...] Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single particle in nuclear physics, namely, the alpha particle.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{people might}} {{react to a}} {{direction}} by thinking [...] "why should I?" [...] or [...] "You can't make me", called a polarity response because it motivates the subject to consider the polar opposite of the suggestion. The conscious mind recognizes negation in speech ("Don't do X") but according to Erickson, the unconscious mind pays {{more attention to the}} [...] "X" [...] than the injunction [...] "Don't do". Erickson thus used this as the basis for suggestions that deliberately played on negation and tonally marked the important wording, to provide that whatever the client did, it was beneficial: [...] "You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a trance, so you can easily wonder about what you notice no faster than you feel ready to become aware that your hand is slowly rising....." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{formerly}} {{suffered from}} epilepsy; {{she was being}} hospitalised around once every 10 days in early 2014, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "When I have a fit at night, my arms come out. They dislocate. So I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> hospital to have them relocated. That's happened 26 {{times in the last}} nine months". The seizures could occur up to ten times at night, according to Sathnam Sanghera who interviewed her for The Times in mid-2015. They began in her late teens whenever she fell asleep and did not respond to prescribed drugs, she said in 2017. In a piece for The Sun, published the following August, she announced she was considering surgery to help prevent seizures. In mid-November 2015, her condition led her to fall to the ground in the street, injuring her face, and for an ambulance to be called.|$|E
