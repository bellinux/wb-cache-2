5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather prediction is to sample {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of <b>global</b> <b>coverage,</b> however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E

25|$|Although the GLONASS {{constellation}} {{has reached}} <b>global</b> <b>coverage,</b> its commercialisation, especially {{development of the}} user segment, has been lacking compared to the American GPS. For example, the first commercial Russian-made GLONASS navigation device for cars, Glospace SGK-70, was introduced in 2007, but it was much bigger and costlier than similar GPS receivers. In late 2010, {{there were only a}} handful of GLONASS receivers on the market, and few of them were meant for ordinary consumers. To improve the situation, the Russian government has been actively promoting GLONASS for civilian use.|$|E
25|$|Most commonly, the {{location}} is determined using GPS and the transmission mechanism is SMS, GPRS, or a satellite or terrestrial radio from {{the vehicle to}} a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. GSM and EVDO {{are the most common}} services applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low bandwidth requirements also allow for satellite technology to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a <b>global</b> <b>coverage</b> area and into very remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Global</b> barrier <b>coverage</b> that {{requires}} much fewer sensors than full coverage, {{is known to}} be an appropriate model of coverage for movement detection applications such as intrusion detection. However, it has been proved that given a sensor deployment, sensors can not locally determine whether the deployment provides <b>global</b> barrier <b>coverage,</b> making it impossible to develop localized algorithms, thus limiting its use in practice. In this paper, we introduce the concept of local barrier coverage to address this limitation. Motivated by the observation that movements are likely to follow a shorter path in crossing a belt region, local barrier coverage guarantees the detection of all movements whose trajectory is confined to a slice of the belt region of deployment. We prove that it is possible for individual sensors to locally determine the existence of local barrier coverage, even when the region of deployment is arbitrarily curved. Although local barrier coverage does not always guarantee <b>global</b> barrier <b>coverage,</b> we show that for thin belt regions, local barrier coverage almost always provides <b>global</b> barrier <b>coverage.</b> To demonstrate that local barrier coverage can be used to design localized algorithms, we develop a novel sleep-wakeup algorithm for maximizing the network lifetime, called Localized Barrier Coverage Protocol (LBCP). We show that LBCP provides close to optimal enhancement in network lifetime, while providing <b>global</b> barrier <b>coverage</b> most of the time. It outperforms an existing algorithm called Randomized Independent Sleeping (RIS) by up to 6 times...|$|R

This paper explores and demonstrates {{the capabilities of the}} TDM in terms of supporting the analysis and monitoring of global human settlement patterns. The basic methodology for a fully-operational detection and delineation of built-up areas from VHR SAR data is presented along with a description of the resulting geo-information product – the Urban Footprint (UF) mask – and the operational processing environment for the UF production. Moreover, potential follow-on analyses based on the intermediate products generated {{in the context of the}} UF analysis are introduced and discussed. The results of the study indicate the high potential of the TDM with respect to an analy-sis of urbanization patterns, peri-urbanization, spatio-temporal dynamics of settlement development as well as population estimation, vulnerability assessment and modeling of global change...|$|R
25|$|High {{frequency}} {{radio signals}} transmitted at relatively low power can {{travel around the}} world under ideal propagation conditions, which are affected by local RF noise levels, weather, season, and sunspots, and can then be received with a properly tuned antenna of adequate size, and a good receiver. However, spies often have to work only with available hand-held receivers, sometimes under difficult local conditions, and in all seasons and sunspot cycles. Only very large transmitters, perhaps up to 500,000 watts, are guaranteed {{to get through to}} nearly any basement-dwelling spy, nearly any place on earth, nearly all of the time. Some governments may not need a numbers station with <b>global</b> <b>coverage</b> if they only send spies to nearby countries.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{personal}} computers have encouraged {{the use of}} digital modes such as radioteletype (RTTY) which previously required cumbersome mechanical equipment. Hams led the development of packet radio in the 1970s, which has employed protocols such as AX.25 and TCP/IP. Specialized digital modes such as PSK31 allow real-time, low-power communications on the shortwave bands. EchoLink using Voice over IP technology has enabled amateurs to communicate through local Internet-connected repeaters and radio nodes, while IRLP has allowed the linking of repeaters to provide greater coverage area. Automatic link establishment (ALE) has enabled continuous amateur radio networks to operate on the high frequency bands with <b>global</b> <b>coverage.</b> Other modes, such as FSK441 using software such as WSJT, are used for weak signal modes including meteor scatter and moonbounce communications.|$|E
25|$|A global {{navigation}} satellite system (GNSS) provides autonomous geo-spatial positioning with <b>global</b> <b>coverage.</b> A GNSS allows small electronic receivers {{to determine their}} location such as longitude, latitude, and altitude to within a few meters using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites in outer space. Receivers {{on the ground with}} a fixed position {{can also be used to}} calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments. The first such system was Transit, developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory under the leadership of Richard Kershner. Development of the system for the United States Navy began in 1958, and a prototype satellite,Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960 by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The last Transit satellite launch was in August 1988.|$|E

25|$|The {{satellite}} navigation system GLONASS was conceived {{in the late}} 1960s, and formal requirements were completed in 1970. The government of the Soviet Union {{made a decision to}} develop the system in 1976. Design work was carried out by specialists led by Vladimir Cheremisin at NPO PM in Krasnoyarsk-26. The first launch took place in 1982. Until its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union launched 43 GLONASS-related satellites. Work on the system was continued by the Russian Federation which brought it its full operational capability in 1995. In the following years, the system fell into disrepair due to the economic crisis in the country and diminished space funding. Starting from 2000, the government under President Vladimir Putin made the restoration of GLONASS a top priority; its funding was doubled and after a lull of several years, launches were restarted again. In 2003, a new satellite design, GLONASS-M, was introduced. By early 2011, GLONASS had 22 operational satellites, two short of the required constellation of 24 to provide <b>global</b> <b>coverage.</b> The latest and significantly improved satellite type, GLONASS-K, is set to be launched in February 2011.|$|E

500|$|Irish {{traditional}} {{music and dance}} has seen a surge in popularity and <b>global</b> <b>coverage</b> since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, {{traditional music}} {{had fallen out of}} favour, especially in urban areas. However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as The Dubliners, The Chieftains, The Wolfe Tones, the Clancy Brothers, Sweeney's Men and individuals like Seán Ó Riada and Christy Moore. Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya, The Saw Doctors, The Corrs, Sinéad O'Connor, Clannad, The Cranberries and The Pogues among others. Since then {{there have been a number}} of stylistic fusions including folk metal and others, while some contemporary music groups stick closer to a [...] "traditional" [...] sound.|$|E
