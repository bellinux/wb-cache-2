25|$|Postage due stamps {{are special}} stamps applied by {{a post office}} to mail bearing <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage.</b> The stamps were issued in several {{denominations}} to make up different amounts due.|$|E
50|$|Postage due is {{the term}} used for mail sent with <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage.</b> A postage due stamp is a stamp added to an underpaid piece of mail to {{indicate}} the extra postage due.|$|E
5000|$|Do-it-yourself {{time bomb}} that Wile E. mails to the Road Runner (to nowhere particular), but is {{returned}} to the Coyote by Road Runner (disguised as a mailman) for <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage.</b> As Wile E. takes the package back into his cave for an extra stamp, BOOM! ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to stamps, postage franking {{can be in}} the form of printed or stamped impressions made in an authorized format and applied directly by a franking machine, postage meter, computer generated franking labels or other similar methods ("Postage Evidencing Systems"), any form of preprinted [...] "postage paid" [...] notice authorized by a postal service permit ("Indicia"), or any other marking method accepted by the postal service and specified by its regulations, as proof of the prepayment of the appropriate fees. Postal franking also includes [...] "Postage Due" [...] stamps or markings affixed by a postal service which designate any amount of <b>insufficient</b> or omitted <b>postage</b> fees to be collected on delivery.|$|R
5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing <b>insufficient</b> {{pre-paid}} <b>postage</b> had the postage due collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|R
5000|$|News {{reports of}} the Hardwick bomb {{described}} its distinctive packaging; an alert post office employee in New York connected this to 16 similar packages which he had set aside {{a few days earlier}} for <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage.</b> Another 12 bombs were eventually recovered before reaching their intended targets. [...] The addressees were: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} underpaid foreign mail {{was one of}} the issues {{addressed}} by the 1874 establishment of the Universal Postal Union. The U.P.U. arrived at the decision that mail with <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage</b> should be marked with a [...] "T" [...] and from April 1, 1879 the amount missing would also be indicated in black. Later more countries started to use handstamps to indicate the amount due. Later the combination of handstamps with both the [...] "T" [...] and the amount missing came into use. From October 1, 1907 the rules were changed. The amount due would be charged instead of the amount missing would be indicated. The amount charged was usually double the amount that was missing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{issue and}} use of {{adhesive}} postage stamps continued during the 19th century primarily for first class mail. Each of these stamps generally bore the face or bust of an American president or another historically important statesman. However, once the Post Office realized during the 1890s that it could increase revenues by selling stamps as [...] "collectibles," [...] it began issuing commemorative stamps, first in connection with important national expositions, later for the anniversaries of significant American historical events. Continued technological innovation subsequently prompted the introduction of special stamps, such as those for use with airmail, zeppelin mail, registered mail, certified mail, and so on. Postage due stamps were issued {{for some time and}} were pasted by the post office to letters having <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage</b> with the postage due to be paid to the postal carrier at the receiving address.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the night}} of the auction arrives, Lars discovers the mouse's box in the snow {{returned}} due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage</b> and with a big hole gnawed through it. Lars and Ernie panic upon seeing the mouse return, but attempt to maintain their composure as the auction continues. The mouse also devours Rudolf's [...] "lucky string," [...] which he gave to the brothers before his death, making their vendetta even more personal. The brothers desperately attempt to flush out the mouse by feeding a hose into the wall. As the auction reaches a record $25 million bid, the house rapidly floods through the walls and the floors, causing everyone to be washed out of the house as it promptly collapses. The brothers' only consolation {{is the fact that the}} mouse must finally be dead as their father's [...] "lucky string" [...] is found in the wreckage.|$|E
5000|$|When Ranney {{shows up}} {{to check on}} George, Ellen is hysterical. Ranney tells her to be calm and goes up to the bedroom. Showing no {{apparent}} emotion for his dead best friend, he sees the bullet hole in the floor, finds the gun in a dresser drawer, methodically repositions George's body in the bed, and draws down the window shade. Back downstairs with Ellen, Ranney listens as she tells him what happened, saying [...] "I did everything wrong, just like he said I would." [...] The doorbell rings. She thinks the police have come to arrest her, but Ranney urges Ellen to open the door. When she does, it is the postman, returning the thick letter for <b>insufficient</b> <b>postage.</b> Ranney gives a sigh of relief; Ellen takes back the envelope and is overcome after closing the door. Ranney wordlessly rips the letter into narrow strips and burns these shreds in an ashtray along with a matchbook bearing the embossed names George and Ellen.|$|E
