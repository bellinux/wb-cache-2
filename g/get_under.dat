5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, {{and the next day}} at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E

Three {{days after the}} event, Wong, who {{was born and raised}} in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled <b>Get</b> <b>under</b> the desk, in which she drew a link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of the Quebec society and its protective language laws.|$|E

If the AA was to save its existing locals at American Tin Plate and American Sheet Steel, it had to organize all the plants of U.S. Steel. But before an organizing drive could <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way, U.S. Steel's tin plate subsidiary withdrew recognition from the AA and refused to bargain at unionized plants. The independent American Sheet Steel did the same.|$|E
25|$|The walkout tied {{up about}} ninety {{ships in the}} Port of Los Angeles. Police quickly started to round up known IWW agitators, thus {{depleting}} the ranks of strike leaders and permitting some ships to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way. Twelve vessels in the offshore trade, manned by seamen sympathetic to the IWW, suffered the longest delays. The thirty-seven lumber schooners in port were largely manned by non-unionists or members of the Sailors Union. Nevertheless, the cargoes {{of a number of}} them had to be discharged in rotation at the piers by the ships' officers because of the shortage of dockhands.|$|E

There they met the naval contingent, and on January 11 they set sail. Until this time, only Burnside and his immediate staff knew their ultimate destination. Once at sea, the captain of each ship opened his sealed orders and learned that his ship should proceed to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras.|$|E

25|$|On October 26, 1944, WASP pilot Gertrude Tompkins Silver of the 601st Ferrying Squadron, 5th Ferrying Group, Love Field, Dallas, Texas, {{departed}} Los Angeles Airport, in North American P-51D Mustang, 44-15669, at 1600 hrs PWT, {{headed for}} the East Coast. She took off into the wind, into an offshore fog bank, and was expected that night at Palm Springs. She never arrived. Due to a paperwork foul-up, a search did not <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way for several days, and while the eventual search of land and sea was massive, it failed to find a trace of Silver or her plane. She is the only missing WASP pilot. She had married Sgt. Henry Silver one month before her disappearance.|$|E
25|$|Large territories in the Pannonian Basin were conquered after 568 by the nomadic Avars who {{had arrived}} from the Eurasian Steppes. The Slavs were forced {{to pay tribute to}} the Avars and to {{participate}} in their plundering raids against the Byzantine Empire, the Franks and the Lombards. Even though the Avar settlement area stabilized on the Danube river in the early period of the khaganate (southern border of present-day Slovakia), a smaller (southernmost) part <b>get</b> <b>under</b> their direct military control {{after the fall of the}} Samo's empire. In the late period of the kaganate, the Avars already inclined to more settled lifestyle and their co-existence with the local Slavs can be already characterized as some kind of cultural symbiosis.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, the Rangers decided not to {{transfer}} Redden to the AHL roster, thereby not having to pay his salary during the labour dispute. When the lockout was settled, however, the newly ratified NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) directly affected Redden in two ways —1) It forced teams to count any AHL player's salary above $900,000 against its NHL cap; and 2) It allowed for up to two contracts per team to be bought out for up to two-thirds of the remaining salary, without the buyout counting against the cap in the 2013 and/or 2014 off-seasons, so as to help teams <b>get</b> <b>under</b> the reduced cap, also known as a compliance buyout. However, the buyouts cannot be used on injured players, so, to avoid any risk of a hockey-related injury, the Rangers originally instructed Redden to simply not report to camp.|$|E
25|$|These events {{damaged the}} summer tourist custom to the railway, the towns served, {{and the area}} as a whole. A {{spokesman}} announced on 22 June that the line was expected to reopen between Bewdley and Arley {{by the end of}} July and the section between Bridgnorth and Hampton Loade to be up and running by the end of August; however it became apparent in early July 2007 that these reopenings would be delayed by as much as a month, later extended to up to three months. On 19 July, another torrential storm caused further wreckage in at least 45 separate locations as rain fell on the already saturated ground, and at least ten of these spots damage was so serious major engineering work was required before reconstruction could <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way. It was also said later that the crucial link between Hampton Loade and Arley, including Highley station and the new Engine House museum, would probably not open until as late as Spring 2008.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{investigation}} could <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way, Sherman alleged {{that he had}} paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay GBP2,500 each to Belcher and Sir Frank Soskice, the Solicitor General. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 cheque made out to Lass & Co. The cheque {{turned out to be}} a forgery, made out on a stolen blank cheque. Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the Lord Chancellor William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt should be alerted and asked to investigate. On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley. On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.|$|E

Men of the 1st and 6th Divisions rushed forward against the palisades with axes, followed by men with just five ladders to scale the 24 foot wall, they failed to receive the support of other troops and were easily repelled with 150 of the 400 men killed and wounded. The engineers then began digging a mine 60 feet to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> the fort's west wall. When this was detonated {{in the early hours of}} the 29 September, part of the wall collapsed, the advanced party of British dashed forward but were not supported and were soon driven back from the defences. It turned out that the mine was run under an ancient buried wall that was in front of the modern wall. Consequently, the main French defenses were unscathed by the explosion.|$|E
