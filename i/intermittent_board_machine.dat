40|$|Abstract. In the paper, Construction {{technology}} and equipment improvement of plastic drainage boards driven in land area are studied. Because overlying hardpan is thick in some areas, drainage plate can’t {{be driven by}} common vibratory <b>board</b> <b>machine.</b> In allusion to this instance, the machine was refitted to superficial drilling holes machine, a bore was drilled and then the drainage plate was driven {{to deal with the}} foundations covered with thick hardpan. Performance of this technology is researched and explored to deal with a complex foundation treatment by reclamation silt. Preface In complex foundation by reclamation at coastal area, its upper is varied thickness backfill material, lower is mucky soft soil foundation. Characteristics of muddy soil are high water content, low strength and bearing capacity. So, bearing capacity and stabilization can’t meet requirements and foundation is easy to be destroyed. The kind soft soil must be disposed to ensure bearing capacity, stabilization and eliminate overlarge settlement deformation. At present, prefabricated drains preloading is used to consolidate foundation[1, 2, 3, 4]. The difficulty of using ivertical drain is different because of complex foundation. The drain can be inserted the bottom of silt through soil layers by common <b>board</b> <b>machine</b> when backfilling thicknes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} demand for cross {{directional}} control of basis weight on a <b>board</b> <b>machine.</b> To analyse the demand, changes made by the control system are studied. The significant changes were expected to be present when a major event occurred on the machine. The events classified as major were changes in basis weight, of grade or of coating blade. Break of board and stoppage of the machine were also included. These events can be seen as large disturbances to the machine. In order to identify the disturbances a methodology had to be developed. The methodology developed is to analyse the output from a model with the actuators of the control system as input and measurement of basis weight as output. The analysis of this output was done using the multivariate method of principal component analysis. The data analysed in this thesis was collected on-line from a <b>board</b> <b>machine</b> operating within the Stora Enso group. Over a period of 3 months, a total of 47 sets of data were collected, each set representing 12 - 14 hours. The data analysis shows that the variations in the control system are greater than the variation in the measured basis weight. This is a strong indication that the control system is needed and in order to find disturbances in the cross directional profile it is not enough only to analyse the final product, the control signals also have to be analysed. The large disturbances do not necessarily emerge from the major events as assumed. Other causes might havelarger impact to the process then first believed. One of the major obstacles in trying to explain the variations is that the basis weight is controlled by using the centre layer of the board but measured on the final product. This leads {{to the fact that the}} errors seen by the measuring system can result from anything on the machine and be compensated by basis weight in the centre layer of the board...|$|R

40|$|Global {{competition}} forces {{process industries}} to continuously optimize plant operation. One {{of the latest}} trends for efficiency and plant availability improvement {{is to set up}} fault diagnosis and maintenance systems for online industrial use. This paper presents a methodology for developing industrial fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems. Since model or data-based diagnosis of all components cannot be achieved online on a large-scale basis, the focus must be narrowed down to the most likely faulty components responsible for abnormal process behavior. One of the key elements here is fault analysis. The paper describes and briefly discusses also other development phases, process decomposition, and the selection of FDD methods. The paper ends with an FDD case study of a large-scale industrial <b>board</b> <b>machine</b> including a description of the fault analysis and FDD algorithms for the resulting focus areas.

40|$|This study aims at {{providing}} a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) approach based on nonlinear parity equations identified from process data. Process knowledge {{is used to}} reduce the process nonlinearity from high to low-dimensional nonlinear functions representing common process devices, such as valves, and incorporating the monotonousness properties of the dependencies between the variables. The fault detection approach considers the obtained process model to be nonlinear parity equations, and fault diagnosis is carried out with the standard structured residual method. The applicability of the approach to complex flow networks controlled by valves is tested on the drying section of an industrial <b>board</b> <b>machine,</b> in which the key problems are leakages and blockages of valves and pipes in the steam-water network.
