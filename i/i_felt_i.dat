25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
500|$|Relegation changed Gunn's {{mind about}} taking the Norwich job. He {{had decided not to}} {{continue}} in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship, and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family. However, [...] "Relegation was a failure and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t quit then. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had to do everything I could to put things right, if I was given the chance. And I was." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{two columns}} were filled. When I read them {{over in the}} morning <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> had found my {{legitimate}} occupation at last. I reasoned within myself that news, and stirring news, too, was what a paper needed, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> was peculiarly endowed {{with the ability to}} furnish it. Mr. Goodman said that I was as good a reporter as Dan. I desired no higher commendation. With encouragement like that, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> could take my pen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and the interests of the paper demanded it.|$|R

It was a high priority to keep true to the songs.|$|E

500|$|Leto has {{described}} his adolescence as a troubled time, {{in which he}} used drugs and dropped out of school. He said, [...] "I was in a mess, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> didn't belong anywhere", calling himself as an [...] "outsider" [...] who hated conformity and rules, and [...] "took any opportunity to break them." [...] Ultimately, Jared helped him recover from drugs.|$|E
500|$|John Rogers, {{described}} as a [...] "penny-pinching" [...] majority owner of the Phillies, assured Lajoie {{that he would make}} the same salary as Delahanty. However, Lajoie discovered that while he was earning $2,600 ($ in current dollar terms), Delahanty earned $3,000 ($ in current dollar terms) (contracts for NL players were not allowed to surpass $2,400). Rogers increased Lajoie's pay by $200 but the damage had already been done. [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had been cheated, I was determined to listen to any reasonable American League offer", Lajoie said.|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the music}} to , O'Donnell began work on {{crafting}} the game's themes before Salvatori joined the team in February 2009. [...] "Marty [...] had started writing before me, and sent me some of his ideas," [...] Salvatori said. [...] "I picked a few that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could add some magic to, and worked on those. I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that {{he put his hands}} on." [...] Once the duo felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby's. There were various {{reasons for his}} disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and Peter Wilson, then {{chairman}} of Sotheby's, used this appeal to the auction house's advantage when using Chatwin {{to try to persuade}} wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become [...] "burnt out" [...] and said, [...] "In the end <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> might just as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour. One's whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Haywald of 1UP.com {{stated that}} [...] "even when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had to guess which {{direction}} I {{was supposed to}} go, the levels are set up well enough that the way forward is always easy to figure out". Haywald praised the visuals as well, but stated that [...] "as the scenery grows more cluttered, it also sometimes becomes {{difficult to find a}} safe place to land after sending the world spinning". Haywald rated And Yet It Moves a B+. NintendoLife rated the WiiWare version 9 out of 10, stating that the new additions and updated controls made it the [...] "definitive version of the game" [...] despite the omission of online features seen in the PC version.|$|E

500|$|In 1845, a {{religious}} revival {{took place in}} Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: [...] "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had found my savior." [...] She {{went on to say}} that it was her [...] "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." [...] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: [...] "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church– / I keep it, staying at Home".|$|E
500|$|On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a {{televised}} statement {{in which he}} said he had been in a 45-day therapy program since the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. [...] "I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to," [...] he said. [...] "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish." [...] He {{said he did not know}} yet when he would be returning to golf. He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would be returning at the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8.|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E

500|$|Webster {{found the}} casting of Darcy {{especially}} hard {{due to the}} character's iconic status and because [...] "Colin Firth cast a very long shadow" [...] as the 1995 Darcy. Wright later commented that his choice of Knightley allowed him to cast comparative unknown Matthew Macfadyen, something {{that would have been}} impossible had he chosen a less well-known actress for Elizabeth Bennet. Macfadyen at the time was known {{for his role in the}} British television spy series Spooks, but had no recognition internationally. A fan of the actor's television work, Wright called Macfadyen [...] "a proper manly man... I didn't want a pretty boy kind of actor. His properties were the ones <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> needed [...] Matthew's a great big hunk of a guy." [...] Macfadyen did not read the novel before filming, preferring to rely solely on the script.|$|E
500|$|Four screenwriters {{worked on}} the property. Peter Hedges wrote the first draft, but didn't think he could do more; another writer passed. Paul Rudnick did some work on Miranda's scenes, {{followed}} by a Don Roos rewrite. After that, Aline Brosh McKenna, {{who was able to}} relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story, produced a draft after a month's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version, rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda. She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship [...] "very liberating ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was allowed to do what the movie wanted to be, a Faust story, a Wall Street for ladies." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2003, Welling {{made his}} feature film debut as Charlie Baker, the oldest son and second oldest in the Baker family which had 12 children, {{in the family}} comedy Cheaper by the Dozen with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, which is a remake of the 1950 movie {{starring}} Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, based on [...] Frank and Lillian Gilbreth's 1948 book. Welling talked about why {{he was interested in}} the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: [...] "The top three reasons I decided to do this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie. I liked what he went through, what he had to go through, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> understood where he was coming from. And I just {{wanted to be a part}} of it." [...] Welling had always been a fan of Martin's and stated that he [...] "absolutely loved" [...] working with him.|$|E
