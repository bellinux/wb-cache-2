25|$|DSLRs largely {{replaced}} film-based SLRs {{during the}} 2000s, {{and despite the}} rising popularity of mirrorless system cameras in the early 2010s, DSLRs remain {{the most common type}} of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> camera in use as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} other <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> designs, DSLRs {{must contend with}} {{potential}} contamination of the sensor by dust particles when the lens is changed (though recent dust reduction systems alleviate this). Digital cameras with fixed lenses are not usually subject to dust from outside the camera settling on the sensor.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since the}} {{introduction}} of the Micro Four Thirds system by Olympus and Panasonic in late 2008, mirrorless <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> cameras are now widely available so the option to change lenses is no longer unique to DSLRs. Cameras for the micro four thirds system are designed with the option of a replaceable lens and accept lenses that conform to this proprietary specification. Cameras for this system have the same sensor size as the Four Thirds System but do not have the mirror and pentaprism, so as to reduce the distance between the lens and sensor.|$|E
5000|$|Few TLR cameras offered <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses</b> {{and none}} {{were made with}} a zoom lens. In systems with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses,</b> such as the Mamiya, the fixed {{distance}} between the lenses sets a hard limit on their size, which precludes the possibility of large aperture long-focus lenses.|$|R

25|$|Panasonic {{released}} the first Micro Four Thirds camera, the Lumix DMC-G1. Several manufacturers have announced lenses {{for the new}} Micro Four Thirds mount, while older Four Thirds lenses can be mounted with an adapter (a mechanical spacer with front and rear electrical connectors and its own internal firmware). A similar mirror-less <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> camera, but with an APS-C-sized sensor, was announced in January 2010: the Samsung NX10. On 21 September 2011, Nikon announced with the Nikon 1 a series of high-speed MILCs. A handful of rangefinder cameras also support interchangeable lenses. Six digital rangefinders exist: the Epson R-D1 (APS-C-sized sensor), the Leica M8 (APS-H-sized sensor), both smaller than 35mm film rangefinder cameras, and the Leica M9, M9-P, M Monochrom and M (all full-frame cameras, with the Monochrom shooting exclusively in black-and-white).|$|E
2500|$|The {{sealed beam}} lamp {{produces}} an intense oval pool of light with unfocused edges. The only focus adjustment is a knob that allows the lamp/lens unit to be rotated within its casing, thus changing {{the orientation of the}} oval. With some models this control is via the mogul ceramic connector which connects directly to the Mogul prongs of the lamp. With the SourceFour PAR, the <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> is what is rotated. Therefore, the diameter of the light spot is defined by the aluminium ...|$|E
2500|$|DSLRs {{typically}} use autofocus {{based on}} phase detection. This method allows the optimal lens {{position to be}} calculated, rather than [...] "found", as {{would be the case}} with autofocus based on contrast maximisation. Phase-detection autofocus is typically faster than other passive techniques. As the phase sensor requires the same light going to the image sensor, it was previously only possible with an SLR design. [...] However, with the introduction of focal-plane phase detect autofocusing in mirrorless <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> cameras by Sony, Fuji, Olympus and Panasonic, cameras can now employ both phase detect and contrast detect AF points.|$|E

2500|$|ETC {{also offers}} a variety of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> tubes with various field angles. [...] These are: 90, 70, 50, 36, 26, 19, 14, 10, and 5 degree lens tubes, some of which are {{available}} as enhanced definition lens tubes (EDLT). [...] The Source Four is also available as a zoom fixture, with a non-interchangeable lens tube. According to ETC's manual, the lenses in each lens tube cannot be reoriented, added or removed. Lenses come from the factory with a painted-on dot denoting the front face. The inside of the lens tube shows which slot is for which lens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} {{exchange}} lenses, {{to select the}} best lens for the current photographic need, and to allow the attachment of specialised lenses, {{is one of the}} key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras, although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Interchangeable lenses for SLRs and DSLRs (also known as [...] "Glass") are built to operate correctly with a specific lens mount that is generally unique to each brand. A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the camera body (for example, Canon EF lenses on a Canon body) although there are also many independent lens manufacturers, such as Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts. There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one lens mount to be used on a camera body with a different lens mount but with often reduced functionality.|$|E
2500|$|ERS or profile {{lanterns}} {{have many}} useful features. One {{of the most}} useful are the metal shutters at the focal plane of the lens to shape the beam of light. The original shape of the beam is round, but {{with the use of}} the shutters one can limit the beam to avoid obstacles or parts of the set that should not be illuminated in a specific look. Another feature is a gate, also in the focal plane, for sliding in gobos (also known as templates or deckles). These have patterns cut into them, much like a stencil. These patterns are projected onto the stage. An iris can be also be inserted in this position to make the beam smaller in diameter, reducing the light cast without the sharp edges of the shutters. ERS instruments from ETC, Altman, Selecon, and a variety of others have <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> tubes (or barrels) which can both create a very sharp or very soft beam as well as alter the beam spread. The barrel sizes can range from a narrow, long distance 5- or 10-degree spot to a broad and short-distance 50- or even 90-degree. The first 90-degree profile lantern was developed by Selecon Performance Lighting as part of their [...] "Pacific" [...] range of products. Since its introduction many other manufacturers have introduced their own 90-degree barrels. ERS instruments allow many different lens tubes to be used with the same body. This makes them more versatile, since a venue can purchase varying degrees of barrels without buying as many instruments. Many manufacturers also produce zoom lenses which offer the ability to change the beam angle. Some zoom ranges have a poorer optical quality making them difficult to use in sharp focus.|$|E
