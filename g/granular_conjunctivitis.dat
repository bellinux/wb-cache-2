40|$|One of {{the strains}} of Bacterium {{granulosis}} isolated by Noguchi in 1926 has been maintained in culture and in monkeys {{and continues to be}} capable, after 3 years, of inducing a chronic <b>granular</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> in monkeys. Cultures of this strain have been recovered from the monkey lesions as late as 3 years after inoculation and have been shown to reproduce the granular disease in monkeys. Six additional strains of Bacterium granulosis have been isolated from cases of trachoma occurring in the Indian schools of Arizona. The cultures thus obtained are identical morphologically and culturally with those isolated by Noguchi and have induced the same chronic <b>granular</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> in monkeys. Advanced untreated cases are more favorable for cultural study than treated cases. Cultures of Bacterium granulosis kept on semisolid medium containing 10 per cent rabbit serum ("leptospira medium") remain viable for many months at room temperature, and sealed ampoules of such cultures have been found to retain their pathogenicity for the monkey conjunctiva for at least 69 days at room temperature and at least 284 days at 4 ° to 6 °C. Several additional cultural and biological characteristics of Bacterium granulosis have been described. Of outstanding importance is the fact that cocaine, in contradistinction to novocain, has a bactericidal effect on the organism. This fact, in view of the common use of cocaine for anesthesia, may explain the negative results of cultivation experiments reported by some workers...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} suggested itself, {{in view of}} {{the theories}} already advanced with regard to the rô 1 e of secondary infections in the later manifestations of trachoma (1), that the implantation of common bacteria on the conjunctivae of monkeys already having well marked characteristic granulosis lesions might give rise to a condition showing less predominance of the follicular reaction and more of the hyperemic granulopapillary effect. We believe we have succeeded, by a suitable technique, in doing this and in producing thereby in the experimental animals a condition closely resembling the florid type of human trachoma (Type IIb and c of MacCallan). The organisms used were some of those which are found in the conjunctival sac of monkey and man with different types of <b>granular</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> Of themselves, they produced only a transient reaction or none, as Noguchi had already shown and as we ourselves had observed in control animals. When inoculated together with material containing Bacterium granulosis, they did not affect the usual action of this organism, but when introduced into a conjunctiva in which granulosis lesions were already well developed, they induced more of the characteristics of the florid stage of trachoma than have been hitherto observed in animals, notably increased hyperemia, edema and thickening, papillary hypertrophy, obscurity of blood vessels, and masking of the follicles. Microscopically these changes were accompanied by increased scar tissue formation, lymphoid infiltration, and papillary hyperplasia...|$|E
