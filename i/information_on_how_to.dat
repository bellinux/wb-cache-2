5|$|Murtagh becomes Eragon's new {{companion}} and {{they travel to}} the city Gil'ead to find <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> find the Varden, a group of rebels {{who want to see}} the downfall of Galbatorix. While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an elf when her pointed ears are uncovered. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf. During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza. Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow, and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist. Having escaped, they run off. Eragon succeeds in communicating with the elf, whose name is revealed as Arya, and learns the location of the Varden. After some arguing, Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden but is still wary of them.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{recruits}} The Lone Gunmen to {{help him}} break into a high security research facility where he thinks he {{may be able to}} find more <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> save Scully. Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send {{information that could}} enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet {{be able to use}} responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{introduce}} a new algorithm {{to account for the}} presence of null alleles in inferences of populations clusters from individual multilocus genetic data. We show by simulations that the presence of null alleles can affect the accuracy of inferences if not properly accounted for and that our algorithm improve signficantly their accuracy. Availability: This new algorithm is implemented in the program Geneland. It is freely available under GNU public license as an R package on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It now includes a fully clickable graphical interface. <b>Informations</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get the software are available on folk. uio. no/gillesg/Geneland. htm...|$|R

5|$|The plenum {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them with <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the internal balance of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need to go beyond political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E
