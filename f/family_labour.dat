2500|$|Simple {{commodity}} production (also {{known as}} [...] "petty commodity production") {{is a term}} coined by Frederick Engels to describe productive activities under the conditions of what Marx had called the [...] "simple exchange" [...] of commodities, where independent producers such as peasants trade their own products. The {{use of the word}} [...] "simple" [...] does not refer {{to the nature of the}} producers or of their production, but to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved. Simple commodity production is compatible with many different relations of production, ranging from self-employment where the producer owns his means of production, and <b>family</b> <b>labour,</b> to forms of slavery, peonage, indentured labour, and serfdom.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, both the direct {{administration}} of India by the British Crown and the technological change ushered in by the industrial revolution had the effect of closely intertwining the economies of India and Great Britain. In fact many of the major changes in transport and communications (that are typically associated with Crown Rule of India) had already begun before the Mutiny. [...] Since Dalhousie had embraced the technological revolution underway in Britain, India too saw rapid development of all those technologies. [...] Railways, roads, canals, and bridges were rapidly built in India and telegraph links equally rapidly established in order that raw materials, such as cotton, from India's hinterland could be transported more efficiently to ports, such as Bombay, for subsequent export to England. [...] Likewise, finished goods from England, were transported back, just as efficiently, for sale in the burgeoning Indian markets. Massive railway projects were begun in earnest and government railway jobs and pensions attracted a large number of upper caste Hindus into the civil service for the first time. The Indian Civil Service was prestigious and paid well, but it remained politically neutral. [...] Imports of British cotton covered 55% of the Indian market by 1875. Industrial production as it developed in European factories was unknown until the 1850s when the first cotton mills were opened in Bombay, posing a challenge to the cottage-based home production system based on <b>family</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
