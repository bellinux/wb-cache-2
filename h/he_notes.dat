5|$|Although one of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction is central to the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that many of the greatest breakthrough scientific discoveries in history have occurred by accident, in locations no more glamorous than Aaron's garage.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} Marcinkus's {{letters to}} the Lithuanian envoy, Bronius Balutis, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> that he shot down his first German bomber, a Dornier Do 17 in March. Marcinkus also wrote that he was {{gathering}} skills and knowledge {{in order to make}} a contribution towards liberating Lithuania and restoring its independence.|$|E
5|$|Teeuw {{writes that}} the {{literary}} style is didactic, which he considers the novel's main shortcoming. However, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> that Mihardja {{was part of a}} literary movement led by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana that viewed literature as being instructive; he also writes that such a style was common in Indonesian literature at the time.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{argues for}} the need to study cells with {{physical}} methods, as morphology alone had little explanatory value. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that in mitosis the dividing cells look like iron filings between the poles of a magnet, in other words like a force field.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{considers}} the skeletal structures of diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifera and sponges, {{many of which}} contain hard spicules with geometric shapes. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that these structures form outside living cells, so that physical forces must be involved.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>notes</b> {{the degree}} of {{artifice}} concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A pool of water is shot at night {{with the sounds of}} a storm, and frogs croaking break the stillness.|$|E

5|$|Later Hurley brings Jack and Charlie water, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> Charlie doesn't look {{well but}} Jack covers for him {{saying that he}} has the flu. Hurley tells him to get better and Charlie looks thankful to Jack. He sees Locke and asks him for his heroin and Locke gives it back. Charlie looks at it for a moment before tossing it into the fire, smiling. Locke tells Charlie he's proud of him and that he always knew he could do it. Charlie and Locke see a moth flying away.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda was {{released}} in 1930; Effendi stated that it {{was released}} before Tan's Nancy Bikin Pembalesan (Nancy Takes Revenge), a sequel to Njai Dasima, began screening in May 1930. Dutch newspapers indicate that it had screened in Medan, North Sumatra, by 1932. Biran writes that the film received little coverage; <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> that Sinematek Indonesia has no news clippings related to Si Ronda.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounts}} in Mino Khirad, written during the Savafid period, {{demonstrate that the}} Zoroastrians were subjected to harassment by the Shi'ite majority, their places of worship were under a constant threat of being destroyed. By 1707, when Le Bruyn visited Isfahan, the Zoroastrians were no longer able practice their religion freely. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that the most deprived Zoroastrians {{had been brought to}} Isfahan, and had been forced to become Muslim three years earlier. In 1821, Ker Porter visiting Isfahan notes that there were hardly any Zoroastrians left in Isfahan and Gabrabad was in ruins.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> {{that some}} have a hollow stem, such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien {{ends the}} essay with an {{analysis}} of lines 210-228 of Beowulf, providing the original text, marked up with stresses and his metrical patterns for each half-line, {{as well as a}} literal translation with poetical words underlined. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that there are three words for boat and for wave, five for men, four for sea: in each case some are poetical, some normal.|$|E
5|$|Wallace stayed {{three and}} a half months in Java, where he admires the system of {{government}} and the contented people. The population is, <b>he</b> <b>notes,</b> rapidly increasing, from 3.5 million in 1800 to 5.5 million in 1826 and 14 million in 1865. He enjoys the fine Hindu archaeological sites, and the flora of the mountain tops which have plants resembling those of Europe, including the royal cowslip, Primula imperialis, endemic to one mountain top.|$|E
50|$|Zürcher {{previously}} {{pleaded for}} accession of Turkey to the European Union, in 2012, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> that {{the perspective of}} accession was lost politically in both Turkey and the European Union. In 2016, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> that his previously expected advancement in democratic standards and Rechtsstaat did not materialize, and that Turkey therefore cannot and should not {{become a member of}} the European Union.|$|R

5|$|Writing in 2009, Biran {{suggests}} that De Stem des Bloeds was clearly written from an Indo {{point of view}} because of the positive roles of Indo children. He finds the film sympathetic to native culture, including the faithful njai. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children were faced {{with a sense of}} disgust, in De Stem des Bloeds an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman.|$|E
5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran to suggest that it may have paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> that reviews were mixed.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, {{is due to}} a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation. To back up the claims of a masonic conspiracy, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual murders, and accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
