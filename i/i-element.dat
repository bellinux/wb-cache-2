The {{purpose of this}} study is to clarify whether first sentences of these components are good enough to train naive Bayes classifiers for sentence-level PICO element detection. We extracted 19, 854 structured abstracts of randomized controlled trials with any P/I/O label from PubMed for naive Bayes classifiers training. Performances of classifiers trained by first sentences of each section (CF) and those trained by all sentences (CA) were compared using all sentences by ten-fold cross-validation. The results measured by recall, precision, and F-measures show that there are no significant differences in performance between CF and CA for detection of O-element (F-measure= 0. 731 ± 0. 009 vs. 0. 738 ± 0. 010, p= 0. 123). However, CA perform better for <b>I-elements,</b> in terms of recall (0. 752 ± 0. 012 vs. 0. 620 ± 0. 007, p< 0. 001) and F-measures (0. 728 ± 0. 006 vs. 0. 662 ± 0. 007, p< 0. 001). For P-elements, CF have higher precision (0. 714 ± 0. 009 vs. 0. 665 ± 0. 010, p< 0. 001), but lower recall (0. 766 ± 0. 013 vs. 0. 811 ± 0. 012, p< 0. 001).

40|$|This chapter {{surveys the}} bond graph {{modeling}} of rotary electric machinery. The discussion includes the DC- and AC-machines {{commonly found in}} industrial applications ranging from a few hundreds of watts up to megawatts, i. e., brushed DC-machines in all their connection types {{as well as the}} synchronous and the induction machine. Most of the presentation adopts the electrical drive point of view, but the generator operation is also addressed in some cases, as this simply implies reversing the power flow in certain bonds, at least in the model world. Also discussed is a variety of machines used in low-power drives, like the permanent magnet (PM) synchronous, brushless DC, synchronous reluctance, PM stepper, and switched reluctance motors. Different modeling techniques are illustrated when surveying the different models. First, most of the bond graphs are derived from equivalent electric circuits with inductances representing the magnetic phenomena. Later, in order to explicitly show this domain, two further approaches are employed: one that, re-using the previous bond graphs, “opens” the <b>I-elements</b> to expose the magnetics and the other that starts the modeling process from scratch. In this later case, again two alternatives are presented, the first one interconnects components defined from constitutive relationships and the second one derives the models from energy conservation properties of ideal coupling fields. The chapter closes with simulation results obtained using the models developed along with it. The intention in writing this chapter has been to give to the reader a comprehensive overview of the subject, to offer a compendium of useful models to the practitioner, and, simultaneously, to provide methodological tools to help applied researchers to successfully develop their own models...|$|R

40|$|In the Drosophila germline, transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are silenced by PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) that {{originate from}} distinct genomic regions termed piRNA clusters and are processed by PIWI-subfamily Argonaute proteins. Here, we explore {{the variation in}} the ability to restrain an alien TE in different Drosophila strains. The <b>I-element</b> is a retrotransposon involved in the phenomenon of I-R hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Genomes of R strains do not contain active I-elements, but harbour remnants of ancestral I-related elements. The permissivity to <b>I-element</b> activity of R females, called reactivity, varies considerably in natural R populations, indicating the existence of a strong natural polymorphism in defense systems targeting transposons. To reveal the nature of such polymorphisms, we compared ovarian small RNAs between R strains with low and high reactivity and show that reactivity negatively correlates with the ancestral I-element-specific piRNA content. Analysis of piRNA clusters containing remnants of I-elements shows increased expression of the piRNA precursors and enrichment by the Heterochromatin Protein 1 homolog, Rhino, in weak R strains, which is in accordance with stronger piRNA expression by these regions. To explore the nature of the differences in piRNA production, we focused on two R strains, weak and strong, and showed that the efficiency of maternal inheritance of piRNAs as well as the <b>I-element</b> copy number are very similar in both strains. At the same time, germline and somatic uni-strand piRNA clusters generate more piRNAs in strains with low reactivity, suggesting the relationship between the efficiency of primary piRNA production and variable response to TE invasions. The strength of adaptive genome defense is likely driven by naturally occurring polymorphisms in the rapidly evolving piRNA pathway proteins. We hypothesize that hyper-efficient piRNA production is contributing to elimination of a telomeric retrotransposon HeT-A, which we have observed in one particular transposon-resistant R strain...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Drosophila I-R type {{of hybrid}} dysgenesis is a {{sterility}} syndrome (SF sterility) {{associated with the}} mobilization of the I retrotransposon in female germ cells. SF sterility results from a maternal-effect embryonic lethality whose origin has remained unclear since its discovery about 40 years ago. Here, we show that meiotic divisions in SF oocytes are catastrophic and systematically fail to produce a functional female pronucleus at fertilization. As a consequence, most embryos from SF females rapidly arrest their development with aneuploid or damaged nuclei, whereas others develop as non-viable, androgenetic haploid embryos. Finally, we show that, in contrast to mutants affecting the biogenesis of piRNAs, SF egg chambers do not accumulate persistent DNA double-strand breaks, suggesting that <b>I-element</b> activity might perturb the functional organization of meiotic chromosomes without triggering an early DNA damage response...|$|E
40|$|PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provide defence against {{transposable element}} (TE) {{expansion}} in the germ line of metazoans. piRNAs are processed from the transcripts encoded by specialized heterochromatic clusters enriched in damaged copies of transposons. How these regions are recognized {{as a source of}} piRNAs is still elusive.

We show that such transgenes, being inserted in unique euchromatic regions that normally do not produce small RNAs, become de novo bidirectional piRNA clusters that silence <b>I-element</b> activity in the germ line. Strikingly, small RNAs of both polarities are generated from the entire transgene and flanking genomic sequences—not only from the transposon fragment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that in ovaries, the trimethylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9 me 3) mark associates with transgenes producing piRNAs.

40|$|In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and TAHRE, {{which are}} {{involved}} in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is {{under the control of}} the piRNA silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown. This strongly correlates with enrichment of two histone H 3 modifications (dimethylation of lysine 79 and dimethylation of lysine 4), which mark transcriptionally active chromatin, on the same sequences in the piRNA pathway mutants. spn-E mutation and piwi knockdown results in transcriptional activation of some other non-telomeric retrotransposons in the ovaries, such as <b>I-element</b> and HMS Beagle.

We also show that transcription of the transgenes is necessary to produce the silencing effect and that repression can be maintained for at least one generation following elimination of the transgenes, thus strongly suggesting that a transgene product and not the transgene per se is the essential intermediate in the silencing effect. The data presented strongly support models in which the repressing effect of antisense transcripts involves the same mechanisms as cosuppression by sense constructs and emphasize the role of symmetrically acting nucleic acid structures in mediating repression...|$|E

A k-uniform S-capturing hypergraph = (X,S,k) has a vertex set X and a hyperedge set consisting of all k-element subsets of X captured by S. In case when k= 2 and S is convex these graphs are planar graphs, known as convex distance function Delaunay graphs.

The Krimp loss-of-function allele exhibited female sterility, defects in karyosome formation and oocyte polarity, and precocious osk translation. These phenotypes are commonly observed in the other nuage component mutants, vasa (vas) and maelstrom (mael), and the RNA-silencing component mutants, spindle-E (spn-E) and aubergine (aub), suggesting a shared underlying defect that uses RNA silencing.

Transposition of I factor depends on cellular conditions that are established in the oocytes of the reactive females and transmitted to their daughters. The so-called reactivity is a cellular state that may exhibit variable levels of expression and represents a permissive condition for I transposition at high levels. Defective I elements have been proposed to be the genetic determinants of reactivity and, through their differential expression, to modulate transposition of active copies in somatic and/or germ line cells. Recently, control of transposable element activity in the germ line has been found to depend on pi-RNAs, small repressive RNAs interacting with Piwi-family proteins and derived from larger transposable elements (TE) -derived primary transcripts. In particular, maternally transmitted <b>I-element</b> piRNAs originating from the 42 AB region of polytene chromosomes were found to be involved in control of I element mobility.

Its equivalence classes are essentially the isomorphism types of restrictions of R and the above order is the usual embedability order of isomorphism types. A consequence of the main result is that for a homogeneous R the order has the strong Sperner property...|$|E

Terminases bind to linear concatemers of replicated viral genomes and concomitantly excise (mature) and package {{a single}} genome per procapsid. In this thesis, I interrogate {{the role of}} E. coli integration host factor (IHF) in mediating the site-specific assembly of bacteriophage lambda terminase at its cognate DNA site, cos, which serves as the packaging initiation site. IHF binds to an <b>I-element</b> within cos and introduces a strong bend in the duplex. It was previously demonstrated that the small terminase subunit could stabilize an IHF-induced bend at cos. I hypothesized that terminase holoenzyme and IHF cooperatively assemble at cos and wrap the duplex into a compact nucleoprotein complex. Rigorous analysis of this cooperative assembly is complex due to the multiple terminase and IHF binding elements within cos. Therefore, I dissected the cos site into individual specific and nonspecific IHF binding sequences, and analyzed the relevant protein affinities for these subsites {{as well as for}} (1) the full-length cos site and (2) a random nonspecific (NS) sequence of equivalent length. Analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoretic mobility shift studies show that IHF and terminase only modestly discriminate between cos and NS-DNA substrates; however, the two proteins cooperatively bind to cos-DNA. The data suggest that IHF confers site-specificity of binding to terminase. Also evident is significant nonspecific DNA binding concurrent with specific interactions, even on specific DNA substrates. IHF likely facilitates the high-affinity cooperative assembly of a relevant nucleoprotein complex at the cos site despite significant nonspecific binding of both proteins to DNA, with the functional significance of nonspecific DNA binding being the enhancement of protein-DNA interactions. Furthermore, sedimentation equilibrium studies demonstrate that while terminase assembles in the absence of IHF as a dimer on a 274 bp DNA substrate inclusive of the entire cos site, in the presence of IHF a nucleoprotein complex of mass consistent with five terminase protomers and two IHF molecules results. This finding further implicates IHF in the cooperative assembly of a specific ternary IHF-DNA-terminase complex at the packaging initiation site of bacteriophage lambda. A terminase packaging enzyme that both (1) site-specifically matures DNA and (2) packages DNA in a sequence-independent manner must be capable of both specific and nonspecific DNA binding. This work furthers the understanding of (1) one of the factors (IHF) involved in the site-specific assembly of a nucleoprotein complex required for the initiation of viral packaging, and (2) the nature of the specific nucleoprotein complex assembled at the cos site prior to DNA maturation and packaging...|$|E
