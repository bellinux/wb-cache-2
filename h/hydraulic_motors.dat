5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motors</b> (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E

Compared to the former structure, {{new kind of}} structure has many advantages over that of the old structure. The hydraulic driving system in the traditional derrick car is: <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> drives a reducer, and then the reducer in turn drives a capstan. Another hydraulic driving system is: an axial piston motor and an internal cycloid pinwheel drive are applied, so that the reducer and the capstan are combined into one so that simplified the transmission system.

40|$|Abstract. A {{swash plate}} pump-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> {{system has been}} {{presented}} in this work. The flow rate of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> system and then the output speed could be controlled by adjusting the swash plate angle. Actuating the swash plate using DC servomotor could enhance dynamic performance of the pump, and then better improve the performance of overall <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> system. In this study, another speed control configuration has been introduced and the angular velocity of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> has been controlled using both PI (proportional and integral) and FL (fuzzy logic) controllers. However, due to the nonlinear nature and time-varying dynamics of the considered system, PI controllers are sometimes insufficient to overcome such nonlinearities because they have linear characteristics. Therefore, this classical controller sometimes fails to compensate the change in system parameters unless its parameters (PI controller) are repeatedly tuned. Unlike classical control methods, the fuzzy controller is designed with linguistic terms to cope with nonlinearities. Results of computer simulation showed that FLC {{has the potential to}} reduce the adverse effects of changing system parameters...|$|R
