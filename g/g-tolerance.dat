50|$|Since Johnsville {{possessed the}} world's largest human centrifuge, capable of {{spinning}} {{a man to}} at least 16g, (42g max 19g/s onset) it was used for astronaut training.The centrifuge was later used for flight simulation where it could simulate {{6 degrees of freedom}} with g loading. The F-14 flat spin on takeoff issue was investigated and resolved on the DFS Centrifuge. Later endeavors included supine seat experiments, <b>G-Tolerance</b> Improvement Program (GTIP), and F/A-18 simulation. The DFS Centrifuge building (formerly building 70) has been refurbished as a museum, office space and a theater.|$|E
50|$|If {{blood is}} allowed to pool in the lower areas of the body, the brain will be {{deprived}} of blood, leading to temporary hypoxia. Hypoxia first causes a greyout (a dimming of the vision), also called brownout, followed by tunnel vision and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g there {{is a period of}} disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.A g-suit does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue. The resting <b>g-tolerance</b> of a typical person is anywhere from 3-5 g depending on the person. A g-suit will typically add 1 g of tolerance to that limit. Pilots still need to practice the 'g-straining maneuver' that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body. High g is not comfortable, even with a g-suit. In older fighter aircraft, 6 g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9 g or more can be sustained structurally making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close aerial combat.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the early {{beginnings}} of space physiology are briefly reported upon {{based on personal}} communications and on other reports and publications not currently easily available. Space physiology has evolved from hypergravity experiments. It originally was the aim in centrifuge laboratories to study the limits of <b>g-tolerance.</b> Instead of forward extrapolations from data derived from hypergravity experiments, in 1945 - 1947 Gauer and Haber extrapolated downwards to zero-g and came to astonishingly precise predictions of {{what might happen to}} the human physiology when man entered a zero-g environment. The article under the title "Man under gravity-free conditions" published in German Aviation Medicine World War II Volume 1 : 641 - 644 was the first scientific article laying the basis for further developments in space medicine. This article must be regarded as the beginnings of space physiology. From then on, the manipulation of gravity became a tool for physiologists. In this article, the developments during the pre-war period in Berlin and the USA will be outlined briefly and some of the pioneers in this field mentioned...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>G-tolerance</b> {{assessment}} {{is an essential}} element of both military pilot and pilot candidate evaluation. AIMS: Attempt at prediction of individual relaxed &#x 002 B; Gz tolerance on the basis of head-up tilt (HUT) testing. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In two stages, 20 healthy men at the mean age 21. 5 years took part in this study. The first stage, a 45 min, HUT test was performed using the Westminster protocol. During the second stage each underwent a centrifuge evaluation in response to gradual onset rate profiles. METHODS AND MATERIAL: In each subject, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) before and at 2, 15 and 45 min of the tilt-test were recorded. The gravity-load centrifuge (GOR) studies were carried out [following the standard GOR programme, at 0. 1 G/s rate of gravity load increase until the gravity load tolerance limit (loss of peripheral vision) was reached]. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Relationships between variables were explored using Kendall&#x 2032;s tau-B correlation coefficient. The critical P-level was one-tailed 0. 05. RESULTS: In four of 20 subjects (20 &#x 0025;), vasovagal syncope occurred during the tilt test. G-level tolerance of this group (of &#x 002 B;Gz accelerations) lay in the range from &#x 002 B; 4 to &#x 002 B; 8. 1 Gz, (&#x 002 B; 5. 72 ? 0. 86 Gz average) and was comparable to the group without syncope. Loss of consciousness did not occur in any subjects during the centrifuge test. No statistically significant correlation was observed between HR and BP during tilt test and tolerance to &#x 002 B;Gz accelerations. CONCLUSIONS: The result of tilt testing, carried out according to the Westminster protocol, was not useful in predicting individual tolerance to &#x 002 B;Gz gravity loads...|$|E
40|$|A {{problem in}} modern, agile {{aircraft}} {{is the possibility}} of the pilot losing consciousness during manoeuvres which can impose forces (G) many times that of gravitational acceleration. There is a possibility that the next generation of agile aircraft will exceed the level of anti-G protection presently available and the possibility of pharmacological intervention had been considered as an additional means of raising <b>G-tolerance.</b> Arginine vasopressin plays an active role in maintaining blood pressure, particularly in hypovolaemic situations, by its powerful vasoconstrictive action and control of heart output. As a potential G protection agent AVP has the appeal of not appearing to produce hypertension. The human centrifuge has normally been used to investigate problems of acceleration protection, but because of the hostile environment and space restraints, it has been difficult to carry out systematic biochemical investigations and lower body negative pressure has been used to simulate the cardio-vascular stress of G. The level of plasma catecholamines and arginine vasopressin has been measured during different exposure levels to lower body negative pressure and following b blockade with Propranolol combined with lower body negative pressure. No correlation could be established between peripheral circulating plasma levels of catecholamines and arginine vasopressin for any of the experimental conditions. However, dramatic oscillations in plasma noradrenaline levels were seen and a distinct pattern of arginine vasopressin secretion was observed at presyncope. The role of arginine vasopressin during syncope was investigated and small increases in plasma levels of this vasoactive hormone appeared to play a protective role in some subjects. In subsequent experiments, a bolus of arginine vasopressin was injected prior to exposure to lower body negative pressure, but this did not appear to have any effect on tolerance to lower body negative pressure and in some subjects it was positively detrimental...|$|E
