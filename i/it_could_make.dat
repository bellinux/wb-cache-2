The city engineer estimated it would need a subsidy of NOK2 million in 2006, and the politicians, who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit. This was rejected by Vildanden—on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a private placement for NOK4 million in December 2005. The company had since the start been losing money, and needed extra capital to get through the rough until <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> an operating profit. After the placement, 15% of the company was owned by DAT, while Coast Air sold their shares. In 2005, Vildanden had a revenue of NOK15 million.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches, and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload on the beaches.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Combined Fleet {{was also}} seeking to draw Allied naval forces {{into what was}} hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet {{carriers}}— and —and one light carrier——arrived at the main Japanese naval base at Truk Atoll from Japan in early October and joined Shōkaku and Zuikaku. With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> up for the defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart {{from a couple of}} air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed in the northwestern area of the Solomon Islands, out of the battle for Guadalcanal and waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carriers. With the Japanese Army's next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for 20 October, Yamamoto's warships began to move towards the southern Solomons to support the offensive and to be ready to engage any Allied (primarily U.S.) ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.|$|E

25|$|In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies, acting {{through the}} Second Continental Congress, {{declared}} political independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution. The new states, though independent {{of each other}} as nation states, recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British. Desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy, Congress negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish an alliance between the states. As a central authority, Congress under the Articles was without any legislative power; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens. This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned {{with respect to the}} royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire. Out from under any monarchy, the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress, while severally lodging the rest within their own respective state governments. Only after all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the Articles take effect on March 1, 1781, when Maryland became the final state to ratify them.|$|E

25|$|Sin and Punishment was co-developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 and Treasure. Development began around 1997 when Treasure {{wrote the}} {{original}} proposal and submitted it to Nintendo. The original inspiration {{to develop the}} game was {{the design of the}} Nintendo 64 controller. In {{the early days of the}} system's lifespan, Nintendo had suggested two ways of holding the controller, a left and right position. Due to the success of Super Mario 64 which released alongside the console in 1996, many games followed in its trails and featured the same right positioning it used. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, began discussing with his team how the left positioning was underutilized and thought <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> for an interesting game, and so started developing a new game to use this position. Nintendo warned Treasure that the left positioning would feel unnatural to players at first, however Treasure was already expecting this. Nintendo was also planning a controller accessory at the time with a movement sensor. The team considered adapting the sensor for the game, but ultimately decided against it as it would have lengthened an already dragging development process. The sensor technology was not finalized by Nintendo until the release of the Wii in 2006.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} Vikings used A.muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first {{suggested}} by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports {{about the use of}} fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people.

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} {{were created by}} Sony Pictures Imageworks, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns. The VFX company's two key goals were to {{accurately}} portray von Stauffenberg's injuries {{and to create a}} 1943 period look to Berlin. With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically, the majority of the 800 computer-generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg's injuries. A digital version of Cruise's hand was designed, and VFX employees rotoscoped the hand in every movement <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> so the missing fingers were erased in the process. With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg's hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own, were inescapable. According to VFX supervisor Richard R. Hoover, [...] "We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn't stick {{his hands in his pockets}} to try and hide his injuries." ...|$|E

500|$|The team {{hoped that}} despite the short {{duration}} of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters.

They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the [...] "discovery" [...] of the outbreak, its inevitability, and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story. The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies. The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling. Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in slow motion, as they believed that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> the action feel [...] "balletic" [...] instead of purely violent.|$|E

Knowles' vocals range from the note of G3 to E5. The song features a synth-horn backdrop as well as a bounce-based hand clap beat. Like most of the tracks on the album, the beat is reinforced by the Roland TR-808 drum machine, while the song also features a heavy bass. [...] "Upgrade U" [...] samples Betty Wright's 1968 song [...] "Girls Can't Do What the Guys Do", composed by Willie Clarke and Clarence Reid. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that similarities between [...] "Upgrade U" [...] and songs from the Destiny's Child era in the sense that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a [...] "female self-empowerment" [...] anthem. According to Mike Joseph of PopMatters, [...] "Upgrade U" [...] contains [...] "the natural chemistry" [...] that Knowles and Jay-Z have in real life. The concept of the song revolves around a woman offering luxuries to a man, to upgrade the lifestyle and the reputation of the latter; similar to the concept of [...] "Suga Mama", another track from B'Day.
