40|$|Abstract In forest trees, roots mediate such {{significant}} carbon fluxes {{as primary}} production and soil C 02 efflux. Despite {{the central role}} of roots in these critical processes, information on root distribution during stand establishment is limited, yet must be described to accurately predict how various forest types, which are growing with a range of resource limitations, might respond to environmental change. This study reports root length density and biomass development in young stands of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoidies Bartr.) and American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) that have narrow, high resource site requirements, and compares them with sweetgum (Liquidambar styraczj 7 ua L.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), which have more robust site requirements. Fine roots (5 mm) were sampled to determine spatial distribu-tion in response to fertilizer and irrigation treatments delivered through drip irrigation tubes. Root length density and biomass were predominately controlled by stand development, depth and proximity to drip tubes. After accounting for this spatial and temporal variation, there was a significant increase in RLD with fertilization and irrigation for all genotypes. The response to fertilization was greater than that of irrigation. Both fine and coarse roots responded positively to resources delivered through the <b>drip</b> <b>tube,</b> indicating a wholeroot- system response to resource enrichment and not just a feeder root response. The plastic response to <b>drip</b> <b>tube</b> water and nutrient enrichment demonstmte the capability of root systems to respond to supply heterogeneity by increasing acquisition surface. Fineroot biomass, root density and specific root length were greater for broadleaved species than pine. Roots of all genotypes explored the rooting volume within 2 years, but this occurred faster and to higher root length densities in broadleaved species, indicating they had greater initial opportunity for resource acquisition than pine. Sweetgum's root characteristics and its response to resource availability were similar to the other broadleaved species, despite its hnctional resemblance to pine regarding robust site requirements. It was concluded that genotypes, irrigation arid fertilization significantly influenced tree root system development, which varied spatially in response to resource-supply heterogeneity created by dnp tubes. Knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of root distribution in these stands will be used to interpret nutrient acquisition and soil respiration measurements...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} {{and quality of}} irrigation water has become an issue limiting productivity in many Australian vegetable regions. Production is also under competitive pressure from supply chain forces. Producers look to new technologies, including changing irrigation infrastructure, exploring new water sources, and more complex irrigation management, to survive these stresses. Often there is little objective information investigating which improvements could improve outcomes for vegetable producers, and external communities (e. g. meeting NRM targets). This has led to investment in inappropriate technologies, and costly repetition of errors, as business independently discover the worth of technologies by personal experience. In our project, we investigated technology improvements for vegetable irrigation. Through engagement with industry and other researchers, we identified technologies most applicable to growers, particularly those that addressed priority issues. We developed analytical tools for ‘what if’ scenario testing of technologies. We conducted nine detailed experiments in the Lockyer Valley and Riverina vegetable growing districts, as well as case studies on grower properties in southern Queensland. We investigated root zone monitoring tools (FullStop™ wetting front detectors and Soil Solution Extraction Tubes - SSET), drip system layout, fertigation equipment, and altering planting arrangements. Our project team developed and validated models for broccoli, sweet corn, green beans and lettuce, and spreadsheets for evaluating economic risks associated with new technologies. We presented project outcomes at over 100 extension events, including irrigation showcases, conferences, field days, farm walks and workshops. The FullStops™ were excellent for monitoring root zone conditions (EC, nitrate levels), and managing irrigation with poor quality water. They were easier to interpret than the SSET. The SSET were simpler to install, but required wet soil to be reliable. SSET were an option for monitoring deeper soil zones, unsuitable for FullStop™ installations. Because these root zone tools require expertise, and are labour intensive, we recommend they be used to address specific problems, or as a periodic auditing strategy, not for routine monitoring. In our research, we routinely found high residual N in horticultural soils, with subsequently little crop yield response to additional nitrogen fertiliser. With improved irrigation efficiency (and less leaching), it may be timely to re-examine nitrogen budgets and recommendations for vegetable crops. Where the drip irrigation tube was located close to the crop row (i. e. within 5 - 8 cm), management of irrigation was easier. It improved nitrogen uptake, water use efficiency, and reduced the risk of poor crop performance through moisture stress, particularly in the early crop establishment phases. Close proximity of the <b>drip</b> <b>tube</b> to the crop row gives the producer more options for managing salty water, and more flexibility in taking risks with forecast rain. In many vegetable crops, proximate drip systems may not be cost-effective. The next best alternative is to push crop rows closer to the <b>drip</b> <b>tube</b> (leading to an asymmetric row structure). The vegetable crop models are good at predicting crop phenology (development stages, time to harvest), input use (water, fertiliser), environmental impacts (nutrient, salt movement) and total yields. The two immediate applications for the models are understanding/predicting/manipulating harvest dates and nitrogen movements in vegetable cropping systems. From the economic tools, the major influences on accumulated profit are price and yield. In doing ‘what if’ analyses, {{it is very important}} to be as accurate as possible in ascertaining what the assumed yield and price ranges are. In most vegetable production systems, lowering the required inputs (e. g. irrigation requirement, fertiliser requirement) is unlikely to have a major influence on accumulated profit. However, if a resource is constraining (e. g. available irrigation water), it is usually most profitable to maximise return per unit of that resource...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} recent {{outbreaks}} of foodborne illnesses in the US have been traced to contaminated water either used in washing vegetables or in irrigating them. It is readily apparent that such foods as leafy green vegetables or crops such as melons that touch the soil surface or {{come in contact with}} irrigation water can become contaminated by pathogens in irrigation water. There is strong evidence in the literature that such crops do not become contaminated so long as the edible portions of the plant do not come in contact with irrigation water or a wetted soil surface. Thus, we undertook a modeling study utilizing the well-known software, HYDRUS- 2 D, to determine minimum depths of placement of irrigation tubing for subsurface irrigation that ensure that the soil surface does not become contaminated. We chose to model a cropping system commonly used for lettuce production in Arizona where the crop is nearly always irrigated using furrow irrigation. Lettuce is usually grown in Arizona in the fall and winter months when maximum crop evapotranspiration (ET) is about 4. 9 mm per day. We used an application efficiency of 95 % for subsurface drip irrigation on two different soil types, sandy clay loam and loam. Assuming that we would irrigate daily for two hours to apply the required 5. 2 mm of water, we found water would wet the soil to a distance of 16 cm above the drip emitter in the both the clay loam and clay soils. Thus it would appear that in these soils, a <b>drip</b> <b>tube</b> placed 20 cm below the surface should avoid soil surface wetting. However, given the great spatial variability in such soil parameters as bulk density and hydraulic conductivity, we would recommend a minimum design depth of 30 cm to avoid soil surface wetting...|$|E

However, potato productivity and industry expansion have been constrained by the poor quality seed tubers being produced in the informal seed sector due to inadequate supply of initial planting materials, improper fertilizer management practices and irregular rainfall patterns. A study was done at the Horticultural Research and Teaching Farm of Egerton University to determine the effect of integration of irrigation water, nitrogen and phosphorus rates on seed tuber relative weight loss and sprouting characteristics after storage. The three factors were tested in a split-split plot design where irrigation water supply was assigned to main plots, N to subplots and P to sub-subplots. The treatments were replicated three times and the trial repeated once. The treatments consisted of three irrigation water rates (40 %, 65 % and 100 % field capacity), applied throughout the potato growth period through <b>drip</b> <b>tube</b> lines. Nitrogen was supplied as urea (46 % N) at four equivalent rates of 0, 75, 112. 5 and 150 kg N/ha, while phosphorus was supplied at planting time as triple superphosphate (46 % P 2 O 5) at four rates of 0, 115, 172. 5 and 230 kg/ha P 2 O 5, which translated into 0, 50. 6, 75. 9, 101. 2 kg P/ha. Data collected included relative percentage weight loss, number of sprouts and sprouting percentage. Data collected was subjected to analysis of variance and significantly different means separated using Tukey’s Studentized Range Test at p ? 0. 05. The 100 % compared to 65 % and 40 % irrigation water rates resulted in relatively high weight loss, sprout length and reduced the number of sprouts and sprouting percentage of seed tubers. N and P rates generally decreased the relative weight loss, improved the number of sprouts and sprouting percentage.

This paper presents results achieved at the above mentioned pitches and at three types of tube bundle surfaces...|$|R
40|$|En el presente estudio se ha realizado la evaluación de un {{material}} textil procedente de residuos de envolturas cárnicas para su uso como manta de riego localizado y subsuperficial en jardinería (césped). El ensayo consta de seis tratamientos diferentes: los primeros tres tratamientos se han realizado a partir del material reciclable (celulosa). Dos de ellos presentan la disposición de las tiras de celulosa en forma de entramado reticular de alta y baja densidad, mientras que el tercero tiene un entramado irregular de alta densidad. Por otro lado, el cuarto tratamiento se corresponde con el empleo de una manta comercial compuesta únicamente de polipropileno. Finalmente, tanto el tratamiento 5 como el 6 se han empleado a modo de testigos. En el primer testigo solamente se ha colocado el tubo de riego por goteo para poder observar el efecto que tienen las mantas sobre el césped, mientras que el testigo número dos es el único tratamiento del ensayo sin riego. A {{lo largo de}} la experimentación se han realizado diversas pruebas en las que se ha medido el grado de humectación de las mantas y se han determinado las curvas de retención de humedad de las mismas. Asimismo, se ha llevado a cabo un análisis cualitativo (evaluación visual) y uno cuantitativo (procesado de imágenes con cámara de espectro visible (RGB) y sensor multiespectral Sequoia), a partir de los cuales se ha realizado una comparativa entre todos los tratamientos. Los resultados muestran que las mantas de riego elaboradas con celulosa, no presentan - bajo nuestras condiciones experimentales - un mejor comportamiento que el obtenido con similar riego sin manta. The following study {{presents the}} evaluation of a textile material from meat wrapping residues {{to be used as}} a centralized and subsurface irrigation mat in gardening (lawns). The trial consists of six different treatments: the first three treatments have been made with recyclable material (cellulose). Two of them present the disposition of the cellulose strips in the form of reticular lattice of high and low density, while the third has an irregular lattice of high density. On the other hand, the fourth treatment corresponds to the use of a commercial mat formed only with polypropylene. Finally, both treatments five and six have been used as control treatments. In the first control, only the <b>drip</b> irrigation <b>tube</b> has been placed in order to observe the effect of the mats on the lawn, while the control number two is the only treatment of the test without irrigation. Throughout the experiment several tests have been carried out in which the degree of wetting of the mats has been measured and the humidity retention curves of the mats have been determined. In addition, a qualitative analysis (visual evaluation) and a quantitative analysis (image processing with visible spectrum camera (RGB) and Sequoia multispectral sensor) were carried out, from which a comparison was made among all the treatments. The results show that the irrigation mats made with cellulose do not present - under our experimental conditions - a better behavior than the one obtained with similar irrigation without mat.

5000|$|White {{was back}} on the stand being {{examined}} by J. Michael Flanagan. It was heard that, based on the diagram showing what Dr. Murray told the police he gave to Jackson on the night in question, it would not have presented any danger at all. White said that [...] "the dose of propofol we are talking here is 25 mg. This is a dose that produces little anxiety, little sleepiness." [...] It was heard that anesthesiologists are obviously trained in sedation. For non-anesthesiologists, most hospitals require certification to use sedation. White was then given a certificate to read. It was Murray's certification from Sunrise Medical Hospital approving him to administer moderate sedation. It qualifies the doctor to administer drugs to achieve moderate sedation; but he must monitor patients carefully. The certification also says the doctor is approved to rescue patients from deep sedation, manage compromised airway, and provide adequate ventilation. Flanagan and White went through simulations that Shafer put together with variables of amount of drugs and time administered. It was heard that {{the fact that there is}} some free lorazepam in the stomach, showing that Jackson took lorazepam orally at some point before his death. Flanagan went going through different scenarios with Dr. White that this could have caused Jackson's death. Dr. White then demonstrated how to mix propofol and lidocaine inside a syringe and administered it through a saline <b>drip</b> and Y <b>tube.</b> White injected 5 mg of propofol/saline mix into a cup to show that propofol doesn't go up the IV line and propofol sticks to the plastic tubing. He said that this is certainly a very safe way to inject propofol, and it was only 25 mg. [...] "My demonstration was probably close to what happened at the scene. You'd need a mechanism to drip the drug and hold this heavy bottle." [...] Flanagan asked if he could envision anyone using a slit IV bag to hang the propofol bottle when there's handle on the bottle? [...] "No." [...] White added: [...] "Why would anyone go through the hassle of cutting a saline bag to put bottle inside when bottle has a handle?" [...] Flanagan then asked how you would mix propofol solution with saline to make it 1-1 mg/ml? [...] "You pull tab off the bottle, spike top, then inject all the bottle of propofol into the saline bag, shaking the bag to make it 1-1 μg/ml." ...|$|R
40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will understand}} that forensic investigations {{are based on a}} multidisciplinary approach in which autopsy findings and toxicological results often result in association with circumstances and crime scene investigations. This presentation will impact the forensic science community by demonstrating how recreational abuse of anesthetic and sedative agents in health care practitioners, especially anesthesiologists is an increasing event. This presentation will also show an unusual case of suicide in which the manner and means of suicide was dependent upon the occupation of the victim. Presented is a case of a 50 -year-old man, anesthetist at the main local hospital, who was found dead in the house where he lived alone since separating from his wife. On the previous evening he was found on the landing’s floor with an occipital bruise injury and treated in the Emergency Department. The next day his brother, alerted by his colleagues that tried in vain to contact him, went to his house. He found that the front door had been left ajar, with a piece of furniture behind it. When he entered the flat, he noticed the corpse of the brother, supine on the living room’s floor near a piece of furniture. There were two <b>drips</b> with intravenous <b>tubes</b> almost empty (approximately 1 ml). One drip was still inserted in the dorsum of the victim’s right hand with <b>tube</b> for intravenous <b>drip</b> totally open. On the glass of this drip there was written “Miclela Caput” (meaning “Caput Mixture,” written incorrectly). On the glass of the other drip there was written “ 500 TPS+ 200 DIPR” (meaning Sodium Thiopental+Diprivan). In the house there were some empty blisters of Zolpidem, more than 20 packs of different drugs (some of them empty), an ash-tray containing white liquid, several empty ampoules of Propofol, Midazolam and Thiopental, and several new and used syringes. In the bedroom there were two knapsacks containing pornographic materials and four plastic phalli. External examination revealed abundant livor mortis, numerous recent needle marks with fresh and older hemorrhages in both arms, and a sutured occipital injury. Autopsy and histological findings were pulmonary and brain oedema, moderate fatty liver, acute poly-visceral congestion, hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Systematic toxicological analysis was performed on biological and non biological samples for alcohol, drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Blood toxicological examination by GC/MS revealed lethal concentration of Zolpidem (0. 86 μg/ml) and high therapeutic blood concentrations of Propofol (0. 30 μg/ml), Midazolam (0. 08 μg/ml), Amitriptyline (0. 07 μg/ml), and low concentration of Thiopental (0. 03 μg/ml). Zolpidem was also found in gastric content while Thiopental was found in urine. Hair segment analysis (0 – 2 cm) revealed Propofol (4, 7 μg/mg) and the presence of Zolpidem, Amitriptyline and Ketoprofen. Residual’s toxicological analysis of the inserted drip (“Caput mixture”) revealed Propofol and Midazolam (approximately 1, 9 and 0, 08 mg/ml). Analysis of the non-inserted drip, showed Propofol and Thiopental (approximately 2 and 5 mg/ml). The low blood concentration of Thiopental suggests a self administration of the non-inserted drip at least 12 hours before death. The blood Propofol level was lower than or within the commonly accepted therapeutic range of 1. 3 – 6. 8 μg/ml after a standard anesthetic induction dose. Published reports indicate that in most cases, the postmortem Propofol concentrations were at therapeutic levels. It {{should be pointed out that}} especially for those agents used in anesthesia; the therapeutic concentrations refer to patients being supported respiratorywise, while in non-supported or non-intubated patients such concentrations may be lethal. Most of those deaths are thought to have occurred because of the rapidity of Propofol’s injection which led to apnea and death. A mere interpretation of the blood and tissue concentrations of Propofol in the toxicological analysis may be of limited diagnostic significance without taking into account the before mentioned reports. Toxicological analysis of hair confirmed the recreational abuse of Propofol. These anesthetic and sedative drugs are often used in combination for anesthesia’s induction. All of these act synergistically in combination and may induce respiratory depression. This effect depends on individual susceptibility, on dose used and, especially for Propofol and Midazolam, infusion’s rapidity. In conclusion, the victim was administered a solution of anesthetic drugs, rapidly infused in a lethal combination and simultaneously a hypnotic drug in lethal dose...|$|R
