5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for his treatment of the natives <b>in</b> <b>Congo</b> Free State. In the United States, the main outlet of this criticism was the Presbyterian church. In 1891, Sheppard became involved with William Morrison after Lapsley's death. They would report the crimes they saw, and later, {{with the help of}} Roger Casement, would form the Congo Reform Association (CRA), one of the world's first humanitarian organizations.|$|E

Malaysian peacekeeping forces have contributed to many UN peacekeeping missions, such as <b>in</b> <b>Congo,</b> Iran–Iraq, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, East Timor and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{considered}} a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy <b>in</b> <b>Congo,</b> the contribution of coltan mining <b>in</b> <b>Congo</b> to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E

5|$|Leopold {{gave his}} {{mistress}} vast {{sums of money}} by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit. He also arranged for his two sons to be well provided for after his death. Under Belgian law, his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate, regardless {{of the contents of}} his will. However, this applied only in Belgium and not abroad; consequently, much of the wealth he distributed for safekeeping was in foreign investments or in the shape of paintings, bric-a-brac, and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash. Leopold transferred Caroline a fortune <b>in</b> <b>Congo</b> securities, which were added to the already vast sum of six million francs he had previously presented her. Princess Louise soon went after these securities, but with the help of men loyal to the king, Caroline was able to safely spirit away the majority of her wealth to Paris; two of her estates (in Brussels and in France) were boarded up however, disallowing her from entering them.|$|E

25|$|Christianity has a {{long history}} <b>in</b> <b>Congo,</b> dating back to 1484, when the Portuguese arrived and {{convinced}} the king and entourage of the Kongo people to convert. In 1506, a Portuguese-supported candidate for kingship, Alfonso I of Kongo won the throne. Alfonso (the Kongo royal family had begun to take on Portuguese names), established relations with the Vatican. More widespread conversion occurred during the Belgian colonial era. Christianity varies in its forms, and is in some ways surprisingly similar to native beliefs.|$|E

25|$|The above {{descriptions}} are {{by necessity}} simplified. Many Congolese are multilingual, {{and the language}} used depends on the context. For instance, a government official might use French to set a tone of formality and authority with another official, use Lingala when buying goods at a market, and the local language when in his home village. English is also spoken, especially in the east where eastern and southern African influences have spread in the post-Mobutu era. Among the slangs spoken <b>in</b> <b>Congo,</b> Indubil has been noted since around the 1960s, and continues to evolve nowadays.|$|E

Over 60 of Katanga's 75 processing plants are owned by Chinese companies and 90 percent of the region's minerals go to China.
