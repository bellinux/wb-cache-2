While {{compared}} unfavorably to White Heat by critics, it was fairly successful at the box office, with $500,000 <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> Cagney Productions' bankers to pay off their losses. Cagney Productions was not a great success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, A Lion Is in the Streets, the company came to an end.|$|E

It was then {{extended}} {{to the end of}} January 2010 after making an impressive debut against Hartlepool in the 2–0 victory at Victoria Park. Forster received a red card on 26 September 2009 against Gillingham for bringing Curtis Weston down in the penalty area, however this was considered to be a controversial decision. He made a blunder in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United on 19 October, with a 90th-minute goal kick <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> Jermaine Beckford who scored.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July 1822, in the MCC v Kent {{match at}} Lord's, Willes opened the bowling for Kent and was {{promptly}} no-balled for using his roundarm action.

25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E

2500|$|As the band's {{popularity}} increased, however, Weller became {{restless and}} wanted to explore a more soulful, melodic style of music with a broader instrumentation, and in consequence in 1982 he announced that The Jam would disband {{at the end of}} that year. The action came as a surprise to Foxton and Buckler who both felt that the band was still a creative formation with scope to develop further professionally, but Weller was determined to end the band and move on. Their final single, [...] "Beat Surrender", became their fourth UK chart topper, <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> No.1 in its first week.

2500|$|With {{the news}} that Wayne Carlisle had agreed to rejoin the Gulls, Torquay went into their Carling Cup First Round fixture against Reading full of confidence. [...] The Torquay defence proved as {{resilient}} against the Championship side {{as it had been}} against every other team it had encountered since the beginning of April, and {{it was not until the}} very last minute of extra time that Royals striker Grzegorz Rasiak finally found a way past keeper Scott Bevan. [...] A similar problem was encountered by Bournemouth in their Johnstone Paints Trophy First Round clash with the Gulls. [...] However, this time, with the match <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> penalties with a 0-0 stalemate after 90 minutes, the Cherries still could not find a way past Bevan and Torquay went on to win the tie 3-0 in the penalty shoot out.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the glass ceiling, which already is stopping women from climbing higher in success in the workplace, a parallel phenomenon called the [...] "glass escalator" [...] is occurring. This {{can be defined as}} how more men are joining fields that were previously occupied mainly by women, such as nursing and teaching, and within these job fields, the men are riding right past women and <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the top, similarly to if they were on an escalator and a woman was taking stairs. Men are being offered more promotions than women and even though women have worked just as hard, they are still not being offered the same chances as men are in some circumstances. The chart from Carolyn K. Broner, Ph.D. shows an example of the glass escalator in favor of men for female-dominant occupations in schools. While women have mostly occupied the position of teachers, men are taking the higher positions in school systems as deans or principals.|$|E

In the process, Manny {{continued}} to be Manny by high-fiving a Red Sox fan in Baltimore while making a catch. Later that month in the same place, Manny Ramirez hit his 500th career home run. Despite the positive progress, David Ortiz was injured on May 31. As a result, the usually quiet J. D. Drew stepped up by reinventing his image. He hit [...]337 with 27 RBI in June 2008. Another part of the Red Sox' reinvention occurred in an early June game against the Tampa Bay Rays where pitcher James Shields hit Coco Crisp, resulting in Crisp <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> Shields. Shortly after, both benches cleared out in a brawl. In July, the defending champions sent seven All-Stars to the game at the hated Yankee Stadium, Dustin Pedroia, David Ortiz, J. D. Drew, Manny Ramirez, Jonathan Papelbon, Jason Varitek, and Kevin Youkilis, with Ramirez, Youkilis, and Pedroia named starters to Francona's American League squad. In the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, J. D. Drew hit a two-run home run in the seventh inning. He earned All-Star Game MVP honors due to his stellar performance.|$|E
