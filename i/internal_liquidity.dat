However, few existing studies investigate its effects on bond yield spreads. Panel data for the period from year 1993 through 2008 show that corporate <b>internal</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk significantly impacts bond yield spreads (and changes) when controlling for well-known bond yield determinant variables, traditional accounting measures of corporate debt servicing ability, cash flow volatility, credit ratings, and state variables.

Using panel data on gross region-to-region migration flows in 1992 - 99, we estimate {{the effect of}} economic, political and social factors.

People move from poorer and job scarce regions with worse public good provision to ones that are richer and more prospering both in terms of employment prospects and public goods.

40|$|Liquidity risk is {{associated}} with solvency uncertainty at the re 8 ̆ 5 nancing stage. To insure, banks can accumulate liquid assets, or enhance transparency to facilitate re nancing. A liquidity bu¤er provides complete insurance against small liquid-ity shocks, while transparency o¤ers partial insurance against large ones as well.

This study {{analyses}} {{data for}} the top ten listed real-estate firms in South Africa to examine the relationships that exist between <b>Internal</b> <b>Liquidity,</b> Capital Structure and Firm Profitability.

40|$|Investment {{cash flow}} {{sensitivity}} {{is associated with}} both underinvestment when cash flows are low and overinvestment when cash flows are high. The accessibility of external capital is positively correlated with cash flows, intensifying investment cash flow sensitivity. Managers actively counteract the variations in <b>internal</b> and external <b>liquidity</b> by accumulating working capital when liquidity is high and draining it when liquidity is low. These results imply that cash flow sensitive firms face financial constraints, which are binding in low cash flow years. Traditional indicators of financial constraints, such as size and dividend payout, successfully distinguish firms that may potentially face constraints, but are less successful in distinguishing between periods of tight and relaxed constraints.

The banking system is well capitalized and profitable, with adequate liquidity, but faces challenges arising from the recent rapid credit growth that increases bank exposure to unfamiliar credit risks. Strategic and medium-term challenges include addressing legal and institutional impediments to improving competitiveness and developing new, cost-efficient sources of funding.

40|$|This study {{examines}} external and domestic influences on Latin America’s economic performance {{over the past}} decade and a half. It notes that over the past few years, macroeconomic policies have strengthened and structural reforms have been implemented. Together with a favorable external environment, these policies have contributed to Latin America’s relatively sharp economic recovery from its last recession. The study discusses the priorities for the region’s reform agenda that could help to ensure that this growing prosperity becomes entrenched. It also makes observations on the future roles of the major policymakers involved [...] the governments in the region; the international financial institutions, and especially the IMF; and industrial country governments.

40|$|This paper reveals why foreign {{ownership}} participation {{matters in the}} sensitivity relationship between investment and the <b>internal</b> <b>liquidity</b> of listed companies in Indonesia. This paper finds that foreign-owned enterprises are less financially constrained than domestic-owned ones, {{especially in terms of}} short-term investment following a financial crisis. Empirical evidence is provided by dividing 157 firms listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange for at least five consecutive years between 1994 and 2004 into foreign-owned enterprises, and comparing their financing constraints and performance before and after the financial crisis during that period. The results also demonstrated that post-crisis foreign-owned enterprises performed better with higher sales, greater market opportunity and less leverage, leading to lower financing constraint. Subsequently, foreign-owned enterprises have a better capacity to invest more than local-owned ones. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} analytically how short sellers can put non-transitory {{downward pressure}} {{on the stock market}} prices and intrinsic values of companies that need to raise external capital because of insufficient <b>internal</b> <b>liquidity.</b> The model helps explain anomalous empirical findings in the extant literature on negative returns to stocks subjected to heavy shorting activity. The implications of the model also supply normative justification for the sizable cash reserves held by corporations and their reluctance to raise external capital. The equity pricing effects implied by the model are illustrated for a large empirical sample of companies negatively impacted by heavy short sales. Empirical tests are also conducted in this research that provide evidence consistent with the theory. Short sales, liquidity, new issue, equity, bankruptcy...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{fundamental}} Q model of investment {{to consider the}} role played by financing frictions in agricultural investment decisions, controlling econometrically for censoring, heterogeneity and errors-in-variables. Our findings suggest that farmer's investment decisions are not driven by market fundamentals. We find some evidence that debt overhang restricts investment but investment is not dependent on liquidity or internal funds. The role of financing frictions in determining investment decisions changes in the post-financial crisis period when debt overhang becomes a significant impediment to farm investment. The evidence suggests that farmers increasingly rely on <b>internal</b> <b>liquidity</b> to drive investment. Finally, we find no evidence that farmers use off-farm capital to fund on-farm investment. Credit Constraints, Firm Level Investment, Tobin's Q, Debt...|$|E
30|$|The {{studies of}} Kadapakkam et al. (1998) and Cleary (2006) also, {{find that in}} several {{developed}} countries investment is more sensitive to cash flow for firms that are a priori expected to be less financially constrained. Shin and Park (1999) also find that more constrained firms have higher sensitivity of firm investment to internal funds for the Korean companies and Caggese (2007) finds the similar results {{in the context of}} UK companies. These studies conclude that <b>internal</b> <b>liquidity</b> of the firm is a significant determinant of corporate investment for the financially constrained firms and investment-cash flow sensitivity can also be used as a useful measure of financial constraints. On the other side, Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and Cleary (1999) have shown that sensitivity of firms is more for the least financial constrained firms.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the entities activating on capital markets is exposed directly to liquidity risk. When we approach this type of entities the liquidity risk has two main components: (a) the <b>internal</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk, which refers {{to the possibility that}} the financing capacity and largely, the cash flow of a specific enterprise that acts on capital markets, to be affected; (b) the market liquidity risk that covers the capacity of reselling financial assets on capital markets. Even though, during the time, these two components of liquidity risk were approached independently, recent studies consider them interdependent. We want to emphasize with this study that in the actual framework of capital markets the two components of liquidity risk should always be analyzed together, in order to provide the best premises for decision makers...|$|E

The sample of firms {{was divided into}} two subsamples based on the ownership structure data.

40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{provided evidence}} on financing constraints for investment in R&D activities due to capital market imperfections and special features of R&D investments. Moreover, {{it has been}} shown that a shift in capital structure towards more debt, results in a reduction of R&D investments. This article complements this literature by compartmentalizing R&D activities in its components, ‘R’ and ‘D’. In particular, we distinguish research from development as these activities do not only differ in their nature, but also to a large extent take place sequentially. Our results show that ‘R’ investment is more sensitive to the firms’ operating liquidity than ‘D’ indicating that firms have to rely even more on internal funds for financing their research compared to development activities. Moreover, we find that (basic) research subsidy recipients’ investment is less sensitive to <b>internal</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Research and Development; Liquidity Constraints; Innovation Policy;...|$|E
