25|$|Being {{the most}} curious of the Three, Jayfeather {{tries to find}} out who his true parents are. When asking around about his birth, Mousefur reveals that Leafpool accidentally put a strange herb in Mousefur's tansy soon after Jayfeather's birth. After looking through herbs in the {{medicine}} cat's den and with herbs sticking to his pelt, he goes to Mousefur to deliver some fresh-kill. Mousefur says that a certain herb sticking to his fur is the mystery herb, but Jayfeather does not know what it <b>is.</b> <b>To</b> <b>find</b> <b>out,</b> he asks Littlecloud when the medicine cats meet at the Moonpool. The ShadowClan medicine cat recognizes it as parsley, a herb that stops the milk of a cat whose kits die. Jayfeather remembers that while going back to the camp after birth, there is another cat with him besides Squirrelflight: Leafpool, Jayfeather's true mother.|$|E

2500|$|Sensor-based {{activity}} {{recognition is}} a challenging task {{due to the}} inherent noisy nature of the input. Thus, statistical modeling has been the main thrust in this direction in layers, where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected. At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns {{how to find the}} detailed locations of agents from the received signal data. At an intermediate level, statistical inference may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels. Furthermore, at the highest level a major concern <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning.

2500|$|Contributions by attorneys, psychiatrists, {{and doctors}} were common as were advice columns {{on how to}} raise {{children}} while being a [...] "deviant". Marion Zimmer Bradley offered advice on whether to stay married after one knows she is a lesbian. [...] And the issue of marriage was brought up again in 1959 when The Ladder reported on a panel discussion sponsored by the Daughters of Bilitis that debated if marriage could cure homosexuality, all opinions of psychotherapists at hand saying that it could not, and one offering {{that it was not}} to be cured as it was not a disease. A 1957 column featuring a psychotherapist who offered his opinion on how one determines the source of lesbians' fear of men: [...] "The basic problem in evaluating your personal problems <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why you are shying away from sexual relations with men. In other words, the problem is not why you like women, but why you don't like men." [...] Forrest J Ackerman wrote two articles under his pseudonym LauraJean Ermayne (normally used for writing lesbian pulp fiction) and was declared an [...] "honorary lesbian" [...] for his contributions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} {{language}} attrition, in general, is to discover how, why {{and what is}} lost when a language is forgotten. The aim in foreign or second-language attrition research <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why, after an active learning process, the language competence changes or even stops (Gleason 1982). Further, results from {{research in this area}} could, as Van Els and Weltens (1989) counter, contribute to the understanding of relations between acquisition and attrition (van Els 1989). L2/FL attrition research is particularly important because it provides interesting results for foreign language instruction. De Bot and Weltens state, [...] "esearch on language attrition can also have a considerable impact on curriculum planning or foreign language teaching" [...] (1995: 152). The theoretical grounding of the language attrition research derives primarily from cognitive and psychological theories. Research in the area of language attrition concentrates generally on the loss of the L1 and L2. The first distinction that can be made is between pathological and natural language attrition. The former concentrates on language loss caused by a damage of the brain, injury, age or illness. However, this topic will not be investigated any further, because the language attrition in these cases is not caused by natural circumstances. Weltens (1987: 24) states another possible distinction, inter and intra generational language attrition. Inter generational language attrition is concerned with attrition within individuals, whereas intra generational language attrition concentrates on the attrition across different generations. Van Els (1986) distinguishes types of attrition in terms of which language is lost and in which environment it is being lost. Therefore, he classifies: ...|$|E

David pries Hook away, saying that Arthur was right, he doesn't remember anything from the events in Camelot, and the now, Arthur was [...] "no longer important." [...] Hook says Emma told them this was about him, but Regina says that Emma is manipulating him, like all the Dark Ones do, and Regina and Mary Margaret are convinced that Emma has fully succumbed to the darkness. Hook believes Emma hasn't fully caved to the darkness yet, since she hasn't used the sword yet, but Regina thinks Emma still needs another ingredient for her spell. Hook is determined {{to find out what}} went on in Camelot, saying {{that the only way to}} help her <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what happened between him and Emma. Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks what’s going on inside Emma’s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says he recognizes the look on her face – regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he can’t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him. Hook goes outside and calls for Emma and asks what happened between them and what she wants.|$|E
