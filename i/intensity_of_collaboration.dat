50|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, {{the scale}} and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> is a key determinant {{of whether or not}} polycentric networks function properly. Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) have given researchers a unique opportunity to study {{the scale and}} <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> in these areas. In a study conducted by researchers from the University of Vermont as well as the University of La Verne, using a 2009 Government Accountability Office survey of all 381 MPOs, they found a direct link to the scale of the MPO and the performance seen. The study concluded that higher <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> of MPOs across vertical as well as horizontal stakeholders generates a greater sense of good performance. The study found that MPOs who focus more on vertical collaboration (between the federal state and higher up agencies) saw a decrease in their perceived performance. The study looked at 15 indicators to determine its findings, these indicators include: condition of transportation network, mobility for disadvantaged populations, air quality, level of highway congestion, measure of public participation, extent of coordination and stakeholder involvement, satisfaction among general public, satisfaction among local stakeholders, compliance with federal and state rules, transportation systems security, transportation systems accessibility, transportation systems reliability, transportation systems safety, travel demand model accuracy and project implementation.|$|E

We use it to characterize the relations of collaboration, as {{defined in terms of}} co-publication, between the physicists the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), in the field of condensed-matter, between 1992 and 1997, and to analyse if their <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> depends on the geographical distance between laboratories. We find that the average intensity of co-publication within laboratories is about 40 times higher than the intensity between laboratories but within towns, and 100 times higher than the intensity between laboratories and between towns.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} some {{insights}} into scientific collaboration (SC) {{at the regional}} level by drawing upon two lines of inquiry. The first involves examining the spatial patterns of university SC across the EU- 15 (all countries belonging to the European Union between 1995 and 2004). The second consists of extending the current empirical analysis on regional SC collaboration by including the economic distance between regions in the model along with other variables suggested by the extant literature. The methodology relies on co-publications {{as a proxy for}} academic collaboration, and in order to test the relevance of economic distance for the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> between regions, we put forward a gravity equation. The descriptive results show that there are significant differences in the production of academic scientific papers between less-favoured regions and core regions. However, the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> is similar in both types of regions. Our econometric findings suggest that differences in scientific resources (as measured by R&D expenditure) between regions are relevant in explaining academic scientific collaborations, while distance in the level of development (as measured by per capita GDP) does not appear to play any significant role. Nevertheless, other variables in the analysis, including geographical distance, specialization and cultural factors, do yield significant estimated coefficients, and {{this is consistent with the}} previous literature on regional SC...|$|E

To do so, we analyse how the interplay of external knowledge sources (specifically, the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> end-user <b>collaboration</b> and the breadth <b>of</b> external <b>collaboration)</b> and the firm's internal resources impact process innovation at the firm level. Survey data from 166 Information Technology Services firms provide the empirical data, which is tested using the partial least squares structural equation model. Our results demonstrate that benefits from collaboration are not automatic, as the firm's commitment of internal resources fully mediates the impact <b>of</b> the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> end-user <b>collaboration</b> and breadth <b>of</b> external <b>collaboration</b> on process innovation.

It contributes to the literature on university industry knowledge transfer in investigating institutional collaborations, typically mediated by the university through its administrative structures such as departments or dedicated units such as technology transfer offices, and contractual personal collaborations between firms and individual academics, involving formal and binding contractual agreements, but carried out without the direct involvement of the university. We explore and compare the characteristics of firms involved in these two different governance forms of knowledge transfer, with those of firms that do not collaborate with universities. Our analysis shows that firms that use contractual personal collaborations are generally smaller and more often interested in the acquisition of external embodied and disembodied knowledge and open innovation strategies. ...|$|R

The study {{is based on the}} data of the research project 'KompNet 2011 - Factors determining the success of regional innovation networks', which examines the innovation activities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in and closely around Jena (Thuringia). The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore to what extent spatial reach <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> linkages determines innovation orientation and innovative behavior. That means: Innovation performance could be positively related to (a) to a high <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> local <b>collaboration,</b> (b) the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> international <b>collaboration</b> or (c) neither regional nor (inter) national collaborations. In a first step we summarize the relevant literature which comprises aspects of our central subject under investigation. We additionally discuss the necessity of keeping in mind several control variables for theoretical and empirical reasons. In the following we present descriptive analyses relating to the regional reach <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> in general, the impact <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> on innovation and the links between the regional reach of cooperation and different forms of innovation, i. e. product, process, marketing and organizational innovation. In a final step we discuss the results of several regression models. We observe that there is no significant influence of the geographical variables on the innovative performance of SME. Therefore our findings suggest that innovative firms rely on collaboration partners at a variety of spatial distances. The results also show a significant and positive influence <b>of</b> the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> competition on the innovativeness of firms in all models. Furthermore product- and process innovations are created by firms with intensive cooperative activities to scientific institutions, while a wide variety of cooperation partners and a strong focus on quality leadership turns out to be important for the development of marketing- and organizational innovations.

30|$|Let us briefly {{illustrate}} these {{mechanisms by}} considering the potential effects of personal proximity on the formation, process, and outcomes <b>of</b> <b>collaboration.</b> Regarding its first effect, personal proximity is likely to trigger the selection of partners. With respect to partner selection, people prefer to tap the knowledge of persons they like (Casciaro and Lobo 2008; Yuan et al. 2014). To give an example, informal interactions between researchers and industrial firms increase both the likelihood and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> research <b>collaboration</b> (Ponomariov and Boardman 2008). From a process perspective, personal proximity eases collaboration processes, for example, because partners may share {{a sense of humor}} that enables them to appreciate and put into perspective hard but necessary critique from one another (Robert and Wilbanks 2012). Hence, it counteracts both conflicts that may hamper collaboration. Additionally, personal proximity may benefit collaborations’ outcomes. That is, partners who are personally close might produce more collaborative output. In the long run, partners who ‘click’ on the personal level collaborate on more diverse projects (Jha and Welch 2010), in other words, they produce richer outputs.|$|R
