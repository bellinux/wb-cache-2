5|$|Although many Old Court supporters—typically the state's wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the National Republican Party (later to {{be called}} Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is {{inaccurate}} to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned with was their faith in Whig Party founder and native son, Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm's term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died {{a year and a}} <b>half</b> <b>into</b> his term and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a National Republican.|$|E

The Rebels also added a pair of field goals to their score, and rolled to a 3417 victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E

Virginia Tech added another field goal in the second quarter, but Michigan scored a touchdown {{in the final minute}} to take a 7–6 lead, and then recovered a Virginia Tech fumble on the ensuing kickoff. Michigan kicked a field goal as time expired in the first half to take a 10–6 lead. Michigan converted its first possession of the second <b>half</b> <b>into</b> a touchdown to take a 17–6 lead, but Virginia Tech added a field goal to narrow the lead to 17–9. In the fourth quarter, Virginia Tech scored a touchdown to narrow Michigan's lead to two points, and then converted a two-point conversion to tie the game. Michigan responded with a field goal, but Virginia Tech tied the game with a field goal with two seconds remaining. In overtime, Virginia Tech appeared to score the go-ahead touchdown, but the call on the field was overturned upon video review. On the next play, Virginia Tech missed a crucial field goal. Michigan converted its field goal opportunity to win the game 23–20 in overtime.|$|E
5|$|In the 1967/68 season, John left Llanelli {{and joined}} Cardiff, where he formed a {{partnership}} with Gareth Edwards. Although John and Edwards later became the scourge of New Zealand, their first international pairing had an inauspicious start. On 11 November 1967, the pair played their first international together, facing Brian Lochore's touring New Zealand team. Edwards, like John, had two international games to his name, paired with Watkins {{in the final two}} matches of the 1967 Five Nations Championship. John regained his international place after Watkins had switched to professional rugby league just the month before, joining Salford for a club record fee of £16,000. Wales had an error-strewn game, in a match played in a cutting, rain-laden wind which turned the pitch into a muddy field. Wales captain Norman Gale won the toss and chose to play the first <b>half</b> <b>into</b> the gale, and finished the half 8–0 down. John raised Welsh hopes with an early dropped goal, his first international points, but a panicked blind back pass from Wales' number8, John Jeffery, gifted Bill Davies an easy try. The game ended 13–6 to New Zealand, with Edwards looking uncomfortable throughout, and John's kicking inaccurate, there was little to suggest the pair would become one of the great half-back pairings in rugby history.|$|E

With the new reorganization the format of the League was preserved, while the changes that were made were exclusively administrative. Competitions continued to be conducted in a double round robin format among 16 clubs. There were couple seasons when the 14-clubs league's composition was experimented. Since the 2014 Russian aggression, the league was reduced to 12 members, while its format also has changed. The season is still being played in a double round robin {{in the first half of}} a season, after which the league splits in <b>half</b> <b>into</b> two groups of six (6) teams.

25|$|In 1816, several {{officers}} of the Imperial Russian Guard founded a society known as the Union of Salvation, or of the Faithful and True Sons of the Fatherland. The society acquired a more liberal cast after it was joined by the idealistic Pavel Pestel. After a mutiny in the Semenovsky Regiment in 1820, the society decided to suspend activity in 1821. Two groups, however, continued to function secretly: a Southern Society, based at Tulchin, a small garrison town in Ukraine, in which Pestel was the outstanding figure, and a Northern Society, based at St Petersburg, led by Guard officers Nikita Muraviev, Prince S. P. Trubetskoy and Prince Eugene Obolensky. The political aims of the more moderate Northern Society were a British-style constitutional monarchy with a limited franchise, the abolition of serfdom, and equality before the law. The Southern Society, under Pestel's influence, was more radical and wanted to abolish the monarchy, establish a republic and redistribute land: taking <b>half</b> <b>into</b> state ownership and dividing the rest among the peasants.|$|E

Chapman, however, was able to refine and improve on the idea better than his rivals, melding the tactical change with his own ideas on counter-attacking football, pacy wingers and a strong defence. Chapman himself summed it up by saying: [...] "the most opportune time for scoring is immediately after repelling an attack, because opponents are then strung out in the wrong half of the field." ...|$|E
