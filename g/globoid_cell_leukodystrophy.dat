It is a neurological disease where the dog lacks an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic condition that affects the breed is [...] "white dog shaker syndrome". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.|$|E

5000|$|Like MLD, Krabbe {{disease is}} {{another type of}} {{leukodystrophy}} with autosomal recessive inheritance that {{is the result of}} a lysosomal storage disorder. It is due to a deletion in exon 16 of the GALC gene that causes a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon. The GALC gene, found on chromosome 14 at position 31 (14q31), codes for the enzyme beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). GALC is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the catabolism of galactolipids, especially psychosine, that are heavily distributed throughout the brain. A deficiency in GALC thus causes a buildup of these fatty acids known as “globoid” macrophages that destroy oligodendrocytes, thereby inhibiting myelin formation. [...] Because of the presence of these globoid cells, clustered near white matter, Krabbe Disease often goes by the name <b>Globoid</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Leukodystrophy.</b> Furthermore, new research has shown that Krabbe Disease and <b>Globoid</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Leukodystrophy</b> may be distinct disease entities due to the secretion of inflammatory mediators by natural killer cells in some cases. This research has shown that Natural Killer cells have receptors (TDAG8) for certain glycosphingolipids that build up in an individual with leukodystrophy, again due to insufficient GALC levels, and when bound, target the Natural Killer cells for destruction thereby preventing their cytotoxic effects. These sphingolipids have been identified as galactosyl sphingosine and glycosyl sphingosine and are not present in unaffected individuals.|$|E

40|$|<b>Globoid</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukodystrophy</b> is a {{lysosomal}} {{storage disease}} {{characterized by the}} loss of galactocerebrosidase. Galactocerebrosidase loss leads to the accumulation of psychosine and subsequent oligodendrocyte cell death, demyelination, macrophage recruitment, and astroglial activation and proliferation. To date, no studies have elucidated the mechanism of glial cell activation and cytokine and chemokine up-regulation and release. We explored a novel explanation {{for the development of the}} pathological changes in the early stages of <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukodystrophy</b> associated with toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 up-regulation in the hindbrain and cerebellum as a response to dying oligodendrocytes. TLR 2 up-regulation on microglia/macrophages coincided with morphological changes consistent with activation at 2 and 3 weeks of age. TLR 2 up-regulation on activated microglia/macrophages resulted in astrocyte activation and marked up-regulation of cytokines/chemokines. Because oligodendrocyte cell death is an important feature of <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> we tested the ability of TLR 2 reporter cells to respond to oligodendrocyte cell death. These reporter cells responded in vitro to medium conditioned by psychosine-treated oligodendrocytes, indicating the likelihood that oligodendrocytes release a TLR 2 ligand during apoptosis. TLRs are a member of the innate immune system and initiate immune and inflammatory events; therefore, the identification of TLR 2 as a potential driver in the activation of central nervous system glial activity in <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukodystrophy</b> may provide important insight into its pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Globoid</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukodystrophy</b> (Krabbe’s disease) {{is one of}} {{the classic}} genetic leukodystrophies first {{described}} by Krabbe in 1916. 1 It is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder.

However, patients with more slowly progressive juvenile and adult forms are being uncovered with increasing frequency. Rapid and complete loss of myelin and the oligodendrocytes, reac-tive astrocytic gliosis, and infiltration of the unique “globoid cells ” are the pathologic hallmarks of the disease. 2 In 1970, genetic deficiency of galactosylceramidase was identified as the underlying cause of human and canine <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukodystrophy.</b> 3, 4 It was also demonstrated early that there was no overt accumulation of galactosylceramide in the brain of patients with Krabbe’s disease, 5 in contrast to an equivalent disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, in which abnormal sulfatide accumulation had been well established since the first report by Jatzkewitz. 6 There were other obser-vations in <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukodystrophy</b> that provided a puz-zling contrast in regard to those with metachromatic leukodystrophy, even though the two diseases are meta-bolically closely related.

A comparison with other Krabbe disease fetuses described in the literature contributes to the consensus that abnormal morphological findings can be expected in particular in the most actively myelinating areas of the nervous system.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the characteristic MR fea-tures of early-onset (before age 2 years) versus late-onset (after age 2 years) <b>globoid</b> <b>cell</b> leu-kodystrophy (GLD). METHODS: Thirty-four brain MR images in 22 patients with GLD were reviewed. A severity score (0 to 32), based on a point system derived from the location and extent of disease and the presence of focal and/or global atrophy, was calculated for each examination. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients, three were asymptomatic and 19 were symptomatic. Ten patients had early-onset disease, whereas nine had late-onset disease. MR images of all patients showed abnormalities. In the early-onset group (n 5 10; mean maximum MR score, 8. 1; range, 3 – 18), 90 % had pyramidal tract involvement, 80 % had cerebellar white matter involvement, 70 % had deep gray matter involvement, 60 % had posterior corpus callosal involvement, 50 % had parietooccipital white matter involvement, and 40 % had cerebral atrophy.
