25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or <b>ground—in</b> fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

5000|$|A typical wash cycle {{lasts for}} 8-15 minutes {{depending}} on the type of garments and degree of soiling. During the first three minutes, solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose, insoluble soil comes off. It takes 10-12 minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the <b>ground-in</b> insoluble soil from garments. Machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25 minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent-soluble soils. A dry cleaning surfactant [...] "soap" [...] may also be added.|$|E

Neil's genuine love of the product stemmed from his time serving in the Royal Air Force, where he claimed it would make cleaning of equipment a breeze. It is believed that the product was named Cillit 'Bang' {{because it was so}} good at cleaning carbon residual from large machine guns. In one advert he places a copper-plated one penny coin in Cillit Bang to demonstrate the product's cleaning ability to remove staining.|$|E
50|$|Much OTU-RTU {{instruction}} was given on the <b>ground-in</b> classrooms, hangars, and on gunnery ranges. Air training was conducted chiefly through informal supervision of flight operations. An experienced navigator, for instance, would accompany {{a new team}} on a practice mission. During {{the course of the}} trip he would observe the recently graduated navigator, check his techniques, and offer suggestions for improvement. At the conclusion of each mission the “instructor” would file a report on the progress of the “student.” Informal teaching of this kind was the rule for other crew positions, too. Tactics involving the coordinated use of crews, or of larger elements, were often demonstrated by experienced crews before the new units attempted them.|$|E
5000|$|The visible marks {{may appear}} to be a {{symmetrical}} pattern of dash marks on the roadway, as if there were an associated meaning to the pattern. [...] When there are many of them along the roadway, motorists on the interstate highways may interpret the grind marks as an unknown form of mechanical markers, such as <b>ground-in</b> strips, or strange road surface markings. In some cases, these marks are confusing for motorists. When roads are under construction and lanes are laterally shifted, such marks may interfere with temporary lane markings. As the marks from the dowel bar retrofit are not intended to be any form of road surface markings, the responsible agencies try to make these marks smooth and hope to make them less visible to the motorists.|$|E
50|$|Using her {{powers as}} a {{teaching}} aid in {{her career as a}} schoolteacher, Susan is sufficiently successful as to have parents clamouring in large numbers to have their child included in her class. Her approach to history and geography, subjects which children often find rather dull, has particularly captured her class's attention. Parents generally see the occasional need to clean their children's clothing of dried-in bloodstains or <b>ground-in</b> swamp mud as more than compensated for by the broad education being received. A child's description of one of the classic battles from Ankh-Morpork's long history, for example, might be sufficiently vivid and detailed to make the parent think that the description could not have been improved upon if the child had actually seen the battle at first hand—which in fact he has, given the flexibility of time and space Susan has inherited from her grandfather.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the Golden Age {{programs}} in circulation among collectors [...] - [...] whether on analog tape, CD, {{or in the}} form of MP3s [...] - [...] originated from 16-inch transcription discs. In many cases, the circulating recordings are several generations of analog reel-to-reel and cassette tape copies down the line from the original discs, being the product of tape-trading among collectors during the decades before lossless digital duplication was possible. The muffled sound, dropouts, sudden changes in sound quality, unsteady pitch and other defects heard all too often are almost always accumulated tape copy defects. The audio quality of the source discs, when they have survived unscathed and are accessed and dubbed anew, is usually found to be reasonably clear and undistorted, sometimes startlingly good, although like all phonograph records they are vulnerable to wear and the effects of scuffs, scratches and <b>ground-in</b> dust. Many shows from the 1940s have survived only in edited AFRS versions, although some exist in both the original and AFRS forms.|$|E

To the present time, its application {{has been limited}} to contact lenses correcting refractive errors of less than 3 D and to <b>ground-in</b> prisms of not more than 6 delta. The field is new. Technical, mathematical, and clinical advances should eventually allow the use of stronger prisms over {{a wider range of}} refractive corrections...|$|E

40|$|A {{regenerative}} brake {{system is a}} system using the power from the battery to run the bike when going uphill—in saving mode—and recharge the battery when the bike goes downhill or on a flat <b>ground—in</b> charging mode. The system includes the electric part, and the transmission part. However, how can we know whether it works or not, or how efficient it is? This raises some methods to test the system. First, a small bulb will {{be connected to the}} circuit, and it will light up when the battery is charged. Second, the bike will be able to run 20 meters without any human forces. The farther the system can go, the better efficiency it gets. Finally, the system has to be stable, and safe for the user. With all those tasks above, the system will be a success if it can perform them...|$|E

Newer <b>ground-in</b> rumble strip designs {{can be installed}} on {{a wider variety of}} shoulders, but these new designs have a much greater negative effect on bicycle traffic than did previous designs. The feasibility of placing gaps in a rumble strip pattern to permit bicycle traffic to cross the rumble strip area without striking the rumble strip pattern itself was investigated. A recommended minimum length for these gaps to accommodate bicyclists of varying abilities at speeds representative of downhill conditions was also determined. On the basis of experimental information collected, the researchers recommend that rumble strips on noncontrolled-access highways include periodic gaps of 3. 7 m (12 ft) in length, and that these gaps be placed at periodic intervals at a recommended spacing of 12. 2 m (40 ft) or 18. 3 m (60 ft). This study is intended to determine the optimum length for gaps in continuous shoulder rumble strips to allow bicyclists traveling on the roadway or shoulder to cross the rumble strip without having to enter the rumble strip pattern...|$|E
40|$|Faces are {{processed}} holistically, so selective attention to 1 face part without any {{influence of the}} others often fails. In this study, 3 experiments investigated what type of facial information (shape or surface) underlies holistic face processing and whether generalization of holistic processing to nonexperienced faces requires extensive discrimination experience. Results show that facial shape information alone is sufficient to elicit the composite face effect (CFE), 1 of the most convincing demonstrations of holistic processing, whereas facial surface information is unnecessary (Experiment 1). The CFE is eliminated when faces differ only in surface but not shape information, suggesting that variation of facial shape information is necessary to observe holistic face processing (Experiment 2). Removing 3 -dimensional (3 D) facial shape information also eliminates the CFE, indicating the necessity of 3 D shape information for holistic face processing (Experiment 3). Moreover, participants show similar holistic processing for faces with and without extensive discrimination experience (i. e., own- and other-race faces), suggesting that generalization of holistic processing to nonexperienced faces requires facial shape information, but does not necessarily require further individuation experience. These results provide compelling evidence that facial shape information underlies holistic face processing. This shape-based account not only offers a consistent explanation for previous studies of holistic face processing, but also suggests a new <b>ground-in</b> addition to expertise-for the generalization of holistic processing to different types of faces and to nonface objects...|$|E
