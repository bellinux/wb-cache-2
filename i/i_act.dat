500|$|The {{military}} {{dangers in}} such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis' generals controlled the left {{bank of the river}} and its central reaches. Such a long march would almost certainly involve a high wastage of men and horses through exhaustion and disease. However, Marlborough was convinced of the urgency – [...] "I am very sensible that I take a great deal upon me", he had earlier written to Godolphin, [...] "but should <b>I</b> <b>act</b> otherwise, the Empire would be undone ..." ...|$|E

[...] "I talked to her about my character... she explained to me how it was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, {{a lot of people}} say that <b>I</b> <b>act</b> like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, to the fact that she's new.

[...] After Saddam's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, a UN coalition led by the United States drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait in February 1991. The ability for Saddam Hussein to pursue such military aggression was from a [...] "military machine paid for in large part by the {{tens of billions of dollars}} Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hellman aggravated {{the matter}} by {{claiming}} {{the real reason}} she turned down the benefit was because when the Spanish government fell to Franco's fascists, Hellman and Shumlin requested that Bankhead put on {{a benefit for the}} Spanish loyalists fleeing to neighboring France, and the actress and company refused. Bankhead was further incensed by this. Hellman and Bankhead would not speak again for 25 years. Years later, drama critic Joseph Wood Krutch recounted how he and fellow critic George Jean Nathan had shared a cab with Hellman and Bankhead:Bankhead said: [...] "That's the last time <b>I</b> <b>act</b> in one of your god-damned plays". Miss Hellman responded by slamming her purse against the actress's jaw. ... I decided that no self-respecting Gila monster would have behaved in that manner.|$|E
2500|$|Jérusalem {{is a grand}} {{opera in}} four acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The {{libretto}} was to be an adaptation and partial translation of the composer's original 1843 Italian opera, I Lombardi alla prima crociata. It was the one opera which he regarded as the most suitable for being translated into French and, taking Eugène Scribe's advice, Verdi agreed that a French libretto was to be prepared by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Vaëz, who had [...] written the libretto for Donizetti's most successful French opera, La favorite. [...] The opera received its premiere performance at the Salle Le Peletier in Paris on 26 November 1847. The maiden production was designed by Paul Lormier (costumes), Charles Séchan, Jules Diéterle and Édouard Desplechin (sets of Act <b>I,</b> <b>Act</b> II, scene 1, Act III scene 1, and Act IV), and Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry (sets for Act II, scene 2 and Act III, scene 2).|$|E
