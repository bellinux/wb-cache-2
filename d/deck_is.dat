5|$|Its design also {{included}} a full glass cockpit rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320's flight <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E <b>Deck</b> <b>is</b> an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|Seating at the {{ballpark}} includes fixed stadium seats, general admission bleachers, some with contoured seats, and eighteen skyboxes located on the third floor. As of 2014, total seating capacity is 10,300. Games can be watched from one of four picnic areas—one behind home plate, one on the third base line, one in the third base stands, and one beyond the right field wall. A rentable hot tub <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> located in the right field corner. There is a concert stage and family fun zone located on The Plaza inside the concourse entrance.|$|E
50|$|The lower <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} rail traffic, {{and the upper}} <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> used for {{automobile}} traffic. With {{the opening of the}} Pattullo Bridge in 1937, the upper <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> removed and the bridge was converted exclusively for rail use.|$|R
50|$|Four of the <b>decks</b> <b>were</b> armoured. The {{forecastle}} deck, upper <b>deck</b> and maindeck <b>were</b> all of 1.5 in armour and {{the middle}} <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> of 1 in, increasing to 3 in over the machinery and magazines.|$|R
500|$|The gun turrets and barbettes were {{protected}} by [...] of KC armour, {{except for the}} turret roofs which were five inches thick. The <b>decks</b> <b>were</b> made of high-tensile steel. The forecastle deck ranged from 1.75 to 2inches (44 to 51mm) in thickness while the upper <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> 2inches (51mm) thick over the magazines and 0.75inches (19mm) elsewhere. The main <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> 3inches (76mm) thick over the magazines and 1inch (25mm) elsewhere, except for the 2-inch-thick slope that met {{the bottom of the}} main belt. The lower <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> 3inches thick over the propeller shafts, 2inches thick over the magazines and 1inch elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|The tower has {{a three-story}} {{observation}} deck, located on floors 100–102, {{in addition to}} existing broadcast and antenna facilities. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors are separated from the tenants, having their own separate entrance next to the museum, descending down to a below-ground security screening area. On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, {{but there is a}} food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor. To show visitors the city, and give them information and stories about New York, an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors. The admission fee is $32 per person, but admission discounts are available for children and seniors, and the <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims. When it opens, the <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year. Tickets went on sale starting on April 8. However, the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck. It officially opened on May 28, 2015, one day ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Point Light was {{designed}} by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41-foot (12m) octagonal tower. Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. During the restoration effort, {{it was discovered that}} six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction. The tower has a total of five windows, with two facing south and one for the north, east and west. The lantern gallery <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> constructed of concrete and lined with thirty two Italian marble balusters, originally imported from Italy around 1900. The interior has an iron ladder, originally wooden, that leads up to the watchroom level. The lighthouse design and masonry tower have Colonial Revival elements. It is the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut as an official navigational aid.|$|E
50|$|Above the car <b>deck</b> <b>were</b> {{passenger}} accommodation and navigation bridge. Fore and aft ramps allowed full ro-ro operation. In the late 1970s hydraulically operated mezzanine <b>decks</b> <b>were</b> fitted to increase her car capacity.|$|R
500|$|The {{forecastle}} <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> 25mm thick {{while the}} upper <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> [...] over the citadel. Below it, the 50mm middle deck {{acted as a}} splinter deck. The upper <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> 100mm thick above the 220mm waterline belt extension. The bottom edge of the forward splinter belt met with a [...] arched deck. Another arched deck of the same thickness covered the stern aft of the rear transverse bulkhead.|$|R
40|$|Crack {{densities of}} Low-Cracking High-Performance Concrete (LC-HPC) bridge <b>decks</b> <b>are</b> {{compared}} to crack densities of control decks {{to investigate the}} benefits of the LC-HPC specifications developed at the University of Kansas. Specifications for construction of LC-HPC bridge <b>decks</b> <b>are</b> addressed. Bridge <b>deck</b> crack survey procedures are also summarized. Thirteen LC-HPC decks and thirteen control <b>decks</b> <b>are</b> compared by calculating crack densities and noting trends in cracking patterns over time. The results for eight additional <b>decks</b> <b>are</b> also presented. These include three LC-HPC decks, one control deck, and three <b>decks</b> which <b>are</b> considered neither LC-HPC nor control decks. The LC-HPC bridge decks have, with very few exceptions, lower crack densities than the control <b>decks.</b> Cracks <b>are</b> typically transverse above and parallel to the bars in the top layer of reinforcing steel, except at abutments, where cracks propagate longitudinally or perpendicular to the abutment...|$|R
5|$|The {{winner of}} the trick takes the first card from the stock, and the loser the second; thus, until the stock runs out, they each hold ten cards {{at the start of}} every trick. When the trump card {{at the bottom of the}} <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> {{superior}} to a 7 (Ace, Three, King, Knight, or Knave), the player that holds the 7 of the trump suit is able to exchange it for any of these. The 7, and cards of lesser value (6, 5, and 4), can later be exchanged only by a 2. The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards are left in the stock.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
500|$|The five Admiral Hipper-class {{ships were}} {{protected}} by Krupp steel armor, of both Wotan Hart and Wotan Weich types. The ships had two armored decks {{to protect the}} ship from vertical attacks. The upper <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> [...] thick amidships to protect the ships' vitals. At either end, the <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> reduced to [...] thickness. The bow and stern was not protected by deck armor. The main armored <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> [...] thick. Both <b>decks</b> <b>were</b> Wotan Hart steel. The main armored belt was [...] thick amidships and reduced to [...] thick aft. An interior 20mm thick torpedo bulkhead protected the ships' vitals from underwater attack.|$|R
25|$|Similar to Raid <b>Decks,</b> Dungeon <b>Decks</b> <b>are</b> {{large scale}} {{encounters}} designed for multiple players to play against. The main difference from Raid <b>Decks</b> <b>is</b> that a Dungeon Deck runs itself with {{no need for}} an additional player to act as the Raid Master. Additionally Dungeon <b>Decks</b> <b>are</b> designed to be played against basic starter decks with players unlocking the ability to add new cards by gaining experience from defeating dungeons and leveling up.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{accommodation}} {{was located}} in saloons both forward and aft of the engine room. Open passenger <b>decks</b> <b>were</b> situated above the saloons, with small cockpits at the bow and stern. On the PS Compton Castle and later vessels the <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> widened over long sponsons {{to the edge of}} the paddle boxes, and a flying after <b>deck</b> <b>was</b> provided above the aft cockpit. The second PS Dartmouth Castle was later refitted with these features.|$|R
25|$|Parking <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> used {{mostly in}} the Southern United States.|$|E
25|$|This type of bridge {{comprises}} an arch {{where the}} <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> completely above the arch. The {{area between the}} arch and the <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> known as the spandrel. If the spandrel is solid, usually the case in a masonry or stone arch bridge, the bridge is called a closed-spandrel deck arch bridge. If the <b>deck</b> <b>is</b> supported {{by a number of}} vertical columns rising from the arch, the bridge is known as an open-spandrel deck arch bridge. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel arch bridge. Finally, if the arch supports the deck only {{at the top of the}} arch, the bridge is called a cathedral arch bridge.|$|E
