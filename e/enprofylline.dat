40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} intravenous doses of theophylline and <b>enprofylline,</b> a new xanthine derivative, on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was studied in eight asthmatic patients. Methacholine provocations {{were carried out}} on three days before and after increasing doses of theophylline, <b>enprofylline,</b> and placebo, a double blind study design being used. Methacholine responsiveness was determined as the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a fall of 20 % in FEV 1 (PC 20). The patients were characterised pharmacokinetically before the main study to provide an individual dosage scheme for each patient that would provide rapid steady state plasma concentration plateaus of 5, 10, and 15 mg/l for theophylline and 1. 25, 2. 5, and 3. 75 mg/l for <b>enprofylline.</b> Dose increments in the main study were given at 90 minute intervals. FEV 1 showed a small progressive decrease after placebo; it remained high in relation to placebo after both drugs and this effect was dose related. Methacholine PC 20 values decreased after placebo; mean values were higher after theophylline and <b>enprofylline</b> than after placebo (maximum difference 2. 0 and 1. 7 doubling doses of methacholine); the effect of both drugs were dose related.

Venous pCO 2 fell and pH rose after adenosine. Caffeine significantly reduced the adenosine-induced changes of minute ventilation, tidal volume, venous pCO 2 and pH, whereas no changes occurred after <b>enprofylline.</b> Our results suggest that adenosine stimulates respiration in man by binding with specific P 1 -purinoceptors, which can be blocked by caffeine, but not by <b>enprofylline...</b>|$|E

40|$|Adenosine potentiates {{mast cell}} activation, but the {{receptor}} type and molecular mechanisms involved {{have not been}} defined. We, therefore, investigated the effects of adenosine on the human mast cell line HMC- 1. Both the A 2 a selective agonist CGS 21680 and the A 2 a/A 2 b nonselective agonist 5 '-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) increased cAMP, but NECA was fourfold more efficacious and had a Hill coefficient of 0. 55, suggesting the presence of both A 2 a and A 2 b receptors. NECA 10 microM evoked IL- 8 release from HMC- 1, but CGS 21680 10 microM had no effect. In separate studies we found that <b>enprofylline,</b> an antiasthmatic previously thought to lack adenosine antagonistic properties, is as effective as theophylline as an antagonist of A 2 b receptors at concentrations achieved clinically. Both theophylline and <b>enprofylline</b> 300 micro completely blocked the release of IL- 8 by NECA. NECA, but not CGS 21680, increases inositol phosphate formation and intracellular calcium mobilization through a cholera and pertussis toxin-insensitive mechanism. In conclusion, both A 2 a and A 2 b receptors are present in HMC- 1 cells and are coupled to adenylate cyclase. In addition, A 2 b receptors are coupled to phospholipase C and evoke IL- 8 release. This effect is blocked by theophylline and <b>enprofylline,</b> raising the possibility that this mechanism contributes to their antiasthmatic effects...|$|E
40|$|Human lung bronchiolar {{segments}} (about 2 mm {{long and}} with a diameter of 0. 6 - 1. 5 mm) were dissected and circular muscle tension recorded. Airways were identified by histology and in some preparations by relaxant responses to noradrenaline (0. 1 - 10 microM). Adenosine (1 - 100 microM) produced only very weak contractions, whereas carbachol (EC 50 = 0. 40 microM), histamine (EC 50 = 0. 63 microM), prostaglandin D 2 (EC 50 = 0. 50 microM), substance P (EC 50 = 4. 6 microM) and ATP (1 - 100 microM) produced much greater ones. The contractions generally developed rapidly and were stable. The mean maximum increase in tension achieved with the most efficient constrictor, carbachol, was 0. 5 g. ATP was the least efficient producing only about 40 % of carbachol's maximum. Terbutaline, theophylline and <b>enprofylline</b> relaxed carbachol (2. 0 microM = EC 70) -contracted preparations. Terbutaline (3 - 3000 nM) relaxed 4 out of 11 bronchioles. Theophylline (10 - 4000 microM) and <b>enprofylline</b> (1 - 400 microM) consistently relaxed the bronchiolar preparations including those exhibiting little responsiveness to the beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist. Since <b>enprofylline</b> (which does not block adenosine receptors) was a five times more potent relaxant than theophylline and since adenosine produced only weak contractions, antagonism of adenosine receptors is probably not involved in relaxation of the small airways. It is suggested that the present data, which apparently differ from those obtained with lung parenchymal strips, are of relevance for human small airways responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{and radical}} scavenging properties of 8 -oxo derivatives of pentoxifylline, lisofylline, <b>enprofylline</b> (3 -propyl xanthine), and 1, 7 -dimethyl <b>enprofylline</b> were studied in vitro. The {{results show that}} 8 -oxopentoxifylline and 8 -oxolisofylline are signifi-cantly better hydroxyl and peroxyl radical scavengers and more potent inhibitors of t-butylhydroperoxideinduced lipid peroxidation in human erythrocyte membranes than the parent drugs. The ydroxyl radical scavenging property of 8 -oxoenprofylline and its analogue 1, 7 -dimethyl- 8 -oxoenprofylline is marginally etter than their corresponding xanthines. Interestingly, 1, 7 -dimethyl- 8 -oxoenprofylline is an effective inhibitor of lipid peroxidation whereas <b>enprofylline,</b> 1, 7 -dimethylenprofylline, and 8 -oxoenprofylline exhibit significantly less activity. All the 8 -oxo derivatives tested are better hydroxyl radical scavengers than uric acid, a natural antioxidant and a free radical scavenger in humans. The rate constant for the reaction between 8 -oxopentoxifylline and hydroxyl radical is 1. 6 - 4. 2 × 10 ^ 10 M^- 1 s^- 1 which is {{comparable to that of}} dimethyl sulfoxide (1. 4 - 1. 6 × 10 ^ 10 M^- 1 s^- 1) and better than that of mannitol (1. 9 - 2. 5 × 10 ^ 9 M^- 1 s^- 1), the known hydroxyl radical cavengers. Both 8 -oxo pentoxifylline (IC_ 50, 1. 8 ± 0. 08 μ M) and 8 -oxolisofylline (IC_ 50, 2. 2 ± 0. 13 μ M) are as efficient peroxyl radical scavengers as uric acid (IC_ 50, 1. 9 ± 0. 05 μ M).

40|$|Ischemic {{preconditioning}} or phosphodiesterase inhibition improves lung protection during prolonged hypothermic storage. In ischemic preconditioning of cat lungs, adenosine A 1 receptor antagonism {{was suggested}} {{as a possible}} mechanism. Some phosphodiesterase inhibitors (such as theophylline) are also adenosine antagonists; we showed theophylline to be particularly effective in protecting lungs. In isolated, perfused and ventilated rat lungs, we examined (1) whether synergy exists between phosphodiesterase inhibition and ischemic preconditioning and (2) whether theophylline acts both to inhibit phosphodiesterase and block adenosine receptors, by comparing its effects with <b>enprofylline</b> (selective phosphodiesterase inhibition) or xanthine amine congener (selective adenosine A 1 receptor antagonism). In Study 1, rolipram (added to St Thomas ’ cardioplegia) or ischemic preconditioning before hypothermic storage (8 h) did not improve lung function during reperfusion (40 min); {{a combination of these}} treatments was also ineffective. In Study 2, lungs stored in St Thomas’ cardioplegia containing <b>enprofylline</b> or theophylline had improved recovery of function compared to control lungs; however, xanthine amine congener was without effect. Thus, no interaction exists between phosphodiesterase inhibition and ischemic preconditioning. Adenosine A 1 receptor antagonism plays no role in protecting rat lungs from the effects of prolonged hypothermic storage by either preconditioning or addition of theophylline to the storage solution...|$|E
40|$|Dipyridamole {{inhibits}} {{platelet aggregation}} in whole blood at lower concentrations than in plasma. The blood cells responsible for increased effectiveness in blood are the erythrocytes. Using the impedance aggregometer we have {{carried out a}} series of pharmacological studies in vitro to elucidate the mechanism of action of dipyridamole in whole blood. Adenosine deaminase, an enzyme breaking down adenosine, reverses the inhibitory action of dipyridamole. Two different adenosine receptor antagonists, 5 '-deoxy- 5 '-methylthioadenosine and theophylline, also partially neutralize the activity of dipyridamole in blood. <b>Enprofylline,</b> a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with almost no adenosine receptor antagonistic properties, potentiates the inhibition of platelet aggregation by dipyridamole. An inhibitory effect similar to that of dipyridamole can be obtained combining a pure adenosine uptake inhibitor (RE 102 BS) with a pure phosphodiesterase inhibitor (MX-MB 82 or <b>enprofylline).</b> Mixing the blood during preincubation with dipyridamole increases the degree of inhibition. Lowering the haematocrit slightly reduces the effectiveness. Although we did not carry out direct measurements of adenosine levels, the results of our pharmacological studies clearly show that dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation in whole blood by blocking the reuptake of adenosine formed from precursors released by red blood cells following microtrauma. Its slight phosphodiesterase inhibitory action potentiates the effects of adenosine on platelets. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The direct overall {{metabolic}} {{effects of}} drugs acting on adenosine receptors in human platelets were evaluated using a sensitive microcalorimetric method. Adenosine induced a concentration-dependent {{increase in the}} heat production rate at concentrations above 100 microM. The adenosine uptake inhibitor, dipyridamole (3 microM) did not modify the effect of adenosine. Two putative adenosine receptor agonists were tested: NECA (5 -N-ethyl carboxamide adenosine) and PIA (L-N 6 -phenylisopropyl-adenosine). NECA induced, at significantly lower concentrations than adenosine, an enhanced heat production rate. Concentrations above 1 mM had no effect. PIA, on the other hand, invariably induced {{a reduction in the}} heat production rate already at a concentration of 100 microM. The two xanthine derivatives <b>enprofylline</b> (25 microM) and theophylline (100 microM) were tested at concentrations found during antiasthmatic therapy. Neither had any thermogenic effect by themselves nor showed any significant modification of the heat production rate induced by adenosine (300 microM). These results indicate that adenosine and NECA increase human platelet metabolism, whereas PIA has an opposite effect. The proposed adenosine receptor antagonists <b>enprofylline</b> and theophylline were without effects. This microcalorimetric study gives new insights into the complex nature of adenosine mechanisms in a human test system and indicates that the thermogenic effect of adenosine is unrelated to adenosine receptors...|$|E

There was, however, no difference in the carbachol concentration-response curves or maximum responses to carbachol of tracheal smooth muscle from control and budesonide treated rats. Isometric and isotonic recordings agreed in these respects. Glucocorticoid treatment did not increase the sensitivity of tracheal smooth muscle to the relaxant drugs terbutaline and enprofylline; if anything there was a tendency for terbutaline and <b>enprofylline</b> to be less potent after budesonide treatment.

40|$|Adenosine is a {{powerful}} bronchoconstrictor of asthmatic, but not normal, airways. In vitro studies on isolated human mast cells and basophils revealed that adenosine and selective analogues augmented inflammatory mediator release from mast cells by stimulating A 2 receptors. Pharmacological blockade of mast cell mediator release in vivo also attenuated adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction, as did theophylline, by adenosine A 2 receptor antagonism. Further in vitro studies revealed that the asthmatic response to adenosine {{is likely to be}} mediated via the A 2 B subtype which is selectively antagonised by <b>enprofylline.</b> Studies in animal models, especially mice, have shown a close synergistic interaction between adenosine, Th 2 and airway remodelling responses. The recent description of A 2 B receptors on human airway smooth muscle cells that mediate cytokine and chemokine release and induce differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts strengthens the view that adenosine maybe more than an inflammatory mediator in asthma but also participates in airway wall remodelling in this disease.

The analogue D-PIA was very weak and its maximum effect was small. NECA and L-PIA enhanced [3 H]-cyclic AMP accumulation in [3 H]-adenine labelled feline pial vessels with similar absolute and relative potency to their relaxant effects. The relaxant effects of adenosine and of NECA were competitively antagonized by 8 -phenyl-theophylline (pA 2 = 6. 5). The effect of theophylline and <b>enprofylline</b> {{could not be}} tested in higher concentrations than 30 or 10 microM because they affected the vessels directly. At these concentrations they were essentially inactive as adenosine antagonists. The non-xanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (0. 1 and 100 microM) caused a slight but non-significant potentiation of the relaxant effect of adenosine.

NECA was approximately 10 times more potent than L-PIA, in thymocytes from both species. D-PIA was more potent in guinea-pig than in rat thymocytes. The {{effect of a}} number of adenosine analogues followed the order: NECA greater than 2 -chloro-adenosine greater than L-PIA greater than N 6 -cyclohexyl-adenosine (CHA), an order of potency characteristic for adenosine receptors of the A 2 -subtype.

By contrast, xanthine derivatives substituted at the C 8 - or N 9 -position failed to open CFTR channels. The CFTR chloride channel activity was blocked by glibenclamide (100 [*]μM) but not by DIDS (100 [*]μM). Activation of CFTR by xanthines was not mimicked by the calcium ionophore A 23187, adenosine, UTP, ATP or the specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors rolipram, Ro 20 - 1724 and milrinone. In addition, we found no correlation between the effect of xanthines on CFTR and on the cellular cyclic AMP or ATP levels.

Moreover, the role of adenosine as modulator of the bronchial responsiveness to Ach after noise-exposure was assessed both in normal and in sensitized guinea pigs. In non-sensitized noise-exposed guinea pigs, the hyporesponsiveness to Ach was abolished by pretreatment of the animals with the peripheral A 1 /A 2 antagonist 8 -p-(sulfophenyl) theophylline (8 -pSPT, 3 mg/kg i. v.) or with the A 2 -selective blocker 3, 7 -dimethyl- 1 -propargylxanthine (DMPX, 80 microg/kg i. v.) {{but not with the}} A 1 -selective antagonist Xanthine Amine Congener (XAC, 0. 1 mg/kg i. v.).

The A 1 agonist R-PIA showed a dose-dependent decrease in BP with a drastic decrease in HR at the highest doses. The A 1 selective antagonist DPCPX significantly reduced the bradycardic activity and also the hypotensive responses obtained with the lowest doses while it increased those obtained with the highest ones.

Treatment of cells with the A 3 -selective agonist N 6 -(3 -iodobenzyl) - 5 ′-(N-methylcarbamoyl) adenosine (IB-MECA) inhibited the elevation of the cyclic AMP level induced by NECA or isoproterenol in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal inhibition of 40 [*]–[*] 50 %. These responses were blocked by the specific A 3 adenosine receptor antagonist MRS 1191. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin attenuated the IB-MECA-induced responses, suggesting that this effect occurred via the pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G proteins. IB-MECA also caused a concentration-dependent elevation in [Ca 2 +]i and IP 3 content. Both the responses induced by IB-MECA were attenuated by treatment with U 73122 or phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. These data suggest the presence of both A 2 B and A 3 adenosine receptors in mouse pineal tumour cells and that the A 2 B receptor is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase whereas the A 3 receptor is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and also coupled to phospholipase C...|$|E
40|$|Responses to {{vascular}} relaxant {{drugs were}} obtained on KCl (15 mM) -contracted isolated ring preparations of pulmonary artery and aorta from young (1 - 2 months old) and aged (greater than 16 months old) rats. These vessels contain both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptors. Relaxant responses (i. e. relaxation {{expressed as a}} % of the KCl-induced contraction) to isoprenaline, procaterol (beta 2 -selective partial agonist), fenoterol (beta 2 -selective) and noradrenaline (beta 1 -selective) but not those of forskolin, 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine, <b>enprofylline</b> or sodium nitrite, were smaller on preparations from aged rats than on those from young rats. Thyroxine (T 4) -treatment (1 mg kg- 1 s. c. thrice weekly for 3 - 5 weeks) of aged or young rats enhanced responses to isoprenaline and noradrenaline but reduced those to procaterol, when compared with preparations from age-matched saline-treated control rats. The agonist order of potency, determined in young rats, was isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than adrenaline in preparations from T 4 -treated rats compared with isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline in saline-treated control rats. It is concluded (a) that the age-related decline in vascular responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists involves beta-adrenoceptor mechanisms specifically and possibly beta 2 -adrenoceptors more than beta 1 -adrenoceptors; and (b) that T 4 -treatment of rats enhances beta 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated and reduces, or does not change, beta 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated responses of preparations of rat pulmonary artery and aorta. In preparations from control rats beta 2 -adrenoceptors were functionally predominant but in preparations from T 4 -treated rats beta 1 -adrenoceptors appeared to become functionally predominant...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine receptors in {{guinea pig}} lung were {{characterized}} by measurement of cyclic AMP formation and radioligand binding. 5 '-N-Ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) increased cyclic AMP Ievels in lung slices about 4 -fold over basal values with an EC_ 50 of 0. 32 μmol/l. N^ 6 - R-(-) -Phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) was 5 -fold less potent than NECA. 5 '-N-Methylcarboxamidoadenosine (MECA) and 2 -chloroadenosine had EC_ 50 -values of 0. 29 and 2. 6 μmol/l, whereas adenosine and inosine had no effect. The adenosine receptors in guinea pig Iung can therefore be classified as A_ 2 receptors. Several xanthine derivatives antagonized the NECA-induced increase in cyclic AMP levels. 1, 3 -Diethyl- 8 -phenylxanthine (DPX; K_i 0. 14 μmol/l) was the most potent analogue, followed by 8 -phenyltheophylline (K_i 0. 55 μmol/l), 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX; K_i 2. 9 μmol/l) and theophylline (K_i 8. 1 μmol/l). In contrast, <b>enprofylline</b> (1 mmol/ 1) enhanced basal and NECA-stimulated cyclic AMP formation. In addition, we attempted to characterize these receptors in binding studies with [^ 3 H]NECA. The K_D for [^ 3 H] NECA was 0. 25 μmol/l and the maximal number of binding sites was 12 pmol/mg protein. In competition experiments MECA (K_i 0. 14 μmol/l) was the most potent inhibitor of [^ 3 H] NECA binding, followed by NECA (K_i 0. 19 μmol/l) and 2 -chloroadenosine (K_i 1. 4 μmol/l). These results correlate well with the EC_ 50 - values for cyclic AMP formation in lung slices. However, the K_i-values of R-PIA and theophylline were 240 and 270 μmol/l, and DPX and 8 -phenyltheophylline did not compete for [^ 3 H]NECA binding sites. Therefore, a complete characterization of A_ 2 adenosine receptors by [^ 3 H] NECA binding was not achieved. In conclusion, our results show the presence of adenylate cyclase-coupled A_ 2 adenosiile receptors in lung tissue which are antagonized by several xanthines...|$|E
40|$|Functional antagonism" {{is often}} used to {{describe}} the general relaxant effect of beta 2 agonists and xanthines and their ability to protect the airways against bronchoconstrictor stimuli. This study in guinea pig isolated trachea addresses {{the question of whether the}} capacity of these drugs to protect against constrictor stimuli is related to smooth muscle relaxation. Three antimuscarinic drugs were also examined to determine whether antagonism of mediators other than muscarinic agonists might contribute to bronchodilatation by these antimuscarinic drugs. Terbutaline (1. 1 x 10 (- 7), 2. 2 x 10 (- 7) M), theophylline (2. 2 x 10 (- 4), 4. 4 x 10 (- 4) M), and <b>enprofylline</b> (5. 2 x 10 (- 5), 1. 0 x 10 (- 4) M) relaxed the tracheal tension that remained after indomethacin treatment. They did not, however, alter the carbachol concentration-response curve significantly. In addition, neither theophylline (2. 2 x 10 (- 4) M) nor terbutaline (1. 1 x 10 (- 7) M) altered histamine induced contraction. Atropine sulphate, glycopyrrolate, and ipratropium bromide had EC 50 values of 10 (- 9) - 10 (- 8) M for relaxation of carbachol induced contractions, whereas concentrations of 10 (- 6) - 10 (- 3) M or greater were required to relax contractions induced by allergen and nine other non-muscarinic mediators. It is suggested that bronchodilatation by antimuscarinic drugs in vivo is due to inhibition of acetylcholine induced bronchoconstriction alone and that beta 2 agonists and xanthines have poor ability to protect airway smooth muscle against constrictor stimuli. Hence mechanisms other than bronchodilatation and "functional antagonism" should be considered to explain the protection against constrictor stimuli in asthma seen with beta 2 agonists and xanthines...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of thyroid status on the lipolytic responses of rat white adipocytes to β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) stimulation. The β 1 - and β 3 -AR mRNAs and proteins were measured by Northern and saturation analyses, respectively. Glycerol production and adenyl cyclase (AC) activity induced by various non-selective and selective β 1 /β 3 -AR agonists and drugs which act distal to the receptor in the signalling cascade were measured in cells from untreated, tri-iodothyronine (T 3) -treated and thyroidectomized rats. The β 3 -AR density was enhanced (72 %) by T 3 -treatment and reduced (50 %) by introduction of a hypothyroid state while β 1 -AR number remained unaffected. The β 1 - and β 3 -AR density was correlated with the specific mRNA level in all thyroid status. The lipolytic responses to isoprenaline, noradrenaline (β 1 /β 3 /β 3 -AR agonists) and BRL[*] 37344 (β 3 -AR agonist) were potentiated by 48, 58 and 48 %, respectively in hyperthyroidism and reduced by about 80 % in hypothyroidism. T 3 -treatment increased the maximal lipolytic response to the partial β 3 -AR (CGP[*] 12177) and β 1 -AR (xamoterol) agonists by 234 and 260 %, respectively, increasing their efficacy (intrinsic activity: 0. 95 versus 0. 43 and 1. 02 versus 0. 42). The maximal AC response to these agonists was increased by 84 and 58 %, respectively, without changing their efficacy. In the hypothyroid state, the maximal lipolytic and AC responses were decreased with CGP (0. 17 ± 0. 03 versus 0. 41 ± 0. 08 [*]μmol glycerol/ 106 adipocytes; 0. 048 ± 0. 005 versus 0. 114 ± 0. 006 [*]pmol cyclic AMP[*]min− 1 [*]mg− 1) but not changed with xamoterol. The changes in lipolytic responses to postreceptor-acting agents (forskolin, <b>enprofylline</b> and dibutenyl cyclic AMP, (Bu) 2 cAMP) suggest the modifications on receptor coupling and phosphodiesterase levels in both thyroid states. Thyroid status affects lipolysis by modifying β 3 -AR density and postreceptor events without changes in the β 1 -AR functionality...|$|E
40|$|Pyridoxal 52 ̆ 7 -phosphate (PLP) is the {{cofactor}} {{for over}} 140 vitamin B 6 (PLP) -dependent enzymes {{that are involved}} in various metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. Pyridoxal kinase (PL kinase) and pyridoxine 5 ’-phosphate oxidase (PNP oxidase) are the two key enzymes that metabolize nutritional forms of vitamin B 6, including pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN), and pyridoxamine (PM) to the active cofactor form, PLP. Disruption of the PLP metabolic pathway due to mutations in PNP oxidase or PL kinase result in PLP deficiency, which is implicated in several neurological pathologies. Several ingested compounds are also known to result in PLP deficiency with concomitant neurotoxic effects. How these mutations and compounds affect B 6 metabolism is not clearly understood. On the other hand, an emerging health problem is the intake of too much vitamin B 6 as high doses of the reactive PLP in the cell exhibits toxic effects, including sensory and motor neuropathies. The overall aim of this research is to understand the catalytic function of PL kinase and the regulatory pathway of PLP metabolism. Using site-directed mutagenesis (Asp 235 Asn, Asp 235 Ala), kinetic and structural studies, we have shown that Asp 235 may play a catalytic role in PL kinase phosphorylation activity. We also show that human PL kinase binds its substrates, PL and MgATP synergistically, and that the enzyme requires Na+ (or K+) and Mg 2 + for its activity. Using kinetic study, we show severe induced MgATP substrate inhibition of PL kinase in the presence of its product, PLP, and we postulate this to be due to the formation of a non-productive ternary complex (Enzyme•PLP•MgATP). Consistently, our crystal structure of human PL kinase (2. 1 Å) co-crystallized with MgATP and PLP showed both MgATP and PLP trapped at the active site. Our hypothesis is that this abortive ternary complex might be a physiological process, and that PL kinase uses this mechanism to self-regulate its activity. Our inhibition studies show theophylline, a bronchodilator as a mixed competitive inhibitor of human PL kinase with Ki of 71 μM. Our structural study (2. 1 Å) shows theophylline bound at the substrate, PL binding site of human PL kinase. We also identified several potential PL kinase inhibitors from the DrugBank Chemical Compound database. Some of these compounds, including <b>enprofylline,</b> theobromine, caffeine, and lamotrigine, which incidentally exhibit similar neurotoxic effects as theophylline, show significant inhibitory effect on human PL kinase. Further studies are also planned to investigate the effect of these drugs on vitamin B 6 metabolism in vivo...|$|E
