50|$|The chest must be {{examined}} by inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Subcutaneous emphysema and tracheal deviation must be identified if present. The {{aim is to}} identify and manage six life-threatening thoracic conditions as Airway Obstruction, Tension Pneumothorax, Massive <b>Haemothorax,</b> Open Pneumothorax, Flail chest segment with Pulmonary Contusion and Cardiac Tamponade. Flail chest, tracheal deviation, penetrating injuries and bruising can be recognized by inspection. Subcutaneous emphysema can be recognized by palpation.

50|$|In {{civilian}} life, polytraumas {{often are}} associated with motor vehicle crashes. This is because car crashes often occur at high velocities, causing multiple injuries. On admission to hospital any trauma patient should immediately undergo x-ray diagnosis of their cervical spine, chest, and pelvis, commonly known as a 'trauma series', to ascertain possible life-threatening injuries. Examples would be a fractured cervical vertebra, a severely fractured pelvis, or a <b>haemothorax.</b> Once this initial survey is complete, x-rays may be taken of the limbs to assess the possibility of other fractures. It also is quite common in severe trauma for patients to be sent directly to CT or a surgery theatre, if they require emergency treatment.|$|E
40|$|<b>Haemothorax</b> {{is one of}} {{the less}} common presentations that {{requires}} hospital admission. Most cases are associated with underlying causes, but there is such an entity called spontaneous <b>haemothorax.</b> Spontaneous <b>haemothorax</b> is commonly associated with adhesions within the pleural cavity.

40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article ’Right massive <b>haemothorax</b> as the presenta-tion of blunt cardiac rupture: the pitfall of coexisting pericardial laceration ’ by Chen et al. [1]. This well-presented case highlights a dual emergency and its successful ap-proach. The discussion section, however, includes {{a number of possible}} causes that may be responsible for blunt traumatic <b>haemothorax,</b> without mentioning injury of the diaphragm. Traumatic diaphragm injury accounts for almost 3. 3 % of blunt trauma cases [2]. Three years ago, we faced and reported a rare case of <b>haemothorax</b> due to blunt injury in a patient with hereditary rib exostosis that caused diaphragm penetration [3]. Several other case reports consider not only traumatic diaphragm rupture, but also vascular damage by pressure trauma as an aetiological factor for <b>haemothorax.</b> In addition, there are cases where the disrupted spleen is herniated through the dia-phragm in the thorax, causing a <b>haemothorax.</b> Therefore, massive <b>haemothorax</b> should not always focus attention to the chest and intrathoracic causes of haemo-dynamic instability. If such injuries are not recognized and approached properly, po...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous massive <b>haemothorax</b> is {{uncommon}} {{and usually}} occurs {{as a result}} of pulmonary infarction, arteriovenous fistula, neoplasm, ruptured aortic aneurysm, rupture of pleural adhesions or pleural endometriosis.

40|$|A clotted <b>haemothorax</b> {{can develop}} any time after blunt chest trauma. Two cases are {{described}} in which late clotted haemothoraces developed which were treated by limited thoracotomy and evacuation of clots. Late clotted <b>haemothorax</b> may occur {{even in the absence}} of any abnormal initial clinical findings. Early detection and treatment is important to avoid the complications of fibrothorax and empyema with permanent pulmonary dysfunction. After blunt chest trauma patients should be advised to return to the accident and emergency department for assessment on development of any new chest symptom.

30|$|Distal {{haematoma}} {{may be seen}} as <b>haemothorax</b> or haemorrhagic ascites. It {{is usually}} multifactorial. Factors such as anticoagulation, consumption of complement and prothrombotic substances in addition to recent cannulation may cause subacute <b>haemothorax</b> to develop over time. Radiographs may demonstrate new effusion and/or displacement of mediastinal structures. Ultrasound will demonstrate echogenic fluid that can be confirmed by CT as high-attenuation fluid.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report a}} case of {{spontaneous}} <b>haemothorax</b> in a 19 year old boy with an exostosis of the left second rib. It may {{have been caused by}} nontrauma-tic rupture of markedly dilated pleural vessels, as a result of long-standing fric-tion between the exostosis and the pleura. This is the first report of spontaneous <b>haemothorax,</b> without penetrative injury to the pleura or the diaphragm, in a patient with hereditary multiple exostosis...|$|E

40|$|A case of von Willebrand's disease (increased {{bleeding}} tendency) {{with the}} unusual complication of <b>haemothorax,</b> {{together with the}} more frequent complication of haemo-ptysis, is reported. The pre-operative preparation, so as to lessen the bleeding during the operation, is described and {{the management of the}} anaesthetic problems due to heavy bleeding into the trachea are discussed. <b>Haemothorax</b> is treated by the surgical removal of blood and clot from the chest. This treatment rapidly restores lung function and prevents the possibility of empyema developing later (Lush et al., 1944). In the case reported here the cause of the <b>haemothorax</b> was an increased bleeding ten-dency which could have led to prolonged hae-morrhage, and this discouraged major surgery. Also local aspiration of the pleural contents and insertion of tubes into the chest failed to drai...|$|E
40|$|Bloody pleural {{effusion}} {{may be a}} clinical complication of many diseases like malignancy, trauma, pulmonary infarction, ovarian pathology, certain infections etc. Rarely pulmonary, endometriosis can present with <b>haemothorax</b> & pose a diagnostic problem to clinicians.

We report a case of pleural endometriosis in a 28 years infertile lady presented with catamenial <b>haemothorax</b> occurring in the first 3 days of menstruation over a 3 months period associated with right shoulder pain & progressive shortness of breath for last 6 years.

40|$|We {{have read}} the paper by Dr Elsayed about a {{life-threatening}} <b>haemothorax</b> complicating a mediastinoscopy [1]. We think many points must be discussed. First, the author states that they have closed a patient submit-ted to mediastinoscopy with demonstrated active (even if very mild) mediastinal bleeding associated with iatrogenic opening of the parietal pleura. This is not cautious behaviour by a thoracic surgeon. It {{is well known that}} even mild bleeding may be the cause of massive <b>haemothorax</b> when the negative intrapleural pressure is transmitted to other opened neighbouring compart-ments, such as the mediastinum. Second, when postoperative right-sided <b>haemothorax</b> was demonstrated by a reduction of the haemoglobin levels and chest X-ray (Fig. 2 a of the cited paper [1]) they inserted – as stated – a basal chest drain without significant improvement.

40|$|<b>Haemothorax,</b> haemo{{pneumothorax}}, and pneumothorax {{were the}} most common complications in 85 patients with penetrating stab injuries of the chest. These complications were amenable to conservative treatment by aspiration or drainage of the pleural space. Immediate operation was indicated in 30 cases. Indications for surgery were haemorrhage from a major systemic or pulmonary vessel or the heart, cardiac tamponade, diaphragmatic penetration, oesophageal and bronchial tears, and sucking chest wounds. The need for immediate operation was clinically obvious at presentation in most cases. It should have been suspected from {{the situation of the}} entry wound, the nature of the weapon used, the size of the <b>haemothorax,</b> and the clinical findings in the others. All 11 deaths occurred in that group in which early operation was indicated, and some could have been averted had the need for operation been suspected early. Seven patients developed an empyema; five were in the group that required immediate surgery and in the other two infection occurred in a clotted <b>haemothorax.</b> Early repair of the associated visceral injuries and complete evacuation of a <b>haemothorax,</b> either fluid or clotted, could reduce the incidence of empyema...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{presence}} of endometrial tissue in airways, pleura and lung parenchyma is called thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES). It {{is a rare}} pathology, and typically consists of catamenial pneumothorax, <b>haemothorax,</b> haemoptysis, and pulmonary nodules. We report {{a case of a}} 36 -year-old woman with thoracic endometriosis causing catamenial <b>haemothorax.</b> Conclusions: The diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis is complicated and often delayed. TES should be suspected in a reproductive age woman with exacerbating symptoms during the menstruation. Treatment may be medical and surgical...|$|E

40|$|The {{case history}} is {{presented}} of a 61 year {{old man with}} von Recklinghausen's disease who developed a spontaneous <b>haemothorax.</b> In spite of being asymptomatic for five days after drainage, he {{died as a result}} of fatal sudden re-bleeding. The post mortem examination showed dissection and rupture of the left subclavian artery. Microscopically, disarrangement of smooth muscle and decrease of elastic fibre was observed in the ruptured artery. <b>Haemothorax</b> in patients with von Recklinghausen's disease may require thoracotomy, even if the condition of the patient appears to be stable. ...|$|E
40|$|Angiostrongylosis was {{diagnosed}} in a dog presenting with <b>haemothorax</b> {{on the basis}} of detection of Angiostrongylus vasorum first-stage larvae both in the pleural effusion and in faeces. A one-year-old, male, mixed-breed dog was presented with fever, depression and persistent cough of one month's duration. Clinical examination revealed temperature of 39 · 5 °C, loud bronchovesicular sounds on thoracic auscultation and attenuated cardiac sounds. Thoracic radiographs showed a moderate bilateral pleural effusion and a diffuse interstitial pulmonary pattern, with an alveolar pattern in one lobe. Routine haematology revealed anaemia and leucocytosis with eosinophilia, basophilia and thrombocytopenia. Coagulation assays showed a consumptive coagulopathy resembling disseminated intravascular coagulation. The relationship between <b>haemothorax</b> and the presence of A vasorum larvae in the pleural effusion is discussed. The dog was successfully treated with fenbendazole until negative for larvae on faecal examination. This case report indicates that A vasorum infection should be considered as a possible aetiological cause of <b>haemothorax</b> in dogs. © 2008 British Small Animal Veterinary Association...|$|E

40|$|We {{record a}} case of {{pulmonary}} arteriovenous fistula presenting in a dramatic and unusual way. These lesions are generally diagnosed clinically by consideration of their associated features. In this case these were all absent, and the patient presented with a spontaneous <b>haemothorax</b> as an isolated finding. When blood is found on aspiration of the pleural cavity it generally represents bloodstained effusion (trauma excluded), and by far the commonest cause is bronchogenic carcinoma. Less frequently, however, aspiration of blood may represent spontaneous intrapleural bleeding without effusion (spontaneous <b>haemothorax),</b> and a rare cause of this situation is pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. We record this case to demonstrate that innocent pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae can masquerade as carcinoma...|$|E
