5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>obsolescence</b> is a {{situation}} where a digital resource is no longer readable because of its archaic format: the physical media, the reader (required to read the media), the hardware, or the software that runs on it is no longer available.|$|E

A digital library that deals with data those are born digital {{as well as those}} that have been digitized from their analogue form. So {{there is a need to}} preserve digital resources for future use. Since the nature of digital data or resource is intangible and it cannot see in necked eyes so there is a need to preserve and organized them in such a way that we can get easily access to them. Developing preservation process for digital resources will require the integration of new methods, policies, standards, and technologies. This paper aims to give an overview in digital preservation, highlights some strategy and standards efforts. Keywords: <b>Digital</b> Preservation, <b>Obsolescence,</b> OAI...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{curation}} initiatives with {{an intention}} {{to preserve the}} intellectual content of an institute gained momentum in the early 1990 s with open source technologies facilitating such efforts. Indian Institute of Management Library (hitherto referred as IIMB library in this paper) heralded onto a new path of making primary datasets about socio-economic datasets, including the massive census reports in the digital domain. In the year 2014 all National Sample Surveys from the Government of India and Census reports from 1881 to 1941 were digitized for internal circulation purposes only. Though these efforts were a small step towards digital curation, it raised expectations from the user community on the computational potential and data mining abilities of these datasets. But to accomplish it, the challenges of <b>digital</b> perpetuity, technological <b>obsolescence,</b> dissemination expanded to the public, copyright issues have to be overcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} we {{have with}} materials is built up over time and includes a complex array of variables that contribute to a material having preconceived functional and aesthetic qualities that are specific to certain products and within certain materials (Demirbilek & Sener, 2003, Dunne, 2005; Chapman, 2015). The relationship {{we have with}} plastic is a short one and {{has not yet been}} fully understood in terms of our material culture. The use of plastics for the manufacture of digital goods is interesting, as the brevity of our relationship with plastics as a material is mirrored by our short lived contact with rapidly obsolescing digital products. As a result the opportunities to engage with the material and to understand how it ages over time are limited. If we are to encourage the extension of digital product lifetimes, it is imperative that we understand the way plastics age within this context. The disposal of digital products (of which significant proportions are manufactured using a variety of plastics) contributes to a substantial problem of e-waste. The most recent estimation is that around £ 200 m of digital products per year are sent to landfill (WRAP, 2015). The physical condition of these devices {{is an important factor in}} product replacement, which leads to significant product turnover (van Nes, 2004; Cooper, 2010). To understand the reasons for disposal of these <b>digital</b> devices, cosmetic <b>obsolescence</b> is the area that this paper is concerned with and through empirical studies, the paper establishes how smartphones [in this instance] wear over time and what the attitudinal reactions to those instances of wear are. By conducting these studies, a taxonomy of wear is established that occurs within plastics used in digital products and begins to understand the attitudinal reactions which give an indication of the affect that these types of wear have on the perceptions of plastics in terms of newness and tolerance of wear...|$|R

5000|$|Digital {{curation}} is the selection, preservation, maintenance, {{collection and}} archiving of digital assets.Digital curation establishes, maintains and adds value to repositories of digital data for {{present and future}} use. This is often accomplished by archivists, librarians, scientists, historians, and scholars. Enterprises are starting to use digital curation {{to improve the quality}} of information and data within their operational and strategic processes. Successful digital curation will mitigate <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> keeping the information accessible to users indefinitely.|$|E
40|$|Digital Preservation {{addresses}} a significant {{threat to our}} cultural and economic foundation: the loss of access to valuable and, sometimes, unique information that is captured in <b>digital</b> form through <b>obsolescence,</b> deterioration or loss of information of how to access the contents. Digital Preservation {{has been defined as}} “The series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as necessary” (Jones, Beagrie, 2001 / 2008). This thesis develops a conceptual model of the core concepts and constraints that appear in digital preservation - DePICT (Digital PreservatIon ConceptualisaTion). This includes a conceptual model of the digital preservation domain, a top-level vocabulary for the concepts in the model, an in-depth analysis of the role of digital object properties, characteristics, and the constraints that guide digital preservation processes, and of how properties, characteristics and constraints affect the interaction of digital preservation services. In addition, it presents a machine-interpretable XML representation of this conceptual model to support automated digital preservation tools. Previous preservation models have focused on preserving technical properties of digital files. Such an approach limits the choices of preservation actions and does not fully reflect preservation activities in practice. Organisations consider properties that go beyond technical aspects and that encompass a wide range of factors that influence and guide preservation processes, including organisational, legal, and financial ones. Consequently, it is necessary {{to be able to handle}} ‘digital’ objects in a very wide sense, including abstract objects, such as intellectual entities and collections, in addition to the files and sets of files that create renditions of logical objects that are normally considered. In addition, we find that not only the digital objects' properties, but also the properties of the environments in which they exist, guide digital preservation processes. Furthermore, organisations use risk-based analysis for their preservation strategies, policies and preservation planning. They combine information about risks with an understanding of actions that are expected to mitigate the risks. Risk and action specifications can be dependent on properties of the actions, as well as on properties of objects or environments which form the input and output of those actions. The model presented here supports this view explicitly. It links risks with the actions that mitigate them and expresses them in stakeholder specific constraints. Risk, actions and constraints are top-level entities in this model. In addition, digital objects and environments are top-level entities on an equal level. Models that do not have this property limit the choice of preservation actions to ones that transform a file in order to mitigate a risk. Establishing environments as top-level entities enables us to treat risks to objects, environments, or a combination of both. The DePICT model is the first conceptual model in the Digital Preservation domain that supports a comprehensive, whole life-cycle approach for dynamic, interacting preservation processes, rather than taking the customary and more limited view that is concerned with the management of digital objects once they are stored in a long-term repository.

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} analog {{objects such}} as books or photographs where the user has unmediated access to the content, a digital object always needs a software environment to render it. These environments keep evolving and changing at a rapid pace, threatening the continuity {{of access to the}} content. Physical storage media, data formats, hardware, and software all become obsolete over time, posing significant threats to the survival of the content. This process can be referred to as <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Xena {{attempts}} to avoid <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence</b> by converting files into an openly specified format, such as ODF or PNG. If the file format is not supported or the Binary Normalisation option is selected, Xena will perform ASCII Base64 encoding on binary files and wrap the output in XML metadata. The resulting [...]xena file is plain text, although {{the content of}} the data itself is not directly human-readable. The exact original file can be retrieved by stripping the metadata and reversing the Base64 encoding, using an internal viewer.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 the Keeping Emulation Environments Portable (KEEP) project, {{part of the}} EU Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development 7, {{developed}} {{tools and}} methodologies to keep digital software objects available in their original context. Digital software objects as video games might get lost because of <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence</b> and non-availability of required legacy hardware or operating system software; such software {{is referred to as}} abandonware. Because the source code is often not available any longer, emulation is the only preservation opportunity. KEEP provided an emulation framework to help the creation of such emulators. KEEP was developed by Vincent Joguin, first launched in February 2009 and was coordinated by Elisabeth Freyre of the French National Library.|$|E
5000|$|With the 2000s and the emerge of {{peer-to-peer}} sharing {{networks and}} sharing in web development, a new copyright-critical developer generation made the [...] "license-free" [...] public-domain software model visible again, also criticizing the FOSS license ecosystem ("Post Open Source") as stabilizing {{part of the}} copyright system. New non-FOSS licenses and waiver texts were developed, notable the Creative Commons [...] "CC0" [...] (2009) and the [...] "Unlicense" [...] (2010), and a growing popularity of permissive software licenses was noticed. Also, the growing problem of orphaned software and <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence</b> of software raised the awareness of the relevance of passing software into public domain again for a better digital preservation of the digital heritage, unrestricted by copyright and DRM.|$|E
5000|$|An extreme {{variant of}} [...] "delayed open-sourcing" [...] is a {{business}} practice popularized by id Software and 3D Realms, which released several software products under a free software license after a long proprietary commercialization time period {{and the return of}} investment was achieved. The motivation of companies following this practice of releasing the source code when a software reaches the commercial end-of-life, is to prevent that their software becomes unsupported Abandonware or even get lost due to <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> This gives the user communities the chance to continue development and support of the software product themselves as an open-source software project. Many examples from the video game domain are in the list of commercial video games with later released source code.|$|E
50|$|Technical {{obsolescence}} usually {{occurs when}} a new product or technology supersedes the old, and it becomes preferred {{to use the new}} technology in place of the old. Historical examples of superseding technologies causing obsolescence include bronze replacing flint in handtools, higher-quality multimedia DVD over videocassette recorder and the telephone, with audio transmission, over the telegraph's coded electrical signals. On a smaller scale, particular products may become obsolete due to replacement by a newer version of the product. Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner; for example, Central processing units frequently become obsolete in favor of newer, faster units. Singularly, rapid obsolescence of data formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information, a process known as <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Digital {{preservation}} {{involves the}} many activities necessary to enable continuous access to digital content. These activities include [...] "collection, description, migration, and redundant storage". [...] Born-digital materials present certain difficulties in this mission. As with other digital objects, preservation {{must be a}} continuous and regular undertaking, as these materials do not show {{the same kinds of}} advanced warning signs of degradation that print and certain other physical materials do. Invisible processes such as bit rot can lead to irreparable damage. [...] In other cases, such as on the Web, born-digital content is particularly ephemeral and changes, or even disappears, very quickly; lapses in preservation can cause these materials to escape forever. [...] Those preserving digital materials also have to worry about changing technologies and the risk of <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The rapid {{evolution}} and proliferation {{of different kinds}} of computer hardware, modes of digital encoding, operating systems and general or specialized software ensures that <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence</b> will become a problem in the future. Many versions of word-processing programs, data-storage media, standards for encoding images and films are considered [...] "standards" [...] for some time, but in the end are always replaced by new versions of the software or completely new hardware. Files meant to be read or edited with a certain program (for example Microsoft Word) will be unreadable in other programs, and as operating systems and hardware move on, even old versions of programs developed by the same company become impossible to use on the new platform (for instance, older versions of Microsoft Works, before Works 4.5, cannot be run under Windows 2000 or later).|$|E
50|$|A huge {{challenge}} of oral history preservation {{today is the}} battle with <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> There is an obvious link between oral history preservation and digital preservation. Oral histories are often recorded on an assortment of tapes which are ultimately transferred onto computerized, or digitized, formats {{in order to facilitate}} their longevity. These digitized formats then have to be preserved, along with their corresponding metadata, just as any other digital objects are. Technological advances are happening everyday {{and it is difficult to}} keep up with these changes. Emulation and migration are two ways in which formats can be changed in order to be of use for longer. Emulation focuses on designing hardware and software that will imitate the old system so that it can accept the old files while migration focuses on fitting preserved data into a smaller number of formats that can still encode the complexities of the structure and form of the original format.|$|E
40|$|Private sector legal {{records are}} at risk of {{becoming}} lost or inaccessible through globalization, <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> physical neglect, lack of interest on the part of information owners or reduced archive resources to preserve and provide access to the records. All records in the private sector face similar challenges, but modern legal records (early twentieth century to the present day) are particularly vulnerable due to recent developments which are transforming the nature, organisation, regulation and economics of legal services. These changes are outstripping the capacity of the traditional providers of legal research facilities to make relevant records available to researchers. Additionally, unless systematic efforts are made towards collecting private sector legal records, research using modern legal records will continue to be weighted towards the study of the legislation and the courts, producing a lopsided historical picture of the UK’s legal framework. In this article the authors explain concerns about the potential loss of legal records from the private legal sector and outline {{the ways in which the}} Legal Records at Risk research project at the IALS aims to investigate the issues and help identify possible solutions...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{research}} data throughout its lifecycle ensures its long-term value and prevents data from falling into <b>digital</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> Proper data management {{is a key}} prerequisite for effective data sharing throughout the scientific community. This, in turn, increases the visibility of scholarly work {{and is likely to}} increase citation rates. Many funding organizations prescribe the use of data management plans and insist on open access publication of the research results they funded. Even if a funding body does not explicitly demand data management, following professional curation and preservation concepts has numerous advantages: 	It greatly facilitates the reuse of {{research data}}. 	As a result, this increases the impact of research results. 	It saves precious research funds and ultimately natural and human resources by avoiding unnecessary duplication of work. Today, the availability of well-managed data is part of good scientific practice and ensures the reproducibility of research results, a key requirement {{at the core of the}} research process. The following data management checklist is based on a generalised research data lifecycle, and is flexible enough to be applied to requirements from different funding organisations. It is among the first tangible deliverables of the Swiss Data Life-Cycle Management (DLCM) project, facilitated by swissuniversities and involving the collaboration between eight Swiss higher education institutions...|$|E
