40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of the European Union's Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs) since their introduction in 1993. It argues that the BEPGs have demonstrated value-added as an overarching instrument of policy co-ordination and as a catalyst for co-operation between European and national policy-makers. Notwithstanding this, the effectiveness of the BEPGs appears to have been hindered by the progressive accumulation of guidelines and by the failure of peer pressure to bite as a sanction mechanism. The re-launch of the Lisbon Strategy in March 2005 simplified and streamlined the BEPGs, embedding them within a new set of <b>Integrated</b> <b>Guidelines</b> for Growth and Jobs. Key issues surrounding the future of the BEPGs concern their potential as a trigger for 'home grown' peer pressure, their attention to euro area specific issues and the involvement of the European Parliament in multilateral surveillance.

These CVD risk factors, especially obesity, track from childhood into adult life (Gidding et al. 2004; The et al. 2010).

However, this focus on the `New` economy mistakes the EU`s strengths, weaknesses and their causes. In reality, an improvement in its growth and employment prospects may lie with the decidedly unglamorous economics of labour market reforms and with the parts of the `Old` economy, which still comprises the main engine of growth.

In addition, using decision models to produce guidelines enables developers to structure guideline problems systematically, to prioritize information acquisition, to develop site-specific guidelines, and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the explicit incorporation of patient preferences into guideline recommendations.

The most important thing to do, to ensure that a synthesis is useful to managers, is to include managers, science delivery specialists, and scientists throughout the development process.

Various {{national}} guidelines exist for specific diseases. However, most of the guidelines address management at a tertiary level and often appear nonapplicable for the limited resources in primary care facilities. An <b>integrated</b> symptom-based <b>guideline</b> was developed so as to translate the Botswana national guidelines to those applicable in primary care. The Botswana Primary Care <b>Guideline</b> (BPCG) <b>integrates</b> the care of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS and noncommunicable diseases, by frontline primary health care workers. Methods: The Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Botswana, together with guideline developers from the Knowledge Translation Unit (University of Cape Town) collaborated with the Ministry of Health to develop the guideline. Stakeholder groups were set up to review specific content of the guideline to ensure compliance with Botswana government policy and the essential drug list. Results: Participants included clinicians, academics, patient advocacy groups, and policymakers from different disciplines, both private and public. Drug-related issues were identified as necessary for implementing recommendations of the guideline. There was consensus by working groups for updating the essential drug list for primary care and expansion of prescribing rights of trained nurse prescribers in primary care within their scope of practice.
