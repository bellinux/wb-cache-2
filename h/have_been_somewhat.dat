Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E

During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.

5|$|Later on September9, Sarah turned sharply northward as the {{lee side}} low rapidly tracked northeast. Reintensification {{gradually}} took {{place as the}} storm {{moved away from the}} Philippines, with the storm reaching typhoon status by September10. Tracking generally towards the north-northwest, Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period of explosive intensification on September11. Over a six-hour span, the storm's winds increased from 140km/h (85mph) to 215km/h (135mph). A powerful typhoon, Sarah featured a well-defined eye and multiple outflow channels. The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category4equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). The JMA assessed Sarah to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> weaker, estimating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) along with a barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E
5|$|Early in {{his tenure}} Norreis appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> circumspect {{and did not}} greatly annoy his monks. The change appears to have {{happened}} around 1195, when the monks are first recorded as appealing to higher authority. Because Evesham had traditionally claimed to be exempt from episcopal oversight by the see of Worcester, {{in which it was}} located, the monks could only appeal to the papacy or to a papal legate. Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury after Baldwin, held a legateship for England until July 1195 and so the monks appealed to him. Walter forced Norreis to make some compromises with his subordinates, but the truce did not last long, and the monks once again complained of their treatment. They were visited by the new Bishop of Worcester John of Coutances some time between 1196 and 1198, but Norreis succeeded in avoiding any severe sanctions by offering gifts to the bishop. The monks again appealed to Walter in about 1200, but between the archbishop's preoccupation with political affairs and Norreis's promises to reform, no solid changes occurred.|$|E

25|$|The {{church in}} Cornwall {{until the time}} of Athelstan of Wessex {{observed}} more or less orthodox practices, being completely separate from the Anglo-Saxon church until then (and perhaps later).

However, {{it is unclear whether}} he was the sole Bishop for Cornwall or the leading Bishop in the area. The situation in Cornwall may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> similar to Wales where each major religious house equated to a kevrang (cf.

25|$|Excavations {{carried out}} in 1934 by H. E. Kilbride-Jones {{on behalf of the}} Ministry of Works, showed that the circle was built in stages. The entire site had first been cleared, leveled and burned by setting fire to piles of willow twigs. Then came the outer stones, with their bases shaped into points to make them more stable in their gravel bed. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> eroded over time by acidic peat eating away the lower {{portions}} of the stones. Oak and hazel were burned within the stone rings, leaving charcoal behind, and cremated human bones were deposited in the ashes within five of the rings.

25|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{introduce}} intensified crop production {{with an emphasis}} on rice grown year after year in the same field, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> successful. Rice cultivation in this historically cold region has been made easier in recent decades due to global warming. This is largely due to the exhaustion of Zafimaniry land for traditional swidden agriculture, which has forced the Zafimaniry {{to find a way to}} adopt rice cultivation despite the unadapted nature of the mountainous terrain where they live. The terrain and climate require highly complex terracing and irrigation systems that the local population lacks the knowledge to build, so they are required to hire Betsileo specialists to construct their paddies. Most cash income the Zafimaniry use is invested in the construction of terraces for rice cultivation.|$|E
