5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along the <b>external</b> <b>wall.</b> This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached {{the external}} walls.

The monks' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> of the south transept.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{evaluate}} the possibility of application or replacement of radiators with low-temperature radiant panels. This paper shows the comparison results of operations of 4 space heating systems: the low-temperature radiant panel system without any additional thermal insulation of <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> (PH-WOI), the low-temperature radiant panel system with additional thermal insulation of <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> (PH-WI), the radiator system without any additional thermal insulation of <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> (the classical heating system) (RH-WOI), and the radiator system with additional thermal insulation of <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> (RH-WI). The operation of each system is simulated by software EnergyPlus. The investigation shows that the PH-WI gives the best results. The RH-WOI has the largest energy consumption, and the largest pollutant emission. However, the PH-WI requires the highest investment...|$|R

5|$|The first {{church was}} {{markedly}} cruciform {{in shape and}} smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing {{between the north and}} south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).|$|E

25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and another patient to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall <b>external</b> <b>wall.</b> In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} floors {{with a single}} large room on each floor. The {{ceilings}} are 7.5m in height. The floors are connected by a well-conserved narrow spiral staircase only 1m in width located in {{the northwest corner of}} the building. The stairs are protected at the top by a rectangular turret. On the first two levels of the staircase there are slots in the <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> to admit light. The roof terrace is 27m above the ground. The turret projects another 7m and the lookout tower extends a further 5m giving a total height of 39m for the structure. The walls are 2.4m in thickness on the ground floor, 2.2m on the first floor and 2.0m on the second.|$|E
25|$|A former {{employee}} of Kenzo Tange was Arata Isozaki who was initially {{interested in the}} Metabolist Movement and produced innovative theoretical projects for the City in the Air (1961) and Future City (1962). However he soon moved away from this towards a more Mannerist approach similar {{to the work of}} James Stirling. This was particularly striking at the Oita Branch for Fukuoka Mutual (1967) with its mathematical grids, concrete construction and exposed services. In the Gunma Prefectural Museum (1971–74) he experimented with cubic elements (some of them twelve metres to a side) overlaid by a secondary grid expressed by the <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> panels and fenestration. This rhythm of panelling may have been influenced by Corbusier's detailing on the Museum of Western Art in Tōkyō.|$|E

25|$|Pentagonal pillboxes {{are only}} found {{at or near}} airfields so are almost {{certainly}} an Air Ministry design, although no drawings {{have been found to}} support this idea. They are regular pentagons in shape with a variant form having an added AAMG well at the rear. They also show some variation in size, with the smallest having <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> lengths of approximately 3m and the largest at 4.5m; this variation may be a result of later thickening of the walls of some thin-walled pillboxes at airfields. They are generally fitted with Turnbull Mounts allowing the use {{of a wide range of}} weapons. The versions with an AA well have four embrasures and those without have five centrally placed in each face. The door in these variants is offset to accommodate the fifth embrasure.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} {{was dedicated}} in 1995 to the seven {{victims of the}} 1979 fire, with a tree planted next to an antique bench decorated {{with the names of}} the victims. During the 2003 redevelopment, the tree was removed and the bench lost. Park director Warwick Doughty claimed that the memorial and events had little relevance, although North Sydney mayor Genia McCaffery, among others, disagreed and campaigned for the memorial's reinstatement. In 2004, a plaque listing the names of the victims was placed on an <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> of the Big Top, which was constructed {{on the site of the}} Ghost Train. The plaque was to be the centrepiece of a mural painted by former Park Artist Martin Sharp, but this has never been painted. At least one person present at the unveiling of the plaque was unimpressed with the new memorial.|$|E

At the first floor level the northwest veranda has been enclosed and extended and the roofline has been altered. The first level contained one large room, which has been subdivided with partitions. This room has six sets of French doors, which open onto the enclosed veranda and six windows on the Gregory Terrace elevation. The room retains its pressed metal ceiling and fittings such as a row of coat hooks.|$|E
25|$|For {{the early}} period, before the 6th century BC, the term Ionic temple can, at best, {{designate}} a temple in the Ionian areas of settlement. No fragments of architecture {{belonging to the}} Ionic order have been found from this time. Nonetheless, some early temples in the area already indicate the rational system that was to characterise the Ionic system later on, e.g. the Heraion II of Samos. Thus, even at an early point, the axes of the cella walls aligned with the column axes, whereas in Doric architecture, the <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> faces do so. The early temples also show no concern for the typical Doric feature of viewability from all sides, they regularly lack an opisthodomos; the peripteros only became widespread {{in the area in}} the 4th century BC. In contrast, from an early point, Ionic temples stress the front by using double porticos. Elongated peristaseis became a determining element. At the same time, the Ionic temples were characterised by their tendency to use varied and richly decorated surfaces, as well as the widespread use of light-shade contrasts.|$|E
25|$|Detectives went to Simpson's Rockingham {{estate to}} inform {{him that his}} ex-wife had been murdered. In {{the back of his}} home, they found some blood {{scattered}} all over on a white Ford Bronco. Detective Mark Fuhrman climbed over an <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances—specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to Chicago late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found under the bed at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson.|$|E
