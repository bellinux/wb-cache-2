As {{the rate of change}} in organisations continues to increase this dependency has become more critical. However methods for determining the <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> that an organisation needs have not moved forward to reflect these increases in organisational turbulence and new capabilities offered by Information Technology. Strategic Alignment is proposed as a new method for <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Planning</b> which recognises the dynamic role of <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> as an agent of change and to enable organisations to model and determine how <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> can be exploited to improve and transform Business Strategies. Important innovations in the method are incorporation of feedback to ensure that analysis of the interaction of the <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> and Business objects within the model is bidirectional. Also that the development of an <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Plan</b> is a complex process which has to be modular. This enables it to incorporate existing results and information where applicable and to deliver its results incrementally. The Strategic Alignment Method has been developed from extensive research which used the Electricity Supply Industry as the source of information because it was facing immense change after its privatisation. As a result detailed case study material is presented as well as the Strategic Alignment Methodology. Maintenance of an <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Plan</b> is also addressed.
