5|$|The Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, {{although}} written under McIntosh's leadership, {{had been}} {{determined by a}} special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused on <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>schemes</b> and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned. One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as Fares Fair, which focused on reducing London Underground fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975, it was widely {{considered to be a}} moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London rates.|$|E
25|$|There are now several {{countries}} which have implemented direct <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>schemes</b> {{to counter the}} major problems associated with persistent unemployment.

500|$|From 1974 to 1990 {{the canal}} benefited from <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>schemes</b> {{run by the}} Manpower Services Commission and Youth Training Scheme {{to work on the}} {{northern}} section from Resolven to Ysgwrfa. By 1990 there was [...] of navigable canal, including 7 restored locks and a slipway at Resolven basin. It received a 1998 Europa Nostra award for the quality of the work, and a Civic Trust Award in 1992. The £4million project was jointly funded by the Welsh Office and the Prince of Wales Trust. The Rheola aqueduct {{in the middle of this}} section was refurbished by the Canals Society in 1990. The stream that is now carried under the canal had previously been carried over it in a cast iron trough, but was diverted through a channel cut across the canal bed after high flows overtopped the trough. This required the construction of a new aqueduct, and once completed, the Canals Society launched their trip boat, named Thomas Dadford, on 12 July 1990, to provide canal trips for the public.

30|$|Further studies {{likewise}} {{relied on}} PSM methods: Wunsch and Lechner (2008) on West Germany and Lechner and Wunsch (2009) on East Germany investigated effects of many ALMPs including the traditional <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme.</b> They analysed the inflow into unemployment from 2000 to 2002 {{and for people}} aged 25 to 49  years. Programme participants are defined by their first programme participation that started within 18  months after entering unemployment in Wunsch and Lechner (2008) and within three years in Lechner and Wunsch (2009). The analysis consists of a matching step and a regression step that is doubly robust (Wunsch and Lechner 2008 : 149). With {{a negative effect on}} the regular employment rate even 30  months after entering the programme, both studies found that the traditional <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme</b> was quite detrimental for participants. Stephan and Pahnke (2011) analysed the inflow into different ALMPs in March 2003. Non-participation was defined as waiting, since non-participants might have entered a programme after March 2003. The sample was restricted to people aged 25 to 59  years who were initially not yet long-term unemployed. Compared with waiting, the <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme</b> significantly reduced the time spent in regular employment during the 3.5  years after programme entry by 40 (52) days for participations of a duration of 4 to 6 (7 to 12) months, due to lock-in effects. Finally, the evidence suggests some alternative programmes would have worked better for <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme</b> participants, in particular the provision of skills for 7 to 12  months and short in-firm training.|$|R

50|$|The canal {{benefited from}} the {{activities}} of the Manpower Services Commission in 1975, when £40,000 was allocated under the <b>Job</b> <b>Creation</b> <b>Scheme</b> to fund work on the Rochdale town section of the canal. The following year, another 150 jobs were created when a further £208,000 grant was made. Despite the progress, there were plans to sever the route with a low-level crossing by the proposed M66 motorway in 1979, and to build a supermarket on it at Sowerby Bridge in 1980, both of which were met with opposition. One benefit of the <b>Job</b> <b>Creation</b> <b>Scheme</b> was that the perception of the restoration changed in official circles. The local council was responsible for the young people employed on the scheme, which ran for twelve years, and found itself having to negotiate with the canal company. At its height, there were 450 people working on the canal, and since no-one could work on the scheme for more than a year, several thousand people learnt practical restoration skills, and many retained an interest in canals afterwards. The section from Todmorden to Hebden Bridge was completed in 1983, and opened on 20 May.|$|R
30|$|Hujer and Thomsen (2010) {{determined}} in {{how far the}} <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme’s</b> effect on participants varied for an entry during the first eight quarters of unemployment duration. They studied the inflow into the scheme in selected months during the years 2000 and 2001. 30  months after programme start, their results imply positive and significant employment effects only for programme entry in the fifth quarter of unemployment duration. For East Germans, the findings suggest no well-determined positive longer-term effects, and for some duration groups even significant negative effects.|$|R

30|$|Hohmeyer and Wolff (2010) {{were the}} first to study effects of both new work {{opportunity}} schemes and of the traditional <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme</b> on labour market prospects of welfare recipients after the introduction of the Hartz IV reform. They analysed the inflow into the programmes from May to July 2005. For all schemes, PSM estimates for the regular employment rate show quite moderate lock-in effects of a few percentage points. After the lock-in period, the estimates imply mostly positive employment effects. They are strongest and already emerge 6 to 12  months after programme entry for work opportunities with regular earnings. The highest effects were observed for East German women at around ten percentage points for most of the second and third year after programme entry and the lowest ones for East German men, at usually less than five percentage points. The positive employment effects of the <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme</b> were more moderate and emerged somewhat later. The lowest employment effects were found for participants of the One-Euro-Jobs scheme. More studies on One-Euro-Jobs are presented in Section 4.3. Additional estimates showed that wage paying schemes – even in the years after participation was completed – considerably raised annual earnings and reduced former participants’ dependence on welfare.|$|R

30|$|Even if the {{subsidies}} {{would have led}} to beneficial effects like increased employability and search effectiveness of the participants (which for most groups, they did not), deadweight loss, substitution and displacements effects might occur (see Section 2). For these reasons some studies aimed at determining effects of {{the intensity of the}} programme on the matching efficiency by considering its effects on the regular hiring rate and more general in a Beveridge Curve framework on the job-seeker rate, using regional labour market panel data 4. The studies by Hujer et al. (20042006) used a Beveridge Curve framework for the period of the first quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2001. Their system GMM estimates for West Germany show a positive though insignificant long-term impact of the number of participants in the <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme</b> relative to the labour force on the job-seeker rate.

Other studies investigated regional panel data for periods around and after the beginning of the millennium; they found either no or detrimental effects of the traditional <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>scheme</b> on outcomes like exit rates of job-seekers into regular jobs or the job-seeker rate (Fertig et al. 2006 a Fertig et al. 2006 b Hagen 2004 Hujer and Zeiss 2005 Hujer et al. 2009).|$|R

50|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 20th century, the {{settlement}} of this cultural landscape of small, closely built villages surrounded by orchards and gardens and terraced vineyards, only changed slowly. Today many of the former orchard fields lie fallow or have fallen victim to development as villages have grown, to industrial estates and roads, but also large-scale, consolidated vineyards. On the hillsides many old terrace walls have been demolished and levelled in order to simplify farming and construct farm tracks. The impression of a historically evolved, terraced, cultural landscape is thus quite a rare sight in several sections of the valley. With the aid of predominantly publicly funded <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>schemes,</b> overgrown terraces that had run wild have had their vegetation removed in several places in order to preserve the picture of a cultural landscape created by man as well as the biotope of very sunny terraces.
