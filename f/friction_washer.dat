50|$|The {{differential}} failed during endurance {{due to lack}} {{of safety}} wire on the main bolts. Early model Tosen differentials are assembled with three main bolts that hold the two housing together in the axial direction. These bolts loosened during the endurance event, which created a large gap between the two main gears and the <b>friction</b> <b>washer.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Invented in 1897, {{the duck}} brake or duck roller brake used a rod {{operated}} by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. [...] Mounted on axles secured by <b>friction</b> <b>washers</b> and set {{at an angle to}} conform to the shape of the tyre, the rollers were forced against their <b>friction</b> <b>washers</b> upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. [...] A tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. [...] Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar, which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). [...] Used in combination with a rear coaster brake, a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake. [...] Known colloquially as the duck brake, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. [...] In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck Roller Brake (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).|$|R

40|$|A {{landing pad}} system is {{described}} for absorbing {{horizontal and vertical}} impact forces upon engagement with a landing surface where circumferentially arranged landing struts respectively have a clevis which receives a slidable rod member and where the upper portion of a slidable rod member is coupled to the clevis by <b>friction</b> <b>washers</b> which are force fit onto the rod member to provide for controlled constant force energy absorption when the rod member moves relative to the clevis. The {{lower end of the}} friction rod is pivotally attached by a ball and socket to a support plate where the support plate is arranged to slide in a transverse direction relative to a housing which contains an energy absorption material for absorbing energy in a transverse direction...|$|R
50|$|The {{naturally}} aspirated V12 engine T-930 {{was created by}} adding extra four cylinders to the existing T-928 75-degree V8 engine, used in Tatra T138. The crankshaft consisted of six individual journals bolted together with front and rear pins all running on the main roller bearings and located on axial <b>friction</b> thrust <b>washers.</b> The military version was once again multi-fuel capable, running on mixtures of diesel fuel, petrol and aviation kerosene fuel.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article explores self-oscillations in a {{round washer}} {{interacting}} with a rotating elastic rod. It demonstrates that natural frequencies of the system are not equidistant. The internal <b>friction</b> in the <b>washer</b> material described by the Voigt model, limits the frequency range of excited oscillations. Quasi-harmonic self-oscillations with a limited range are excited in the washer due to the friction motion. Therefore, fluctuations apply to processes in the bearing outer race of a machine in the rotary mode...|$|R

The steel sheeting sections are manufactured with cold forming from thin steel strip and {{are attached to the}} underlying purlins or more commonly straight to the steel trusses by self-drilling or self-tapping screws. The behavior of sheeting connections is important in fire especially when the sheeting is in catenary action and tensile forces are devel-oped at supports where the screw connectors are located. A 3 D finite element model is created using ABAQUS software to simulate the single lap screw connections connecting thinner sheet (0. 8 mm) to thicker sheet (10 mm) under static shear at both room and high temperatures. This model considers the material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behav-ior. The connection model is analyzed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. The analysis reveals that the failure modes of the connection for both room and elevated temperatures are bearing failure of the thinner sheet. The load bearing capacity of the connections depends on the <b>friction</b> between the <b>washer</b> and the thinner sheet, the direct bearing of the screw shank against the thinner sheet and the postbuckling resistance of thinner sheet. Degradation of material at ele-vated temperature further reduces the strength and stiffness of the connections. This connection model can be taken as a component model in the analysis of the behavior of steel sheeting system in fire, which is highly non-linear so as to save the computing time...|$|R
