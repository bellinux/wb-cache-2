[...] In 1965, Bunning joined with Robin Roberts, a founder of the MLBPA, to hire a full-time executive director. [...] They agreed on Marvin Miller, then an <b>economist</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United Steelworkers. [...] They convinced the players union to hire Miller, and he remained in the position until 1983. [...] Under Miller's direction, in 1968 the MLBPA negotiated its first collective bargaining agreement with the owners, which put the players on the path to improved salaries, benefits, and working conditions. [...] By the time Bunning retired, the minimum salary and average salary for major league players had nearly doubled. [...] By 2015, the minimum salary was over $500,000 and the average salary was over $4 million. [...] Over time, the MLBPA also succeeded at eliminating the reserve clause and Major League Baseball's exemption from antitrust laws. [...] As a result, players were able to negotiate for the right to veto trades, as well as the right to declare free agency and offer their services to the highest bidder.|$|E
