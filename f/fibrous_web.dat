In this sense, a new method to produce novel sub-micrometer carbon fibers and interconnected <b>fibrous</b> carbon <b>webs</b> materials (FCMs), showing unique advanced properties for different applications, by electrospinning [2] of phosphorous-containing lignin solutions is studied in this work. The different FCMs were prepared by electrospinning of Alcell lignin solutions with and without P–containing compounds, followed by stabilization and carbonization at different temperatures. For comparison purposes, equivalent lignin-based powdery carbon materials (PCMs) were also prepared from lignin powder without the electrospinning step. The different samples were characterized by N 2 and CO 2 adsorption, SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS, TPD and TG analysis. In the absence of P-containing groups, electrospun carbon fibers are continuous and linear (Fig 1. a), and show a specific surface area of 700 m 2 /g, much higher than that of carbon prepared in powdery shape (70 m 2 /g).

40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing(MB) is {{a process}} for {{producing}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>webs</b> or articles directly from polymers or resins using high-velocity air or another appropriate force to attenuate the filaments. This process is one of the newer and least developed nonwoven processes. This process is unique because it is used almost exclusively to produce microfibers rather than fibers the size of normal textile fibers. MB microfibers generally have diameters in the range of 2 to 4 ㎛, although they may be as small as 0. 1 ㎛ and as large as 10 to 15 ㎛. The material acoustic property for noise absorption is principally based on the efficiency of material structures for damping sound wave reflections. In this paper, the sound absorbing material was designed with three layer composite sturcture. Sound absorbing material with fine meltblown(0. 5 ~ 3 ㎛, 80 %) and high modulus hollow fiber(30 ㎛, 20 %) as a surface layer and bulky non-woven(15 ~ 30 ㎛) as middle layer, meltblown(3 ~ 10 ㎛) as bottom layer were manufactured. Their noise absorption were measured using the acoustic duct instrurment.

With outstanding properties such as large surface area, high length/diameter ratio, flexible surface functionality, and tunable surface morphologies, the electrospun fibers have an underlying application in optoelectronics, sensors, catalysis, textiles, filters, fiber reinforcement, tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound healing, etc. [1 – 7]. During electrospinning process, when the electric field force reaches a certain threshold value, polymer droplet overcomes the surface tension and forms a jet trickle from the capillary Taylor cone vertex. After a series of vigorous whipping and/or splitting motion due to fluid instability and electrically driven bending instability, the products are deposited commonly as a nonwoven <b>fibrous</b> <b>web</b> on a collector.

40|$|Hydroentanglement is an {{important}} technique of bonding fibres to produce nonwovens using high velocity waterjets as the primary bonding tool. The work reported in this thesis addresses the gap in scientific knowledge and understanding, both theoretical and experimental, related to the impact forces and energy of the waterjets used in the hydroentanglement process. The current study focused on the impact forces and energy involved in, and the optimisation of, the hydroentanglement process. The results of the experimentally measured waterjet impact forces {{have been used to}} characterise the waterjets as well as to verify empirically the theoretical models currently available for explaining the mechanics of the hydroentanglement process. Since the process of supplying pressurised waterjets consumes a great deal of energy, the study of energy consumption and efficiency of the system has been critical. A method was proposed and used to determine the coefficients of velocity and water discharge of an industrial machine set-up, helping explain the mechanism of energy transfer during hydroentanglement and to concurrently optimise the process. Furthermore, a response surface experimental design was used to optimise the hydroentanglement of viscose and Polylactic acid (PLA) fibres into nonwovens.

The type of nonwovens studied in this research is a thermally bonded one with polymer-based bicomponent fibres.

Molten sheath material acts as an adhesive while core parts of the fibres remain fully intact in the bond points. On the other hand, web regions, which are not in contact with the hot engraved pattern, remain unaffected and form the fibre matrix that acts as a link between bond points. With two distinct regions, namely, bond points and fibre matrix, with different structures, nonwovens exhibit a unique deformation behaviour. This research aims to analyse the complex mechanical behaviour of thermally bonded bicomponent fibre nonwoven materials using a combination of experimental and numerical methods.

To facilitate this, a new solvent system was developed for electrospinning polysulphone that enabled low temperature solvation of the polymer. Both of technology platforms (molecular loading and molecular-imprinting of electrospun fibres) were relevant to the design of improved therapeutic products for applications in healthcare.

40|$|Self-assembling {{peptides}} (SAPs) {{have been}} shown to offer great promise in therapeutics and have the ability to undergo self-assembly and form ordered nanostructures. However SAP gels are often associated with inherent weak and transient mechanical properties and incorporation of them into polymeric matrices is a route to enhance their mechanical stability. The aim of this work was to incorporate P 11 - 8 peptide (CH 3 COQQRFOWOFEQQNH 2) within poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) <b>fibrous</b> <b>webs</b> via one-step electrospinning, aiming to establish the underlying relationships between spinning process, molecular peptide conformation, and material internal architecture. Electrospinning of PCL solutions (6 % w/w) in hexafluoro- 2 -propanol (HFIP) containing up to 40 mg mL− 1 P 11 - 8 resulted in the formation of fibres in both nano- (10 – 100 nm) and submicron range (100 – 700 nm), in contrast to PCL only webs, which displayed a predominantly submicron fibre distribution. FTIR and CD spectroscopy on both PCL/peptide solutions and resulting electrospun webs revealed monomeric and β-sheet secondary conformation, respectively, suggesting the occurrence of peptide self-assembly during electrospinning due to solvent evaporation. The peptide concentration (0 → 40 mg mL− 1) was found to primarily affect the internal structure of the fabric at the nano-scale, whilst water as well as cell culture medium contact angles were dramatically decreased. Nearly no cytotoxic response (> 90 % cell viability) was observed when L 929 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in contact with electrospun peptide loaded samples. This novel nanofibrous architecture may be the basis for an interesting material platform for e. g. hard tissue repair, in light of the presence of the self-assembled P 11 - 8 in the PCL fibrous structure...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignJooyoun KimSeong-O ChoiSuperhydrophobicity (water contact angle, WCA > 150 ˚) can be {{achieved}} by introducing surface roughness and decreasing surface energy. Polystyrene (PS) electrospun web can be used as an excellent substrate for superhydrophobic surface due to its low surface energy (~ 33 mN/m) and processibility to form various roughness. As the Cassie-Baxter model explains, the presence of roughness amplifies anti-wettability of materials whose surface energy is low (hydrophobic, WCA > 90 ˚). This study aims to fabricate superhydrophobic PS nonwoven webs by electrospinning process and vapor deposition of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (PFDTS) and to investigate the influence of fiber morphology and surface energy on wettability. To this end, PS webs with various fiber morphologies were electrospun under different polymer concentrations and solvent mixtures. PS substrates were treated by air plasma to attach –OH groups before the vapor deposition of PFDTS. Air plasma treatment itself increased the surface energy of PS; however, with PFDTS coating, the surface energy was decreased. The wettability was characterized by WCA and sliding angle measurement. WCAs on the electrospun webs were greater than that of flat PS film (WCA= 95 ˚) due to the increased roughness of the web. The web with beads or grooved fibers achieved superhydrophobicity (WCA> 150 ˚). PFDTS deposition lowered the surface energy of PS surface to about 15. 8 mN/m. PS web with PFDTS deposition presented high water contact angle up to 169 ˚ and low sliding angle about 3 ˚. Also it was attempted to characterize the interfacial area between water and a solid surface on irregular <b>fibrous</b> <b>webs.</b> The fraction of solid surface area wet by the liquid (solid fraction) was observed by staining the rough electrospun web with a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, coumarin. The actual solid fraction corresponded fairly well with the theoretical solid fraction calculated by the Cassie-Baxter equation, demonstrating that the treated superhydrophobic surface follows the Cassie-Baxter wetting state...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to explore the possible ways of using the intrinsic properties of cellulosic pulp fibres and inorganic pigments, by combining these elements using non-standard procedures, {{as a means to}} engineer a new composite material – a novel uncoated woodfree paper with improved physical properties. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) was used as the inorganic pigment in this study. To accomplish this objective, we conducted a preliminary study on web addition followed by detailed studies on in-situ precipitation in fibrillated pulp suspensions and blending of novel furnish materials. We evaluated the different technological approaches by analysing the production process and product quality. In the first approach, chemical precipitation and spraying of filler dispersion onto a <b>fibrous</b> <b>web,</b> and mechanically pressing to assist penetration into the network, were compared against conventional filler dosage before web forming. The results showed that web addition approach results in higher tensile strength and lower light scattering of paper. Filler agglomeration and optical crowding, in chemical precipitation and web application respectively, resulted in significantly deteriorating the light scattering of the handsheets. The experimental conditions were not sufficient to obtain an even distribution of filler along the thickness direction of paper and the filler characteristics were not optimised in this study. In the second technique, precipitation onto fibrillated pulp suspensions was investigated by varying the pulp substrate, PCC crystal structure, and pre-refining a mixture of pulp and milk of lime. According to the research findings, PCCs formed by precipitation of calcium carbonate onto cellulosic fibrils and fibres do not necessarily have the same characteristics as reference PCCs formed by carbonizing milk of lime. Precipitation of calcium carbonate onto fibrillated fibres and microfines increases the retention of filler but impairs the dewatering of handsheets during pressing. Higher amount of fibrillated cellulosic substrates in combination with appropriate filler morphology, scalenohedral or rhombohedral, contribute to increased bond strength and light scattering of traditional fine paper. Pre-refining a mixture of pulp and calcium hydroxide results in grinding of lime, and hence, the composites have a greater surface area than the reference filler. Composite filled handsheets, from this study, exhibited high light scattering. In the third method, the microfines-filler composite was envisioned as the backbone structure for a new composite material – uncoated fine paper. In the new composite paper, strength properties arise from the microfibrillated cellulose, bulk and pores originate from the filler surrounded by fibrils, whereas tear strength is imparted by a minimal proportion of pulp fibres in the composite. Compared to conventional fibre based fine paper, even at high filler loading the new composite material showed higher bending stiffness, tensile and tear indices, internal bond strength, light scattering and brightness properties. The new concept of fines-pigment-based furnish enables us to load pigments in uncoated wood free paper up to 50 %- 60 %. However, dewatering time is considerably longer. This method needs to be optimised, with further research on dewatering, and printability, before scaling it to an industrial process. This study shows the potential of different approaches, novel furnish components and addition of pigment onto a formed web, in the creation of new composite fine paper. Novel composite structure for fine paper can be achieved by employing the smallest component of pulp fibres, cellulosic microfines, in combination with pigments. The characteristics of microfines and crystal structure of pigments are important control variables in the formation and properties of the new composite paper. On the other hand, cellulosic microfines are highly swollen and retard dewatering. Therefore, further optimisation of process methodology and product quality can be expected to lead to some useful advances in commercialisation of this technology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{the effects}} of {{variables}} such as initial carded web mass, needle penetration depth, punch density, {{and the frequency of}} incident sound wave on transmission of sound through polypropylene needle-punched nonwovens were investigated. <b>Fibrous</b> carded <b>webs</b> using commercially available 17 dtex, 90 mm staple length polypropylene fibers were prepared with different mass per unit area using carding machine. Samples were needled at various punch-densities and needle penetration depths were produced. Design points of experiments were set up using Taguchi experimental design method. Sound transmission loss (STL) of needled samples was measured using an impedance tube equipped with four microphones. Minitab software was used to analyze the sound transmission ability of the samples. Results indicated that all of the considered controllable factor have significant effects on STL values determined for the needled nonwovens. Also, initial carded web mass was found to be the most influential factor affecting sound transmission through the samples. It was concluded that an increase in thickness of the samples as well as mass per unit area of nonwovens results in higher sound transmission loss by the samples...|$|R

Please note that this version does not contain the published papers and that where publisher permission has been given, the published papers {{are available from the}} Institutional Repository. This thesis describes original engineering research which aimed to establish fundamental understanding of various textile processes and to search for solutions to the associated problems. First, the particulars of the candidate are given, followed by a list of the publications included in the submission and the summary of each paper detailing the aims and achievements of the work. In this thesis, contributions in the following areas are described: 1. Air-jet texturing and intermingling: this section, which contains nearly half of the papers, reports the research in the field of air-jet texturing of continuous filament yarns and intermingling of false-twist textured yarns. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the supersonic air flow, its interaction with the filament yarn and the effect of process parameters on the properties of the textured yarn are reported. This research established a clear understanding of the mechanism of the loop and entanglement formation in the air-jet texturing and the air-intermingling processes. Improvements to both processes have been suggested and more efficient and cost effective nozzles have been designed and evaluated. 2. Yarn characterisation: development of digital image processing and analysis techniques for objective, non-invasive and accurate assessment of the structural properties of the air-jet textured yarns is reported. The research has been extended to include the measurement of nip frequency and regularity of the air-intermingled yarns, as well as the yarn hairiness, evenness and twist of the conventional spun yarns. 3. 	Water-jet and thermal bonding of nonwovens: experimental research into the nonwoven fabric formation using very fine high-pressure water jets and modelling of the thermal bonding of <b>fibrous</b> <b>webs</b> by passing hot-air flow through them, mostly in collaboration with North Carolina State University, are reported. Models developed provide an essential tool for more efficient process, product and machine design. 4. 	Finally, this short section reports various other textile engineering research including the use of pulse lasers to fuse false-twist textured yarns to impart fused nodes (nips), the fibre opening, straightening and transportation using high-speed air flow in the open-end spinning process, and the design, development and construction of a novel circular warp knitting machine.
