Initially, {{some of the}}m thought the gunshots were firecrackers or part of the music. A recently discharged Marine veteran who was working as a bouncer immediately recognized the sounds as gunfire from a high-caliber gun, jumped over a locked door—behind which dozens of people were hidden and paralyzed by fear—and opened a latched door behind them that allowed about 70 people to escape. Many described a scene of panic and confusion caused by the loud music and darkness. One person shielded herself by hiding inside a bathroom and covering herself with bodies. A bartender said she took cover beneath the <b>glass</b> <b>bar.</b> At least one patron tried to help those who were hit.

It {{was found that}} the Zr-based metallic <b>glass</b> <b>bars</b> have a tendency to buckle elastically or plastically rather than to yield or fracture if its slenderness ratio is over a critical value. The elastic buckling undermines the intrinsic strength of the metallic glass, but the plastic buckling imparts the metallic glass a benign failure mode and avoids the catastrophic brittle fracture. The phenomena are understood by the unique stress state across the bar. The result has implication for the measurement of mechanical properties of bulk metallic glasses and is of significance in the application of metallic glass members in engineering structures.

5000|$|A slide, (neck of a bottle, {{knife blade}} or round metal or <b>glass</b> <b>bar</b> or cylinder) {{is used in}} blues and rock to create a {{glissando}} or [...] "Hawaiian" [...] effect. The slide is used to fret notes on the neck, instead of using the fretting hand's fingers. The characteristic use of the slide is to move up to the intended pitch by, as the name implies, sliding up the neck to the desired note. The necks of bottles were often used in blues and country music as improvised slides. Modern slides are constructed of glass, plastic, ceramic, chrome, brass or steel bars or cylinders, depending on the weight and tone desired (and {{the amount of money}} a guitarist can spend). An instrument that is played exclusively in this manner (using a metal bar) is called a steel guitar or pedal steel. Slide playing to this day is very popular in blues music and country music. Some slide players use a so-called Dobro guitar. Some performers who have become famous for playing slide are Robert Johnson, Elmore James, Ry Cooder, George Harrison, Bonnie Raitt, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman, Muddy Waters, Rory Gallagher, and George Thorogood.|$|E

The lobby on the ground floor greets visitors entering or exiting the building. Entering the ticketing gate, travelers can take the escalators or stairs to the waiting areas on the second floor. Two waiting areas for passengers that lead to the northbound and southbound trains are connected by an air bridge. Two escalators and one stairway take passengers to the platforms. There are ten emergency exits around the platforms.To avoid directional confusion, two arch walls in the lobby are erected to break the symmetry. These two walls are designed by well- known artists with themes of “The Past” and “The Future”The Past wall is designed by Taiwanese artist Tsai Ken.

This type of sensor was investigated on a laboratory stand and on an electrical power line which included conductor where the high intensity electric current flow.
