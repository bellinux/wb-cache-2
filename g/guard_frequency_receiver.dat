It {{is based on}} charge sampling and hybrid filter bank techniques. The charge sampling method is employed to design analog bandpass filters. Using a hybrid filter bank for wide-band analog-to-digital conversion improves the speed and resolution of the conversion.

40|$|Additional thesis - To improve weather monitoring, local near-real time weather {{forecasts}} {{and climate}} monitoring, a dense network of sensors {{should be set}} up. As shown already in the 1990 s, GPS is a promising measurement device to form a dense network for meteorology observation. Because of economic reasons, a network of dual <b>frequency</b> GPS <b>receivers</b> is densified using low-cost single <b>frequency</b> GPS <b>receivers.</b> In this thesis and the complementary thesis written by E. M. J. Stierman (2016), respectively, {{the quality of the}} Tropospheric Zenith delay and the Precipiatble Water Vapour recordings that are estimated using the single <b>frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> in the network are investigated. To do this, two networks of small (< 10 km) spacing and large (30 - 90 km) spacing have been set-up. After this, a L 2 - and C 2 -measurement is generated for the single <b>frequency</b> <b>receivers,</b> using epoch-differenced ionospheric delay for L 2 and regular ionospheric delay for the C 2 measurement together with the L 1 and C 1 observations of the single frequencyreceiver. This is done {{to be able to use}} web-based PPP processing software of NRCan, that estimates the ZTD for dual frequency data. The single frequency GPS show a ZTD that is much more variable in time than the ZTD found by dual frequency measurements. Secondly, the standard deviation to which the single frequency measurements converge is about 5 cm. It takes about half a day to obtain this precision. For comparison; the dual <b>frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> obtain a standard deviation well below 1 cm in less than 2. 5 hours. The results show this processing method for single <b>frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> is not good enough to obtain an accurate and precise measurement of the ZTD. Further research could be done on taking the correlation between the made observation and generated observations into account, using other processing methods, for instance double differences, or improving this processing method.

40|$|Additional thesis - Precipitation and {{especially}} rainfall {{are very important}} for the world’s population. It has its positive and negative side like providing water and contrary causing floods. Therefore it is of utmost importance to make clear and accurate weather predictions. The revolution of GPS in the last few decades gave a new opportunity in doing atmospheric science. Many researches have been focused on atmospheric science using GPS in Europe and North America. This research gives a better insight in the precipitable water vapour in the atmosphere above Uganda. Besides weather prediction the results of this report could be used for climate studies in Africa. Together with the research of A. M. Koning 2016 the accuracy of the to be determined zenith tropospheric delay and the precipitable water vapour in Uganda’s atmosphere was determined. This study was done during the months September and October of year 2016 in the surroundings of Kampala. To obtain the precipitable water vapour, 3 measurement rounds were done. All three networks were spanned by 3 dual <b>frequency</b> GPS <b>receivers</b> densified with at least 5 single <b>frequency</b> GPS <b>receivers.</b> The ionospheric delays measured with the dual <b>frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> were interpolated to the single <b>frequency</b> GPS <b>receivers</b> so these were transformed into dual <b>frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> as well. Thereafter, the RINEX files were uploaded on the PPP NRCan application where the zenith tropospheric delay was determined. Using the constant of proportionality found by Bevis 1994 together with Saastamoinen’s model to determine the zenith hydrostatic delay, the precipitable water vapour was found.

The ionospheric distortion of the C/A code (1. 023 Mbps), and P code (10. 23 Mbps) may be too small to measure.
