40|$|Purpose: Aluminium-doped {{zinc oxide}} thin films exhibit {{interesting}} optoelectronic properties, which make them suitable for fabrication of photovoltaic cell, flat panel <b>display</b> <b>electrode,</b> etc. It {{has been shown}} that aluminium dopant concentration and annealing treatment in reduced atmosphere are the major factors affecting the electrical and optical properties of aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) film. Here, the authors report the structural, optical and electrical properties of aluminium-doped zinc oxide thin films fabricated by dip coating technique and annealed in air atmosphere, thereby avoiding hazardous environments such as hydrogen. The aim of this paper was to systematically investigate the effect of annealing temperature on the electrical properties of dip-coated film. Design/methodology/approach: Aluminium-doped ZnO thin films were prepared on corning substrates by dip coating method. Aluminium concentration in the film varied from 0. 8 to 1. 4 mol per cent. Films have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy and Hall measurements. The deposited films were heat treated at 450 - 600 °C, in steps of 50 °C for 1 h in air to study the improvement in electrical properties. Films were also prepared by annealing at 600 °C in air for durations of 1, 2, 4 and 6 h. Envelope method was used to calculate the variation of the refractive index and extinction coefficient with wavelength. Findings: The electrical resistivity is found to decrease considerably when the annealing time is increased from 1 to 4 h. The films exhibited high transmittance (> 90 per cent) in the visible range, and the optical band gaps were found to change as per the Moss–Burstien effect, and this was consistent with the observed changes in the carrier concentration. Originality/value: The study shows the effect of annealing in air, avoiding hazardous reduced environment, such as hydrogen, to study the improvement in electrical and optical properties of aluminum-doped zinc oxide films. Envelope method was used to calculate the variation of optical constants with wavelength...|$|E

This way, the surface roughness of the ITO could be reduced with an only 45 nm thick ATO coating to Rpv = 3. 8 nm (Ra = 0. 4 nm) compared to 31 nm (3. 8 nm) for the ITO substrate. Another benefit of such additional coating is the possibility to tailor surface properties of the electrodes in wide ranges.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the electro-mechanical reliability and characterisation of ITO coated polyester substrates for use in touch screen and flexible display applications. Flexible display anode components such as ITO coated polyesters are common in almost all flexible display technologies. However, these hybrid thin systems are unusual in mechanical terms. There is a mismatch between the mechanical properties of the inorganic coating and the organic substrate. It is therefore important to investigate the electromechanical response of such flexible anodes under various stress states and deformation modes. It is also important to develop new mechanical testing techniques for flexible displays. Numerous experimental techniques were used in order to characterise and test the available ITO coated/uncoated PET and PEN substrates. Also, the development of new experimental mechanical testing methods, such as the biaxial 'bulge' apparatus, was undertaken. During this work, various ITO coated polyester substrates were mechanically tested under uniaxial tension, controlled buckling and biaxial tension. In-situ electrical resistance monitoring and ex-situ atomic force microscopy, were used in order to detect and characterise ITO failure mechanisms. Tribological investigation of bare polyester substrates was undertaken. Preliminary nanoscratch and nanoindentation studies were also conducted on coated and uncoated systems. Overall it was shown that ITO coated polyester flexible <b>display</b> <b>electrodes</b> can properly function up to relatively low strains. Electrical resistance generally does not recover during unloading in cyclic experiments. These factors currently limit the use of such components to slightly curbed displays. Various ITO failure modes were observed, depending on the applied deformation mode. It was also shown, that the ITO adhesive failure is as critical as cohesive failure...|$|R
