50|$|First {{developed}} in 1952 {{under the name}} Pirelli Cintura, taking the name Cinturato in 1963, the tyre was composed {{of two or three}} carcass plies of cords laid at an angle of 90 degrees to the beads, and a belt of several plies laid circumferentially under the tread. Without a belt, the 90-degree plies would produce a casing which would greatly increase its sectional height on inflation. The belt, being inextensible, prevented the casing increasing in height when inflated, and the inflated tyre maintained almost the same dimensions as in the mould in which it went through vulcanisation. The belt was kept under tension, and the tread retained its <b>flatter</b> <b>profile</b> even when the tyre was inflated.|$|E

30|$|On the one hand, {{the ability}} to select <b>flattering</b> <b>profile</b> images may be {{hindered}} by an impaired ability to view one’s own face accurately (e.g., White et al., 2015) and in an overly optimistic light (Epley & Whitchurch, 2008). This evidence leads to the prediction that people would select better photographs for strangers. On the other hand, this ability may be enhanced by people’s expertise in selecting flattering online photographs of themselves (Hancock & Toma, 2009) and in self-presentation more generally (e.g., Goffman, 1959; Leary & Allen, 2011; Schlenker, 2003).

50|$|Promoters of the {{new line}} predict that it would about double rail traffic on the Modane {{corridor}} compared to the reference scenario (without the construction {{of the new}} line). It should be noted that traffic predictions for major rail infrastructures are intrinsically uncertain, with well-known examples of both overestimates (e.g. the Channel tunnel) and underestimates (e.g. the TGV Est) of even the early traffic.Anyway, not all the experts agree on the necessity for a new line connecting France and Italy on the Modane corridor, since the old line has wide margins for increase in traffic. Rather than as a natural consequence of faster transit times and a lower price for freight shipping (due to reduced energy use thanks to a much <b>flatter</b> <b>profile,</b> but without necessarily taking into account the full construction cost of the new line), rail traffic could also be increased by coupling additional renovation of the existing rail infrastructure with sufficiently high financial incentives for rail transport and/or sufficiently heavy tolls and taxes on road transport. The political realism of such taxes is however questionable, as demonstrated by the 2013 violent protests against a trucking ecotax in France. The construction of a brand-new line will on the other hand make the older infrastructure fully available for regional and suburban services, which is an important consideration near the congested Turin node. It will also allow higher safety standards.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{results are}} {{reported}} on the maximum achievable H-mode density and the behavior of pedestal density and central density peaking as this limit is approached. The maximum achievable H-mode density roughly scales as the Greenwald density, though a dependence on B-t is clearly observed.

5000|$|The {{railroad}} bridged the North Platte River over a 2600 ft {{bridge at}} North Platte, Nebraska, in December 1866 after completing about 240 mi of track that year. In late 1866, General Grenville M.

The North Platte/South Pass route was popular with wagon trains but not attractive to the railroad, for it was about 150 mi longer and much more expensive to construct up the narrow, steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{clustering}} properties of metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as traced by 619 CIV, 81 SiIV, N >= 10 ^ 12 cm^- 2 and 316 MgII, and 82 FeII N >= 10 ^ 11. 5 cm^- 2 absorption components in 19 high signal-to-noise (60 - 100 per pixel), high resolution (R = 45000) quasar spectra. Over the redshift range probed (1. 5 - 3. 0), CIV and SiIV trace each other closely and their line-of-sight correlation functions exhibit a steep decline at large separations and a <b>flatter</b> <b>profile</b> below ~ 150 km s^- 1, {{with a large}} overall bias. These features do not depend on column depth. Carrying out a detailed SPH simulation (2 X 320 ^ 3, 57 Mpc^ 3 comoving), we show that this behavior can not be reproduced by models in which the IGM metallicity is constant or a local function of density. However, the CIV correlation function {{is consistent with a}} model in which metals are confined within bubbles with a typical radius Rs = 2 comoving Mpc about sources of mass >= Ms = 10 ^ 12 solar masses at z= 3. Our lower redshift (0. 5 - 2) measurements of the MgII and FeII correlation functions also uncover a steep decline at large separations and a <b>flatter</b> <b>profile</b> at small separations, but the clustering is even higher, and the turn-over is shifted to ~ 75 km s^- 1. Again these features do not change with column depth. We describe an analytical bubble model for these species, which come from regions that are too compact to be simulated numerically, deriving best-fit values of R_s ~ 2. 4 Mpc and M_s ~ 10 ^ 12 solar masses. Equally good fits to all four species are found in a similarly biased high-redshift enrichment model in which metals are placed within 2. 4 comoving Mpc of 3 x 10 ^ 9 solar mass sources at z = 7. 5.

To improve its performance, a new flat torus of elliptic type method concentrating on the solution to flat TC was put forward, and four {{torque converters}} of different flatness ratios were designed to judge the superiority of the flat torus design method. The internal flow characteristics were numerically investigated using CFD codes and resulted in good agreement with experimental data. The results indicate that the main cause of this performance degradation can be attributed to deterioration of the velocity fields of the pump, and a case of flatness ratio 0. 8 illustrates the reason that the performance designed by the flat torus design method based on the elliptic shape is more excellent than that of the traditional one.

30|$|During the nanofluid {{flow through}} the channel, {{migration}} of the nanoparticles and clustering due to non-uniform shear rate across the channel's cross section affect the heat transfer performance. Taking into account the increase in thermal conductivity of the nanofluid, other factors such as chaotic movement of nanoparticles, Brownian motion, and particles' migration {{must also be considered}} in the interpretation of heat transfer performance of nanofluids [35]. An increase in the volume fraction of the nanoparticles intensifies the interaction and collision of the nanoparticles. Also, diffusion and relative movement of these particles near the channel walls lead to the rapid heat transfer from the walls to the nanofluid. In other words, increasing the concentration of the nanoparticles intensifies the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced heat transfer. Moreover, at high flow rates, the dispersion effects and chaotic movement of the nanoparticles intensify the mixing fluctuations and change the temperature profile to a <b>flatter</b> <b>profile</b> similar to turbulent flow and cause an increase in the heat-transfer coefficient. At low flow rates, clustering and agglomeration of nanoparticles may exist in the nanofluid flow, and therefore, at a low Re, a lower heat transfer enhancement can be observed.|$|E
