25|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} impedance in AC circuit is justified by {{the fact that there are}} two additional impeding mechanisms to be taken into account besides the normal resistance of DC circuits: the induction of voltages in conductors self-induced by the magnetic fields of currents (inductance), and the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>storage</b> of charge induced by voltages between conductors (capacitance). The impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as reactance and forms the imaginary part of complex impedance whereas resistance forms the real part.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} charge stored per unit voltage in an {{electrochemical}} capacitor {{is primarily a}} function of the electrode size. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>storage</b> of energy in the double-layers is linear with respect to the stored charge, and correspond to the concentration of the adsorbed ions. Also, while charge in conventional capacitors is transferred via electrons, capacitance in double-layer capacitors is related to the limited moving speed of ions in the electrolyte and the resistive porous structure of the electrodes. Since no chemical changes take place within the electrode or electrolyte, charging and discharging electric double-layers in principle is unlimited.

30|$|Depending on {{different}} storage principles, supercapacitors {{can be divided}} into two categories: double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (or redox supercapacitors). The former relies on <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>storage</b> at the interface between electrode and electrolyte, which are usually composed of carbon based materials. The latter class of supercapacitors is based on a fast and reversible redox reaction to store charge and is mostly prominent in transition metal oxides and conducting polymers [1, 5, 6]. To date, RuO 2 {{is believed to be the}} most outstanding material for high electrochemical performance. However, its high cost and toxicity restrict its large-scale industrial applications [7, 8]. Therefore, the exploration of inexpensive and eco-friendly transition metal oxides to replace RuO 2 for electrochemical energy storage applications is a topic of great debate.|$|R

We performed the search for an optimal multiwell trapping potential for electrons that results in the maximum static palarizability of the system. The response of the heterostructure is modeled quantum mechanically using nonlocal linear response theory. Three main design strategies are identified, which lead to the maximization of the stored energy. We found that the efficiency of each strategy crucially depends on the temperature and the broadening of electron levels. The energy density for optimized heterostructures can exceed the nonoptimized value by a factor more than $ 400 $.

In operation at a temperature of ~ 6 K, the detector is characterised by a high dynamic range, combining a low dark event rate with good high-rate particle counting capability. On-line measurement of the pulse height distributions proved to be an important monitor of the detector response at low temperature. Statistical pulse-height analysis allows to infer the particle detection efficiency of the detector, which {{has been found to be}} close to unity also in cryogenic operation at 6 K.

40|$|AbstractThe {{absorption}} spectra of two photoactive yellow protein model chromophores have been measured in vacuum using an <b>electrostatic</b> ion <b>storage</b> ring. The absorption {{spectrum of the}} isolated chromophore is an important reference for deducing {{the influence of the}} protein environment on the electronic energy levels of the chromophore and separating the intrinsic properties of the chromophore from properties induced by the protein environment. In vacuum the deprotonated trans-thiophenyl-p-coumarate model chromophore has an absorption maximum at 460 nm, whereas the photoactive yellow protein absorbs maximally at 446 nm. The protein environment thus only slightly blue-shifts the absorption. In contrast, the absorption of the model chromophore in aqueous solution is significantly blue-shifted (Î»max= 395 nm). A deprotonated trans-p-coumaric acid has also been studied to elucidate the effect of thioester formation and phenol deprotonation.

A mechanical and magnetic system is laid out for implementing this ultra-low energy beam at the CSR. A new electron and ion beam merging scheme is developed and analyzed by numeric magnetic field and particle track calculations. The design concept of cryogen-filled HTS magnets was developed. For this purpose a prototype magnet was manufactured and tested under realistic operating conditions.

Two independent electron facilities (cooler and target) allow to separate cooling of the ion beam from target operation {{improving the quality of}} electron and ion beams. In addition a strong gain in the resolution was achieved with a help of a cryogenic photoelecron source providing dc electron currents up to 0. 5 mA with an emission energy spread of about 10 meV. In first recombination measurements at the target, performed on HD +, H 3 + and Sc 18 +, low energy resonant structures at milli-eV collision energies revealed unprecedented low transverse and longitudinal electron temperatures of about 0. 5 meV and 0. 025 meV, respectively.

40|$|We {{report on}} the first storage of ion beams in the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment, DESIREE, at Stockholm University.

The ion beams were accelerated to 10 keV kinetic energy and stored in an <b>electrostatic</b> ion <b>storage</b> ring enclosed in a vacuum chamber at 13 K. For 10 keV C- 2 (-) molecular anions we measure the residual-gas limited beam storage lifetime to be 448 s +/- 18 s with two independent detector systems. Using the measured storage lifetimes we estimate that the residual gas pressure is in the 10 (- 14) mbar range. When high current ion beams are injected, the number of stored particles does not follow a single exponential decay law {{as would be expected}} for stored particles lost solely due to electron detachment in collision with the residual-gas. Instead, we observe a faster initial decay rate, which we ascribe to the effect of the space charge of the ion beam on the storage capacity. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

Ion storage in ASTRID dominated in the early 90s, with many successful experiments storing both positive and negative ions ranging in mass from 1 (hydrogen atom) to 840 (carbon 70 cluster). Meanwhile, the synchrotron radiation based research at ISA was expanding, and by 1995 ASTRID was operated 50% of the time in ion storage mode and 50% for synchrotron radiation. With the construction of the <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Storage</b> Ring for Ions (ELISA) in 1998, and an increasing demand for synchrotron radiation (by 2000 there were 7 beamlines on ASTRID using the light source), the ion storage runs were gradually reduced, until finally in 2005 ASTRID operated in ion storage mode for the last time. Since then ASTRID has been operating in electron storage mode producing synchrotron radiation throughout the year, with 3 or 4 electron runs, separated by shutdown periods for maintenance and development of the ring.|$|E

The ring was designed with a closed ion beam orbit of about 2. 9 m, where the ion beam is guided entirely by electrostatic components. The vacuum {{chamber of the}} ring is cooled using a liquid-He-free cooling system to 4. 2 K with a temperature difference of 0. 4 K at most within all the positions measured by calibrated silicon diode sensors. The first cryogenic operation with a 15 -keV Ne+ beam was successfully performed in August 2014. During the measurement, the Ne+ beam was stored under a ring temperature of 4. 2 K with a residual-gas lifetime of more than 10 min.

If ions were first excited by the pump, an increased yield of neutral products caused by the absorption of red light was measured in a microchannel plate detector located on the other side of the ring. This implies that it is possible to pick out ions that were photoexcited by the pump pulse and to spectroscopically characterize these ions.
