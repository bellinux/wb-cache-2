25|$|Opening {{statements}} {{began on}} January 10. During this hearing, witness testimony began. Three soldiers in Graner's unit testified; {{the first was}} Specialist Matthew Wisdom, who first reported the situation at Abu Ghraib. Wisdom said that Graner had enjoyed beating inmates (saying that he <b>had</b> <b>laughed,</b> whistled, and sung) and {{was the one who}} first thought of arranging the prisoners in naked human pyramids and other positions. On this day the Military Judge, Michael Hunter, banned any further reporting of the hearing.|$|E
25|$|At No Mercy, Big Show {{defeated}} Eddie Guerrero for the United States Championship {{and then}} formed {{an alliance with}} the then WWE Champion Brock Lesnar. He was eliminated by Chris Benoit at the Royal Rumble in 2004. Big Show abandoned a departing Lesnar immediately before WrestleMania XX. At the pay-per-view, Big Show lost the United States Championship to John Cena. On the April 15, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, Big Show promised to quit if he failed to defeat Eddie Guerrero that night. He lost to Guerrero after Guerrero performed a Frog Splash, and, believing that Torrie Wilson <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> at him for losing, upended her car and threatened to throw her off a ledge. Then General Manager of SmackDown! Kurt Angle ascended the ledge to try to talk some reason into Big Show, but he chokeslammed Angle off the ledge, kayfabe concussing him and breaking his leg, as well as causing the back of Angle's head to bleed. After the show, Big Show was neither seen nor heard from on WWE television for months.|$|E

25|$|Fielding's {{theatrical}} {{output of}} 1730–1 {{shows that the}} assumption of the Scriblerian persona may have had an opportunist character. Though Fielding was happy to share {{in some of the}} fame and power of Pope and Swift at their peak, and to borrow some of their themes and techniques, he never agreed wholeheartedly with their cultural or political aims. In his poetry of the period Fielding distanced himself from the Toryism and misanthropy of Pope, and {{it has been suggested that}} the surface affiliation of The Tragedy of Tragedies with the writing of the Scriblerus Club masks real antipathy. However, Fielding's use of the Scriblerus name doesn't seem to have been resented by its creators. Swift reportedly praised Fielding as a wit, saying that he <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> only twice in his life, the second instance being the Circumstance of Tom Thumb's killing the Ghost in the quick accumulation of corpses that closes the play. Pope may have echoed Fielding in the expanded four-book Dunciad of 1743 which suggests memories of Fielding's The Author's Farce in some of the methods it uses to satirise the garish culture of the time.|$|E

500|$|While campaigning on 28 October for the {{forthcoming}} Glasgow North East by-election on 22 November, Griffin was {{asked why he}} <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> on Question Time. He replied: [...] "I had thought that David Dimbleby would have the professional self-respect to at least make a show of being fair.

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{withdrew the}} testimony of Dr. Marvin Lynch, the other examining doctor, as [...] "repetitive." [...] Many years later, Judge Horton said that Dr. Lynch confided that the women had not been raped and <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> when he examined them. He {{said that if he}} testified for the defense, his practice in Jackson County would be over. Thinking Patterson would be acquitted, Judge Horton did not force Dr. Lynch to testify, but the judge had become convinced the defendants were innocent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), as Abraham {{was sitting in}} the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre {{in the heat of the}} day, he looked up and saw God in the form of three men. [...] He ran, bowed to the ground, and welcomed them. Abraham offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, and they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, ran to select a choice calf for a servant-boy to prepare, set curds and milk and the calf before them, and waited on them under the tree as they ate. One of the visitors told Abraham that he would return the next year, and Sarah would have a son, but Sarah laughed to herself at the prospect, with Abraham so old. God then questioned Abraham why Sarah <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> at bearing a child at her age, noting that nothing was too wondrous for God. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|Johan Derksen {{claimed in}} VI that Cambuur had paid {{a large sum}} of money to keep Oeki Hoekema from being suspended. According to Derksen Vlaardingen player and chief witness of the case Herman den Haag had {{received}} a few banknotes for the trouble {{out of the hands}} of a Cambuur official whilst on the toilet. De Volkskrant wanted to get to the bottom of it and called KNVB official Van Zon, who stated he <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> very hard when he heard the claims. [...] "Money handed out on the toilet? How did he come up with that? I have seen it with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{learning}} of his death, Dahmer's mother Joyce Flint responded angrily to the media: [...] "Now is everybody happy? Now that he's bludgeoned to death, {{is that good}} enough for everyone?" [...] The response of the families of Dahmer's victims was mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death. The district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, noting that Dahmer's death was still murder. On May 15, 1995, Scarver was sentenced to two additional terms of life imprisonment for the murders of Dahmer and Anderson. Although Scarver had confessed in 1994 to having concealed the weapon used to kill Dahmer and Anderson in his clothing {{on the morning of}} the murders, in 2015 he publicly stated the murders of Dahmer and Anderson had resulted from a confrontation in which one of the two men had poked him (Scarver) in the back as the three had begun their assigned work detail. In this renewed account of events, Scarver claimed that the two <b>had</b> <b>laughed</b> at him when he had turned around in response before Dahmer and Anderson each walked to separate rooms to begin their cleaning duty, with Scarver following Dahmer toward the staff locker room.|$|E
