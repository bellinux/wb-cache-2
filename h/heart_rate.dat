5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
30|$|Once data {{reduction}} was complete, {{the differences between}} the average <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of each segment and the baseline <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated. This procedure helps eliminate individual differences in <b>heart</b> <b>rates,</b> as the difference between the <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of each segment and the baseline <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> becomes a unit of analysis (Wise et al. 2008). The changes in <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Mean comparisons were made for perceived trust and purchase intention. Simple regression analyses were conducted for the effect of perceived trust on purchase intention.|$|R

50|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>rates</b> {{considered}} bradycardic vary by species; for example, in {{the common}} housecat, a rate of under 120 beats per minute is abnormal. Generally, smaller species have higher <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> while larger species have lower rates.|$|R

5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect the <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{slows down}} {{to one or two}} beats a minute, and blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E
40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Stress {{echocardiography}} {{could be}} a useful diagnostic test in horses suspected to suffer from exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction {{as a cause of}} exercise intolerance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of treadmill exercise and pharmacological stress test on left ventricular echocardiographic parameters. METHODS: Echocardiography was performed in 2 groups of 5 healthy horses, either immediately after a near-maximal treadmill exercise (Group EXE) or during a pharmacological challenge (Group DOB) consisting of 35 microg/kg atropine, followed by incremental dobutamine infusion rates of 2 - 6 microg/kg bwt/min for 5 min duration each, which led to a cumulative dobutamine dose of 100 microg/kg. Left ventricular M-mode parameters were compared at rest and at <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 80, 100, 110, 120 130, and 140 beats/min, within each group. RESULTS: In 2 horses of Group EXE, echocardiographic measurements were impossible at 140 and 130 beats/min, as their <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> dropped too fast in the immediate post exercise period. In the remaining 3 horses image quality was not always satisfactory at <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 130 and 140 beats/min. Systolic left ventricular parameters and fractional shortening measured at 130 and 140 beats/min were significantly different from values obtained at lower <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> Horses in Group DOB reached expected <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 80 and 100 beats/min, after the administration of atropine and during a dobutamine infusion rate of 2 microg/kg bwt/min, respectively. <b>Heart</b> <b>rates</b> targets of 110, 120, 130, and 140 beats/min were reached at mean (+/- s. d.) dobutamine infusion rates of 2. 8 +/- 0. 4, 3. 2 +/- 0. 4, 4. 0 +/- 0. 7, 5 +/- 0. 7 microg/kg bwt/min, respectively. Systolic left ventricular parameters and fractional shortening at <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 110, 120, 130, and 140 beats/min, were significantly different from values obtained at lower <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> CONCLUSION: The pharmacological stress test induced changes in ventricular dimensions at <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 80 to 140 beats/min. Using this test, high quality images can easily be obtained at <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 140 beats/min. Conversely, in post exercise echocardiography, obtaining good quality images at <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 130 and 140 beats/min is difficult, which limits use of the technique in routine clinical settings. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Further studies should demonstrate the potential of pharmacological stress test as a diagnostic tool in horses suffering from exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction.

50|$|Class III {{antiarrhythmic}} agents exhibit reverse use-dependent prolongation of {{the action}} potential duration (Reverse use-dependence). This means that the refractoriness of the ventricular myocyte increases at lower <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> This increases the susceptibility of the myocardium to Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs) at low <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> Antiarrhythmic agents that exhibit reverse use-dependence are more efficacious at preventing a tachyarrhythmia than converting someone into normal sinus rhythm. Because of the reverse use-dependence of class III agents, at low <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> class III antiarrhythmic agents may paradoxically be more arrhythmogenic.|$|R

5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> Therefore, continuous observation of the <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E

50|$|Like {{all other}} class I {{antiarrhythmic}} agents, quinidine primarily works by blocking the fast inward sodium current (INa). Quinidine's effect on INa {{is known as}} a 'use dependent block'. This means at higher <b>heart</b> <b>rates,</b> the block increases, while at lower <b>heart</b> <b>rates,</b> the block decreases. The effect of blocking the fast inward sodium current causes the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential to decrease (decreased Vmax).|$|R
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
