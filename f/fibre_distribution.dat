Simultaneously with CFD simulations and with experimental data, the non-dimensional rotational dispersion coefficient has been determined for the extended 1 D headbox model. Furthermore the behavior of turbulence generating vanes types, i. e. blunt and tapered, and the location of such has been studied. For different streamlines in the contracting channel, the one dimensional <b>fibre</b> orientation <b>distribution</b> model is solved, and the <b>fibre</b> orientation <b>distribution</b> is studied along streamlines near the vane wall and vane tip and further away. The model reveals the effect of the vane tip and the wall boundary layer on <b>fibre</b> orientation <b>distribution.</b> The boundary layer will for both in the plane of paper and in the plane of contraction wider the <b>fibre</b> orientation <b>distributions,</b> i. e the fibres will be less oriented.

40|$|International audienceInjection molding {{is widely}} used to process short fibre {{reinforced}} thermoplastics. The quality and especially the mechanical properties of the resulting part {{are linked to the}} mold conception (for example the gate(s) and the venting port(s) locations) and to the processing parameters which will govern <b>fibre</b> orientation <b>distribution.</b> <b>Fibre</b> orientation modelling is based on the well known Folgar and Tucker equation. The models differ one from another by the interaction parameter, the closure approximation and by the coupling with the rheology of the reinforced melt. Quantitative comparison with experiments is very tedious and generally limited to simple part geometries (plaque or disk). As a consequence, in complex geometries, <b>fibre</b> orientation <b>distribution</b> is experimentally checked using several techniques and the resulting anisotropic thermo-mechanical properties are computed using various homogenization theories. In this paper, we propose a first integrated approach of the injection molding of fibre reinforced thermoplastics starting from rheology of the material, orientation equation, interaction parameter and closure approximation. The resulting local <b>fibre</b> orientation <b>distribution</b> is then used in two ways in order to predict the mechanical properties of the part: first, using classical analytical homogenization theories, but based on the computed orientation tensor and not on an experimental one, and then, using numerical homogenization which consists in generating a Representative Elementary Volume (REV), determining its unidirectional mechanical properties and finally, in computing directly the anisotropic properties of the part...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for environmentally friendly materials has {{ushered in a}} new generation of bio plastics and plant fibre based composite materials. The quality of the raw components is very important when manufacturing a bio based material. For example, many plant fibres are hygroscopic, which means that moisture becomes an important quality determining factor. Therefore, a better understanding and knowledge of moisture adsorption equilibrium is of importance. The moisture adsorption equilibrium of several different plant fibres is examined in paper I. Differences in moisture adsorption equilibrium was found between unretted and retted hemp fibres, while differences between varieties were small. An example of a renewable composite material, investigated in this thesis, is a wheat gluten plastic reinforced with hemp fibres. Paper II shows the effect of hemp fibre reinforcement on the mechanical properties of a wheat gluten based plastic film. Different fibre contents and fibre quality levels were tested. It was found that the fibres did improve the mechanical properties of the plastic and that fibre content was {{the most important factor in}} creating a stronger material. However, there were problems encountered with regards to <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> in the material, poor adhesion between the fibres and plastic and a large variation in the material properties. In paper III, we attempted to improve the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> by using a high speed grinder to mix the fibres and the plastic. Further a diamine was used as a cross linker between the fibres and the plastic to improve the bonding. It was found that the grinder did improve the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> but not sufficiently to avoid clusters of fibres. The diamine did not improve the interaction between the fibres and the plastic but it did strengthen the plastic itself to a certain degree. It is concluded that hemp fibres can be used to improve the mechanical properties of wheat gluten plastics. However, the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> and interaction with the plastic needs to be much improved. A possible solution for the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> problem might be to decrease the viscosity if the wheat gluten dough while the fibre-plastic interaction might be improved by selecting a different cross linking substance...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} {{the dependence of}} mechanical properties in composite laminates on the fibre architecture. The objective is to characterise the mechanical properties of composite plates while varying the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> but keeping the constituent materials unchanged. Image analysis and fractal dimension {{have been used to}} quantify <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> and resin-rich volumes (RRV) and to correlate these with the mechanical properties of the fibre-reinforced composites. The formation, shape and size of RRV in composites with different fabric architectures is discussed. The majority of studies in literatures show a negative effect of the RRV on the mechanical behaviour of composite materials. RRV arise primarily as a result of (a) the clustering of fibres as bundles in textiles, (b) the stacking sequence, and/ or stacking process, (c) the resin properties and flow characteristics, (d) the heating rate as this directly affects viscosity and (e) the consolidation pressure. Woven glass and carbon/epoxy fabric composites were manufactured either by the infusion or the resin transfer moulding (RTM) process. The fractal dimension (D) has been employed to explore the correlation between fabric architecture and mechanical properties (in glass or/ carbon fibre reinforced composites with different weave styles and fibre volume fraction). The fractal dimension was determined using optical microscopy images and ImageJ with FracLac software, and the D has been correlated with the flexural modulus, ultimate flexural strength (UFS), interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and the fatigue properties of the woven carbon/epoxy fabric composites. The present study also considers the dependence of fatigue properties in composite laminates on static properties and fibre architecture. Four-point flexural fatigue test was conducted under load control, at sinusoidal frequency of 10 Hz with amplitude control. Using a stress ratio (R=σmin/σmax) of 0. 1 for the tension side and 10 for the compression side, specimens were subjected to maximum fatigue stresses of 95 % to 82. 5 % step 2. 5 % of the ultimate flexural strength (UFS). The fatigue data were correlated with the static properties and the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution,</b> in order to obtain a useful general description of the laminate behaviour under flexural fatigue load. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique was applied to the results obtained to identify statistically the significance of the correlations. Composite strength and ILSS show a clear dependence on the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> quantified using D. For the carbon fabric architectures considered in this study, the fatigue properties of composite laminates have significant correlations with the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution</b> and the static properties of the laminates. The loss of 5 - 6 % in the flexural modulus of composite laminates indicates an increasing risk of failure of the composite laminates under fatigue loads. The endurance limits, based on either the static properties or the <b>fibre</b> <b>distribution,</b> were inversely proportional to the strength for all laminates.

Design/methodology/approach: The experiments have been performed using transient thermography to obtain the thermograms for CFRP and neat resin specimens. From recorded thermograms, the thermal diffusivity values were determined for all materials under investigation and for two different preheating conditions to verify the effect of preheating conditions on obtained results. Findings: It was found from obtained results that composites with different carbon fibre content had different values of thermal diffusivity. Relationship showed that the thermal diffusivity was a linear function of fibre content in considered materials. It was also found from investigated neat resin specimens that the thermal diffusivity measurement was affected by specimen thickness. Research limitations/implications: Developed relationships between thermal diffusivity and carbon fibre content is not generalized for all types of CFRP composites (manufactured using a different technology or of different thickness), such specific relationships should be determined for any other composite.
