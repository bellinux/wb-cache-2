40|$|It is {{difficult}} to accurately reckon vehicle position for vehicle navigation system (VNS) during GPS outages, a novel prediction algorithm of dead reckon (<b>DR)</b> <b>position</b> error is put forward, which based on Bayesian regularization back-propagation (BRBP) neural network. DR, GPS position data are first de-noised and compared at different stationary wavelet transformation (SWT) decomposition level, and <b>DR</b> <b>position</b> error data are acquired after the SWT coefficients differences are reconstructed. A neural network to mimic position error property is trained with back-propagation algorithm, and the algorithm is improved for improving its generalization by Bayesian regularization theory. During GPS outages, the established prediction algorithm predictes <b>DR</b> <b>position</b> errors, and provides precise position for VNS through <b>DR</b> <b>position</b> error data updating <b>DR</b> <b>position</b> data. The simulation results show the positioning precision of the BRBP algorithm is best among the presented prediction algorithms such as simple DR and adaptive linear network, and a precise mathematical model of navigation sensors isn’t established...|$|E
40|$|To make driving {{easier and}} safer, modern {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} driver support systems. Some of these systems, for example navigation or curvature warning systems, need the global position of the vehicle. To determine this position, the Global Positioning System (GPS) or a Dead Reckoning (DR) system can be used. However, these systems have often certain drawbacks. For example, DR systems suffer from error growth with time and GPS signal masking can occur. By integrating the <b>DR</b> <b>position</b> and the GPS position, the complementary characteristics of these two systems can be used advantageously. In this thesis, low cost in-vehicle sensors (gyroscope and speedometer) are used to perform DR and the GPS receiver used has a low update frequency. The two systems are integrated with an extended Kalman filter in order to estimate a position. The evaluation of the implemented positioning algorithmshows {{that the system is}} able to give an estimated position in the horizontal plane with a relatively high update frequency and with the accuracy of the GPS receiver used. Furthermore, it is shown that the system can handle GPS signal masking for a period of time. In order to increase the performance of a positioning system, map matching can be added. The idea with map matching is to compare the estimated trajectory of a vehicle with roads stored in a map data base, and the best match is chosen as the position of the vehicle. In this thesis, a simple off-line map matching algorithm is implemented and added to the positioning system. The evaluation shows that the algorithm is able to distinguish roads with different direction of travel from each other and handle off-road driving...|$|E
40|$|Now GPS {{has been}} widely used for land, sea and air navigation. However, due to signal {{blockage}} and severe multipath environments in urban areas, such as in Hong Kong, GPS alone can not satisfy most land vehicle navigation requirements. Dead Reckoning (DR) systems {{have been widely used}} to bridge the gaps of GPS and to smooth GPS position errors. However, the DR drift errors increase with time rapidly and frequent calibration is required. Under the normal situation, GPS is sufficient to provide the calibration to the DR unit. However, GPS may not be available in urban areas for more than 20 min, and the <b>DR</b> <b>position</b> errors can reach hundreds of meters during the period. As land vehicles have to be on roads, digital map can be used to constrain the locations of vehicles, known as map-matching. One of the main problems for map-matching techniques is mis-matching, that may be caused by the positioning sensor errors and the complexity of city road network. In this paper, a newly developed model to tightly integrate digital map and in-vehicle positioning unit for car navigation is introduced. With this method, it improves the position accuracy by constraining the vehicle location on the roads. Moreover it provides the close-loop controls for the DR drift errors by feeding back the coordinates of the feature points of the road network and road bearings to the DR unit and therefore the navigation system can be used for longer period when GPS is not available. Extensive tests have been carried out in Hong Kong. It demonstrates that this close-loop approach is much better on the reliability of map-matching, as the positioning sensor errors are constantly calibrated by the digital map.

Methods: we examined IFN-gamma ELISpot responses to a panel of 218 HIV clade B consensus-based HIV protease-reverse transcriptase peptides, designed to mimic previously described and predicted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes overlapping drug resistance (<b>DR)</b> <b>positions,</b> that either included the consensus sequence or the DR variant sequence, in 49 ART-naïve HIV-infected individuals. Next generation sequencing was used to assess the presence of minority DR variants in circulating viral populations. Results: although a wide spectrum of differential magnitudes of response to DR vs. WT peptide pairs was observed, responses to DR peptides were frequent and strong in the study cohort. No difference between the median magnitudes of response to DR vs. WT peptides was observed. Interestingly, of the 22 peptides that were recognized by > 15 % of the participants, two-thirds (64 %) corresponded to DR peptides. When analysing responses per peptide pair per individual, responses to only WT (median 4 pairs/individual) or DR (median 6 pairs/individual) were more common than responses to both WT and DR (median 2 pairs/individual; p< 0. 001). While the presence of ELISpot responses to WT peptides was frequently associated with the presence of the corresponding peptide sequence in the patient's virus (mean 68 % of cases), responses to DR peptides were generally not associated with the presence of DR mutations in the viral population, even at low frequencies (mean 1. 4 % of cases; p = 0. 0002). Conclusions: our data suggests that DR peptides are frequently immunogenic and raises the potential benefit of broadening the antigens included in a therapeutic vaccine approach to immunogenic epitopes containing common DR sequences.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{positions of}} the Gaia first data release (DR 1) secondary data set at its faint limit with CCD positions of stars in 20 fields observed with the VLT/FORS 2 camera. The FORS 2 position uncertainties are smaller than one milli-arcsecond (mas) and allowed us to perform an independent verification of the DR 1 astrometric precision. In the fields that we observed with FORS 2, we projected the Gaia <b>DR</b> 1 <b>positions</b> into the CCD plane, performed a polynomial fit between {{the two sets of}} matching stars, and carried out statistical analyses of the residuals in positions. The residual RMS roughly matches the expectations given by the Gaia DR 1 uncertainties, where we identified three regimes in terms of Gaia DR 1 precision: for G = 17 - 20 stars we found that the formal <b>DR</b> 1 <b>position</b> uncertainties of stars with DR 1 precisions in the range of 0. 5 - 5 mas are underestimated by 63 +/- 5 %, whereas the DR 1 uncertainties of stars in the range 7 - 10 mas are overestimated by a factor of two. For the best-measured and generally brighter G = 16 - 18 stars with DR 1 positional uncertainties of < 0. 5 mas, we detected 0. 44 +/- 0. 13 mas excess noise in the residual RMS, whose origin can be in both FORS 2 and Gaia DR 1. By adopting Gaia DR 1 as the absolute reference frame we refined the pixel scale determination of FORS 2, leading to minor updates to the parallaxes of 20 ultracool dwarfs that we published previously. We also updated the FORS 2 absolute parallax of the Luhman 16 binary brown dwarf system to 501. 42 +/- 0. 11 masComment: 7 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in A&A on August 1, 201...|$|R
