Charette; but he has been {{fighting}} against the republicans this long time, even before Cathelineau began, I believe, though I don't exactly know where. I know he was made a prisoner in Paris, and nearly killed there by some of those bloody-minded rebels; then he escaped, and he was at the siege of Machecoult, and got honourably wounded, and was left for dead: and then he was at Thouars--no, not at Thouars; we heard he was coming, but he didn't come; but he was at Fontenay, and that's where I first saw him. M. Bonchamps brought him in and introduced him to M. de Lescure, and our M. Larochejaquelin, and I was astonished to see how much they made of him, for he was dressed just as he is now, and had no sword or anything. Well, as soon as he came in they all went to work talking, and settling how Fontenay was to be attacked, for though <b>its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> place, and not walled and fortified like Saumur, we had a deal of trouble with it; but before a word was spoken, M. d'Elbée stood up and said, 'Brethren,' said he, 'let us ask the assistance of our Saviour:' so down they went on their knees, and he said an awful long prayer, {{for all the world like}} a priest. And then again before we fired a shot, he bade all the soldiers kneel down, and down we went, the republicans firing at us all the time. The soldiers call him Old Providence, for they say he talks a deal about Providence when he is fighting." ...|$|E
6000|$|It wasn't {{either that}} John Bancroft tossed {{the ball of}} talk--which but for the {{presence}} of the supremely retentive agent just commemorated would have appeared on occasion to remain in his keeping by a preference, on its own part, not to be outwitted; this more or less at all times too, but especially during the first weeks of his dawning on us straight out of Germany and France, flushed with the alarm, as one might have read it, of having to justify rare opportunities and account for the time he had inordinately, obscurely, or at least not a little mysteriously, spent--the implication of every inch of him being that he had spent it seriously. Odd enough it certainly was that we should have been appointed to unveil, so far as we might, a pair of such marked monuments to modesty, marble statues, as they might have been, {{on either side of the}} portal of talk; what I at any rate preserve of my immediate vision of Bancroft--whose very promptest identity indeed had been his sonship to the eminent historian of our country and earlier and later diplomatist--was an opposition, trying to me rather than engaging as its like had been in the composition of Vanderpool, between what we somehow wanted from him (or what I at least did) and what we too scantly gathered. This excellent friend, as he was later on to become, with his handsome high head, large colourable brow and eyes widely divided--brave contribution ever to a fine countenance--sat there in a sort of glory of experience which, had he been capable of anything so akin to a demonstration, he would have appeared all unsociably to repudiate. It was bruited of him that, like John La Farge, whose friend he was admiringly to become--for he too had a Newport connection--he [...] "painted," [...] that is persisted (which was the wondrous thing!) in painting; and that this practice had grown upon him in France, where, en province, his brother had entirely taken root and where the whole art-life, as well as the rural life, of the country had been opened to him; besides <b>its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later coming to light that he had romantically practised at Dusseldorf, where too he had personally known and tremendously liked George du Maurier, whose first so distinguished appearances as an illustrator had already engaged our fondest attention--were they most dawningly in the early Cornhill, or in Punch, or in Once a Week? They glimmer upon me, darkly and richly, as from the pages of the last named. Not to be rendered, I may again parenthesise, our little thrilled awareness, William's and mine, though mine indeed but panting after his, of such peeping phenomena of the European day as the outbreak of a [...] "new man" [...] upon our yearning view of the field of letters and of the arts. I am moved to wonder at how we came by it, shifting all for ourselves, and with the parental flair, so far as the sensibility of home was concerned, turned but to directions of its own and much less restless on the whole than ours. More touching to me now than I can say, at all events, this recapture of the hour at which Du Maurier, consecrated to much later, to then still far-off intimate affection, became the new man so significantly as to make a great importance of John Bancroft's news of him, which already bore, among many marvels, upon the supreme wonder of his working, as he was all his life bravely to work, under impaired and gravely menaced eyesight. When I speak, as just above, of what, through so many veils, [...] "came to light," [...] I should further add, I use a figure representing a considerable lapse of time and shading off, for full evocation, into more associations than I can here make place for. Nothing in this connection came soon to light at least but that endless amazement might lie in the strange facts of difference between our companion and his distinguished sire--the latter so supremely, so quaintly yet so brilliantly, social a figure, I apprehended, when gaped at, a still more angular, but more polished and pacific Don Quixote, on the sleekest of Rosinantes, with white-tipped chin protrusive, with high sharp elbows raised and long straight legs beautifully pointed, all after the gallantest fashion, against the clear sunset sky of old Newport cavalcades. Mr. Bancroft the elder, the [...] "great," [...] was a comfort, that is a fine high identity, a cluster of strong accents, the sort of thing one's vision followed, in the light of history, if not of mere misguided fancy, for illustration of conceived type--type, say in this case, of superior person of the ancient and the more or less alien public order, the world of affairs transacted at courts and chancelleries, in which renown, one had gathered from the perusal of memoirs, allowed for much development of detail and much incision of outline, when not even directly resting on them. As it had been a positive bliss to me that words and names might prove in extremity sources of support, so it comes back to me that I had drawn mystic strength from just obscurely sighing [...] "Metternich!" [...] or [...] "Talleyrand!" [...] as Mr. Bancroft bounced by me--so far as a pair of widely-opened compasses might bounce--in the August gloaming. The value of which, for reflection, moreover, was not in the least in its being that if his son remained so long pleadingly inscrutable any derived Metternich suggestion had contributed to keep him so--for quite there was the curiosity of the case, that among the imputations John appeared most to repudiate was that of having at any moment breathed the air either of records or of protocols. If he persisted in painting for years after his return to America without, as the legend grew, the smallest disclosure of his work or confession of his progress to human eye or ear, he drew the rigour of this course wholly from his singleness of nature, in the aftertime to be so much approved to us. However, I pause before the aftertime, into the lap of which more than one sort of stored soundness and sweetness was to fall from him drop by drop.|$|E

Mark Edward Nero of About.com said Round 2 is a well-sung, well-written, well-produced album, but the one negative is that <b>its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bland and leans too much on love songs. Slavik Nathan of DJBooth.net stated Round 2 finds Holiday shifting away from Lac’s harder-edged image in favor of a smoother sound, resulting in a well-crafted album that shows that while Holiday’s got a ways to go before he reaches elite status, no one {{will ever be able to}} call him a one-hit wonder again.|$|E

He called the selected tracks [...] "illuminative if rarely breathtaking" [...] and felt theyll [...] "likely yield most listeners a discovery or two". He gave the album 7.2 out of 10. However, Drowned in Sounds Michaela Annot was lesser pleased, saying that the compilation [...] "favours the sort of soft-house-electro simplicity favoured by indieists everywhere". She felt that though [...] "it lacks conherency, flow and form", it made the album [...] "even more endearing". She thought that, [...] "overall, <b>its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too anodyne and pleasant", yet had her qualms; [...] "a sneaking suspicion too, that Snow Patrol dont listen to this stuff [...] " [...] She graded the album 6 out of 10.|$|E

Lavigne described the album as being about how we all go through difficult experiences, whether it’s ending a relationship, losing a job, or just missing someone. She stated, [...] "Its so {{easy for me to}} do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and write honestly about something thats really close to me, something Ive been through, its a totally different thing." [...] The album serves as a return to Lavignes older musical style and is largely acoustic. With the exception of the albums lead single, Lavigne describes the songs on the album as different from her earlier material, [...] "Im older now, so I think that comes across in my music, its not as pop-rock and <b>its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more mellow and its deep". She said, [...] "For this record, I just really, really wanted to sing.... I just wanna have silence around me, and have these acoustic songs and really deliver." [...] For Adam R.

We didnt do a red carpet, we just did a friends and family screening on the eve of its release. I even bought drinks at my own premiere! Its generated warmth but I think - are we allowed to say things like its a peculiarly British film? It feels different? <b>Its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit quirky? Its got an intentional DIY feel to it? Its meant to be like that. I think maybe thats something people have picked up on. Superhero films arent so much our cultural history, but we do that kind of comedy really well. I hope that what weve done is something thats wearing its learning on its sleeve.

5000|$|A {{distinguished}} female contract {{killer in}} the world of assassins, and a former acquaintance of John. About the character of Ms. Perkins, Palicki said, [...] "Ms. Perkins is what you think the quintessential assassin would be. She’s cold, heartless, conniving, badass and I think that she has fun with what she does. She enjoys it. I think that she’d clearly do it for a dollar. Ultimately in the film she’s doing it for four million, so <b>its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different." [...] Originally the character of Perkins was envisioned as a man, but the decision was reversed during a brainstorming session and the desire to create [...] "an authentic female action character." [...] Leitch stated, [...] "You believe this woman could come in and give John Wick a run for his money," [...] so Stahelski, Leitch and Iwanyk changed it and offered the role to Palicki. Palicki spoke most highly of working with Reeves and the inclusion of stunt work on her part, to which she stated, [...] "Chad wanted to make sure I would be willing to do my own stuff in the huge fight sequence that I have with Keanu—and I was all game." [...] Palicki spent months of training learning Judo and Jujutsu. After the films release Palicki revealed background information, [...] "I also think we talked about a backstory. Its likely Perkins and Wick had a history as well, before his marriage. She may have a personal vendetta as well as the money. I think theres an enjoyment on multiple levels." [...] On what she hopes for with regard to the fan response, [...] "Its a lot of fun. Theyre going to want to see what happens next. Most importantly, I hope they’re rooting for John Wick the way that I did when I read the script." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{historian}} Frances Titchener {{has given}} a stylized description of the context of Caesars pronouncement: [...] "We know from journals that Caesar is not taking this lightly. He knows that if he marches on Rome with his armies, then he is a public enemy, {{and that he will}} either have to win, or die. For a Roman patrician like Julius Caesar there is no life without military service; there is no life without service to the state. He cannot simply go native and stay in Gaul, and he does realise that if he goes back to Rome, he would be killed. At this time the northernmost border of the Roman territory in Italy is the River Rubicon. Once someone crosses the River Rubicon, hes in Roman territory. A general must not cross that boundary with his army [...] - [...] he must do what the Romans call lay down his command, which means surrender his right to order troops, and certainly not be carrying weapons. Caesar and his armies hesitate quite a while at this river while Caesar decides what to do, and Caesar tells us that he informs his soldiers that <b>its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tiny bridge across the river, but once they cross it theyll have to fight their way all the way to Rome, and Caesar is well aware that hes risking not just his own life, but those of his loyal soldiers, and he might not win. Pompey is a formidable enemy. Its also impossible to avoid the fact that Caesar was attacking the state, and as a patrician Roman this would have been very difficult for him, equivalent to beating up your father. He wouldnt have done any of this lightly. Finally he makes a decision, its time to go, and he uses a gambling metaphor: he says Roll the dice, Alea jacta est. Once the dice start rolling they cannot be controlled, even though we dont know what it is as the dice roll and tumble. Julius and his men swiftly cross the river and they march double time toward Rome, where they almost beat the messengers sent to inform the Senate of their arrival." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess thats {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. Were in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. <b>Its</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) cant fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
