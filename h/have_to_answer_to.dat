5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, {{although there is no}} evidence that Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E

500|$|The SCLC {{decided that}} {{economic}} pressure on Birmingham businesses {{would be more}} effective than pressure on politicians, a lesson learned in Albany as few blacks were registered to vote in 1962. In the spring of 1963, before Easter, the Birmingham boycott intensified during the second-busiest shopping season of the year. Pastors urged their congregations to avoid shopping in Birmingham stores in the downtown district. For six weeks supporters of the boycott patrolled the downtown area to make sure blacks were not patronizing stores that promoted or tolerated segregation. If black shoppers were found in these stores, organizers confronted them and shamed them into participating in the boycott. Shuttlesworth recalled a woman whose $15 hat ($ in [...] ) was destroyed by boycott enforcers. Campaign participant Joe Dickson recalled, [...] "We had to go under strict surveillance. We had to tell people, say look: if you go downtown and buy something, you're going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> us." [...] After several business owners in Birmingham took down [...] "white only" [...] and [...] "colored only" [...] signs, Commissioner Connor told business owners that if they did not obey the segregation ordinances, they would lose their business licenses.|$|E

2500|$|DeLay {{was accused}} of {{endorsing}} violence {{in the wake of}} a series of high-profile violent crimes and death threats against judges when he said, [...] "The men responsible [...] will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> their behavior". DeLay's comments came soon after the February 28, 2005, homicide of the mother and husband of Chicago Judge Joan Lefkow, and the March 11, 2005, killing of Atlanta Judge Rowland Barnes. DeLay's opponents accused him of rationalizing violence against judges when their decisions were unpopular with the public. Ralph Neas, President of People for the American Way, said that DeLay's comments were [...] "irresponsible and could be seen by some as justifying inexcusable conduct against our courts".|$|E

"It {{does not}} become anyone to drop a word of doubt here and there that shall work like poison in other minds, shaking their {{confidence}} in the messages which God has given, which have aided in laying the foundation of this work, and have attended it to the present day, in reproofs, warnings, corrections, and encouragements. To all who have {{stood in the way}} of the Testimonies, I would say, God has given a message to His people, and His voice will be heard, whether you hear or forbear. Your opposition has not hindered me; but you must give an account to the God of heaven, who has sent these warnings and instructions to keep His people in the right way.

[...] "I saw the state of some who stood on present truth, but disregarded the visions,--the way God had chosen to teach in some cases, those who erred from Bible truth. I saw that in striking against the visions they did not strike against the worm--the feeble instrument that God spake through--but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a small thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose to show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until they would find it out too late." ...|$|E
