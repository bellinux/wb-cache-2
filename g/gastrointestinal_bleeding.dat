5|$|When {{taken with}} NSAIDS (non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} medications), warfarin {{increases the risk}} for <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> This increased risk {{is due to the}} anti-platelet effect of NSAIDS as well as the possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding,</b> were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pharmacogenetics}} of naproxen {{has been}} studied {{in an effort to}} better understand its adverse effects. In 1998, a small pharmacokinetic (PK) study failed to show that differences in a patient's ability to clear naproxen from the body could account for differences in a patient's risk of experiencing the adverse effect of a serious <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> while taking naproxen. However, the study failed to account for differences in the activity of CYP2C9, an drug metabolizing enzyme responsible for clearing naproxen. Studies on the relationship between CYP2C9 genotype and NSAID-induced <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeds</b> have shown that genetic variants in CYP2C9 that reduce the clearance of major CYP2C9 substrates (like naproxen) increase the risk of NSAID-induced <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeds,</b> especially for homozygous defective variants.|$|R
40|$|Combination of aspirin, {{clopidogrel}} and enoxaparin {{remains the}} standard treatment for {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) but is known to increase the incidence of upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> (UGIB).

5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding,</b> kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E

5|$|The toxins {{found in}} Galerina marginata {{are known as}} amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide {{derivatives}} composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding,</b> a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} {{clinical}} syndromes: upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> and lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> About 2/3 of all GI bleeds are from upper sources and 1/3 from lower sources. Common causes of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> include infections, cancers, vascular disorders, adverse effects of medications, and blood clotting disorders. Obscure <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> (OGIB) is when a source is unclear following investigation.|$|E
25|$|Upper <b>{{gastrointestinal}}</b> <b>bleeding</b> is <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> in {{the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, commonly defined as bleeding arising from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Blood may be observed in vomit (hematemesis) or in altered form in the stool (melena). Depending on {{the severity of the}} blood loss, there may be symptoms of insufficient circulating blood volume and shock. As a result, upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> is considered a medical emergency and typically requires hospital care for urgent diagnosis and treatment. Upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> can be caused by peptic ulcers, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, and some rarer causes such as gastric cancer.|$|E

25|$|Lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> is {{typically}} from the colon, rectum or anus. Common causes of lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> include hemorrhoids, cancer, angiodysplasia, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and aortoenteric fistula. It may be {{indicated by the}} passage of fresh red blood rectally, especially {{in the absence of}} bloody vomiting.

40|$|Abstract Background Isolated splenic vein {{thrombosis}} with left sided portal hypertension {{is a rare}} cause of upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed.</b> Diagnosis is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in patients presenting with <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> {{in the presence of}} splenomegaly and normal liver function tests. Case presentation A 64 year old male presented with haematemesis and melaena. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of antral erosions in the stomach and fundal varices. A computerised tomography scan of abdomen confirmed the presence of a diaphragmatic tear and the spleen to be lying in the left hemi thorax. The appearances of the splenic vein on the scan were consistent with thrombosis. Conclusion Left sided portal hypertension as a result of isolated splenic {{vein thrombosis}} secondary to trauma is rare. The unusual presentation of our case, splenic herniation into the left hemithorax, causing fundal varices leading to upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> 28 years after the penetrating injury, makes this case most interesting. We believe that this has not been reported in literature before. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Some {{people who}} suffer an upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> or {{perforation}} die. The mortality rate was estimated at 12 % in studies published before 1997, but a systematic survey of more recent data is needed. Better treatment {{is likely to have}} reduced mortality. An estimate of mortality is helpful in explaining to patients the risks of therapy, especially with NSAIDs. Methods A systematic review of studies published before 1997, and between 1997 and 2008. Any study architecture was acceptable if it reported on cases who died from any cause of upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> or perforation. Analyses were conducted separately for all cases, and those prescribed NSAID or aspirin. Results Information was available for 61, 067 cases (81 % published since 1997) of whom 5, 001 died. The mortality rate in all cases fell significantly, from 11. 6 % (95 % confidence interval, 11. 0 to 12. 2) in pre- 1997 studies to 7. 4 % (7. 2 to 7. 6) in those published since 1997. In 5, 526 patients taking NSAID or aspirin, mortality increased, from 14. 7 % (13. 6 to 15. 8) before 1997 to 20. 9 % (18. 8 to 22. 9) since 1997. Conclusion Upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> or perforation still carries a finite risk of death. Differences in study architecture, population characteristics, risk factors, definition of mortality, and reporting of outcomes impose limitations on interpreting effect size. Data published since 1997 suggest that mortality in patients suffering from an upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> or perforation has fallen to 1 in 13 overall, but remains higher at about 1 in 5 in those exposed to NSAID or aspirin. </p...|$|R

50|$|The stool of {{a person}} with a lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> is a good (but not infallible) {{indication}} of where the bleeding is occurring. Black tarry appearing stools medically referred to as melena usually indicates blood that has been in the GI tract for at least 8 hours. Melena is four-times more likely to come from an upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>bleed</b> than from the lower GI tract; however, it can also occur in either the duodenum and jejunum, and occasionally the portions of the small intestine and proximal colon. Bright red stool, called hematochezia, is the sign of a fast moving active GI bleed. The bright red or maroon color is due to the short time taken from the site of the bleed and the exiting at the anus. The presence of hematochezia is six-times greater in a LGIB than with a UGIB.|$|R
