5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove <b>deeper</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} {{criterion for}} connected and intelligent learning spaces is “unobtrusive technology.” (Sesink 2007, p. 3). This {{is where the}} potential of IoT technologies unfolds, for these miniaturized objects can generally be integrated inconspicuously into architecture and room equipment like furniture. In summary, {{it can be said}} that the Internet of Things is making <b>deeper</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> inroads <b>into</b> everyday (office) life. Initial studies have also substantiated its positive effects on teaching and learning processes. For example, Gomez et al. (2013) worked with QR codes and enhanced physical learning objects with digital information that learners retrieve via QR code scanners. With this relatively simple method, the authors were able to connect the physical and virtual worlds and enrich analog learning content with multimedia (Gómez et al., 2013). Another study has shown that automated control of external factors such as lighting, heating and cooling has a positive effect on learning processes (Uzelac et al. 2015). However, considering the possibilities inherent in the IoT, the empirical research is clearly still in its infancy.|$|R

60|$|Section 7. The ovum next {{begins to}} divide. A furrow cutting <b>deeper</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> divides it <b>into</b> two; another follows {{at right angles}} to this, making the two four, and another {{equatorial}} furrow cuts off the animal pole from the yolk or vegetative pole. (See Sheet 22, Figures 1, 2, and 3.) And so segmentation (= cleavage) proceeds, and, at last, a hollow sphere, the blastosphere (Figure 4) is formed, with a segmentation cavity (s.c.). But, {{because of the presence of}} the yolk at the vegetative pole of ovum, and of the mechanical resistance it offers to the force of segmentation, the protoplasm there is not nearly so finely divided-- the cells, that is to say, are much larger than at the animal pole. The blastosphere of the frog is like what the blastosphere of amphioxus would be, if the future hypoblast cells were enormously larger through their protoplasm being diluted with yolk.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{dynamics}} of the synaptic transmission can ultimately determine the communication between neurons. We have <b>deeper</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> insight <b>into</b> the physiological mechanisms of paired pulse facilitation and depression and their effects on synaptic plasticity, {{as well as the}} spike frequency adaptation. Considering the fact that LTP and LTD is not symmetric to the presynaptic activity we have to calculate the interactions of pre- and postsynaptic spike sequences. To understand the genuine role of these processes in the neural signal transmission, we formulate simple models to simulate their actions. This way we could make qualitative estimations on the model neuron's input-output properties. We examined the transmission of two parameters: the mean and standard deviation of synaptic currents. Our results indicate that the measured effects of long-term potentiation on the {{dynamics of}} synaptic transmission can not be considered as synaptic weight change at the biological relevant activity level, regarding the transfer of membrane currents mean, and so the transfer of firing rate. Other known facts, as the relatively low firing rate, spike frequency adaptation, big spike frequency variability, make the simple firing rate code less appropriate for longer period simulation of real neurons, as it is assumed in the majority of artificial neural network models (ANN). Nonetheless, the other examined parameter, the standard deviation of synaptic currents, which is closely related to the inter-spike-interval variation, behaves like the firing rate in typical ANN models. Considering the fact that LTP and LTD is not symmetric to the presynaptic activity we have to calculate the interactions of pre- and postsynaptic spike sequences. The formation and possible operation of this type of "code " is discussed. ...|$|R
60|$|Days passed. Every other {{afternoon}} and night he spent hours with Bessy Bell, {{and found a}} mounting happiness in the change in her, a <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> ever <b>deeper</b> insight <b>into</b> the causes that had developed her. The balance of his waking hours, which were many, he passed on the streets, in the ice cream parlors and confectionery dens, at the motion-picture theatres. He went many and odd times to Colonel Pepper's apartment, and took a peep into the club-rooms. Some of these visits were fruitful, {{but he did not}} see whom he expected to see there. At night he haunted the parks, watching and listening. Often he hired a cheap car and drove it down the river highway, where he would note the cars he passed or met. Sometimes he would stop to get out and make one of his scouting detours, or he would follow a car to some distant roadhouse, or go to the outlying summer pavilions where popular dances were given. More than once, late at night, he was an unseen and unbidden guest at one of the gay bathing parties. Strange and startling incidents seemed to gravitate toward Lane. He might have been predestined for this accumulation of facts. How vain it seethed for wild young men and women to think they hid their tracks! Some trails could not be hidden.|$|R

500|$|After her miscarriage, much of {{the hostility}} from the family evaporates, with the {{exception}} of J.R. He openly despises her and her brother. In 1979, Pam is told by Digger's doctor that Digger was a carrier of neurofibromatosis, and that she and Cliff, as his children, were carriers; as neurofibromatosis is a potentially fatal disease to infants. Ironically, Pam soon discovers she is pregnant again. As before, however, tragedy strikes as a rattlesnake frightens Pam's horse when she is out riding and throws her, causing a second miscarriage. [...] In 1980, Pam watches Digger die slowly and painfully {{as a result of his}} decades of heavy drinking. On Digger's deathbed, he tells Pam that she's not his biological child, but born after an affair her mother had with Hutch McKinney. Overwhelmed by a sense of loss after Digger's death and deathbed confession, she pushes to find out more about what happened to her mother. She develops a notion – a dream born out of grief – that perhaps her mother isn't dead after all. Then a private investigator turns up evidence that her mother had not died as Digger had believed, but was alive in Houston. Meanwhile, Bobby has taken over Ewing Oil while J.R. is convalescing after being shot. Pam watches her husband get <b>deeper</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> the heart of business in an effort to prove himself, and takes note of Bobby's instinctive attraction to power, which she realizes might be a danger to their marriage.|$|E
500|$|Esther is {{introduced}} in press materials as being [...] "an innocent {{in a world}} of assassins, liars and zealots". Havins describes Drummond as [...] "an optimist and the glass is half full person". A promotional video released by Starz provided background information on Esther including her college education—the character introduces herself by stating that she has a BA in Linguistics and a Masters in Cognitive science. Series four writer Jane Espenson enjoyed writing for Esther as she felt the character to be most similar to herself. She notes that when devising Esther's backstory the writer's [...] "ended up just putting my college experience down." [...] Esther's introduction invites parallels that of lead female character Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) in the series' 2006 premiere episode [...] "Everything Changes"; she represents an audience surrogate for new American viewers. Havins refers to Esther as the [...] "tour guide" [...] for new viewers coming to Torchwood for the first time, one who is [...] "digging <b>deeper</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> the rabbit hole". Despite similarities to their introduction, Havins comments that Esther as a character has a less action-orientated role than Gwen, being more the [...] "techie" [...] of the team who uses her intellect and technology as her weapons. The actress feels that Esther's desk-bound analyst position is [...] "her safe little world". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies described Esther as [...] "a very healing force" [...] in helping the other more outspoken characters gel together as a team because she is [...] "much more able to empathise with people." [...] The character's sister, Sarah Drummond (Candace Brown), recurs throughout Miracle Day, Havins feels that her presence helps [...] "humanise the situation" [...] as including family members helps the audience [...] "understand why people react a certain way." [...] Espenson notes that the first scene between Esther and Sarah was discussed at length at the writer's room—the writers chose to make Esther's choice whether or not to refer her ill sister to social services [...] "as difficult as possible" [...] to heighten the pain felt by the character.|$|E

500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the engine, knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working. This summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg suddenly jumps out of the car unnoticed. Suddenly, they hear Greg's screams from the cornfield. The screams continue, until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield, unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride. The city becomes peaceful once more, as Greg's screams had scared the birds off forever, and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate, the cabbage woman.
