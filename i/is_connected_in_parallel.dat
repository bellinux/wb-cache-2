2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator <b>is</b> <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the design}} {{objectives}} of the instrument is to disturb the circuit {{as little as possible}} and so the instrument should draw a minimum of current to operate.

5000|$|Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power systems to counteract {{the effect of the}} line parasitic capacitance, thereby stabilizing the system voltage within acceptable limits. For short lines, we can basically ignore the impact of capacitive current from a voltage regulation point of view, but medium and long lines can have voltages at their receiving end much higher than the sending end, thus creating issues such as over-fluxing of power transformers and over stressing of line insulators. Under light-load conditions, the line produces more VARs, resulting in receiving end voltage being higher than sending end voltage. In order to consume the excess VARs when system is lightly loaded, an inductor is added to the system. Since inductors absorbs VARs, a reactor <b>is</b> <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> with shunt capacitance of the line known as Shunt Reactor, ...|$|E

5000|$|In this topology, the {{individual}} filters are connected in series, and a driver or driver combination <b>is</b> <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> with each filter. To understand the signal path {{in this type}} of crossover, refer to the [...] "Series Crossover" [...] figure, and consider a high frequency signal that, during a certain moment, has a positive voltage on the upper Input terminal compared to the lower Input terminal. The low pass filter (LPF) presents a high impedance to the signal, and the tweeter presents a low impedance; so the signal passes through the tweeter. The signal continues to the connection point between the woofer and the high pass filter (HPF). There, the HPF presents a low impedance to the signal, so the signal passes through the HPF, and appears at the lower Input terminal. A low frequency signal with a similar instantaneous voltage characteristic first passes through the LPF, then the woofer, and appears at the lower Input terminal.|$|E
