5|$|Bach used {{a rather}} unusual melody by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he based his later chorale cantata on this hymn on the melody by Jacob Regnart. The hymn <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> in a chorale fantasia, with string ritornellos between the verses.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|Cooper Anderson (Matt Bomer), Blaine's (Darren Criss) {{older brother}} and an actor in {{television}} ads, visits McKinley High and <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a celebrity by Blaine's boyfriend Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Sue. Blaine is unhappy, though, when after he and Cooper do an impromptu mashup of two Duran Duran songs in the choir room, Cooper finds fault with Blaine's singing. Sue recruits Cooper to give an acting master class for the club, which contains such bad advice that Blaine is appalled. Worse, Cooper subsequently criticizes Blaine's acting in a class scene.|$|E

5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's northern pintail. Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's pintail, A. a. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|Prostitutes {{were often}} {{hired by the}} hosts of symposia as {{entertainment}} for guests, as seen in red-figure vase paintings. Prostitutes were also drawn on drinking cups as pinups for male entertainment.

5|$|T. ludovicianus is {{traditionally}} placed {{within its own}} genus as its only representative of North America, but recent DNA work suggests it is closely allied with the Bewick's wren. A distinct population in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua, and in Guatemala <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a separate species, either known as Cabot's wren or white-browed wren (Thryothorus albinucha). It is considered a subspecies of T. ludovicianus by some authors, however.|$|E
5|$|This jay <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> {{a species}} of Least Concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , population which, while unsurveyed, {{is believed to be}} above 10,000 individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. However, the azure-hooded jay is uncommon in some parts of its range. It is also believed that deforestation may have an effect on this bird.|$|E

5|$|While {{the goddess}} is a mature sixteen-year old who has conquered her ego and awakened her kundalini, the attendants are {{described}} as spiritually immature twelve-year olds who are sustained on the goddess's blood and have not become liberated from the delusion of duality. In portrayals where the goddess's hair is tied like a matron and her attendants have free-flowing hair like young girls, the goddess <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a motherly figure of regal authority and power; the tied hair and headlessness represent contrasting ideas of controlled and uncontrolled nature, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Acacia pycnantha {{was first}} {{formally}} described by botanist George Bentham in the London Journal of Botany in 1842. The type specimen was {{collected by the}} explorer Thomas Mitchell in present-day northern Victoria between Pyramid Hill and the Loddon River. Bentham thought it was related to A. leiophylla, which he described in the same paper. The specific epithet pycnantha {{is derived from the}} Greek words pyknos (dense) and anthos (flowers), a reference to the dense cluster of flowers that make up the globular inflorescences. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma pycnanthum in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma. However, this name <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a synonym of its original name.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E

5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E

After losing to Sora and Shiro in a game of Shiritori, she becomes their slave, but <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an equal. She often provides magic or transportation necessities for the protagonists. Later on, she begins publishing novels based on Sora and Shiro which makes them famous among the flügels.

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} breeds in {{suitable}} habitats throughout northern Africa {{and through the}} Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding. In addition, there is some short-range movement, including martins from southern Arabia crossing the Red Sea and wintering alongside the local breeding birds in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, and non-breeding P. f. spatzi and P. f. presaharica joining rock martins in Mali and Mauritania. In Pakistan, the breeding range of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta overlaps {{with that of the}} dusky crag martin, although that species breeds at much lower levels, and in North Africa P. f. obsoleta occupies desert habitats whilst the Eurasian crag martin is found in the mountains. The pale crag martin has been recorded as a vagrant in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Sri Lanka, although its occurrence in the last country <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> unproven in a 2011 field guide. The martin has been claimed to visit Turkey, but this is also disputed.|$|E
50|$|The Mishnah (Zavim, 2, 1) {{says that}} Tumtum and Androgynos have both men's and women's Chumras, meaning that where {{the law is}} stricter towards men than women, they <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> men, but where the law is stricter towards women, they <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> women.|$|R
30|$|A {{thermodynamic}} inconsistency {{with the}} assumption that the liganded and unliganded forms of carrier can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> equivalent indistinguishable mobile components (Zhang and Han 2016 a) is that ligand binding is assumed to alter both the carrier affinity and mobility. This implies that the carrier consists of two differentiated mobile components.

If they do not have identical mobility, then they cannot <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a single thermodynamic component.|$|R
