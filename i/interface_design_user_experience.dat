Designer plays the conductive role between different groups of specialists of various competences and frames of reference (e. g. engineers, software developers, doctors, therapists etc.), and communities of individuals with particular characteristics (potential users or customers: patients, children, parents etc.), uniting them together as a productive multidisciplinary team and contributing knowledge of his own competence (product design, graphic design, <b>interface</b> <b>design,</b> <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> design, ergonomics etc.) In {{order to be able to}} organize, manage and be the valuable part of the project developing team, designer should inevitably become a multidisciplinary researcher as well. Answering the main research questions: How design can contribute to children’s neurological rehabilitation? Present research exposed the example of successfully developing multidisciplinary project on robotic rehabilitation system for Dysgraphia. In our case the therapeutic equipment for certain neurological disorder in a certain infant neuropsychiatric department is being brought to a new quality level. Consequently patient’s therapeutic experience is to become more pleasant and exciting, so the efficiency of rehabilitation process is being improved. Moreover our suggestion is that using our general guidelines of project development in this field would bring to similar positive results...|$|E

40|$|In online communities, {{numerous}} {{technical and}} social design decisions determine the social interaction space and affect the community participation. Social presence {{has been considered}} as a major design principle in computer-mediated communication. While most prior IS research adopts a uni-dimensional approach and restricts social presence to be the subjective nature of media, this research adopts a multi-dimensional approach (Shen and Khalifa 2007) to examine the online community design. Compared to uni-dimensional conceptualizations of presence/social presence, multi-dimensional conceptualizations can better capture the sense of social presence induced by both technical and social factors, and therefore entail more valuable implications for community design. The multi-dimensional approach also extends the developers 2 ̆ 7 impacts on online community, from <b>interface</b> <b>design</b> to <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>design.</b> Built upon the work by Shen and Khalifa (2007) and Ma and Agarwal (2007), this study examines the technological antecedents of social presence dimensions.

40|$|The thesis investigates a process-model of {{attitude}} {{formation in the}} context of information search in commercial websites. Contemporary research in social and consumer psychology is moving away from traditional functional and multi-attribute models {{of attitude}}, towards constructive theories and the notion of perceptual and heuristic information processing. The latter approach to attitude formation stresses the limitations of human working memory and perceptual sensitivity to stimuli, and therefore suggests that consumers are less likely to form and hold attitudes in memory toward an infinite number ofmundane objects. What this view proposes, is that attitudes are temporary evaluations, constructed 'on the spot' of a question from perceptually salient information in the context and are contingent on situational goals. Research in commercial website usage and re-visitation, complements this view of humans as perceptual and perhaps inaccurate information processors. A number of inter-related disciplines, namely usability research, human-computer interaction, information systems, and e-commerce research, are concerned with determining the optimal <b>interface</b> <b>design</b> for improving <b>user</b> <b>experiences,</b> in terms of task completion rates, user satisfaction with technology, technology adoption, and purchase behaviour. However, few research studies to date examine - in a systematic manner - the process by which consumers construct their attitudes towards commercial interfaces combining different levels of web design attributes. Due to the vastness of tools that marketers can choose from when <b>designing</b> their online <b>interface,</b> selecting stimuli that create an optimal context for information search on websites is crucial to website evaluation. In light of the above considerations, we synthesise a conceptual framework of consumer attitudes toward commercial websites, adopting a constructive viewpoint. In order to test our process-model of attitude formation in a natural, realistic setting, we conduct two webexperiments. Following theory and web-designers' insights, we manipulate three core design attributes, namely novelty in informative features, information layout on web pages, and interactivity in website navigation, and monitor the changes in consumers' perceptions of effort, attitudes, and intentions to use websites. In addition, in order to test for moderating effects of motivation, we manipulate search goals experimentally (undirected vs. directed information search). Finally, we assess the nuisance effects of relatively stable individual tendencies. Our first experiment (193 subjects) involves extreme manipulations of design, and results in large effects on consumer responses. Our second, large-scale experiment (676 subjects) involves refined manipulations of the same design attributes, and results in smaller-sized effects but significant interactions. Interpreted as a whole, our results support the contextual and temporary nature of attitudes towards commercial online interfaces, and are consistent with constructive perspectives on attitude formation. Regarding design attributes, absence of novelty in features and low interactivity in navigation have negative direct and combined effects on consumer responses. However, when the two attributes are manipulated unobtrusively, information layout is the sole influential design factor. Moreover, in both studies, individual design factors interact with participants' search goal, although participants involved in general search report consistently more favourable responses than those engaged in directed search. One of our major research contributions lies in the finding that attitudinal responses reflect a temporary evaluation of the context, which is shaped by the interactions of situational search goals and perceptually salient design aspects. Furthermore, responses to commercial websites are not explained by stable individual factors, although a number of these factors may have a direct impact on participants' responses. In accordance with these findings, we put forward a number of implications for marketers, web-designers, and academic researchers. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
