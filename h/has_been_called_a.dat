5|$|Lemoine is {{best known}} for his proof of the {{existence}} of the Lemoine point (or the symmedian point) of a triangle. Other mathematical work includes a system he called Géométrographie and a method which related algebraic expressions to geometric objects. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> co-founder of modern triangle geometry, as many of its characteristics are present in his work.|$|E
5|$|The Spirits Within debuted to mixed {{critical}} reception, but {{was widely}} praised for the realism of the computer-animated characters. Due to rising costs, the film greatly exceeded its original budget {{towards the end}} of production, reaching a final cost of $137 million, of which it recovered only $85 million at the box office. The film <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> box office bomb and is blamed for the demise of Square Pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> masterpiece {{depiction of}} a battle scene, and {{much more than a}} simple {{depiction of a}} bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E

5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been mistaken for a chanterelle, and hence it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> false chanterelle.|$|E
5|$|Drive <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature, {{extremely}} {{violent and}} very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. According to Refn, Drive {{turns into a}} superhero film during the elevator scene when The Driver kills the villain. Drive also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Other influences {{can be seen in}} the neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks"a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone". Drives title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by Risky Business (1983). Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of science of science policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E

5|$|Western {{developers}} {{began to}} return to the survival horror formula. The Thing from 2002 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> survival horror game, although it is distinct from other titles in the genre due to its emphasis on action, and the challenge of holding a team together. The 2004 title Doom 3 is sometimes categorized as survival horror, although it is considered an Americanized take on the genre due to the player's ability to directly confront monsters with weaponry. Thus, it is usually considered a first-person shooter with survival horror elements. Regardless, the genre's increased popularity led Western developers to incorporate horror elements into action games, rather than follow the Japanese survival style.|$|E
5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Stevens {{was twice}} named the Horizon League Coach of the Year and won collegeinsider.com's Hugh Durham Award mid-season honors in January 2009. He also {{was both a}} Hugh Durham Award and Jim Phelan Award finalist all three years of his career. Stevens <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> {{coaching}} prodigy and compared to John Wooden. He is married with two young children. In July 2013, he signed a six-year, 22-million-dollar contract to become the {{head coach of the}} Boston Celtics in the NBA. In April 2015, Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA Playoffs as the 7th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 40–42 record. In April 2016, Brad Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his tenure as the 5th seed in the 2016 NBA Playoffs finishing the season with a 48–34 record. On June 1, 2016, Stevens received a contract extension. In the 2016–17 season, Stevens' team finished with a laudable 53–29 record. It earned them the Atlantic Division title and placed them as the best overall team in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics then entered post-season play as the number one seed in their conference. Both the division title as well as the number one seeding are bests thus far for the Stevens' led Celtics' teams.|$|E
