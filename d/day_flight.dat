25|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Alibaruho {{expressed}} how pleased {{the teams}} {{on the ground}} were with the successful deployment of the arrays, and commended the crew on the deployment activities. Mission Management Team Chairman LeRoy Cain noted that the team {{was working on a}} revised timetable to allow critical experiment samples to return to earth safely. The samples need to be kept in a cold environment, and in the event weather delayed the landing, the team evaluated the best way to preserve the samples. The team approved a revised flight plan that allows Discovery to delay hatch closure and undocking slightly, to allow the samples to be kept inside the station's freezer longer, while still protecting the landing date of 28 March. Instead of closing the hatch the night before undocking, the hatch would be closed on the same <b>day,</b> <b>flight</b> day eleven.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent close {{co-operation}} between {{indigenous people}} and Z Force units makes the operation went smoothly as most Allied forces had been received warmly {{especially when they}} showing respect towards {{the tradition of the}} tribes. The fact was supported when another Liberator owned by the United States Air Force (USAF) was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft gun in Borneo, its crew members are rescued and hidden from the Japanese despite knowing the fact that if the Japanese discovering their acts, the entire tribes will be executed. Most of the Allied activities are conducted under two notable intelligence and guerrilla warfare operations towards the passage of liberation, namely Operation Agas for North Borneo and Operation Semut for Sarawak with some notable commando members including F. G. L. Chester, G. S. Carter, Jack Wong Sue, Jock McLaren and Roland Griffiths-Marsh. The Semut parties tried to gain intelligence about Japanese concentrations on the Brunei Bay to facilitate the landings of Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for the liberation mission in June 1945. Through these intelligence operations, almost 50% of Allied planes flying over Borneo had been shot down as Japanese fighter aircraft patrolled the sky throughout the day in addition for being crashed caused by unpredictable weather in the highlands and possibility of mechanical problems on a long <b>day</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
500|$|L.D. Cooper, {{a leather}} worker and Korean War veteran, was {{proposed}} {{as a suspect}} in July 2011 by his niece, Marla Cooper.

The next <b>day</b> <b>flight</b> 305 was hijacked; and though the uncles ostensibly were turkey hunting, L.D. Cooper came home wearing a bloody shirt—the result, he said, of an auto accident.

She also recalled that her uncle, who died in 1999, was obsessed with the Canadian comic book hero Dan Cooper (see Theories and conjectures), and [...] "had one of his comic books thumbtacked to his wall"—although he was not a skydiver or paratrooper.|$|E
50|$|During busy periods, {{outbound}} flights use the western runway for take-off, while inbound flights use the eastern runway for landing. Wind factors may cause numerous variations, but on most <b>days</b> <b>flights</b> will take {{off to the}} north and land from the south.|$|R

500|$|In May 1915, she sailed for the Dardanelles, {{carrying}} two Short Type 184 torpedo bombers, {{and arrived at}} Lesbos on 10 June. Her aircraft were mainly involved in spotting for ships providing naval gunfire support for troops ashore, although they also conducted reconnaissance missions of the area. On 11 August, one of these missions had spotted a Turkish ship off the north coast of the Sea of Marmora and, on the following <b>day,</b> <b>Flight</b> Commander Charles Edmonds attacked it flying a Short 184 seaplane. He left his observer behind and flew with a reduced fuel load to lighten his aircraft enough to carry a , [...] torpedo. He successfully dropped his aerial torpedo {{at a distance of}} about [...] and an altitude of [...] It turned out that his target had been beached after having been torpedoed by the British submarine [...] This was followed by a successful attack on 17 August against a [...] ship by Edmonds. Flight Lieutenant George Dacre accompanied Edmonds on his flight in his own aircraft, but suffered engine troubles and had to land in the Dardanelles. He was taxiing on the water when he encountered a large steam tugboat, which he promptly torpedoed. After taxiing for several miles he was able to get airborne again and was within gliding distance of Ben-my-Chree when his engine failed permanently.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{successful}} completion of Gemini 7, Collins {{was assigned to the}} prime crew of Gemini 10 with John Young, with White moving onto Apollo program. Their three-day mission called for them to rendezvous with two different Agena Target Vehicles, undertake two EVAs, and perform 15 different experiments. The training went smoothly, as the crew learned the intricacies of orbital rendezvous, controlling the Agena and, for Collins, EVA. For what was to be the fourth ever EVA, underwater training was not undertaken, mostly because Collins just did not have the time. To train to use the nitrogen gun he would use for propulsion, a super smooth metal surface {{about the size of a}} boxing ring was set up. He would stand on a circular pad that used gas jets to raise itself off the surface. Using the nitrogen gun he would practise propelling himself across the [...] "slippery table". For the three <b>day</b> <b>flight,</b> Collins received $24.00 in travel reimbursement.|$|E
