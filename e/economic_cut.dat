40|$|Developing {{tourism in}} an area {{represents}} the continuous process of planning and building tourist facilities, refurbishing and modernizing the existing ones, resizing them according to the types and sizes of tourist fluxes, shaping demand and offer, rendering a sustainable tourist activity. Perspective studies {{on the evolution of}} the phenomenon are necessary to design the tourist activity, following the insertion of the future area parameters into the decision models allowing them to be monitored and changed during the modelling process. Given the geographic really of space, the present study focuses on highlighting several indicators concerning tourism development {{in an area}} severely affected by <b>economic</b> <b>cut</b> backs, suggesting and also trying to monitor the social and economic effects tourism development could have upon. Besides determining the function of the territory, authors have conducted a diagnostic analysis which underlines the favourable factors of tourism, indicating, at the same time, the necessary measures to insure the best development. Thus, given the conditions of massive cut backs in the major economic sectors, the local development of tourism is of a crucial importance. As a key element of the sustainable development, tourism could provide new business and work places in the same time; it could determine the increase of incomes for the rural area habitants through the capitalization of local resources...|$|E
40|$|What ‘make(s) ’ a good teacher? A {{study of}} peer group {{mentoring}} as {{a practice of}} professional development. Keywords:	teachers’ continuing professional development, peer group mentoring, practice architectures, Foucault, power relations, democratic practices This thesis takes its departure from the on-going debate about teachers’ (collective) ‘continuing professional development’ (CPD). Teachers’ CPD through an imposed nine-step model of peer group mentoring (PGM) is focused on. The study draws on data from a {{two and a half}} yearlong interactive project that took place in a teacher team in a Swedish school. The general aim of the thesis is to study a practice of professional development in a teacher team involving peer group mentoring and to find out how and what kind of teachers’ expertise that is constructed. Furthermore, the aim is to examine how the PGM-practice was constrained and enabled and what kind of CPD was made possible. The theoretical and methodological framework is mainly based on practice theory. Practices and practitioners are seen as mutually inter-related. Practice architectures (Kemmis & Grootenboer, 2008) are used to uncover the relations between the PGM-practice and its historical, material-economic, social-political and cultural-discursive conditions. Furthermore, Foucault’s notion of power was adopted as an analytical tool to examine how power came into play during the mentoring sessions and how the teachers’ discursively con¬structed a ‘good teacher’ and teachers’ expertise. The metho¬do¬logical approach is action research. A main finding of the thesis is that professional and personnel develop¬ment may be imposed through peer group mentoring. Furthermore, democratic processes increased during the PGM-meetings and seemed {{to have an impact on}} classroom practice and the practice of parent-teacher meetings. The results show how the PGM–practice and its outcomes are deeply interconnected to global and local historical, material-economic, social-political and cultural-discursive arrangements which constrained and enabled it. When <b>economic</b> <b>cut</b> downs (i. e. material-economic arrangements) began to take effect in the local school, along with a neo-liberal discourse (i. e. cultural-discursive arrangements), democratic processes were challenged and threat¬ened. The focus in the PGM discussions shifted from the teachers’ per¬ceived need for pedagogical knowledge development to talk about students as costs. The constrained nine-step model disciplined some individuals more than others. The teachers disciplined each other through e. g. confessions, corrections and differentiations. In¬consistent discourses about good teaching and teachers’ know-how were constructed and the teachers posi¬tioned themselves and each other as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ teachers. The interactive research approach partly enabled the PGM-practice but at the same time effected the teachers’ posi¬tio¬ning of each other. The interactive research approach disciplined both the teachers and the researcher. Anyhow, power relations be¬came fluent and mutual among the participants. A collegial approach and the ability to carry out reflexive cooperation were both fostered by the model and articulated in the PGM-practice as im¬portant teacher skills...|$|E

Despite the earlier confirmation, the country's participation came into doubt later in the same month due to budget cuts the broadcaster had endured, the high costs associated with the contest, and the difficulty said costs would present in finding sponsors to cover the expenses. Additionally, various Greek politicians and the current government spokesman suggested that a participation in the 2013 contest would be distasteful during a time that Greeks were enduring drastic <b>economic</b> <b>cuts</b> to keep the economy afloat due to the ongoing finical crisis. Despite the uncertainty, Greece's participation was officially confirmed on 21 December 2012 when the European Broadcasting Union released a list of the countries that would participate in the 2013 contest. ERT later stated that its participation was decided on taking into consideration the high viewership and popularity of the event, on the condition that the broadcaster would not be burdened financially.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study how {{individuals}} with alcohol and drug problems come to treatment – who is in treatment and who is not? It further studies the goal and role of treatment according to different groups – clients, staff and politicians. How can we understand clients’ experiences in a context? The main data is from the Women and men in Swedish alcohol and drug treatment-study, with {{a representative sample of}} clients as well as complementary data on the views of staff and the general population. The thesis comprises four related papers: (1) explores who is in treatment and who is not by analysing the client and the general population samples; (2) studies reasons for coming to treatment among clients by focussing on self-choice in relation to informal, formal, and legal social pressures to seek treatment; (3) investigates alcohol and drug related events among misusers and the role of these events in treatment entry, and in relation to level of marginalization of the clients; (4) analyses motives for and conflicts surrounding changes in the treatment system on an organizational level. The thesis reveals that clients in treatment are marginalized (regarding housing, work, family, etc.). At treatment entry, clients report self-choice as well as a range of pressures to seek treatment as reasons for coming. The events are influential in treatment seeking, especially events and pressures in relation to significant others. In addition, it is shown that changes in the treatment system are not only driven with the interests of the clients in mind. Professional struggles, <b>economic</b> <b>cuts,</b> and coincidences are of importance. It is shown that different actors have competing as well as compatible and matching views on the goals of treatment. Finally, some notable changes in the treatment system are discussed...|$|R
