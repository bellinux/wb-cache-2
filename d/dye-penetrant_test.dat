40|$|Serious {{propeller}} {{damages in}} service require the costly docking of ships and a repair by welding. The total {{failure of a}} propeller blade is often characterized by fatigue lines on the cracked surface, starting mostly at a deficiency as a material defect or welding repair at {{the trailing edge of}} the blade. The current practice to supervise welding repairs is a strict welding performance according to a well-proven procedure and a <b>dye-penetrant</b> <b>test</b> in order to visualise surface deficiencies. If such flaws are inside the material, non-destructive testing methods {{have not been able to}} properly detect them, due to the material properties which are disadvantageous for the methods applied so far. Therefore, Germanischer Lloyd (GL) has initiated a research project concerning this matter, supporte d by the Bundesministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft und Technologie (BMWT) ...|$|E
40|$|Joining of {{dissimilar}} metals {{leading to}} better material utilization with improved functionality encouraged the research thrust on various dissimilar material joining processes including laser brazing. This paper reports {{the development of}} laser brazing joints and their characterization for 3 mm thick Cu sheet with 3 mm thick AISI 316 L stainless steel sheet in butt joint configuration using 63 Ag- 35. 25 Cu- 1. 75 Ti active brazing foil as filler metal. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to identify the optimum processing parameters for controlled simultaneous heating of the filler metal and sheets by laser beam resulting in melting of the filler metal without melting Cu and SS sheets. Using this methodology, a number of brazed joints were successfully prepared at different set of processing parameters. The brazed joints were subjected to various non-destructive (visual and <b>dye-penetrant</b> <b>test)</b> and destructive (microscopic examination, energy dispersive spectroscopy, four point bend testing etc.) characterization techniques. The results demonstrated that laser energy per unit length of 100 J/m is threshold limit for feasibility of brazing process for selected metal and thickness combination. Microscopic studies of transverse section of laser brazed joint showed full penetration across the thickness without the melting of parent metals. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies showed the diffusion of filler material (Ag) more towards the Cu sheet as {{compared to that of}} stainless steel sheet. Four point bend test showed that the alignment of laser beam-metal joint was critical for the brazing joint strength and improved joint strength was achieved when the beam was at the centre of the brazing joint. A maximum joint strength of 343. 7 MPa was achieved for laser power of 550 W at scan speed of 3 mm/min...|$|E
40|$|Descriptions {{are given}} of various {{procedures}} used in determining leaks in the tubes of the 1 B heat exchanger. Air pressurization tests determined leakage and leak rate of nine tubes. The leak-location-detector-probe method was found promising for locating defects {{along the length}} of the tube. Results of the probalog, <b>dye-penetrant,</b> and ultrasonic <b>tests</b> proved inconclusive in determining leak locations. (B. O. G. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the introduction of}} large scale Condition Monitoring by Associated Pulp and Paper Mills (A. P. P. M.) at Wesley Vale (W. V.), Tasmania. Some C. M. techniques have been in use for several years at the mill but without being {{part of an overall}} C. M. program. Two examples are: -Dye-penetrant testing. -Thermography. The report includes a literature survey describing some of the different techniques available to the Condition Monitoring Engineer. The three basic principles of C. M., (Detection, Diagnosis, and Prognosis) are discussed, as are some of the more common techniques in use in other industries. An introduction to vibration monitoring is presented to set the scene for the application of this technique in the Paper Mill and is discussed in more detail in the following chapters. Examples of the types of machine faults that can be detected by a vibration monitoring program are discussed along with some of the techniques avail-able to process the vibration data. Included also is a discussion on the need for the selection of appropriate measuring points and transducers. The history of C. M. at the W. V. paper mill, including <b>dye-penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> and Thermography, are discussed with case studies included. The extension of the major time based maintenance intervals (annual shuts) from twelve months to eighteen months made the need for a condition based maintenance system more acute. This would be sustainable only if the progress of any developing fault could be monitored and preventative action taken before failure of the machine occurred. The range of plant and equipment in use at W. V. is discussed along with some of the causes of break-downs commonly encountered with this machinery. The most common reason for plant downtime is due to bearing related faults. Vibration monitoring is selected as the most appropriate C. M. technique for W. V. given the types of machines in service and the kind of faults experienced. The selection of the particular vibration monitoring hardware and software {{to be used in the}} vibration monitoring program is discussed. The decision on which equipment to use was based on the need to consider the following points: -Cost. -Compatibility with existing data. -Ease of use. -Availability of software upgrades. -The ability to extract a slice of the database. The C. S. I. hardware and software selected for use at W. V. is discussed along with the necessary support equipment such as computers, cables, and accelerometers. Some of the practical problems encountered in getting the vibration monitoring program in place are discussed including the fitting of studs to machines and getting co-operation from the maintenance staff generally. The use of A 4 size floor plans to assist in the identification and location of each machine to be monitored is discussed. The monitoring program for the 4 MW steam turbine at W. V. is discussed including both oil analysis and vibration monitoring. The balancing of the turbine rotors carried out in early 1991 and the problems encountered in this job are also out-lined. Results of the monitoring program are included after it had been in use for about eighteen months along with some case studies. Included is a discussion on the training of the maintenance staff and their place in the C. M. program. The use of Computer based Maintenance Management Packages is discussed. along with their interaction with the C. M. program in use at the mill. The need for good maintenance records is highlighted along with a proposal for upgrading the existing mill data collection system to give sufficiently accurate records to allow statistical analysis of breakdowns to be carried out when required. The use of Expert Systems as an aid to C. M. is discussed with a pilot program being developed by the writer for future use at Wesley Vale...|$|R
