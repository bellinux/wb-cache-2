5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng {{said that the}} Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, {{freedom of speech and}} expression, though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed <b>democracy,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race or religion, and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E

However, if any <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding {{the people from the}} legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its own favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.|$|E

500|$|Once in Philadelphia, Dennie {{resumed his}} {{editorial}} {{career with the}} Gazette of the United States, a Federalist-friendly newspaper. In 1800 Dennie, along with Philadelphia bookseller Asbury Dickens, began work on the Port Folio. Under the pseudonym Oliver Oldschool, Esq., Dennie wrote, in 1803, a scathing attack on Jeffersonian democracy, {{for which he was}} brought up on charges of seditious libel. Dennie wrote, in part:A democracy is scarcely tolerable at any period of national history. Its omens are always sinister, and its powers are unpropitious. It is on its trial here, and the issue will be civil war, desolation, and anarchy. No wise man but discerns its imperfections, no good man but shudders at its miseries, no honest man but proclaims its fraud, and no brave man but draws his sword against its force. The institution of a scheme of policy so radically contemptible and vicious is a memorable example of what the villany of some men can devise, the folly of others receive, and both establish in spite of reason, reflection, and sensation. This paragraph was reprinted in Federalist newspapers throughout the country. While Dennie was acquitted, the severity of the attacks leveled in Port Folio would henceforth be lessened. However, when Dennie criticized democracy, it was not the republican democracy found in the United States today, but rather the [...] "democracy" [...] found in France under Robespierre and Napoleon. Dennie was invoking Aristotle's argument that [...] "an absolute <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government. It is the corruption and degeneracy, and not the sound constitution of a republic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Socialist Studies, on {{the other}} hand, regards the {{struggle}} by workers living under a dictatorship to establish some measure of political democracy as a reformist struggle which socialists should oppose. [...] They believe {{that the difference between}} democratic capitalist governments and dictatorial capitalist governments is of no significance to workers, that political <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> essential for the propagation of socialist ideas, and that workers in dictatorships should not directly confront the forces of suppression.

It is possible for human beings to be politically equal as voters but yet so unequal in educational, economic, and social opportunities, that ultimately even the nature of their political equality is affected.|$|E

He claims that the two main forms of democracy, socialist democracy (proletarian democracy) and capitalist democracy (bourgeoisie democracy) are both diametrically opposite; socialist democracy allows the people to master their own affairs while capitalist democracy, Wang contends, [...] "guarantees the freedom of capital to exploit and suppress [...] ". The use of qualifiers {{in front of the}} word of democracy is important as to highlight the class nature of the different forms of democracy Wang contends, and concludes that [...] "One sort of pure democracy, common democracy or 'universal democracy' that all of humanity identifies with has never existed in human societies".|$|E
2500|$|During that interval, Nae Ionescu and his Cuvântul {{were moving}} to the far right, {{aligning}} themselves with the fascist Iron Guard. Tudor criticized the Trăiristss sympathy for radical solutions, either fascist or communist, defending Romania's young democracy. In a December 1933 issue of Credința, he reacted: [...] "We say that <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the good thing for us, yet we have never even truly implemented it". Writing from a Christian perspective, Tudor accused Romania's revolutionary youth of [...] "monkeying" [...] foreign experiments in totalitarianism, describing Adolf Hitler as the Antichrist, and equating all revolutionary ideologies with the triumph of [...] "animality". Tudor and Eliade were among the 31 Christian and Jewish Romanian intellectuals to have signed a protest against antisemitism in general and against Nazism in particular. Their appeal to ventilate Romania's [...] "medieval atmosphere" [...] was hotly condemned by the pro-Nazi Axa magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Sarkar {{therefore}} advocates {{an economic}} democracy where the decision-making {{power for the}} economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one. [...] The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following {{one of the five}} fundamental principles, PROUT argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region. Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike capitalism, where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a proutistic society it should be based on necessity [...] The third requirement of economic democracy is the decentralization of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders. That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system [...] and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) {{for the development of the}} region and not merely for export [...] In summary, PROUT advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units) [...]„ ... a local economy using local resources in a climate which fosters local initiative and industriousness for the collective welfare." [...] PROUT also indicates that outsiders must be kept out from interfering with the local economy [...] From a proutistic perspective, this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community [...] From a Neo-humanistic perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.“ In law, we grant individual rights only to the extent that they do not harm others. Prout includes this idea in economics. “ ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{only because}} such a vast {{section of the}} modern world is out of sympathy with the serious {{democratic}} sentiment that this statement will seem to many to be lacking in seriousness. <b>Democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> philanthropy; it is not even altruism or social reform. <b>Democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> founded on pity for the common man; democracy is founded on reverence for the common man, or, if you will, even on fear of him. It does not champion man because man is so miserable, but because man is so sublime. It does not object so much to the ordinary man being a slave as to his not being a king, for its dream is always the dream of the first Roman republic, a nation of kings.|$|E
60|$|But {{the general}} march of {{industrial}} <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> towards inadequate hours of work, but towards sufficient hours of leisure.

They demand time to look about them, time to see their homes by daylight, to see their children, time to think and read and cultivate their gardens--time, in short, to live. That is very strange, perhaps, but that is the request they have made and are making with increasing force and reason as years pass by.|$|E
60|$|You {{may learn}} {{a good deal}} that will {{surprise}} you.

Their stern Calvinism slackened into many [...] "isms," [...] but left a kind of religiosity behind it. One of Dr. Holmes's mouthpieces sums up his whole creed in the two words Pater Noster. All these hereditary influences are consciously made conspicuous in Dr. Holmes's writings, as in Hawthorne's. In Hawthorne you see the old horror of sin, the old terror of conscience, the old dread of witchcraft, the old concern about conduct, converted into aesthetic sources of literary pleasure, of literary effects.|$|E
60|$|Democracy is a device--the best so far invented--for {{diminishing}} as much {{as possible}} the interference of governments with liberty. If a nation is divided into two sections which cannot both have their way, democracy theoretically insures that the majority shall have their way. But <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> at all an adequate device unless it is accompanied by a very great amount of devolution. Love of uniformity, or the mere pleasure of interfering, or dislike of differing tastes and temperaments, may often lead a majority to control a minority in matters which do not really concern the majority. We should none of us like to have the internal affairs of Great Britain settled by a parliament of the world, if ever such a body came into existence. Nevertheless, there are matters which such a body could settle much better than any existing instrument of government.|$|E
60|$|State socialism, even in {{a nation}} which {{possesses}} the form of political <b>democracy,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a truly democratic system. The {{way in which it}} fails to be democratic may be made plain by an analogy from the political sphere. Every democrat recognizes that the Irish ought to have self-government for Irish affairs, and ought not to be told that they have no grievance because they share in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is essential to democracy that any group of citizens whose interests or desires separate them at all widely {{from the rest of the}} community should be free to decide their internal affairs for themselves. And what is true of national or local groups is equally true of economic groups, such as miners or railway men. The national machinery of general elections is by no means sufficient to secure for groups of this kind the freedom which they ought to have.|$|E

40|$|The {{prospects}} for the spread of democracy {{around the world in}} the 21 st century appear to be bright, but there are also important reasons for pessimism.

The older <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> in danger of failing, but they are losing much of their democratic vitality, as seen in the decline of people s interest in politics, decreasing voter participation, and the serious weakening of political parties.
