40|$|The {{field of}} {{microfluidics}} is expanding {{into what is}} known as paper microfluidics. This uses a paper platform rather than materials (i. e. PDMS, PMMA) that are commonly used in microfluidics research. Current devices require an expensive manufacturing process and external sources to power the device. Such devices are not practical in low resource environments. As a consequence, it is the goal of this Thesis to develop a three-dimensional, multiplexed assay chip using nitrocellulose membranes. This device comprises of multiple layers of nitrocellulose membranes with defined fluidic channels. The multiple layers are bound together using double backed tape, and imbedded between the layers are conjugate reagents. In the detection region both antibodies and aptamers were evaluated. The fiberglass pad where conjugate reagents would be contained, were initially saturated in dye. As sample was inputted into the three-dimensional chip, the fluid path could be visualized. Without the use of the conjugate pad the chip’s four detection regions showed detection within one minute of one another. However, the addition of this <b>fibrous</b> <b>pad</b> skewed time points dramatically. The hypothesis that a three-dimensional chip could be designed to detect different biomarkers in a multi-analyte sample was satisfied. However, simultaneous detection was only possible if the conjugate pad was either neglected or, possibly, a different material was used. Additionally, current lateral flow assay technologies, another research area that paper microfluidics spawns from, use antibodies in order to capture biomarkers in sample and provide visual signal to the user. However, antibodies are sensitive to denaturation with pH and temperature, whereas aptamers can withstand much more extreme environmental conditions. A two-dimensional nitrocellulose chip was designed to compare antibodies and aptamers as capture reagents to detect VEGF, using colloidal gold as a particle to visualize detection. Both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-VEGF antibodies were used and showed no signal. On the other hand, the anti-VEGF aptamer produced a visual signal when conjugated to biotin on its 5 ’ end. This data was further validated by a separate project analyzing the binding kinetics of the antibody and the aptamer using Surface Plasmon Resonance. Therefore, the hypothesis that aptamers {{could be used as a}} possible capture reagent in a paper microfluidic chip for the detection of VEGF was satisfied...|$|E
5000|$|Stridex (originally spelled Stri-Dex) is an American acne {{treatment}} and prevention medicine, originally registered trademark of Bayer Corporation. It {{comes in the}} form of <b>fibrous</b> <b>pads</b> saturated with astringents and contained in a plastic tub of fifty-five to ninety pads. Most products in the Stridex line contain as the active ingredient salicylic acid (0.5-2.5%); Stridex [...] "Power Pads", however, contain instead benzoyl peroxide (2.5%), which is considered by medical professionals to be [...] "the most effective and widely used nonprescription medication for both types of acne". However, they also warn about possible side effects: dryness of the skin, possible burning, and tingling. Patients are advised to apply treatment with caution around lips, nose and mouth, or cuts and scrapes, and also avoid excessive sun exposure. In 2013, FDA started to investigate a possible link between benzoyl peroxide- and/or salicylic acid-based acne prevention medicine with hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions without calling off any products or placing warnings.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Polymeric electrospun nanofibrous {{membranes}} {{were investigated}} {{for use in}} water filtration applications. A customized pressure vessel was designed according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) {{to be used to}} test the membrane for its filtration properties. Low pressure filtration was focused on due to previous research that suggested that high pressure water testing of electrospun polymeric nanofibrous filters could decrease the filtration capability by expanding the pore size within the membrane. During testing it was found that this technology does reduce pathogens but will only remove a portion of them per pass, and thus is not adequate for use as a one pass pathogenic filter. The filter was found to be well suited for the reduction in the amount of suspended and dissolved solids, increasing clarity, and reduction of odor. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the electrospun <b>fibrous</b> <b>pads</b> to narrow down on an ideal parameter set that gave the desirable characteristics for the application of filtration. The composition of the polymer, and electrospinning parameters, were also manipulated to give a hydrophilic, or absorbent, membrane to facilitate a low pressure differential for filtration. It was demonstrated that this type of filtration membrane can be manufactured inexpensively while not requiring electricity or other external power source to generate large pressure differentials and flow. This is desirable because it allows this technology to be used in areas where both basic utilities and clean water are limited, for example in remote Africa and India. It was also shown that this filter has benefits over best selling commercial water filters currently on the market. This technology may be best suited for enhancement of tap water where healthier and cleaner water is desired. Pre-filtration of reverses osmosis (RO) or other ultrafine filter system, to increase the life of the primary filter while decreasing fouling and maintenance may be another application...|$|R
40|$|Hopping {{provides}} {{efficient and}} energy saving locomotion for kangaroos, but {{it results in}} great forces in the knee joints. A previous study has suggested that a unique fibrous cartilage in the central region of the tibial cartilage could serve to decrease the peak stresses generated within kangaroo tibiofemoral joints. However, the influences of the microstructure, composition and mechanical properties of the central fibrous and peripheral hyaline cartilage on {{the function of the}} knee joints are still to be defined. The present study showed that the fibrous cartilage was thicker and had a lower chondrocyte density than the hyaline cartilage. Despite having a higher PG content in the middle and deep zones, the fibrous cartilage had an inferior compressive strength compared to the peripheral hyaline cartilage. The fibrous cartilage had a complex three dimensional collagen meshwork with collagen bundles parallel to the surface in the superficial zone, and with collagen bundles both parallel and perpendicular to the surface in the middle and deep zones. The collagen in the hyaline cartilage displayed a typical Benninghoff structure, with collagen fibres parallel to the surface in the superficial zone and collagen fibres perpendicular to the surface in the deep zone. Elastin fibres were found throughout the entire tissue depth of the fibrous cartilage and displayed a similar alignment to the adjacent collagen bundles. In comparison, the elastin fibres in the hyaline cartilage were confined within the superficial zone. This study examined {{for the first time the}} fibrillary structure, PG content and compressive properties of the central <b>fibrous</b> cartilage <b>pad</b> and peripheral hyaline cartilage withi...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY A {{study has}} been made of the {{coalescence}} of secondary dispersions in a fibrous bed. The literature pertaining to the formation, hydrodynamic behaviour and methods of separation of droplets less than one hundred micrometres in diameter has been reviewed with particular reference to fibrous bed coalescers. The main operating parameters were identified as inlet drop size distribution, phase ratio, superficial velocity and the thickness and voidage of the bed. A recirculatory rig with interchangeable <b>fibrous</b> bed <b>pads</b> was designed and operated with toluene-water dispersions generated by a combination of centrifugal pumps. Inlet drop sizes were analysed using a Coulter Counter and outlet drops were sized photographically. A novel technique, involving conductivity measur ements at different planes in the bed, was developed to measure hold up distribution. Single phase flow and two phase flow pressure drops were correlated by a Blake-Kozeny type equation. Exit drop size was independent of inlet drop size distribution and phase ratio but a function of superficialvelocity and packing thickness. Average bed hold up was independent of inlet drop size distribution and phase ratio, but decreased with increase in superficial velocity. Hold up was not evenly distributed in the bed, the highest value occurred at the inlet followed by a sharp - 2 drop at approximately 1. 2 x 10 m. Hold up remained constant {{throughout the rest of the}} bed until the exit plane, where it increased. From the results, a mechanism is postulated involving: (a) Capture of the inlet drops followed by interdrop coalescence until an equilibrium value is reached. (b) Equilibrium size droplets flowing as rivulets through the intermediate portion of the bed, and (c) Each rivulet forms droplets at the exit face, which detach by a 'drip point' mechanism...|$|R
