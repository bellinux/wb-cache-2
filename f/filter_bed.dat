5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
2500|$|Barley is {{the most}} {{commonly}} malted grain, {{in part because of}} its [...] high content of [...] enzymes, though wheat, rye, oats , rice and corn are also used. Also very important is the retention of the grain's husk, even after threshing, unlike the bare seeds of threshed wheat or rye. This protects the growing acrospire (developing plant embryo) from damage during malting, which can easily lead to mold growth; it also allows the mash of converted grain to create a <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> during lautering (see brewing).|$|E

50|$|The {{remains of}} the flood gates are located south of the Lea Bridge Road at Lea Bridge and {{adjacent}} to the former Middlesex <b>Filter</b> <b>Beds</b> which are now a nature reserve. The <b>filter</b> <b>beds</b> were built in 1852, to provide cleaner water to London, {{as a response to}} an outbreak of cholera three years before. They became redundant when the Coppermills Water Treatment Works was built at Walthamstow in 1969, and by the time Thames Water took over responsibility for them in 1974, they were already providing habitat for a range of plants and wildlife. They subsequently became part of the Lee Valley Regional Park in 1988, and the <b>filter</b> <b>beds</b> now provide areas of wet woodland, reed beds and open water. Over 60 varieties of birds have been seen at the reserve, which is close to the Waterworks Nature Reserve, a similar site occupying some of the Essex <b>filter</b> <b>beds,</b> which were built later than the Middlesex <b>filter</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Backwashing of {{granular}} media filters involves several steps. First, {{the filter}} is taken off {{line and the}} water is drained to a level that is above {{the surface of the}} <b>filter</b> <b>bed.</b> Next, compressed air is pushed up through the filter material causing the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> to expand breaking up the compacted <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> and forcing the accumulated particles into suspension. After the air scour cycle, clean backwash water is forced upwards through the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> continuing the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> expansion and carrying the particles in suspension into backwash troughs suspended above the filter surface. In some applications, air and water streams are simultaneously pushed upwards through the granular media followed by a rinse water wash. Backwashing continues for a fixed time, or until the turbidity of the backwash water is below an established value. At the end of the backwash cycle, the upward flow of water is terminated and the <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> settles by gravity into its initial configuration. Water to be filtered is then applied to the filter surface until the filter clogs and the backwash cycle needs to be repeated.|$|E

50|$|In sewage {{treatment}} works, {{the water is}} first of all screened to remove floating debris. Then it is sedimented to remove small insoluble impurities.

50|$|When kilning is complete, {{the grains}} are now termed malt, {{and they will}} be milled or crushed to break apart the kernels and expose the cotyledon, which {{contains}} the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to extract the sugars during mashing. Milling also separates the seed from the husk. Care must be taken when milling to ensure that the starch reserves are sufficiently milled without damaging the husk and providing coarse enough grits that a good <b>filter</b> <b>bed</b> can be formed during lautering. Grains are typically dry-milled with roller mills or hammer mills. Hammer mills, which produce a very fine mash, are often used when mash filters are going to be employed in the lautering process because the grain does not have to form its own <b>filter</b> <b>bed.</b> In modern plants, the grain is often conditioned with water before it is milled to make the husk more pliable, thus reducing breakage and improving lauter speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{same type}} {{that is used}} in aquariums, though any small gravel can be used, {{provided}} it is washed first. Indeed, plants growing in a typical traditional gravel <b>filter</b> <b>bed,</b> with water circulated using electric powerhead pumps, are in effect being grown using gravel hydroponics. Gravel is inexpensive, easy to keep clean, drains well and will not become waterlogged. However, it is also heavy, and, if the system does not provide continuous water, the plant roots may dry out.|$|E
40|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{works with}} percolating <b>filter</b> <b>beds</b> {{are known to}} provide profitable foraging areas for insectivorous birds due to their association with high macroinvertebrate densities. Fly larvae developing on <b>filter</b> <b>beds</b> at sewage treatment works may similarly provide a valuable resource for foraging bats. Over the last two decades, however, {{there has been a}} decline in <b>filter</b> <b>beds</b> towards a system of “activated sludge”. Insects and bat activity were surveyed at 30 sites in Scotland employing these two different types of sewage treatment in order to assess the possible implications of these changes for foraging bats. Bat activity (number of passes) recorded from broad-band bat detectors was quantified at three points within each site. The biomass of aerial insects, sampled over the same period as the detector surveys, was measured using a suction trap. The biomass of insects and activity of Pipistrellus spp. was significantly higher at <b>filter</b> <b>beds</b> than at activated sludge sites. In addition, whilst foraging activity of Pipistrellus spp. at <b>filter</b> <b>beds</b> was comparable to that of adjacent “good” foraging habitat, foraging at activated sludge sites was considerably lower. This study indicates the high potential value of an anthropogenic process to foraging bats, particularly in a landscape where their insect prey has undergone a marked decline, and suggests that the current preference for activated sludge systems is likely to reduce the value of treatment works as foraging sites for bats...|$|R
