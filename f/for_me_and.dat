5|$|In , a 2010 {{documentary}} film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted: It's something that I probably won’t realize until my career is over, {{how many people}} are really rooting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> cheering <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E

5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton {{had worked in}} such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals but who was not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed it to Me and Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the downstairs}} lounge, {{a few minutes}} before the Act 2 curtain <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the {{remarkable}} conclusion to Act 1—although the audience has noticed nothing unusual ("Intermission Talk"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors ("It Feels Good"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet, where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date ("We Deserve Each Other"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out ("I'm Your Girl"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well.|$|E

25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again.

That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E

25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, {{that we could not}} move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> not the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E
25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make {{a down payment on}} a farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees for the purpose of making maple sugar. A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have all worked for me many a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has worked <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E

25|$|Best {{known today}} for his {{performances}} in {{films such as}} An American in Paris (1951), Anchors Aweigh (1945), and Singin' in the Rain (1952), he starred in musical films until they fell out of fashion in the late 1950s. He starred in many musical films throughout the 1940s, including <b>For</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> My Gal (1942), Du Barry Was a Lady (1943), Thousands Cheer (1943), and On the Town (1949). He starred as {{the lead in the}} film It's Always Fair Weather (1955), which has gained a cult following among musical enthusiasts and his fans. In his later career, he starred in two films outside the musical genre: Inherit the Wind (1960) and What a Way to Go! (1964). Throughout his career, he also directed films (some of which he starred in), most notably the 1969 film Hello, Dolly!, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
25|$|Among his {{earliest}} film jobs was orchestrating the Gershwin {{songs in the}} Fred Astaire movie A Damsel in Distress at RKO. He later {{went to work at}} MGM, where he composed music for the Marx Brothers vehicles A Day at the Races, Go West, and The Big Store, as well as writing or arranging music for such musicals as Lady Be Good and Cabin in the Sky. He also worked on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939 musical The Wizard of Oz (for which he orchestrated the background music used in the tornado scene, poppy-field scene and many of the Emerald City sequences), Babes in Arms, and <b>For</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> My Gal. During his work at MGM, he returned to RKO to supervise the adaptation of the Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart musical Too Many Girls to the big screen. He also worked on dramas, including Vincente Minnelli's The Clock and Tay Garnett's The Postman Always Rings Twice.|$|E
