40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} determining {{if there were any}} changes in the volatile profile of strawberries cv. Camarosa, when subjected to various freezing and thawing treatments. Strawberries were cut in half, one half of the berries were frozen directly at - 20 °C or - 80 °C or rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen (N 2) (- 196 °C). They were then stored overnight or for a week. Berries were later left to thaw at room temperature (natural thawing) for about 1 h and some were forced-thawed in a 30 °C water bath. Headspace volatile compounds were determined using an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation-Mass Spectrometer (APCI-GPA) and validated with a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). In a comparison of thawed half berries and fresh berries, most esters such as hexyl acetate, <b>ethyl</b> methyl <b>hexanoate,</b> methyl acetate were increased significantly by week-long and not by overnight freeze/thaw treatments. Ethyl butyrate was not affected by any treatment. The abundance of aldehydes such as the acetaldehyde compounds was increased significantly when thawed naturally compared to when forced-thawed in all the cold storage treatments. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{aroma of}} Muscat of Sorso-Sennori and Malvasia di Bosa wines {{obtained}} from grapes grown in Sardinia was evaluated by instrumental analysis. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry {{was used to}} identify and quantify the content of free and bound volatile compounds. The odour activity value (OAV) was also calculated. Higher alcohols and esters were quantitatively {{the largest group of}} free volatile compounds in both wines, while terpenes were the main class of bound volatiles. A total of 52 free and 26 bound volatiles were detected. Malvasia di Bosa sweet wine had a higher content of alcohols, esters and acids in comparison to Muscat of Sorso-Sennori, which was richer in some terpenes, like nerol, geraniol and geranic acid, and also in bound volatile compounds.

40|$|AbstractThe odoriferous {{importance}} of volatile compounds during maturation of organic passion fruit was studied. The volatile compounds {{were analyzed using}} GC-FID-OSME and GC-MS. The volatile profile changed throughout maturation. Relative peak area improved from the 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 yellow skin color state of ripeness and was still improved from the 2 / 3 to 3 / 3, but the profile remained. Ethyl butanoate showed the highest relative peak area and importance for the aroma of the organic passion fruit in the 1 / 3 yellow skin color. <b>Ethyl</b> butanoate and <b>hexanoate,</b> propyl acetate and alpha-terpineol showed odoriferous importance from the 2 / 3 yellow skin color, and together with diethyl carbonate and cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol {{were the most important}} compounds in the 3 / 3 yellow skin color state of ripeness. PCA allowed clearly differentiate all ripening states, indicating that hexanal and caramel, earthy and synthetic aroma were most closely associated with the unripe passion fruit. 2 -methylpropyl acetate characterized the passion fruit at the 2 / 3 yellow skin color together with cis-beta-ocimene, benzaldehyde and aroma sweet and passion fruit, skin, which also were associated with the 3 / 3 yellow skin color.

The results from the sensory experiments illustrated that increasing tannin concentration significantly increased the proportion of panelists (n= 36, at 5 % significant criterion) correctly choosing the tannin sample as the odd sample. The addition of mucin did not significantly change the sensory responses from the panelists.

In this study, two Sauternes wines were investigated by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gas chromatography-pulsed flame photometric detector (GC-PFPD) after XAD 2 and thiol-specific extractions. Most polyfunctional thiols (3 -sulfanylpropyl acetate, 2 -sulfanylethyl acetate, 3 -methyl- 3 -sulfanylbutanal, etc.) proved to be completely degraded after 2 years of bottle aging in a cellar. Only 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol was still found in aged samples at concentrations above its threshold value. Most other key odorants found in the young noble rot wine were still detected 5 - 6 years after harvest: varietal aroma (alpha-terpineol), sotolon, fermentation alcohols (3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol and 2 -phenylethanol) and esters (<b>ethyl</b> butyrate, isobutyrate, <b>hexanoate,</b> and isovalerate), and oak maturation-related compounds (guaiacol, vanillin, eugenol, beta-damascenone, trans-non- 2 -enal, beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone, gamma-nonalactone, and furaneol), as well as three newly identified aromas exhibiting interesting cake, honey-like, and dried apricot odors: homofuraneol, theaspirane, and gamma-decalactone. Interestingly, abhexon, never mentioned in sweet wines before, was found to be synthesized during bottle aging. An optimized extraction method allowed us to quantify this honey/spicy compound at levels close to its threshold value (up to 7 mug/L after 5 - 6 years), thus suggesting a key role of this strong odorant in old Sauternes wines...|$|R
40|$|PhD {{dissertation}} thesis "Study of {{correlation of}} quality parameters of wines and wine distillates" {{was done at}} Department of Post-Harvest Technology of Horticultural Products, Faculty of Horticulture, Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno during 2006 - 2012. Samples of wines and samples of distillates made from these wines were analysed using liquid-liquid extraction method (LLE) followed by gas chromatography analysis (GC). Potential characteristics [...] chemical markers were determined: trans-linalool oxide and cislinalool oxide which are typical for Muscat Ottonel and tetradecanote, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate for Pinot Blanc. In wine distillates, ethyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate, 1, 1 -diethoxybutane, diethoxypentane were determined, however none of these substances were found in wines. These substances probably originate {{as a result of}} esterification process during ageing of wine distillates after distillation process. Differences in chemical composition of wine distillates made from red wine grape cultivars were analysed using main component method. Group of substances such as <b>ethyl</b> butanoate, <b>hexanoate,</b> octanoate, decanoate, dodecanoate and diethyl succinate can be considered as possible markers identifying wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars and white grape cultivars. Characteristic aroma of grape variety was recognisable in wine distillates from Muscat Ottonell and Blue Frankish varieties. Samples of wine and wine distillates were analysed using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GCMS). Negative correlation between 1 -hexanol content and intensity of aroma was discovered in wine distillates. Characteristic aroma of grape variety showed significantly in distillates from Pinot Gris (RS_ 2) and in distillates from red wine grape cultivars, particularly Saint Laurent (SV) and Pinot Noir. Based on analysis of samples of wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars, ten major terpentic aromatic substances were determined (o-cymen, limonen, cis-b-ocimen, cislinalool oxid, linalool, isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol, a-terpineol, trans-sabinyl acetate a transkalamenen). All these substances influence aroma of grape variety. Both centred log ratio transform (clr) and main component method were applied and similarity in aroma of wine distillates was found and it was discovered that aroma of wine distillate from varieties Merlot, Pinot Noir and similar ones are influenced by terpenoids cis-linalool oxid, linalool, 94 isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol a a-terpineol. On the other hand, aroma of wine distillates from varieties Blue Portugieser and Cabernet Sauvignon are influenced by o-cymen, limonen, trans-sabinyl acetate and trans-kalamenen. Analysis of terpentic content wine distillates was carried out using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Major terpentic substances identified are limonen, linalool, a-ylangen, b- bourbonen, g-kadinen, trans-nerolidol, 2, 3 -dihydrofarnesol and (2 -cis, 6 -trans) -farnesol. Verifiable differences were discovered between various distillates types.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the thermodynamics of macrocycles and their metal cation complexes in non-aqueous media {{and these are}} discussed under two main headings, i) Thermodynamics of Alkali-Metal Cations and Macrocycles in Solution and in the Solid State. Thermodynamic parameters of complexation for alkali-metal cations and macrocycles (18 -crown- 6 and <b>ethyl</b> p-tert-butylcalix(6) arene <b>hexanoate)</b> in benzo-nitrile at 298. 15 K are first reported. These data are compared with those previously reported for cryptand 222 and these cations in this solvent. A 'peak' selectivity for potassium is observed for the complexation of the calix(6) arene ester with alkali metal cations. The process is enthalpy controlled with an exothermic maximum for the potassium cation. Thermodynamic data of complexation are characterised by a lower enthalpic stability and a more favourable entropy (except for K+) than corresponding data involving cryptand 222 or indeed 18 -crown- 6. Standard enthalpies of solution, DeltasH 0, of macrocycles and their sodium and potassium salts in benzonitrile measured calorimetrically are discussed in relation to (i) data for the uncomplexed salts and (ii) previously reported data for sodium and potassium cryptate salts in various solvents. Enthalpies of coordination, DeltacoordH 0, for eighteen systems involving sodium and potassium coronates, cryptates and calix(6) arenates are derived and whenever possible these are discussed {{on the basis of}} (i) available X-ray crystallographic data and (ii) the anion effect on the coordination process. ii) Thermodynamics of Lower Rim Calix(4) arene Derivatives with the Silver Cation in Different Media at 298. 15 K. The DeltasH 0 values of p-tert-butyl(bis-diethylamine-bis-methysulphanyl) calix(4) arene (EATCalix 4) in various solvents at 298. 15 K are reported. Transfer parameters from acetonitrile to other solvents are calculated. The interaction of EATCalix 4 and the silver cation was investigated by 1 H NMR in deuterated acetonitrile at 298 K showing that the ligand hosts the metal cation through interaction with the different donor atoms (O, N, S). Conductimetric titrations indicate that the stoichiometry of the complex is 1 : 1. The thermodynamics of complexation of EATCalix 4 and silver in six solvents at 298. 15 K is reported. The DeltasH 0 values of the free and the complex silver perchlorate salts have been also measured in various solvents and these have been combined with DeltacH 0 data to derive the DeltacoordH 0 of this system. A few representative examples about the use of coordination data are given. The medium effect on the complexation process is assessed in terms of DeltatG 0, DeltatH 0 and DeltatS 0 of the reactants and the product from acetonitrile to the appropriate solvent.

Zespri™ gold and the traditional green 'Hayward' kiwifruit are mainly marketed as fresh whole fruit; however there is interest in extending the range of processed products for gold fruit to provide further opportunities to utilize the increasing volumes now becoming available. Vinegar was selected for investigation as it {{plays an important role in}} food processing as a condiment, acidulant and preservative, and has also been identified to have various health benefits. The aims of the project were: (1) To evaluate the effect of juice extraction techniques and conditions on juice yield and quality. (2) To evaluate the effects of pre-fermentation treatment and fermentation conditions on the fermentation behaviour and quality of Zespri gold kiwifruit mashes. (3) To identify suitable conditions for acetifcation of Zespri™ gold kiwifruit wines and investigate the effect of the vinegar elaboration technique on the quality of the resultant kiwifruit vinegars. Ripe peeled or unpeeled gold kiwifruit was processed in a hammer mill and the juice was extracted using a laboratory scale hydraulic press. Yield was measured for four pressurization cycles, to a maximum pressure of 250 MPa. Press aid, and pre-(cellulase) and post-pressing (pectinase) enzymes were used to improve juice yield and quality. Juice yield increased through the first three pressing cycles, but there was little gain in the fourth cycle. A juice of suitable clarity and consistency, and yield of 3. 8 L. (5 kg pulp) - 1 was obtained with the recommended process conditions of: 2 or 3 %(w/w) press aid, 0. 15 mL. kg- 1 pre-press enzyme held at 50 °C for 2 h, 0. 035 mL. kg- 1 post-press enzyme. Repeated pressing was found to increase total phenolics but reduced colour intensity in juice. The free-run juice was superior in colour and TP; other physico-chemical parameters were not affected by repeated pressing. Hand peeling and holding pomace at 30 - 50 °C for 2 - 6 h slightly reduced total acidity and significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced vitamin C. Skin contact and temperature (30 - 50 °C. 2 - 6 h) significantly (P< 0. 05) increased total phenolics. The character impacting aromatic compounds, ethyl butanoate, hexanal and trans- 2 -hexanal, were identified in the juice at 10. 8, 4. 2 and 9. 8 mg. L- 1, respectively. Proteolytic activity attributed to actinidin was about 45 % of that observed in 'Hayward' green kiwifruit juice. Alcoholic fermentation behaviour was evaluated at 20, 30 and 37 °C for natural juice and juice supplemented with sucrose to 18 °Brix using a wine yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Juices obtained from peeled and unpeeled fruit, filtered and unfiltered, were fermented. With sucrose enrichment, wines with 8. 1 %w/v or 8. 0 %w/v were obtained at efficiencies of 88 % and 87 % and productivities of 1. 3 and 1. 6 g. L- 1 h- 1 at 20 and 30 °C, respectively. Natural juice at 20 °C gave a similar yield but efficiency and productivity varied from 84 - 96 % and 1. 1 - 0. 8 g. L- 1 h- 1, respectively. Both sucrose enrichment and high fermentation temperature reduced total vitamin C and total acidity in wine. Many esters which impact positively were identified by GC-MS in the gold kiwifruit wines. These included isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, 1 -hexy <b>hexanoate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> decanoate and ethyl octanoate. Gold kiwifruit wines with up to 7. 5 %w/v ethanol were subjected to acetic acid fermentation using a commercial cider vinegar as the inoculum. A start up protocol for a simple semi-continuous fermentation system was developed. The best fermentation conditions identified were 29 ± 2 °C with flow rate of 0. 8 L. min- 1 of oxygen enriched (40 %) air. A yield of up to 5. 8 % w/v acetic acid was obtained at an efficiency of 85 % and productivity of 1. 2 g. L- 1 h- 1. A sensory panel described the gold kiwifruit vinegar as having stronger wine character than commercial cider vinegar, and equal to cider vinegar in terms of fruity aroma, ethyl acetate aroma and overall impression. The vinegar was found to have a meat tenderizing effect comparable to commercial papain enzyme and left the meat in good eating condition.

Once this dual activity was confirmed, malolactic fermentation (MLF) trials were conducted in wine with O. oeni strains that had been previously observed to have either high or low esterase activity against artificial substrates. Strain specific differences were observed and strains with low esterase hydrolysis activity against artificial substrates had a higher level of total esters measured after MLF. The results demonstrate the impact that O. oeni has on wine aroma and relates this to the ester hydrolysis and synthesis abilities of O. oeni strains. Krista M. Sumby, Vladimir Jiranek, Paul R.

40|$|Correspondance auteur: Athes V. vathes@grignon. inra. frA {{model was}} {{elaborated}} {{to quantify the}} gas-liquid partitioning of four {{of the most important}} volatile compounds produced during winemaking fermentations, namely isobutanol, ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate.</b> Analyses of constant rate fermentations demonstrated that the partitioning was not influenced by the CO(2) production rate and was a function of only the must composition and the temperature. The parameters of the model were identified in fermentations run at different temperatures, including anisothermal conditions. The prediction of the partition coefficient (k(i)) by the model was very accurate for isobutanol, isoamyl acetate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate.</b> The technological potential of the model was confirmed by using it to calculate the losses of volatiles in the gas phase during fermentation and comparing them with experimental data. Up to 70 % of the produced volatile compounds were lost. The difference between observed losses and losses estimated from predicted ki values never exceeded 3 %...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} aroma release {{in relation to}} yogurt structure and perception, the apparent diffusivity of aroma compounds within complex dairy gels was determined using an experimental diffusion cell. Apparent diffusion coefficients of four aroma compounds (diacetyl, ethyl acetate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> and linalool) at 7 degrees C in yogurts (varying in composition and structure) ranged from 0. 07 x 10 (- 10) to 8. 91 x 10 (- 10) m(2) s(- 1), depending on aroma compounds and on product structure. The strong effect of yogurt fat content on the apparent diffusivity of hydrophobic compounds was revealed (15 -fold and 50 -fold decreases in the apparent diffusion coefficient of linalool and <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> respectively). Protein composition {{seemed to have a}} greater effect than that of mechanical treatment. However, variations in the apparent diffusion coefficient for the considered products remained limited and cannot completely explain differences in flavor release and in perception that were previously observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} oil content and droplet size {{distributions}} of dilute oil-in-water emulsions on release of four esters with different hydrophobicities were studied under in vivo, static headspace, and artificial throat conditions. The effect of oil content on orthonasal and retronasal perceived intensity of <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> was studied using a seven-person panel. With increasing oil content {{and with a}} higher hydrophobicity of the aroma compound, a stronger decrease in aroma release was found. This effect was stronger under static headspace conditions than under in vivo and artificial throat conditions, and the sensory intensity of <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> was perceived stronger orthonasally than retronasally. The lowest effective oil content was determined for all systems. Of the compounds tested, droplet size distribution only influenced the in vivo release of geranyl acetate. The artificial throat results correlated well with in vivo release, giving support to the assumption that {{a thin layer of}} liquid remaining in the throat after swallowing determines aroma release...|$|E
40|$|Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two model {{systems of}} {{molecular}} biology, interact in the wild, but the chemical {{basis of this}} interaction is largely unknown. This thesis details an effort to understand the molecular basis of this ecological co-localization. Results: 	While screening a collection of wild and laboratory yeast strains {{for their ability to}} attract adult D. melanogaster (Raleigh 437), I noticed a large difference in fly preference for two nearly isogenic strains of S. cerevisiae, BY 4741 and BY 4742. Using standard genetic analyses, I tracked the difference in preference to lack of mitochondria in BY 4742. I used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to examine the volatile compounds produced by BY 4741 and the mitochondria-deficient BY 4742, and found that they differed in their production of many known fly attractants, including <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate, which were produced at much higher levels in yeast strains with mitochondria during aerobic fermentation, a metabolic strategy that distinguishes S. cerevisiae from most other microbes. Through a detailed investigation of the volatile profiles and RNA expression patterns produced by yeast under multiple nutritional scenarios, I determined that the production of <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate during aerobic fermentation depends on the level and type of nitrogen present in the substrate. Fermentative growth on nitrogen-limited substrates requires mitochondrial engagement and the metabolic configuration employed by S. cerevisiae to contend with this nutritional scenario results in the production of these ester attractants. This nutritional scenario – high sugar but limited nitrogen – matches the composition of fruit, the natural co-localization environment for flies and yeast, suggesting that these volatiles are ecologically relevant cues for D. melanogaster. D. melanogaster sense <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate via the odorant receptor genes Or 22 a and Or 22 b. A single gene version of this locus, which is a chimera of the two ancestral copies, is segregating in natural D. melanogaster populations. I found that D. melanogaster lines harboring the chimeric locus (including Raleigh 437) show more robust preference for <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate-producing S. cerevisiae cultures. This provides an ecological basis, and possibly selective advantage, for the maintenance of this allele in D. melanogaster...|$|E
30|$|The {{recombinant}} P. pastoris expressing EHT 1 or EEB 1, {{as well as}} P. pastoris containing empty vector (control), were cultivated on brewer’s wort. After 12  h methanol induction, {{formation of}} volatile compounds was assessed by SPME GC–MS analysis. Phenethyl alcohol was detected from all the cell cultures, indicating this compound is an endogenous metabolite derived from P. pastoris yeast itself from wort medium used. Apart from phenethyl alcohol, none of volatile ester compounds was observed from the control strain. For the recombinant strains, production of ethyl esters was observed to increase with the increasing chain length from C 6 to C 10. As shown in Fig.  2, recombinant yeast P. pastoris-EHT 1 produced fatty acid ethyl esters including <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> (C 6), ethyl octanoate (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), corresponding to 2, 10 and 11  % of total volatiles, respectively. Similarly, during fermentation with the P. pastoris-EEB 1, the levels were 1, 7 and 13  % of total volatiles for <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> (C 6), ethyl octanoate (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), respectively. In addition, {{it is interesting to}} note that ethyl laurate (C 12) and ethyl myristate (C 14) were produced by P. pastoris-EHT 1, but not by P. pastoris-EEB 1, although they were only present in relatively small quantities. It should be noted that the value above was expressed in relative abundance of the gas phase, and an overall quantification of these compounds indicated that P. pastoris-EEB 1 produced higher amounts of esters compared to P. pastoris-EHT 1 expect for <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> (see Additional file 3), probably due to higher expression level of yeast enzyme Eeb 1 extracellularly.|$|E

40|$|The biotechnological {{production}} of aromatic compounds {{is an important}} alternative to the chemical synthesis of flavor ingredients in food industry. Therefore, {{the development of an}} accurate and precise analytical technique for the measurement of the biotechnological {{production of}} aromatic compounds is of significant importance. In this paper, we optimize the extraction conditions for headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to GC-FID and GC-MS for the determination of <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> produced by Neurospora sitophila in a malt-extract medium. Following three SPME fibers were tested: polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) and polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB). The PDMS/DVB was the most efficient fiber for trapping the volatile aromatic compound. The optimized SPME extraction temperature and time were 30 °C and 10 min, respectively. This method showed good linearity and the limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) of the targeted aromatic compound were 0. 6 and 1. 9 mg L- 1, respectively. The HS-SPME methodology proved to be a simple and rapid approach to quantify <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> accurately and precisely for the biotechnological production process. This journal i...|$|E
40|$|Some {{commercial}} whey {{protein concentrates}} (WPCs) were analyzed {{in order to}} determine the composition and relative content of the various whey protein fractions. The retention capacity of a homologous series of ester compounds (ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate)</b> was investigated in model systems and the data were also compared with those measured in the presence of P-lactoglobulin. The flavour/matrix interactions were studied using headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas-chromatography (HS-SPME-GC). The results showed that the WPCs considered differed in terms of protein, fat and lactose content. Moreover, the WPCs were also different as regards the relative content of single whey protein fractions (P-lactoglobulin, a-lactalbumin, immunoglobulins, proteose-peptones). These differences had a great effect on the aroma retention capacity. The WPCs showed aroma retention properties only for more hydrophobic ester compounds. The higher retention value for <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> measured in one of the WPCs was probably due to the higher fat content in this sample. Finally, no statistically significant retention property was found in the WPC sample that has been modified by thermal denaturation during manufacture to improve gelling properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{profile of}} {{volatile}} compounds of yellow {{passion fruit juice}} was analyzed by solid phase microextraction headspace (HS-SPME) and optimized static headspace (S-HS) extraction techniques. Time, temperature, NaCl concentration and sample volume headspace equilibrium parameters was adjusted to the S-HS technique. The gaseous phase in the headspace of samples was collected and injected into a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer. In the HS-SPME technique was identified 44 volatile compounds from the yellow passion fruit juice, but with S-HS only 30 compounds were identified. Volatile esters were majority in both techniques, being identified ethyl butanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> (3 z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, hexyl acetate, hexyl butanoate and hexyl hexanoate. Aldehydes and ketones were not identified in S-HS, but were in HS-SPME. &# 946;-Pinene, p-cymene, limonene, (Z) -&# 946;-ocimene, (E) -&# 946;-ocimene, &# 947;-terpinene, &# 945;-terpinolene and (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 - nonatriene terpenes were identified in both techniques.

40|$|Research ArticlePartition {{coefficients}} give {{an indication}} of the retention of aroma compounds by the food matrix. Data in the literature are obtained by various methods, under various conditions and expressed in various units, and it is thus difficult to compare the results. The aim {{of the present study was}} first to obtain gas/water and gas/matrix partition coefficients of selected aroma compounds, at different temperatures, in order to calculate thermodynamic parameters and second to compare the retention of these aroma compounds in different food matrices. RESULTS: Yogurts containing lipids and proteins induced a higher retention of aroma compounds than model gel matrices. The observed effects strongly depend on hydrophobicity of aroma compounds showing a retention for <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> and a salting out effect for ethyl acetate. A small but noticeable decrease in enthalpy of affinity is observed for ethyl butyrate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> between water and food matrices, suggesting that the energy needed for the volatilization is lower in matrices than in water. CONCLUSION: The composition and complexity of a food matrix influence gas/matrix partition coefficients or aroma compounds in function of their hydrophobicity and to a lower extent enthalpy of vaporization...|$|E
