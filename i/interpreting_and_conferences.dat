40|$|Television <b>Interpreting</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>Interpreting</b> {{have always}} been {{regarded}} as profoundly different {{in terms of the}} expected performance <b>and</b> the <b>interpreting</b> strategies utilized. Television interpreting is a multi-faceted activity, requiring a particular mind-set and special communicative skills: television interpreters produce their own text, in an attempt to ensure coherence and convey the same effect that the speaker wants to obtain, with little or no possibility of using décalage due to the pragmatic context. The paper investigates how the flow of discourse is managed by television interpreters, with a special focus on the use of prosody and discourse markers. The analysis is conducted on a corpus of recorded texts, interpreted in simultaneous mode by a professional conference interpreter, working for public television. The typology of the interpreted event is the press conference interview, characterized by a rapid question and answer format. Through this analysis, we shall outline a profile of television interpreters <b>and</b> their <b>interpreting</b> strategies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the potential influence of audience design on interpreters’ behaviour in the genre of interpreted government press conferences. The interpreters of these government press conferences are required to follow the principle of ‘faithfulness, accuracy and completeness’ but casual observation suggests that the interpreters do depart from this principle. The hypothesis on which the present study is founded is that audience design, that is the adjustment of a speaker’s output to suit a particular participation framework, is involved in interpreters’ performance. In order to test this hypothesis, the theoretical framework of the study draws upon theories from <b>interpreting</b> studies, sociolinguistics <b>and</b> pragmatics. The investigation is carried out through a study of participation frameworks, face management strategies and information management strategies in an authentic corpus constructed by the author, comprising three <b>interpreted</b> <b>and</b> televised press <b>conferences</b> held by the Chinese Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are chosen to analyze the selected parameters in order that recurrent patterns can be identified. The study confirms the hypothesis that the interpreters’ behaviour varies in accordance with the particular audience (i. e. the primary intended receiver) that they have in mind to serve at any given moment. This study shows that human factors are involved and challenges the public perception that interpreters are mere sounding machines with little or no personal agency.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to share some {{considerations}} on interpreting from three points of view: profession, training and research. The first part is devoted to a bird’s eye view on mediation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> as they have been developing in Italy in the last fifteen years. This overview shows considerable fragmentation and, according to the author, an excessive emphasis on techniques <b>and</b> separation. <b>Conference</b> <b>interpreting,</b> on one side, is still considered “first-class” interpreting, although the national market is constantly changing and can, potentially, offer other occasions for <b>interpreting</b> <b>and</b> mediation as a result of massive migration. “Potentially” since this need is not taken into due account by public institutions which go on satisfying these multilinguistic and multicultural needs on an emergency basis. University training offer, on the other side, is trying to comply with new mediation needs, maintaining some courses in <b>conferences</b> <b>interpreting,</b> sometimes mixed <b>and</b> joined with liaison interpreting. The author’s final proposal is to avoid fragmentation and separation and try to focus more on continuities and common points between <b>interpreting</b> <b>and</b> mediation than on technicalities and diversities. Some practical examples are given...|$|R
