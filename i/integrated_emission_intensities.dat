40|$|The {{appearance}} time of an analyte {{relative to}} {{the timing of the}} sample probe insertion is an important factor that determines the integrated intensity and precision of direct sample insertion inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The ICP background drops significantly with the insertion of a sample probe. Matrix effects can be severe if the the analyte appearance times are shifted {{relative to the}} background drop. In this study, matrix effects of NaCl on the temporal emission profiles and <b>integrated</b> <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> of Zn I and Zn II were shown to relate to the appearance time of the analyte. The peak maxima of the temporal profiles of Zn I and Zn II emissions were displaced by about 0. 2 s in an aqueous matrix, but the maxima coincided in NaCl matrices. In addition, <b>integrated</b> <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> of the more difficult to excite Zn II species increased with an earlier appearance time. The changes in peak profiles and relative intensities are due to redistribution in the proportion of Zn atoms and Zn ions in the vaporized Zn population. The effects of the appearance time of Zn were further demonstrated using different sample probe insertion speeds to change the appearance time of the analyte relative to the background drop. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|Strong {{localization}} {{effect in}} self-assembled InGaN quantum dots (QDs) grown by metalorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} has been evidenced by temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) at different excitation power. The <b>integrated</b> <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> increases gradually {{in the range from}} 30 to 160 K and then decreases with a further increase in temperature at high excitation intensity, while this phenomenon disappeared at low excitation intensity. Under high excitation, about 40 % emission enhancement at 160 K compared to that at low temperature, as well as a higher internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 41.1 %, was observed. A strong localization model is proposed to describe the possible processes of carrier transport, relaxation, and recombination. Using this model, the evolution of excitation-power-dependent <b>emission</b> <b>intensity,</b> shift of peak energy, and linewidth variation with elevating temperature is well explained. Finally, two-component decays of time-resolved PL (TRPL) with various excitation intensities are observed and analyzed with the biexponential model, which enables us to further understand the carrier relaxation dynamics in the InGaN QDs.|$|R

40|$|While {{fluorescence}} microscopy {{has become an}} essential tool amongst chemists and biologists {{for the detection of}} various analyte within cellular environments, non-uniform spatial distribution of sensors within cells often restricts extraction of reliable information on relative abundance of analytes in different subcellular regions. As an alternative to existing sensing methodologies such as ratiometric or FRET imaging, where relative proportion of analyte with respect to the sensor can be obtained within cells, we propose a methodology using spectrally-resolved {{fluorescence microscopy}}, via which both the relative abundance of sensor as well as their relative proportion with respect to the analyte can be simultaneously extracted for local subcellular regions. This method is exemplified using a BODIPY sensor, capable of detecting mercury ions within cellular environments, characterized by spectral blue-shift and concurrent enhancement of emission intensity. Spectral emission envelopes collected from sub-microscopic regions allowed us to compare the shift in transition energies as well as <b>integrated</b> <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> within various intracellular regions. Construction of a 2 D scatter plot using spectral shifts and emission intensities, which depend on the relative amount of analyte with respect to sensor and the approximate local amounts of the probe, respectively, enabled qualitative extraction of relative abundance of analyte in various local regions within a single cell as well as amongst different cells. Although the comparisons remain semi-quantitative, this approach involving analysis of multiple spectral parameters opens up an alternative way to extract spatial distribution of analyte in heterogeneous systems. The proposed method would be especially relevant for fluorescent probes that undergo relatively nominal shift in transition energies compared to their emission bandwidths, which often restricts their usage for quantitative ratiometric imaging in cellular media due to strong cross-talk between energetically separated detection channels...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{difficulties}} {{in the implementation of}} organic-dye-based random lasers is the tendency of organic dyes to irreversibly photodecay. In this letter we report the observation of "reversible" photodegradation in a Rhodamine 6 G and ZrO$_ 2 $ nanoparticle doped polyurethane random laser. We find that during degradation the emission broadens, redshifts, and decreases in intensity. After degradation the system is observed to self-heal leading to the emission returning to its pristine intensity, giving a recovery efficiency of 100 %. While the peak intensity fully recovers, the process is not strictly "reversible" as the emission after recovery is still found to be broadened and redshifted. The combination of the peak emission fully recovering and the broadening of the emission leads to a remarkable result: the random laser cycled through degradation and recovery has a greater <b>integrated</b> <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> than the pristine system.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{interrogate}} structure-function photophysical properties on lanthanide-doped nanoscale materials will define their utility in next-generation applications and devices that capitalize on their size, light-conversion efficiencies, emissive wavelengths, syntheses, and environmental stabilities. The two main topics of this dissertation are (i) the interrogation of laser power-dependent quantum yield and total radiant flux metrics for a homogeneous, solution phase upconversion nanocrystal composition under both continuous wave and femtosecond-pulsed excitation utilizing a custom engineered absolute measurement system, and (ii) the synthesis, characterization, and power-dependent x-ray excited scintillation properties of [Y 2 O 3; Eu] nanocrystals, and their integration into a fiber-optic radiation sensing device capable of in vivo dosimetry. Presented herein is the laser power-dependent total radiant flux and absolute quantum yield measurements of homogeneous, solution-phase [NaYF 4; Yb (15 %), Er (2 %) ] upconversion nanocrystals, and further compares the quantitative total radiant flux and absolute quantum yield measurements under both 970 nm continuous-wave and 976 nm pulsed Ti-Sapphire laser excitation (140 fs pulse-width, 80 MHz). This study demonstrates that at comparable excitation densities under continuous-wave and fs-pulsed excitation from 42 - 284 W/cm 2, the absolute quantum yield, {{and the total}} radiant flux per unit volume, are within a factor of two when spectra are integrated over the 500 - 700 nm wavelength regime. This study further establishes the radiant flux as the true unit of merit for quantifying emissive output intensity of upconverting nanocrystals for application purposes, especially given the high uncertainty in solution phase upconversion nanocrystal quantum yield measurements due to their low absorption cross-section. Additionally, a commercially available bulk [NaYF 4; Yb (20 %), Er (3 %) ] upconversion sample was measured in the solid-state to provide a total radiant flux and absolute quantum yield standard. The measurements were accomplished utilizing a custom-engineered, multi-detector integrating sphere measurement system that can measure spectral sample emission in Watts on a flux-calibrated (W/nm) CCD-spectrometer, enabling the direct measurement of the total radiant flux without need for an absorbance or quantum yield value. Also presented is the development and characterization of a scintillating nanocrystalline composition, [Y 2 -x O 3; Eu x, Li y], in which Eu and Li dopant ion concentrations were systematically varied in order to define the most emissive compositions under specific x-ray excitation conditions. It is shown that these optimized [Y 2 -x O 3; Eu x, Li y] compositions display scintillation responses that: (i) correlate linearly with incident radiation exposure at x-ray energies spanning from 40 - 220 kVp, and (ii) manifest no evidence of scintillation intensity saturation at the highest evaluated radiation exposures [up to 4 Roentgen per second]. X-ray excitation energies of 40, 120, and 220 kVp were chosen to probe the dependence of the integrated emission intensity upon x-ray exposure-rate in energy regimes where either the photoelectric or the Compton effect governs the scintillation mechanism on the most emissive [Y 2 -x O 3; Eu x, Li y] composition, [Y 1. 9 O 3; Eu 0. 1, Li 0. 16]. These experiments demonstrate for nanoscale [Y 2 -x O 3; Eu x], that for comparable radiation exposures, when scintillation is governed by the photoelectric effect (120 kVp excitation), greater <b>integrated</b> <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> are recorded relative to excitation energies where the Compton effect regulates scintillation (220 kVp excitation). The nanoscale [Y 1. 9 O 3; Eu 0. 1, Li 0. 16] was further exploited as a detector material in a prototype fiber-optic radiation sensor. The scintillation intensity from a [Y 1. 9 O 3; Eu 0. 1, Li 0. 16]-modified optical fiber tip, recorded using a CCD-photodetector or a Si-photodiode, was correlated with radiation exposure using a Precision XRAD 225 Cx small-animal image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) system, an orthovoltage cabinet-irradiator, and a clinical X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) machine. For all x-ray energies tested from 80 - 225 kVp, this near-radiotransparent device recorded scintillation intensities that tracked linearly with total radiation exposure, highlighting its capability to provide alternately accurate dosimetry measurements for both diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy treatment. Because Si-based CCD and photodiode detectors manifest maximal sensitivities over the emission range of nanoscale [Y 1. 9 O 3; Eu 0. 1, Li 0. 16], the timing speeds, sizes, and low power-consumption of these devices, coupled with the detection element's linear dependence of scintillation intensity with radiation dose, demonstrates the opportunity for next-generation radiation exposure measuring devices for in/ex vivo applications that are ultra-small, inexpensive, and accurate.

Three distinct dissociation processes are observed for the well-resolved hole cyclotron replicas ("shake-up") of positive trions bound to neutral acceptors in the spin-doublet state (SU-A 0 Xd+). To demonstrate that the hole involved in the shake-up process is not bound by the Coulomb interaction to the charged A 0 X+ complex, we calculate the valence Landau levels using the Luttinger model beyond the axial approximation. The calculated value of the hole cyclotron energy agrees well with the experimental data for the energy separation of the A 0 X+ and SU-A 0 X+ lines, determined from the emission spectra. At low temperatures, below 6 K, the dominant dissociation results in a free hole and an exciton bound to the neutral acceptor in the spin-singlet or -triplet state, (A 0 Xd+→A 0 Xs+h or A 0 Xt+h). At higher temperatures, above 9 K, the dissociation into the free positive trion and the neutral acceptor (A 0 Xd+→A 0 +X+) predominates.

We use novel spatial panel data models to analyze the drivers of energy-related <b>emission</b> <b>intensity,</b> which we posit are characterized by spatial dependence.

40|$|Abstract: Understanding {{international}} {{differences in}} the <b>emissions</b> <b>intensity</b> of trade and production is essential to understanding the effects of greenhouse gas limitation policies. We develop data on emissions from 41 industrial sectors in 39 countries and estimate the CO 2 <b>emissions</b> <b>intensity</b> of production and trade. We find no evidence that developing countries specialize in emissions-intensive sectors; instead, <b>emissions</b> <b>intensities</b> differ systematically across countries because of differences in production techniques. Thus, the technology of developing countries drives the greater <b>emissions</b> <b>intensity</b> of their exports. Our results suggest that international differences in <b>emissions</b> <b>intensity,</b> while substantial, do not play {{a significant factor in}} determining patterns of trade...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} background continuum emission in inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) is proposed. The method {{assumes that the}} ICP background continuum emission is mainly due to recombinative radiation in the plasma. The <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at an arbitrary wavelength {{is related to the}} temperature and electron number density of the plasma. Furthermore, the ratio of background continuum <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at two arbitrary plasma excitation conditions is a constant for all wavelengths. Therefore, if there is a change in plasma excitation conditions, the new background continuum <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the initial background <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> and the <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> ratio that can be measured accurately at another convenient wavelength. In this paper, rather than the <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> ratio, the ratio of the differences in intensities is used to remove the contribution of dark current in the measured intensity, if any. The ratio is termed 'f-factor'. Firstly, the background <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> at two reference plasma excitation conditions are measured. The f-factors of these two background <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> are assigned values 0 and 1, respectively. When the plasma excitation condition changes, the f-factor relative to the reference conditions at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the new <b>emission</b> <b>intensity.</b> The background <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at other wavelengths can then be determined from their corresponding <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> at the reference conditions and the new f-factor. Background <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> of the ICP (λ= 200 - 460 nm) is measured using an ICP spectrometer with a segmented-array imaging detector. The ICP forward power was varied from 800 to 1500 W. In agreement of the model, the f-factors at any wavelengths remain constant at all forward power used. The proposed method was compared to off-peak background correction method. Analyte concentrations were selected to give signal-to-background ratio of ∼ 1. The corrected analyte <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> using both background correction methods agree, except for Ca 396. 847 nm, which suffers from spectral overlap from a nearby hydrogen emission line. The ability of the proposed method for background correction of fast changing background emission was demonstrated using direct sample insertion and a direct reading multi-channel spectrometer. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|International audienceWe {{explore the}} {{contribution}} of product mix in determining firm and aggregate <b>emission</b> <b>intensity.</b> First, using detailed firm-product <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> data from India, we find that more efficient firms are less emission intensive, and that products with the largest sales tend to be cleaner than other products within the firm. We also find that <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> in India dropped significantly between 1990 - 2010 through reallocations across firms, while product mix played a counteracting role in increasing firm <b>emission</b> <b>intensity.</b> Next, we develop a multi-product multi-factor model with heterogeneous firms, variable markups, and monopolistic competition in which each product has a specific <b>emission</b> <b>intensity.</b> We find that pro-competitive market developments lead to an improvement in the aggregate <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> – through reallocations across firms – even though firms can become dirtier or cleaner through product mix.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} uncertainties of total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> estimated using an input-output (I-O) table for a life-cycle inventory analysis. The validity of the total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> has been questioned mainly because the amounts of commodities are measured in monetary units, and because various commodities are produced in a single sector of an existing I-O table. In this study, first, a sensitivity analysis of total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> estimated using the Japanese I-O table was performed to identify the elements that significantly influence the total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensity.</b> If an influential element identified by sensitivity analysis varies widely, the total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> is greatly influenced. Secondly, how much total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> vary associated with the variation of those influential elements was evaluated. It was concluded that the evaluation of uncertainties using a stochastic approach {{as well as the}} improvement of accuracy by disaggregating the original I-O sectors, focusing on influential elements, are important. ...|$|R

We find that: (1) energy intensity effect is confirmed as the dominant contributor to the decline in CO 2 emission and CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensity,</b> (2) economic activity effect is the most important contributor to increased CO 2 emission, and (3) economic structure and CO 2 emission coefficient effects are found to contribute little to the changes in CO 2 emission and CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensity,</b> which actually increased CO 2 emission and CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> over the period 1991 - 2006 except for several years.
