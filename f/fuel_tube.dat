This paper describes a plan of exploratory tests to determine the conditions under which flames will and will not propagate to the ends of pipes attached to coupling specimens of various sizes. An initial series of tests will be conducted by igniting a hydrogen gas mixture with a small spark at the interior of tube specimens of various diameters to determine the conditions that let the flame appear at the open end of the pipe. A second group of tests will be conducted on couplings attached to short tube ends and arranged to produce an arc that is exposed to the interior of the coupling when typical currents are conducted through the coupling.

Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) /Chemical & Hydrogen Technology Section (CHTS) identified a flow sheet for the dissolution of these Mark 42 <b>fuel</b> <b>tubes</b> which required a more aggressive dissolver solution than previously required for irradiated Mark 42 <b>fuel</b> <b>tubes.</b> Subsequently, SRTC/MTS was requested to develop and perform a corrosion testing program {{to assess the impact}} of new flow sheets on corrosion of the dissolver wall. The two primary variables evaluated were the fluoride and aluminum concentrations of the dissolver solution. Fluoride was added as Calcium Fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }) while the aluminum was added either as metallic aluminum, which was subsequently dissolved, or as the chemical aluminum nitrate (Al(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 }). The dissolved aluminum metal was used to simulate the dissolution of the aluminum from the Mark 42 cladding and fuel matrix. Solution composition for the corrosion tests bracketed the flow sheet for the Mark 42. Corrosion rates of AISI Type 304 stainless steel coupons, both welded and non-welded coupons, were calculated from measured weight losses and post-test concentrations of soluble Fe, Cr and Ni. The corrosion rates, which ranged between 2. 7 and 32. 5 mpy, were calculated from both the one day and the one week weight losses. These corrosion rates indicated a relatively mild corrosion on the dissolver vessel. The welded coupons consistently had a higher corrosion rate than the non-welded coupons. The difference between the two decreased as the solution aggressiveness decreased. In these test solutions, aggressiveness corresponded with the fluoride concentration. Based on the results of this study, any corrosion occurring during the Mark 42 Campaign is not expected to have a deleterious effect on the dissolver vessel...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{critical}} experiments were completed in 1962 - 1965 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Critical Experiments Facility {{in support of}} the Medium-Power Reactor Experiments (MPRE) program. In the late 1950 ’s efforts were made to study “power plants for the production of electrical power in space vehicles”. The MPRE program was a part of those efforts and studied the feasibility of a stainless steel system, boiling potassium 1 MW(t), or about 140 kW(e), reactor. The program was carried out in [fiscal years] 1964, 1965, and 1966. A summary of the program’s effort was compiled in 1967. The delayed critical experiments were a mockup of a small, potassium-cooled space power reactor for validation of reactor calculations and reactor physics methods. Initial experiments, performed in November and December of 1962, consisted of a core of 253 unmoderated stainless steel tubes, each containing 26 UO 2 fuel pellets, surrounded by a graphite reflector. Measurements were made to determine critical reflector arrangements, fission-rate distributions, and cadmium ratio distributions. “The [assemblies were built] on [a] vertical assembly machine so that the movable part was the core and bottom reflector. ” The first two experiments in the series were evaluated in HEU-COMP-FAST- 001 (SCCA-FUND-EXP- 001) and HEU-COMP-FAST- 002 (SCCA-FUND-EXP- 002). The first experiment had the 253 <b>fuel</b> <b>tubes</b> packed tightly into a 22. 87 cm outside diameter (OD) core tank (References 1 and 2). The second experiment in the series, performed in early 1963, had the 253 <b>fuel</b> <b>tubes</b> at a 1. 506 -cm triangular lattice in a 25. 96 cm OD core tank and graphite reflectors on all sides. The third set of experiments in the series, performed in mid- 1963, which is studied in this evaluation, used beryllium reflectors. The beryllium reflected system was the preferred reactor configuration for this application because of the small thickness of the reflector. The two core configurations had the 253 <b>fuel</b> <b>tubes</b> at a 1. 506 -cm triangular lattice and arranged in 7 -tube clusters.

40|$|The blowout {{limits of}} a number of swirl-stabilized, nonpremixed flames were measured, and the {{observed}} trends are successfully explained by applying certain concepts that previously have been applied only to nonswirling flames. It is shown that swirl flame blowout limits can be compared to well-known limits for nonswirling simple diffusion flames by using the proper nondimensional parameter, i. e., the inverse Damkohler number (UF/dF) /(SL 2 /[alpha]F). The fuel velocity at blowout (UF) was measured while four parameters were systematically varied: the <b>fuel</b> <b>tube</b> diameter (dF), the fuel type and thus reaction rate, which is related to the maximum laminar burning velocity (SL), the coaxial air velocity (UA), and the swirl number. Results show that for zero swirl, the blowout curves agree with curves predicted by previous analysis. However, as swirl is added, the flame becomes five times more stable (based on maximum fuel velocity). To explain the effect of swirl, a simple analysis is presented that is an extension of previous nonswirling flame blowout theory. It shows that the conventional swirl number is not the appropriate governing parameter. Instead, a Damkohler number based on swirl velocity is suggested by the analysis and is found to help collapse the data at the rich blowout limit to a single, general curve. Swirl causes a jet-vortex interaction; the recirculation vortex reduces the fuel jet velocity on centerline, which strongly stabilizes the lifted flame. As one increases the <b>fuel</b> <b>tube</b> diameter or the reaction rate (by adding hydrogen), the swirl flame becomes more stable, {{in a manner similar to}} a nonswirling flame. Another advantage of swirl is that it makes overall fuel-lean operation possible; the present flame is unstable without swirl for fuel-lean conditions...|$|E

40|$|Fuel {{cladding}} {{is one of}} the {{key components}} in a fission reactor that confines radioactive materials inside a <b>fuel</b> <b>tube.</b> During reactor operation, however, cladding is sometimes breached, and radioactive materials leak from the fuel pellet into the coolant water through the breach.

Depending on the measured leakage concentration, the faulty fuel assembly with leaking rod is removed from the reactor and replaced immediately or at the next refueling. In the present study, an effort has been made to develop a methodology to optimize the management for replacement of faulty fuel assemblies due to cladding failures using measured leakage concentration. A model numerical equation is proposed to describe the time evolution of an increase in I- 131 concentration due to cladding failures and is then solved using the Monte Carlo method as a function of sampling rate.

40|$|In {{the first}} moments {{following}} the pipe break, of a DEGB LOCA, the depressurization wave is postulated to propagate rapidly through the system, {{in the manner}} of an acoustic or water hammer wave. this is immediately followed by a (reflected) repressurization wave, as the flow of coolant through the break is established. The pressure history is then dictated by the flow from the break and the ability of the pressurizer, pumps and accumulators to supply coolant. The initial sudden drop in pressure may result in the system pressure falling below the saturation pressure of the coolant. This could, in turn, result in bubble formation. Such immediate vapor formation (prompt nucleation of bubbles), in the period before the repressurization wave restores the system pressure to a level above the saturation pressure might initiate flow instability. Such an interruption in flow would allow the <b>fuel</b> <b>tube</b> clad temperature to increase rapidly.
