2500|$|Golden eagles {{generally}} hunt grouse {{using the}} “contour flight with short glide attack” method, since grouse are {{often found in}} small groups.

The eagle will frequently abandon the hunt after the grouse has flown, since it is unlikely to overtake such prey in the air unless it gains height over its quarry very quickly, although it may be able to gain the appropriate height to tail chase a grouse or even catch it while flying high using the “high soar with vertical stoop attack”. In Idaho a juvenile eagle was observed dropping a rock near a <b>dusky</b> <b>grouse</b> (Dendragapus obscurus), possibly attempting to spook it into flight so it could be overtaken from a flying height advantage.

The birds include spotted owl, <b>dusky</b> <b>grouse</b> (Dendragapus obscurus) {{and a number of}} birds of prey.

50|$|These {{are large}} grouse that inhabit {{highland}} regions of North America and Eurasia. The sooty grouse {{is found in}} the Pacific Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada, and the <b>dusky</b> <b>grouse</b> in the Rocky Mountains. These two taxa were originally regarded as separate species, but were considered conspecific for much of the twentieth century. However, in 2006 the American Ornithologists' Union re-split them, following the DNA-based work of Barrowclough et al. (2004). whose results supported the earlier work of Brooks (1929) who regarded the two taxa as separate species based on morphology, behavior and vocalizations. The precise ranges of the two species are well-defined in the south, separated by extensive areas of unsuitable forest-free habitat, but somewhat uncertain in the north of the range of the genus where there is no separation; Barrowclough et al.'s study did not include these northern populations.|$|E
