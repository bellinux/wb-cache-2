60|$|In the {{afternoon}} the wind considerably increased, and, as a pretty heavy sea was still running, the tender rode very hard, when Mr. Taylor, the commander, {{found it necessary}} to take in the bowsprit, and strike the fore and main topmasts, that she might ride more easily. After consulting {{about the state of the}} weather, it was resolved to leave the artificers on board this evening, and carry only the smiths to the rock, as the sharpening of the irons was rather behind, from their being so much broken and blunted by the hard and tough nature of the rock, which became much more compact and hard as the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation</b> was increased. Besides avoiding the risk of encumbering the boats with a number of men who had not yet got the full command of the oar in a breach of sea, the writer had another motive for leaving them behind. He wanted to examine the site of the building without interruption, and to take the comparative levels of the different inequalities of its area; and as it would have been painful to have seen men standing idle upon the Bell Rock, where all moved with activity, it was judged better to leave them on board. The boats landed at half-past seven p.m., and the landing-master, with the seamen, was employed during this tide in cutting the seaweeds from the several paths leading to the landing-places, to render walking more safe, for, from the slippery state of the surface of the rock, many severe tumbles had taken place. In the meantime the writer took the necessary levels, and having carefully examined the site of the building and considered all its parts, it still appeared to be necessary to excavate to the average depth of fourteen inches over the whole area of the foundation.|$|E

It is found that the formation of a hinge, about which the coherent ejecta flap rotates at the rim of the transient crater, divides material in the flow field into ejected and downward and outward-driven portions. Ejected material originates from an excavation cavity whose geometry is distinct from that of the transient crater. The shallow <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation</b> both observed in impact and explosion craters and predicted by the Z-model flow fields imply that thickness estimates of such lunar geologic units as the maria basalts, which are determined by assuming that excavation depths are similar to (1) final or (2) transient crater depths, must be reduced by factors of two to three respectively.

50|$|A rock burst is a spontaneous, violent {{fracture}} of rock {{that can occur}} in deep mines. The opening of a mine shaft relieves neighboring rocks of tremendous pressure, which can literally cause the rock to explode as it attempts to re-establish equilibrium.

50|$|Some designs {{elect to}} simply leave a crawl space under the house, {{rather than a}} full {{basement}} due to structural challenges. Most other designs justify further excavations to create a full-height basement, sufficient for another level of living space. Even so, basements in Canada and the northern United States were typically only 7 ft in height, rather than the standard full 8 ft of the main floors. Older homes may have even lower basement heights as the basement walls were concrete block and thus, could be customized to any height. Modern builders offer higher basements as an option. The cost of the additional <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation</b> is usually quite expensive. Thus, houses almost certainly never have multi-storey basements though 9 ft basements heights are a frequent choice among new home buyers.

The proposed dam site at Polavaram is located where the river emerges from the last range of the Eastern Ghats into plains covered with deep alluvial sandy strata. At Polavaram, the river width is about 1500 m. In view of large <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation</b> {{which is more than}} 30 m deep, to reach hard rock at this dam site, the dam project was not found economical to take up. However a lucrative alternate site is feasible located in upstream of Polavaram site where the river passes through deep gorges of Papi hill range. The width of river is about 300 m only in the rocky gorge stretch. Thirty years back, this alternative was found technologically challenging task to connect the reservoir with the irrigation canals via tunnels across the ghat area. Also costly underground hydro electric station is mandated compared to river bed based hydro electric station.When the project was actually taken up in the year 2004, the old finalised designs at Polavaram site are adopted without re-examining the latest cost of upstream alternate site in view of state of the art construction technology of tunnels and underground hydro electric station. The progress up to the year 2012 in construction of dam structures and the hydro electric station is almost nil. The alternate site located in the gorge stretch is still worth of re-examination to reduce the ever-increasing cost of Polavaram dam.|$|E

40|$|Modern urban policies, {{particularly}} in major towns, involve the active use of underground space that poses {{the problem of}} assessing the impact of excavation on the existing buildings {{as one of the}} most urgent. Surface and semi-closed construction methods are currently widespread in the process of urban civil and transport underground facilities construction. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation</b> can reach 30 m, but more often, in everyday practice common foundation pits have shallower depth, accommodating 2 - 4 underground levels (6 - 12 m). In the process of solving such problems not only the forces occurring in the foundation pit fence are of great interest, but also a quantitative change in the stress-strain state of the rock mass. In modern engineering practice in order to solve them numerical methods based on the finite element method are widely applied, which can quantify soil stress-strain state. In this study, the authors present the investigation of the influence of various factors within their variation on the additional deformations of adjacent buildings located in the influence zone, using the design of experiment method. The study is based on 3 -dimensional numerical simulation with the use of finite element method. Such calculated factors were taken: the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation</b> (X), modulus of deformation (X), the distance to the building (X) and distributed load of the building (X). As a result, regression equations to determine the maximum additional deformationof building and horizontal displacement of the pit fence were derived from the calculations carried out.

40|$|Lateral {{movement}} of sheet pile driven in soft soils {{has been a}} major problem in geotechnical engineering. It was reported that the conventional theories such as Rankine and Coulomb theory has overpredicted the lateral movement, hence causing inaccuracy. On top of that, the behavior of lateral movement on soft soil is not well understood since it is complicated and involved many parameters. So, the objectives of this study are to understand the behavior of soft soil in terms of lateral movement and to measure the amount of lateral movement on soft soil using physical laboratory model and Finite Element Method, which is PL AXIS. Excavation work has been conducted on the physical model {{and at the same time}} the available models in PLAXIS software such as MohrCoulomb (MC), Hardening-Soil (HS), Soft Soil (SS) and Soft Soil Creep (SSC) model were employed to predict the amount of movement during excavation. Based on the results, the amount of lateral movement is proportional to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation.</b> The lateral movement increases as the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>excavation</b> increases. Moreover, through physical modeling, it was found that the angle of wedge failure is the same as Rankine theory which is (45 °+ 0 / 2). Besides that, through Finite Element Method, it was observed that the Soft Soil Creep model gives more accurate results since this model is specially design for soft soil problems. As a recommendion, this study can be enhanced by using centrifuge model due to its ability to replicate the real soil unit weight, therefore producing more reliable results. In terms of Finite Element Method, 3 -D model should be engaged in order to obtain more accurate results...|$|E

To construct the trough model the data of instrumental measurements on core lines are used.

The measured maximum settlements of the six metro excavations fell within zone I of the Peck classical normalized settlement-distance chart. These small measured settlements were consistent with the small measured wall deflections.

This contribution shows a case study on deep excavation in soft soils overlying bedrock at the South Link tunnel project in Stockholm. The behaviors of sheet pile walls and retained soils at the South Link show that both lateral displacement and settlement are larger than the magnitude from similar case histories. Exemplified by a test section, the features of lateral displacement are analyzed with monitoring and PLAXIS simulating results. The analysis results indicate that the displacement mainly occurs during the upper excavations and that the beneficial influence of bedrock may be overshadowed by the low strength <b>of</b> soils where <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>excavation</b> bottom to bedrock is larger than the excavation depth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Excavation</b> <b>of</b> {{the soil}} is {{actually}} the unloading process. The unloading process of soil makes the soil uplift, and the soil uplift is restricted by the pit engineering piles. And then, engineering piles should bear the vertical upwards pulling force caused by soil uplift. When pulling force is huge and tensile bearing capacity of pile is low, engineering piles could be pulled apart, and it is harmful to bearing capacity and durability of engineering piles. This paper adopts the finite element method to simulate engineering piles during pit excavation, and studies the traits of engineering piles in various excavation working conditions and different position. The computational {{results show that the}} deeper pit, the bigger displacement and tensile forces of piles, and the farther away from edges of the pit, the bigger displacement and forces of piles.
