500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deceiving youths into donning {{handcuffs}} became Gacy's typical {{modus operandi}} in subduing his victims. After plying a youth with drink, drugs or generally gaining his trust, Gacy {{would produce a}} pair of handcuffs (occasionally {{as part of a}} clowning routine) which he would persuade his intended victim into donning. With his victim manacled and unable to free himself, Gacy would then make a statement to the effect of: [...] "The trick <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have the key", before proceeding to rape and torture his captive. He would finish with [...] "the rope trick", placing a rope over his victim's neck and tying a makeshift tourniquet until the victim was strangled to death.|$|E

He {{was asked by}} co-host Touré if he believed that Democratic Party has done {{enough to get the}} overwhelming support from African-Americans it receives. King's answer is said to have shocked the host. “The party does not do enough,” he said. “It's our responsibility to hold the party accountable. And I'm not sure we do that. I think {{we have to find a}} way to hold the parties accountable. He went on to say that he believed there should be communication between African-Americans and the Tea Party Movement, saying [...] "the only way you change <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be at least communicating".|$|E

Lloyd Kaufman, co-founder of Troma Entertainment, noted that being a scream queen is [...] "more than just crying and having ketchup thrown on you. <b>You</b> not only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attractive, but <b>you</b> also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a big brain. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> frightened, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sad, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> romantic." ...|$|R

You don't know that I am speaking the truth; you just feel it. You're trusting your heart and not your head. The head must win in the end. You might go on believing for a time, but sooner or later you would be bound to begin to doubt and worry and torment yourself. You couldn't fight against the evidence, when once your instinct--or whatever it is that tells you that I am speaking the truth--had begun to weaken. And it would weaken. Think what {{it would have to be}} fighting all the time. Think of the case your intelligence would be making out, day after day, till it crushed you.

Yet, knowing you are Lord Dawlish, I become engaged to you. Directly afterwards you hear Nutty consoling me as if I were marrying you against my will. Isn't that an absolutely fair statement of what has happened? How could you go on believing me with all that against you?' ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} noted {{that the concept of}} a batting order in {{baseball}} is [...] "profoundly democratic; no matter how good a hitter <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait your turn."

5000|$|Simba {{was framed}} for this terrible murder, {{and on the}} one hand you can say it wasn’t his fault, but he wasn’t a {{stand-up}} guy, so {{a little bit of the}} theme of the movie <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stand up for yourself if you know you’re right. So that idea of redemption, that idea of that day in your life that you have to take responsibility for yourself, that you’re no longer a child, you’re an adult, all those themes resonated with us when we were making the movie and, thankfully, the audience appreciated them, as well. — Producer Don Hahnon Simba's role in the film.|$|E

The way to keep you in their mind and {{to get you to}} become a habit for these readers <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have a lot of product out there for them to read.
