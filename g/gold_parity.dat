25|$|Under {{the gold}} standard, the United States kept the Dollar {{convertible}} to gold. The Federal Reserve {{would have had}} to execute an expansionary monetary policy to fight the deflation and to inject liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling—but lower interest rates would have led to a gold outflow. Under the gold standards price–specie flow mechanism countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation). As long as the Federal Reserve had to defend the <b>gold</b> <b>parity</b> of the Dollar it had to sit idle while the banking system crumbled.|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} was suspended twice during World War I, once fully {{and then for}} foreign exchange. At {{the onset of the}} war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities, who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (<b>gold)</b> <b>parity</b> of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the {{gold standard}} was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange value of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.|$|E

Before 1914, gold standard adherence effectively signalled credibility and shaved 40 to 60 basis points from country borrowing spreads. In the 1920 s, however, simply resuming prewar <b>gold</b> <b>parities</b> was insufficient to secure such benefits. Countries that devalued before resumption were treated favourably, and markets scrutinized other signals.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{mechanisms}} of international payments adjustment at work under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates between 1945 and 1971. I argue that two market failures - imperfect international capital mobility and imperfect wage-price flexibility - are central to understanding the adjustment problems of that period. Imperfect capital mobility implied that even intertemporally solvent governments could face international liquidity constraints. Wage-price inflexibility implied that countries suffering from simultaneous reserve loss and unemployment might need to undergo lengthy transitions before returning to balance. By the 1960 s, when trade had been substantially liberalized and partial convertibility restored, the main remaining adjustment weapon was currency realignment: devaluation could eliminate an unemployment-cum-deficit dilemma in a stroke, while revaluation could relieve the inflationary pressures in surplus countries. The currency realignment option proved incompatible, however, with the growing efficiency of the international capital market. Under the classical gold standard, high capital mobility had supported the credibility of fixed exchange rates. Under Bretton Woods, fixed <b>gold</b> <b>parities</b> did not have primacy among other economic objectives; and increasing capital mobility undermined the regime as governments proved unwilling to stand by key systemic commitments.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the uncovered interest parity hypothesis using the dollar-sterling exchange rate during {{the gold standard}} era. This period is interesting because the exchange rate was seasonal, because transactions costs were high, and because occasions when uncovered interest rate speculation did not occur can be identified. The paper shows UIP speculation frequently did not occur, that speculation occurred more in response to expected exchange rate changes than interest rate differentials, and that profitability varied systematically with interest rate differentials. The estimated UIP equations are substantially improved by distinguishing occasions when sterling was borrowed not lent. Uncovered interest <b>parity,</b> <b>gold</b> standard...|$|R

40|$|The debate {{concerning}} {{the return to}} the gold standard in England during and {{in the aftermath of}} the Napoleonic Wars, and the subsequent resumption of convertibility in 1819, played a significant role in British monetary orthodoxy.

50|$|With {{the end of}} war orders, {{a serious}} {{depression}} hit the economy by 1921-22. Factors explaining the economic depression are on one hand the return to prewar <b>gold</b> standard at <b>parity</b> or upcoming structural problems to the northern industrial core of the UK.Indeed, the whole decade was one of stagnation The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills. In depressed areas the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|R
40|$|The subject under {{consideration}} is the conception {{and significance of}} special drawing rights and {{the main reason for}} the introduction of the new international monetary unit. Also indicated is the fundamental difference between the drawing rights and the spacial drawing rights. To meet the need as and when it arises for supplement to existing reserve assets the Fund is authorized to allocate special drawing rights to members that are participants in the Special Drawing Account. The new international unit, commonly known as SDR (Special Drawing Rights) or gold paper was introduced in January 1970. It's parity is 0, 88671 g of fine gold, thus equal to the US dollar. It is expressed in dollars but not US dollars. It is issued by the IMF. The grounds for issuing is mutual committance {{of the participants in the}} Special Drawing Account, to use the SDR as a means of payment in international settlement of payments. The introduction of SDR constitutes a further step in demonetization of gold, but does not yet mean its full demonetization. SDR is demonetized <b>gold,</b> despite its <b>parity</b> in <b>gold.</b> Here gold plays the role of a yardstick of international measure of values. The introduction of SDR has positive influence on international liquidity thanks to the possibility for supplement to existing reserve assets. Though reducing it does not however, eliminate all the difficulties of those countries which have a long-standing debit balance of payments.

40|$|I do {{not claim}} {{in this paper}} that the {{international}} gold standard was a principal cause of the Great Depression. Instead, I explore the events that allowed the world to slip deeper into depression despite the gold standard. The volatility of international short-term capital flows surely contributed greatly to the Depression. I argue that this volatility was exacerbated-rather than ameliorated-by the international gold standard. The reason is that despite governments' legal assurances that {{they are committed to}} a gold standard, speculators never perceive the terms of <b>gold</b> <b>parity</b> as immutable. This statement holds with increasing force when one observes the precarious status of government debts and international finance during the 1920 s. This reality renders a gold standard vulnerable to precisely the type of volatility in international capital markets that made the 1931 downturn more severe.

40|$|This paper defines two {{competing}} hypotheses on the working of fixed exchange rates. The "symmetry" hypothesis states that every country {{is concerned with}} the good functioning of the system, and cannot afford to deviate from world averages. Every country is just left to follow the rules of the game," that is to avoid sterilizing balance of payments flows. The world price level is pegged down either by an external numeraire like gold, or by cooperation among central banks, in a fiat currency system. The competing hypothesis states that fixed-exchange rates regimes are inherently asymmetric: they are characterized by a 'center country" which provides the nominal anchor for the others, either by managing the <b>gold</b> <b>parity</b> in a centralized fashion, or by arbitrarily setting some other nominal anchor. I discuss the empirical evidence to discriminate between the two hypotheses, by studying the institutional features and the data on three experiences of fixed rates: the International Gold Standard, the Bretton Woods regime, and the European Monetary System. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{monetary}} {{theory of}} G. F. Knapp was so shocking {{in the moment}} of its announcement that it was rejected. Yet, demonetarization of gold is presently materialized and the authoress made an attempt at the study of that theory. Her task was to present main theses of G. F. Knapp and to examine whether the theory found its application in the modern monetary systems. Upon presentation of main theses of G. F. Knapp references were made to the theories of John Law, L. Walras. J. M. Keynes. The differences between metalism and nominalism were indicated. In the answer to the query the immediate interest of G. F. Knapp theses was emphasised. Applications of his theory in current international monetary system is brought forward. It was proved by G. F. Knapp that money is always an autonomous tender. Moneyed function is its, essence. Money is always numéraire. Substantional value od money is unnecessary and so are <b>gold</b> <b>parity</b> and par value system. State can fix a nominal value of its currency, as a compulsory legal tender and secure a future purchasing power as means of exchange. The exchange rate is a price of foreign currency expressed in a domestic unit. In cannot be fixed arbitrarily, as it is formed by the whole of state policies and international exchange. According to the Knappian pantopolical theory of exchange rate, a state has to run the monetary policy both inland and with reference to the foreign relations. All fundamental Knappian theses are presently fully realised in monetary system of many countries. In the international monetary system it is used in basket currency introduced by the IMF in 1974 as well as in establishing principles of central rate.

40|$|France {{has long}} {{conceived}} of finance {{as a weapon}} of diplomacy. The role of French finance in sealing the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892 is well known; the Quai d'Orsay's use {{of access to the}} Paris financial markets and the Paris Bourse as an instrument of foreign policy before the First World War was the subject of much research in the early 1970 s. However, the use of currency and credit manipulation as a diplomatic weapon and a lever of power has received less attention. After the First World War the opportunity for such manipulation became more widespread. Following the outbreak of War many currencies came off the gold standard and were slow to return to it in the post-war era giving rise to considerable financial instability through the 1920 s. The German, French and British currencies were all buffeted at some stage during the 1920 s. The problem was that inter-war economic policy-makers were less committed to defending the gold reserve and <b>gold</b> <b>parity</b> when confronted with competing domestic variables such as unemployment. This encouraged a splintering of international collective effort into competing national monetary systems each pursuing its own monetary policy and interests. The ensuing instability of the interwar years offered opportunistic advantage for a government wishing to seize it. Currency vulnerability and the ramifications it had for national economic policies became all too obvious. Friends and foe alike could not ignore how short term concerted action by banks and financial institutions to manipulate a currency by heavy selling or buying, possibly at the behest of state authorities, could undermine governments and their policies while conferring political leverage on others. It was not long before certain governments would view currency manipulation as an additional weapon in their diplomatic arsenal. The question of stabilising the French franc in the 1920 s and returning it to a fixed parity against gold has been studied primarily from economic and political perspectives; the diplomatic has been under-researched. This article will analyse first how France perceived herself to be the object of currency manipulation for political aims by Germany and Britain in the early 1920 s; and then how during the stabilisation of the franc after 1926 under Premier and Finance Minister Raymond Poincaré she was able to turn the tables and use short term financial advantage as leverage against Britain on important policy matters...|$|E
