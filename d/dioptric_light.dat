5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing <b>dioptric</b> <b>light.</b> Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E

50|$|In 1860, the oil-powered {{light was}} {{upgraded}} to a <b>dioptric</b> <b>light</b> and Mumbles Battery, the fort {{that surrounds the}} tower was built by the War Department. In 1905, an occulting mechanism, where the light was made to flash, was fitted. This was partially automated in 1934. By 1977, the cast-iron lantern had deteriorated beyond repair and was removed. A different lantern was added in 1987. In 1995, the main light was replaced {{and an array of}} solar panels and emergency monitoring equipment were added.|$|E
50|$|In 1850 a new stone {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} and {{equipped with a}} <b>dioptric</b> Fresnel <b>lighting</b> device in 1875.|$|R
60|$|The {{floating}} {{lights of}} England are illuminated {{by means of}} lamps with metallic reflectors, on what is styled the catoptric system. The dioptric system, in which the rays of light are transmitted through glass, has been introduced into the floating lights of India by the Messrs. Stevenson, C.E., of Edinburgh. The first floating light on this system in India was shown on the Hoogly in 1865. Since then, several more <b>dioptric</b> <b>lights</b> {{have been sent to}} the same region, and also to Japan in 1869, and all reports agree in describing these lights as being eminently successful.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the task of}} pointing ships into the channel, the lighthouse also signaled ships {{about the state of the}} tide. During the day this was performed using two day signals installed on two corners of the structure, while during the night two 6th order <b>dioptric</b> <b>lights</b> showing different colors coded the state of the tide. The different colours were changed manually, by lowering glass cylinders over the lanterns, which could be done from inside the structure. Records of the tide were also kept automatically by floats in tubes which graphed the tide level. The graphs were replaced every month and were sent to Greenwich where they were kept.|$|R
50|$|The navigational {{light was}} moved to the tower in 1867. The {{clockwork}} operated revolving <b>dioptric</b> <b>light</b> was constructed by Chance Brothers. The height of the focal plane above sea-level was 140 m and the light was visible to an eye elevated 61 m above sea level at a distance of 27 km in clear weather. The light was a triple flash at intervals of 30 seconds, each flash being of one second duration, and each long eclipse of 18 seconds duration. The light was lit using kerosene oil. In 1907 it was converted to gas. In 1933 it was replaced with a 1,500 candle power light powered by electricity.|$|E
50|$|Three single-wick lamps {{fitted with}} {{parabolic}} reflectors were used. Incandescent oil <b>dioptric</b> <b>light</b> with ‘Hood’ burner {{was used in}} 1931 with a 3rd Order 500 mm optic. (The Order is a system of classifying the type of lenses used based on the focal length of the lens). This optic revolved on mercury, producing an intensity of 670,000 candelas with a visibility range of 22 nautical miles (about 40 km). This kerosene burning lighting equipment was replaced in 1967 by an electrically operated 100-volt/1,000-watt light source. A generator room {{was built on the}} east side of the lighthouse to house three generators. With the generators, the seven-men lighthouse crew was reduced to four.|$|E
50|$|Trinity House {{took over}} {{operation}} of the lighthouse under an enabling act of 1836, but not without a fight from the original owners, who wanted to protect their investment from a low takeover price. It was lavishly restored by James Walker, exhibiting two of his characteristics: a decrease in diameter and a solid parapet (as seen at his Trwyn Du Lighthouse). The stone-built gallery was 0.84 m wide and bracketed out on corbels with a crenellated parapet. A new cast-iron lantern, 4.25 m in diameter, was glazed with square panes around a <b>dioptric</b> <b>light</b> with mirrors, later replaced by a lens. On {{the north side of}} the tower there is a former external doorway exhibiting the Trinity House coat of arms, which now leads to the engine room.|$|E

5000|$|Witch Shoal Lighthouse {{was located}} about 0.5 mi {{southwest}} of Magog. The original lighthouse {{was built in}} 1878 as a 21 ft white square wooden tower on a pier. It had a fixed white <b>dioptric</b> <b>light</b> located at a height of 19 ft above the high water mark and {{with a range of}} 9 mi. [...] It was rebuilt in 1900. In April 1933, it was destroyed by pressure from the ice caused by the rising level of the lake. It was rebuilt in 1960 as a small metal tower, which was swept away by spring ice in 1978. Since 1980, the mast that replaced it is left in place only from May to October each year. The tower is 23 ft high with a fixed white light that has a range of 9 mi and a focal plane of 28 ft. The aid is owned by the Coast Guard and maintained by a private contractor.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} apparatus was a 10 ft H Wilkins & Co. catadioptric. The {{light source}} was twelve kerosene lamps with a parabolic reflector for each lamp, on a revolving iron frame, in four groups of three. Two groups {{were white and}} two groups were red, resulting in a light characteristic of an alternating red and white, with intensities of 500 cd and 200 cd, respectively. It was originally manned by three keepers.In 1901 the keeper's quarters went through major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones.

60|$|In Fig. 1, AAA {{represents}} in plan {{an ordinary}} Fresnel's <b>dioptric</b> fixed <b>light</b> apparatus, and BB' a hemispherical mirror (either metallic or dioptric on my father's principle) {{which is made}} to revolve with uniform speed about the burner. This mirror, it is obvious, intercepts the rays of one hemisphere, and, returning them through the flame (less loss by absorption, etc.), spreads them equally over the other. In this way 180° of light pass regularly {{the eye of the}} seaman; and are followed at once by 180° of darkness. As the hemispherical mirror begins to open, the observer receives the full light, since the whole lit hemisphere is illuminated with strict equality; and as it closes again, he passes into darkness.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{navigational aid}} {{at the point}} was a lightroom erected in 1863 with {{kerosene}} burners. In 1867 the lightroom was replaced with a wooden tower.

5000|$|The Green Point Lighthouse, Cape Town is an {{operational}} lighthouse on the South African coast, first lit on 12 April 1824. The lighthouse {{was the first}} solid lighthouse structure on the South African coast and the oldest operational lighthouse in South Africa. The lighthouse was commissioned by acting Governor of the Cape Colony Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin and designed by German architect Herman Shutte. Building commenced in 1821 and was completed in 1823. The lighthouse started operating in 1824. The lighthouse cost approximately 6 420 pounds sterling to build. When the lighthouse was first lit, it burned Argand lamps fueled by sperm whale oil. The light from these lanterns could be seen for [...] The lighthouse was expanded to its present height in 1865. In 1922, {{the range of the}} light house was extended to 22 nautical miles when 3rd order <b>dioptric</b> flashing <b>lights</b> were installed. Its present characteristic is a white light flashing every 10 seconds. In 1926, a foghorn was installed in the lighthouse despite a letter of complaint sent to the Mayor of Cape Town in 1923 by Green Point residents.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to relate the}} structure and physiology of superposition compound eyes of mesopelagic and bathypelagic decapods to their visual environment. An anatomical survey at the light microscope level showed that bathypelagic decapods have stellate or hypertrophied rhabdoms and little or no proximal shielding pigments. In contrast, species found in upper mesopelagic depths have fusiform rhabdoms that are square in cross section in the dorsal region of the eye and often have stellate rhabdoms ventrally. Proximal shielding pigment was much more noticeable in mesopelagic species than in bathypelagic species. In addition, shielding pigments were only found distal to the basement membrane in mesopelagic species. Observation of eyeshine intensity distribution around the eye confirmed histological evidence that the reflective tapetum is restricted to ventral regions of the eye in mesopelagic species while bathypelagic species have a complete tapetum. Measurements of aperture diameters using green light and white light showed that they are significantly smaller under green light. Since most mesopelagic species will rarely encounter anything other than blue/green light, the functional aperture of most superposition eyes is probably less than has been estimated previously. Physiological evidence suggests that spectral sensitivity {{and the ability of}} the eye to respond to rapid changes in light intensity changes with light adaptation in coastal species. Deep-sea species appear unable to light adapt. It is suggested that one reason for this may be the limited ability of the rhabdomeral membrane to respond to the increased rate of ion cycling induced by elevated light levels. This, and previous evidence, may also explain the ease with which the eyes of deep-sea decapods become damaged upon exposure to relatively low light intensities. A ray-tracing model was formulated that predicted the sensitivity and acceptance angle for all the species examined histologically. This agreed well with previous empirical models and suggested that the <b>dioptric</b> layer focuses <b>light</b> from a point source onto the axial rhabdom. The model suggests that sensitivity to extended sources increases with depth. It is suggested that this is an associated (concomitant) rather than causal relationship and that the eyes of mesopelagic and deep-sea decapods are primarily designed to maximise sensitivity to `point' sources such as bioluminescent events...|$|R
