Shortly thereafter, he called for the province to <b>finish</b> <b>delayed</b> renovations on the Dorion–Rigaud commuter line and expressed disappointment when the government instead allocated the money for a road link to Mirabel Airport. Yeomans later opposed the provincial government's plan to extend Highway 440 to the Trans-Canada Highway, arguing that it would create more urban sprawl and reduce investment in Montreal. He did, however, strongly support the province's plans to renovate Montreal's Deux-Montagnes Line.|$|R

40|$|THE BOND STREGTH OF ADHESIVE RESIN CEMENT: TIME DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN CEMENTATION AND FINISHING OF CAST DOWEL-CORES By Purnima Joan Shahani, D. D. S., M. S. A Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Dentistry at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2003 Major Director: Peter C. Moon, M. S., PhDDirector of VCU Dental Biomaterials LaboratoryThis study compared the retention of cast dowel-cores cemented with Panavia® 21 subjected to immediate versus <b>delayed</b> high-speed <b>finishing.</b> Conventionally, <b>finishing</b> is <b>delayed</b> for 24 hours to one week to allow for optimal setting and ultimate strength of the cement. Forty-five recently extracted human maxillary canines were used. Teeth were divided among 3 groups: a control group (n= 15, no finishing), an immediate finishing group (n= 15, high-speed cutting of the cores performed five minutes after cementation) and a <b>delayed</b> <b>finishing</b> group (n= 15, high-speed finishing performed 48 hours post-cementation). Tensile load to failure was applied using an Instron® at a crosshead speed of 0. 05 inches/minute. A statistical test of equivalence was performed. The average retention force associated with failure after immediate finishing was {{not found to be}} inferior to <b>delayed</b> <b>finishing</b> failure force.

For both concurrent and delayed conditions, fidelity of reproduction fell with increasing number of segments in the model. Overall quality of reproduction did not differ between the two conditions. When a few models were repeated, interspersed among non-repeated ones, performance improved but only when reproduction was delayed. This improvement was stimulus-selective, not a general improvement with practice. Two additional experiments showed that (i) memory for a seen model is well preserved for at least 6 s, with relatively modest need for rehearsal, and (ii) successful reproduction is possible with remarkably little information having been extracted from key points in the model's trajectory. ...|$|R

40|$|Eriophorum vaginatum is a tussock-forming sedge that {{contributes}} {{significantly to the}} structure and primary productivity of moist acidic tussock tundra. Locally adapted populations (ecotypes) have been identified across the geographical distribution of E. vaginatum; however, {{little is known about}} how their growth and phenology differ {{over the course of a}} growing season. The growing season is short in the Arctic and therefore exerts a strong selection pressure on tundra species. This raises the hypothesis that the phenology of arctic species may be poorly adapted if the timing and length of the growing season change. Mature E. vaginatum tussocks from across a latitudinal gradient (65 – 70 °N) were transplanted into a common garden at a central location (Toolik Lake, 68 ° 38 ′N, 149 ° 36 ′W) where half were warmed using open-top chambers. Over two growing seasons (2015 and 2016), leaf length was measured weekly to track growth rates, timing of senescence, and biomass accumulation. Growth rates were similar across ecotypes and between years and were not affected by warming. However, southern populations accumulated significantly more biomass, largely because they started to senesce later. In 2016, peak biomass and senescence of most populations occurred later than in 2015, probably induced by colder weather at the beginning of the growing season in 2016, which caused a delayed start to growth. The <b>finish</b> was <b>delayed</b> as well. Differences in phenology between populations were largely retained between years, suggesting that the amount of time that these ecotypes grow has been selected by the length of the growing seasons at their respective home sites. As potential growing seasons lengthen, E. vaginatum may be unable to respond appropriately as a result of genetic control and may have reduced fitness in the rapidly warming Arctic tundra...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{computer}} systems, {{jobs are}} divided into short tasks and executed in parallel. Empirical observations in practical systems suggest that the task service times are highly random and the job service time is bottlenecked by the slowest straggling task. One common solution for straggler mitigation is to replicate a task on multiple servers and wait for one replica of the task to <b>finish</b> early. The <b>delay</b> performance of replications depends heavily on the scheduling decisions of when to replicate, which servers to replicate on, and which job to serve first. So far, little is understood on how to optimize these scheduling decisions for minimizing the delay to complete the jobs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on delay-optimal scheduling of replications in both centralized and distributed multi-server systems. Low-complexity scheduling policies are designed and are proven to be delay-optimal or near delay-optimal in stochastic ordering among all causal and non-preemptive policies. These theoretical results are established for general system settings and delay metrics that allow for arbitrary arrival processes, arbitrary job sizes, arbitrary due times, and heterogeneous servers with data locality constraints. Novel sample-path tools are developed to prove these results...|$|R
