50|$|The Dodge Kew Fargo Livestock Transporter (484) {{was issued}} in April 1967. This {{was a large}} animal {{transporter}} based on an American Dodge truck which featured an opening bonnet and carried a cargo of plastic pigs. The Tandem Disc <b>Harrow</b> <b>Plough</b> Trailer (71) was relreased in July 1967 and an updated Agricultural Gift Set (GS5) in October 1967, which featured {{some of the more}} recent releases such as the Dodge Kew Fargo and the Massey Ferguson 165 tractor with scoop. In March 1970 the Massey Ferguson 165 Tractor With Saw Attachment (73) was issued featuring a clever circular saw attachment which rotated as the model was pushed along by means of a long finely coiled spring. Next followed two versions of the Ford 5000 Super Major tractor with a fully operational side trenching scoop (74) in 1970 followed by a version with a rear trenching scoop (72) in January 1971. The next new tractor model was issued in April 1973. The Massey Ferguson MF50B (50) featured a closed cab and was finished in yellow. A version with an operational shovel (54) was released in April 1974 and was featured with a trailer carrying a load of plastic 'hay' with figures sitting atop the 'hay' as the latest version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS4) in July 1974. Another new tractor was added to the range in September 1976. The David Brown Tractor and Trailer Set (GS34) included the new tractor finished in white and with a closed cab and a tipping trailer. These models were also featured in another version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS42) released in March 1978, along with models of a grain elevator and grain silo. At the same time the David Brown tractor was issued with a Danish JF combine harvester attachment (1112).|$|E

Size-number distributions were fitted by power law equations {{that allowed the}} identification of self-similarity and self-affinity. Self-affinity and thus non-random size-number distribution prevailed in undisturbed soil. Self-similarity and thus randomness of size-number distribution prevailed after tillage regardless of the intensity of disturbance imposed by cultivation. The values of fractal dimensions before and after tillage were low, suggesting that short-term, short-range factors govern size-number distribution of soil seed banks...|$|R

50|$|Two-wheel tractor {{or walking}} tractor motoculteur Einachsschlepper oder Bodenfräse are generic terms {{understood}} in the USA and in parts of Europe to represent a single-axle tractor, which is a tractor with one axle, self-powered and self-propelled, which can pull and power various farm implements such as a trailer, cultivator or <b>harrow,</b> a <b>plough,</b> or various seeders and harvesters. The operator usually walks behind it or rides the implement being towed. Similar terms are mistakenly applied to the household rotary tiller or power tiller; although these may be wheeled and/or self-propelled, they are not tailored for towing implements. A two-wheeled tractor specializes in pulling any of numerous types of implements, whereas rotary tillers specialize in soil tillage with their dedicated digging tools. This article concerns two-wheeled tractors as distinguished from such tillers.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} century the Eastern Han dynasty brought the Northern Xiongnu into {{submission}} by military measures. Hordes of herdsmen and the Southern Xiongnu, originally subdued by the Northern Xiongnu, began trading without having heavy tribute imposed on them. Horses and animal products were traded mainly for agricultural tools, such as the <b>harrow</b> and the <b>plough,</b> and clothing of which silk was most popular. In return those herdsmen helped defend the Han dynasty against any remaining Xiongnu. The more they engaged in commerce with the Chinese, the more they preferred to stay near China's border, to facilitate trade, instead of residing on the steppes of Manchuria and Mongolia.|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were done {{to measure the}} effect of different primary tillage methods on the CO 2 flux from soil and to evaluate the effect of conservation tillage tools on short-term CO 2 emissions. The {{experiments were}} conducted on a clay loam soil winter wheat field and a corn field. The three tillage treatments included stubble mulching (disc harrow, mulch tiller, chisel plough), primary tillage (disc <b>harrow,</b> moldboard <b>plough,</b> and chisel plough) and secondary tillage (combined seedbed maker). The control treatment was no-till with soil and residues left by the harvester. The CO 2 flux from the tilled soil surface was measured by a portable closed-chamber tester. Moldboard ploughing produced the roughest soil surface and the highest initial CO 2 flux and maintained the highest flux throughout the experiment. The moldboard ploughing caused higher CO 2 loss than less intensive tillage such as chisel ploughing, mulch cultivating, or disc harrowing. Primary tillage caused higher CO 2 emission in the fall than seedbed preparation did in the spring. These results support increased use of new and improved forms of conservation tillage equipment and offer a significant potential for preserving or increasing soil C levels while decreasing carbon dioxide emissions...|$|R

The <b>Plough</b> and <b>Harrow</b> (now <b>Plough</b> Cottage) and The Welcome closed early in the century, and the Horse and Harrow closed in 1988 {{after the death of}} its last landlord, Jim Austin, only a few years before the parish boundary change moved it into Berrick parish. The building is now a private house but retains the name Horse and Harrow. As Moreau mentions, there was a long series of post offices, and other small shops.

50|$|Ploughing is {{not always}} {{regarded}} as essential nowadays, but the plough can improve soil by inverting it to improve soil aeration and drainage, release nutrients through weathering, and expose harmful pests to predators. It is also an effective method of weed control. Ploughing depth in Britain varies between 5-6 inches in some limestone regions to up to 18 inches in deep stoneless silt land. Most British ploughs are designed to turn a furrow of up to about a foot deep, which is relatively shallow compared to some other countries, where furrows of up to 16 inches are common. Other machines used to prepare land include cultivators (to break up land too heavy for a normal <b>plough),</b> <b>harrows</b> (to level the surface of ploughed land), rolls or rollers (used for firming the soil), sprayers and dusters (used to spread herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers).|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} primary, minimum, {{conventional}} and ridging tillage on soil penetration resistance, porosity and the yield response of Okra (Abelmoschus) were investigated {{for a growing}} season in 2008, on a sandy loam soil. Experimental factors included tillage depths, tillage operations, and soil properties such, as soil resistance and porosity. Two different tillage depths of 0 - 150 and 150 - 300 mm were studied. Okra parameters investigated were plant height, plant leaf count and yield in terms of number of seeds per plot, number of fruits per plant, fruit weight, length and diameter of the fruits. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and regression analysis. Results showed that the highest porosity of 31. 78 % (v/v) was recorded on the <b>ploughed</b> + <b>harrowed</b> + harrowed plot, 30. 35 % (v/v) was recorded on ridged, while 29. 76 % (v/v) and 29. 67 % (v/v) were recorded in <b>ploughed</b> + <b>harrowed</b> plot and <b>ploughed</b> plot respectively. The results further showed that the highest soil penetration resistance of 1. 13 KN was recorded in the ploughed plot, while the lowest value of 0. 61 KN {{was obtained from the}} ridged plot. The other values were 1. 08 and 1. 05 KN for <b>ploughed</b> + <b>harrowed</b> plot and <b>ploughed</b> + <b>harrowed</b> + harrowed plot, respectively. Analysis of variance indicated no significant difference in soil porosity for depths, between plots and blocks at the 5 % level of significance, while penetration resistance showed significant difference at the same level of significance. On the whole the mean highest okra yield was obtained from ploughing + harrowing + harrowing tillage operation. The values were 30. 26 kg/ha for number of plant per plot, 5. 27 kg/ha for number of fruits per plant, 1. 76 kg for fruit weight, 68. 2 mm fruit length and 31. 5 mm for fruit diameter.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was performed {{during the summer}} and autumn in 1984. The purpose was to investigate factors on low profile implement tyres affecting the coefficient of rolling resistance. The following factors were studied: - inflation pressure - width - diameter - construction - ply rating - aspect ratio - tread pattern Tests wars performed on concrete, <b>harrowed</b> fields, <b>ploughed</b> fields and stubble. Important factors when reducing the CRR when driving on concrete are: - increase the diameter and width - higher ply rating - decrease in aspect ratio - less aggressive tread pattern - choice of particular constructions (Garden Tractor or Steel Belt). The most important factor in reducing rolling resistance on soft ground is to ensure that the tyre size is adequate to carry the vertical load at as low inflation pressure as possible. A big soft tyre with low inflation pressure giving no or little sinkage is desirable. Choice of aggressive tread patterns will lead to an increase in rolling resistance because of the energy losses produced by the high compaction under the lugs. The relation between diameter and width must be large enough to ensure no or a minimum of bulldozing resistance. Reducing rolling resistance will lead to a number of advantages. The low inflation pressures will cause a decrease in soil compaction, and there will be an increase in yields. Lower railing resistance will also result in savings in fuel and time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{connectivity}} of macropore networks {{is thought}} to exert an important control on preferential flow in soil, although little {{progress has been made}} towards incorporating an understanding of these effects into management-oriented flow and transport models. In principle, concepts from percolation theory should be well suited to quantify the connectivity of preferred flow pathways, but so far its relevance for natural soils in the field has not been tested. To investigate this question, X-ray tomography was used to measure soil pore space architecture at an image resolution of 65 μm for 64 samples taken in two consecutive years in the <b>harrowed</b> and <b>ploughed</b> layers of a silt loam soil a few weeks after spring cultivation. The results showed that the pore networks displayed key features predicted by classical percolation theory: a strong relationship was found between the percolating fraction and the imaged porosity, with a percolation threshold of ca. 0. 04 to 0. 06 m 3 m− 3 in the harrowed layer. A percolation threshold was less clearly identifiable in topsoil that had not been recently tilled, although this may probably be attributed to finite size sampling effects in this layer, which showed a more heterogeneous and structured distribution of the pore space. Although further work on more strongly structured soil horizons, especially subsoils, would be desirable, it is tentatively suggested that percolation concepts could prove useful to estimate the conducting macroporosity in management models of preferential flow and transport...|$|R
