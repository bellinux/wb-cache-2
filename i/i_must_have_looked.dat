2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> gaunt and ghastly standing there in my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could almost hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} and edited by Christian Larson, and was filmed on a raining day through Soho, London; in early 2012, images of Minogue wearing a heart-shaped jacket and denim hot pants surfaced online. After the videos completion, Minogue hosted a special website that required her fans to use Twitter to hashtag [...] "KylieTimebomb" [...] {{in order to}} unlock the music video. The campaign was an extreme success on Twitter, with over 25,000 tweets in under an hour and 10 tweets per second and the hashtag was subjected {{as one of the}} trending topics worldwide. In an interview with Vevo.com, Minogue said of the shooting; [...] "When we were shooting down the busiest street in Soho, I worked with an in-ear monitor. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like a complete idiot because I'm strutting down the street singing to absolutely nothing!" [...] In an interview on , she commented that the mini-black dress was purchased at a lingerie store, and further expressed discomforted saying, [...] "That was a very cheeky little outfit. People don't believe it, but I do get very shy and timid. I was like, 'Oh god please, can't there be more to this?'". Minogue promoted the Facebook app that allowed fans to be inserted into Minogue's glasses, which are seen throughout the music video.|$|E

60|$|I verily {{believed}} she thought I was drunk. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> pretty hard and fierce, bursting {{into her room}} with that big gun in hand. My first action then was to lay the gun on her bureau.|$|E

6000|$|As ill-luck {{would have}} it, {{the last person}} I desired to meet chanced upon me, as, well wrapped in furs, I was {{slipping}} towards the door, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> confused when Lucille Haldane said: [...] "Where are you going, Mr. Ormesby?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{offered him}} $2 for it, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like I wanted it, for {{he said it}} would be taking the pumpernickel out of his children's mouths to hold any {{conversation}} that did not lead up to a price of $35. I finally got it for $25.|$|E
60|$|I {{would not}} listen. I was {{determined}} against going {{away from my}} charge; I had rather have been his housemaid than have left him to Hester, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like a stone as I got up, and left them to their talk while I {{went back to the}} boy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is all right, Kitty; but I {{saw someone}} yesterday, {{and it has}} altered my plans--but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> a <b>look</b> at her first. I saw her when I called a year ago; I suppose she has not changed since then?' ...|$|R

60|$|I {{would say}} nothing; but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> my disapproval, for {{he went on}} to explain that in Saxe-Gotha, where he was born, men were made to fight whether they would or no; and they were stolen from their wives at night by {{soldiers}} of the great king, or lured away by fair promises.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you been}} {{stopping}} {{out all night}} again and staring at the sea, Morris?" [...] she inquired; [...] "because I understand it is a habit of yours. You seem so sleepy.

6000|$|... "You {{were all}} right. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> rotten. I've {{never had the}} gloves on in my life. I'm jolly glad no one saw us except Smith, who doesn't count.

60|$|I am {{not sure}} that this was not the most awful moment of my life! A cold shiver of fear {{suddenly}} seized me. I looked from one to the other, speechless. If appearances had gone for anything at that moment <b>I</b> <b>must</b> indeed <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> guilty.|$|R
6000|$|... "The thing can't stand--that's certain. But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> time to <b>look</b> {{into the}} report. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{time to see}} what I can do.

6000|$|... "Where have I {{seen such}} eyes?" [...] said Vansittart Smith to himself. [...] "There is {{something}} saurian about them, something reptilian. There's the membrana nictitans of the snakes," [...] he mused, bethinking himself of his zoological studies. [...] "It gives a shiny effect. But {{there was something}} more here. There {{was a sense of}} power, of wisdom--so I read them--and of weariness, utter weariness, and ineffable despair. It may be all imagination, but I never had so strong an impression. By Jove, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> another <b>look</b> at them!" [...] He rose and paced round the Egyptian rooms, but the man who had excited his curiosity had disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> {{as bad as}} a {{magazine}} artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like I was booked to read a chapter from 'Elsie's School Days' at a Brooklyn Bohemian smoker. But Vaucross treated me like a bear hunter's guide. He wasn't afraid of hurting the waiter's feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> very savage, for Spencer, who was dining with us, trod on my foot {{under the}} table. 'Don't laugh so loud, cousin,' I said, very gently; 'you may wake good old Mr. Van den Bosch.' The good old gentleman {{was asleep in}} his arm-chair, to which he {{commonly}} retires for a nap after dinner.|$|E
60|$|But Rectus did worry. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> frightened when I came up, and I {{believe he}} had caught the scare. Boys will do that. The captain tried {{to keep me from}} going in again, but I knew it was all {{nonsense}} to be frightened. I was going to bring up something from the bottom, if it was only a pebble.|$|E
60|$|Well, I wore my diamond, {{as you may}} imagine, and rigged {{myself in}} my best clothes, viz. my blue coat and brass buttons before mentioned, nankeen {{trousers}} and silk stockings, a white waistcoat, {{and a pair of}} white gloves bought for the occasion. But my coat was of country make, very high in the waist and short in the sleeves, and <b>I</b> suppose <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> rather odd to some of the great people assembled, for they stared at me a great deal, and a whole crowd formed to see me dance--which I did {{to the best of my}} power, performing all the steps accurately and with great agility, as I had been taught by our dancing-master in the country.|$|R
6000|$|All children, except one, grow up. They soon {{know that}} they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. <b>I</b> suppose she <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put {{her hand to her}} heart and cried, [...] "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" [...] This was all that passed between them on the subject, but {{henceforth}} Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two {{is the beginning of the}} end.|$|R
6000|$|It {{had ceased}} raining. But the narrow road was paved with large, convex slabs of hard stone, inexpressibly greasy. To cross the Via Maqueda {{therefore}} was a feat. However, once accomplished, it was done. The near {{end of the}} street was rather dark, and had mostly vegetable shops. Abundance of vegetables--piles of white-and-green fennel, like celery, and great sheaves of young, purplish, sea-dust-colored artichokes, nodding their buds, piles of big radishes, scarlet and bluey purple, carrots, long strings of dried figs, mountains of big oranges, scarlet large peppers, a last slice of pumpkin, a great mass of colors and vegetable freshnesses. A mountain of black-purple cauliflowers, like niggers' heads, and a mountain of snow-white ones next to them. How the dark, greasy, night-stricken street seems to beam with these vegetables, all this fresh delicate flesh of luminous vegetables piled there in the air, and in the recesses of the windowless little caverns of the shops, and gleaming forth on the dark air, under the lamps. The q-b at once wants to buy vegetables. [...] "Look! Look at the snow-white broccoli. Look at the huge finocchi. Why don't we get them? <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> some. <b>Look</b> at those great clusters of dates--ten francs a kilo, and we pay sixteen. It's monstrous. Our place is simply monstrous." ...|$|R
60|$|The revelation which burst upon me {{in those}} words, the {{overthrow}} which they instantly accomplished {{of the whole}} view of the case on which Mr. Bruff had relied, struck me helpless. Innocent as I was, I stood before her in silence. To her eyes, to any eyes, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like a man overwhelmed by the discovery of his own guilt.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard the}} {{crashing}} of the barrels as they hurled {{them off the}} waggon, and then a couple of bearded faces and the muzzles of two guns looked in at me. They seized me by the sleeves of my coat, and they dragged me out into the daylight. A strange figure <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> as I stood blinking and gaping in the blinding sunlight.|$|E
6000|$|I rose {{bright and}} early; {{from head to}} foot {{performed}} my ablutions [...] "with Eastern scrupulosity," [...] and I arrayed myself in my red shirt and shooting-jacket, and the sportsman's pantaloons; and crowned my entire man with the tarpaulin; so that from this curious combination of clothing, and particularly from my red shirt, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like a very strange compound indeed: three parts sportsman, and two soldier, to one of the sailor.|$|E
60|$|As to {{this second}} {{conspiracy}}, the conspiracy with which Sallust and Cicero have made us so well acquainted, {{there is no}} sufficient ground for asserting that Cæsar was concerned in it.[194] That he was greatly concerned {{in the treatment of}} the conspirators there is no doubt. He had probably learned to appreciate the rage, the madness, the impotence of Catiline at their proper worth. He too, <b>I</b> think, <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> upon Cicero as a meddling, over-virtuous busybody; as did even Pompey when he returned from the East. What practical use could there be in such a man at such a time--in one who really believed in honesty, who thought of liberty and the Republic, and imagined that he could set the world right by talking? Such <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been the feeling of Cæsar, who had both experience and foresight to tell him that Rome wanted and <b>must</b> <b>have</b> a master. He probably had patriotism enough to feel that he, if he could acquire the mastership, would do something beyond robbery--would not satisfy himself with cutting the throats of all his enemies, and feeding his supporters with the property of his opponents. But Cicero was impracticable--unless, indeed, he could be so flattered as to be made useful. It was thus, I think, that Cæsar regarded Cicero, and thus that he induced Pompey to regard him. But now, in the year of his Consulship, Cicero had really talked himself into power, and for this year his virtue must be allowed to have its full way.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. H. If you denied {{everything}} you've {{said this}} evening and declared {{it was all}} in fun (a long pause), I'd trust you. Not otherwise. All I ask is, don't tell her my name. Please don't. A man might forget: a woman never would. (Looks up table and sees hostess beginning to collect eyes.) So it's all ended, through no fault of mine-- Haven't I behaved beautifully? I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I? (Arranging gloves and fan.) I only pray that she'll know you some day as I know you now. I wouldn't be you then, for I think even your conceit will be hurt. I hope she'll pay you back the humiliation you've brought on me. I hope-- No. I don't. I can't give you up! <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> something to <b>look</b> forward to or I shall go crazy. When it's all over, come back to me, come back to me, and you'll find that you're my Pip still! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think," [...] he went on, [...] "think of what <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{suffered}} at <b>looking</b> always on that hideous vision whenever I looked on my betrothed wife! Think of my taking her hand, and seeming {{to take it}} through {{the figure of the}} apparition! Think of the calm angel-face and the tortured specter-face being always together whenever my eyes met hers! Think of this, and you will not wonder that I betrayed my secret to her. She eagerly entreated to know the worst--nay, more, she insisted on knowing it. At her bidding I told all, and then left her free to break our engagement. The thought of death was in my heart as I spoke the parting words--death by my own act, if life still held out after our separation. She suspected that thought; she knew it, and never left me till her good influence had destroyed it forever. But for her I should not have been alive now; but for her I should never have attempted the project which has brought me here." ...|$|R
