Tyson was hit for 1/160 off 29 eight ball overs and England lost by an innings and 154 runs. Even so, Tyson hit Arthur Morris and Neil Harvey repeatedly with the ball and they were badly bruised. More to the point <b>he</b> <b>bounced</b> Ray Lindwall after the Australian all-rounder knocked several boundaries off the fast bowler on his way to 64 not out. Tyson also managed to run out Graeme Hole and made 37 not out in the second innings, which remained his highest Test score.|$|E
25|$|Just 20 days later, Rutten faced another steep test, {{fighting}} future UFC Hall of Famer Ken Shamrock, who {{was then}} one of the best Pancrase fighters.

Rutten turned in a hard effort, being taken down by Shamrock and held under dominant position for most of the match. The again more experienced Shamrock made Rutten spend rope escapes by submitting him with a pair of heel hooks and a rear naked choke, and although Rutten still tried on, he was ultimately choked out. After this, Rutten decided to omit strikes from his training and focus in only grappling, and <b>he</b> <b>bounced</b> back from the loss with a submission win over Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Jason DeLucia, trading submission attempts with him before ending the match with a guillotine choke.|$|E
