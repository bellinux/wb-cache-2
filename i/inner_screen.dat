6000|$|Another day--in truth, {{many other}} days--I sought out Poets' Corner, {{and found a}} sign-board and pointed finger, {{directing}} the visitor to it, on the corner house of a little lane leading towards {{the rear of the}} Abbey. The entrance is at the southeastern end of the south transept, and it is used, on ordinary occasions, as the only free mode of access to the building. It is no spacious arch, but a small, lowly door, passing through which, and pushing aside an <b>inner</b> <b>screen</b> that partly keeps out an exceedingly chill wind, you find yourself in a dim nook of the Abbey, with the busts of poets gazing at you from the otherwise bare stone-work of the walls. Great poets, too; for Ben Jenson is right behind the door, and Spenser's tablet is next, and Butler's {{on the same side of}} the transept, and Milton's (whose bust you know at once by its resemblance to one of his portraits, though older, more wrinkled, and sadder than that) is close by, and a profile-medallion of Gray beneath it. A window high aloft sheds down a dusky daylight on these and many other sculptured marbles, now as yellow as old parchment, that cover the three walls of the nook up to an elevation of about twenty feet above the pavement. It seemed to me that I had always been familiar with the spot. Enjoying a humble intimacy--and how much of my life had else been a dreary solitude!--with many of its inhabitants, I could not feel myself a stranger there. It was delightful to be among them. There was a genial awe, mingled with a sense of kind and friendly presences about me; and I was glad, moreover, at finding so many of them there together, in fit companionship, mutually recognized and duly honored, all reconciled now, whatever distant generations, whatever personal hostility or other miserable impediment, had divided them far asunder while they lived. I have never felt a similar interest in any other tombstones, nor have I ever been deeply moved by the imaginary presence of other famous dead people. A poet's ghost is the only one that survives for his fellow-mortals, after his bones are in the dust,--and be not ghostly, but cherishing many hearts with his own warmth in the chillest atmosphere of life. What other fame is worth aspiring for? Or, let me speak it more boldly, what other long-enduring fame can exist? We neither remember nor care anything for the past, except as the poet has made it intelligibly noble and sublime to our comprehension. The shades of the mighty have no substance; they flit ineffectually about the darkened stage where they performed their momentary parts, save when the poet has thrown his own creative soul into them, and imparted a more vivid life than ever they were able to manifest to mankind while they dwelt in the body. And therefore--though he cunningly disguises himself in their armor, their robes of state, or kingly purple--it is not the statesman, the warrior, or the monarch that survives, but the despised poet, whom they may have fed with their crumbs, and to whom they owe all that they now are or have,--a name! ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{professional}} student laboratory kits, {{the container}} A is {{often in the}} form of two concentric cylinders of metal screen, open at the top. [...] A screen acts the same as a solid metal sheet for electrostatic charge, as long as its holes are small. The inner cylinder is the Faraday pail container itself, separated from the outer cylinder with insulating supports. The outer cylindrical metal screen surrounds the inner, and acts as a ground to shield it from stray charges. This design largely eliminates the stray charge problem, as well as allowing the experimenter to see inside the container. The electrometer ground lead is clipped to the outer ground screen, and the experimenter touches this screen while performing any procedure. To ground the <b>inner</b> <b>screen,</b> the experimenter can bridge his finger between the inner and outer screens. When doing this it is important that he lift his finger first from the <b>inner</b> <b>screen,</b> not the outer, to avoid leaving charge on the <b>inner</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

For ASW the <b>inner</b> <b>screen</b> needs good active sonar. Any threat this close is too serious for passive sonar as immediate targeting is needed. Checking the area around and under HVUs for submarines is called 'delousing'. If possible at least one ASW helicopter is always airborne, to target detected contacts as quickly as possible.|$|E

40|$|In a {{companion}} paper [1], we have presented a cross-correlation approach to near-horizon physics in which bulk dynamics is probed through {{the correlation of}} quantities defined at inner and outer spacetime hypersurfaces acting as test screens. More specifically, dynamical horizons provide appropriate <b>inner</b> <b>screens</b> in a 3 + 1 setting and, in this context, we have shown that an effective-curvature vector measured at the common horizon produced in a head-on collision merger can be correlated with the flux of linear Bondi-momentum at null infinity. In this paper we provide a more sound geometric basis to this picture. First, we show that a rigidity property of dynamical horizons, namely foliation uniqueness, leads to a preferred class of null tetrads and Weyl scalars on these hypersurfaces. Second, we identify a heuristic horizon news-like function, depending only on the geometry of spatial sections of the horizon. Fluxes constructed from this function offer refined geometric quantities to be correlated with Bondi fluxes at infinity, {{as well as a}} contact with the discussion of quasi-local 4 -momentum on dynamical horizons. Third, we highlight the importance of tracking the internal horizon dual to the apparent horizon in spatial 3 -slices when integrating fluxes along the horizon. Finally, we discuss the link between the dissipation of the non-stationary part of the horizon's geometry with the viscous-fluid analogy for black holes, introducing a geometric prescription for a "slowness parameter" in black-hole recoil dynamics.

5000|$|On {{the second}} level of a typical breaker, coal would be roughly sorted. The fuel would move over sorting bars, with the various sizes of coal going down {{different}} chutes. Each type of roughly sorted coal would next pass over a [...] "slate-picker screen" [...] (sometimes called a [...] "mud screen"), with the generally round coal falling through the screen and the flat slate passing over the screen to fall down a chute to the culm pile. Coal passing through the slate-picker screen would then be sorted by additional screens. Some of these second screens were composed of flat iron perforated by holes of larger size toward the rear (where the coal entered) and smaller holes toward the front. These flat screens were sometimes shaken back and forth (hence the name [...] "shaking screens"), which not only removed dirt and sulphur from the coal but broke down larger lumps of coal into smaller sizes and sorted it for further cleaning and processing. Other screens were cylindrical, making 10 revolutions per minute and performing the same function as shaking screen.

40|$|The subpulse {{drifting}} {{phenomenon in}} pulsar radio emission is considered within the partially <b>screened</b> <b>inner</b> gap model, {{in which the}} sub-Goldreich-Julian thermionic flow of iron ions or electrons coexists with the spark-associated electron-positron plasma flow. We derive a simple formula that relates the thermal X-ray luminosity L_ x from the spark-heated polar cap and the subpulse periodicity P̂_ 3 (polar cap carousel time). For PSRs B 0943 + 10 and B 1133 + 16, the only two pulsars for which both P̂_ 3 and L_ x are known observationally, this formula holds well. For a few other pulsars, for which only one quantity is measured observationally, we predict {{the value of the}} other quantity and propose relevant observations that can confirm or discard the model. Then we further study the detailed physical conditions that allow such partially <b>screened</b> <b>inner</b> gap to form. By means of the condition T_ c/T_ s> 1 (where T_ c is the critical temperature above which the surface delivers a thermal flow to adequately supply the corotation charge density, and T_ s is the actual surface temperature), it is found that a partially-screened gap (PSG) can be formed given that the near surface magnetic fields are very strong and curved.

40|$|A new {{invention}} disclosure discusses a structure and process for separating gas from liquids in microgravity. The Microgravity Passive Phase Separator {{consists of two}} concentric, pleated, woven stainless- steel screens (25 -micrometer nominal pore) with an axial inlet, and an annular outlet between both screens (see figure). Water enters {{at one end of}} the center screen at high velocity, eventually passing through the <b>inner</b> <b>screen</b> and out through the annular exit. As gas is introduced into the flow stream, the drag force exerted on the bubble pushes it downstream until flow stagnation or until it reaches an equilibrium point between the surface tension holding bubble to the screen and the drag force. Gas bubbles of a given size will form a front that is moved further down the length of the <b>inner</b> <b>screen</b> with increasing velocity. As more bubbles are added, the front location will remain fixed, but additional bubbles will move to the end of the unit, eventually coming to rest in the large cavity between the unit housing and the outer screen (storage area). Owing to the small size of the pores and the hydrophilic nature of the screen material, gas does not pass through the screen and is retained within the unit for emptying during ground processing. If debris is picked up on the screen, the area closest to the inlet will become clogged, so high-velocity flow will persist farther down the length of the center screen, pushing the bubble front further from the inlet of the <b>inner</b> <b>screen.</b> It is desired to keep the velocity high enough so that, for any bubble size, an area of clean screen exists between the bubbles and the debris. The primary benefits of this innovation are the lack of any need for additional power, strip gas, or location for venting the separated gas. As the unit contains no membrane, the transport fluid will not be lost due to evaporation in the process of gas separation. Separation is performed with relatively low pressure drop based on the large surface area of the separating screen. Additionally, there are no moving parts, and there are no failure modes that involve fluid loss. A patent application has been filed...|$|E
