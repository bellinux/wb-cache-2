5|$|In 1992, after {{a three-year}} trial of <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> in Queensland, Australia, a {{referendum}} on <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote– with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating {{the implementation of a}} dual-time zone arrangement for <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> in South East Queensland {{while the rest of the}} state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. On April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement. The Bill was defeated in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E
5|$|<b>Daylight</b> <b>saving</b> time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} <b>daylight</b> <b>savings</b> among small businesses represented {{by a group of}} 41 operators consisting of small wineries, bed and breakfast, food factories and other facilities open to the public located in and around Perth, the capital of Western Australia. While the largest group of respondents in this study did not perceive any major impacts of <b>daylight</b> <b>savings</b> to their businesses, just over one-third of operators viewed <b>daylight</b> <b>savings</b> as detrimental to their businesses. The overall findings clearly reflect the ongoing heated political debate in Western Australia and have a number of implications for businesses, including the fact that <b>daylight</b> <b>savings</b> is affecting operators 2 ̆ 7 lifestyle and working patterns. Further, as some respondents indicated, <b>daylight</b> <b>savings</b> also appears to be affecting their customers 2 ̆ 7 behavior, with resulting potential negative consequences for their operations...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption of <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E

5|$|George Hudson {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> in 1895. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation, starting on April 30, 1916.

5|$|The {{history of}} time in the United States {{includes}} DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. In May 1965, for two weeks, St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis, Minnesota were on different times, when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox (parent of Kingsford Charcoal) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both Idaho senators voted for it {{based on the premise that}} during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries, which are made from Idaho potatoes.|$|E
5|$|These {{limitations}} {{have caused}} problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied {{each year and}} was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> time according to the Gregorian calendar.|$|E

5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent.

In May 2016, the Azerbaijan government decided to abandon the use of <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> time, prompting event organisers to change the start time of the race.

5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E
