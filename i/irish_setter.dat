5|$|Nagle {{acquired}} {{her first}} <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter,</b> whom she named Sulhamstead D'Or, in 1924 {{to keep a}} wolfhound puppy company. In April 1930 she entered him into the All-Aged Stakes at the Kennel Club field trials. In August 1932 she entered a dog named Sulhamstead Token D'Or into the Scottish Field Trials in the same category. At the Kennel Club field trials of April 1933, Nagle entered Sulhamstead Bob D'Or into the All-Aged Stakes and the judge awarded her the prize presented by the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> Association of England. In September 1934, she entered her <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> Sulhamstead Snip D'Or into the Novice Stake of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society's 12th working trials at Pynes, near Exeter.|$|E
5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an <b>Irish</b> <b>setter</b> named Kelly, and had him sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made very much noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the breed in Russia increased after the early 1990s, with Moscow dog shows since that time annually including between 120 and 131 Russian Spaniels, which qualifies the breed {{as one of the}} most popular, along with the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter.</b> In 2002, the Russian Spaniel Club was set up in the United States to increase the knowledge of the breed outside Russia and to enable owners to register their dogs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> {{tend to be}} a {{relatively}} healthy breed. Problems that have been noted in <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> include ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> {{are deep}} chested dogs with small waists. An <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter's</b> life {{expectancy}} {{tends to be}} around 11 to 12 years.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> enjoy {{having a}} job to do. Lack of {{activity}} {{will lead to a}} bored, destructive, or even hyperactive dog. This is not a breed that can be left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, nor should they be. <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> thrive on constant human companionship. <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> respond swiftly to positive training and are highly intelligent.|$|R
25|$|A {{favourite}} dog of Alexander II was an <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> named Milord.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> was bred for hunting, {{specifically}} for setting or locating and pointing upland gamebirds. They are a tireless, wide-ranging hunter, and well-suited to fields and wet or dry moorland terrain. Using their excellent {{sense of smell}} to locate the mark (or bird), the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> will then hold a pointing position, indicating {{the direction in which}} the bird lies hidden.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> {{was brought}} to the United States in the early 19th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> {{tend to be}} a {{relatively}} healthy breed. Problems that have been noted in <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> includehip dysplasia, cancer, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), epilepsy, entropion, hypothyroidism, hyperosteodystrophy, gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), osteosarcoma, Von Willebrand's disease, patent ductus arteriosus, canine Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD) and celiac disease.It should be noted that <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> are now one of the few breeds for which genetic tests have been developed to detect the presence of both CLAD and PRA (RCD-1).|$|R
2500|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> {{get along}} well with children, other dogs, and will enthusiastically greet visitors. [...] Even {{though they do}} well with {{household}} pets, small animals may pose a problem for this breed, as they are a hunting breed. [...] Some <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> may have problems with cats in the house, and may be too rambunctious with small children. [...] As the FCI, ANKC and UK Standards state, the breed should be [...] "Demonstrably affectionate." [...] As a result, <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> make excellent companion animals and family pets.|$|R
2500|$|Though {{they are}} usually alert to their surroundings, <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> are not well-suited as guard dogs, as {{they are not a}} {{naturally}} assertive breed.|$|R
25|$|Bus Éireann, the {{national}} bus company in Ireland, uses the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> as its corporate logo.|$|E
25|$|Irish Setters {{are also}} widely used as therapy dogs {{in schools and}} hospitals. Therapy dogs are {{permitted}} in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter.</b> This process helps to enable the student {{the ability to read}} without being corrected or judged. Generally the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> will lie on the floor with the student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1975, a {{relationship}} {{existed between the}} AKC and the Field Dog Stud book in which registration with one body qualified a dog for registration with the other. In 1975 the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> Club of America petitioned the AKC to deny reciprocal registration, and the AKC granted the request. It is claimed, by critics of the move, that the pressure {{was placed on the}} AKC by bench show enthusiasts who were unappreciative of the outcrossing efforts of the National Red Setter Field Trial Club, as well as some AKC field trialers following a series of losses to FDSB red setters. Working <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> kennels today field champion dogs that claim lines from both the FDSB dogs and AKC dogs.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> are now one of the few breeds for which genetic tests have been {{developed}} to detect the presence of both CLAD and PRA (RCD-1).|$|R
50|$|Originally, setters in Ireland {{were mostly}} red, or the parti-colour red and white, or even nearly all white dogs. All were {{accepted}} as <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> and were mated to each other.|$|R
50|$|Numerous non-sled dog breeds {{have been}} used as sled dogs. Poodles, <b>Irish</b> <b>setters,</b> German shorthaired pointers, Labrador retrievers, Newfoundlands, and St. Bernards have all been used to pull sleds in the past.|$|R
25|$|Anecdotal history {{suggests}} the added infusion of Pudelpointer, Bloodhound and <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> blood {{during the period}} of the Second World War when many other Hungarian kennels became involved {{in the development of the}} breed. It has also previously, but incorrectly been suggested that the breed was created by backbreeding of smooth Vizsla's most heavily coated offspring (Gottlieb, idem).|$|E
25|$|The Breed Standard for {{the modern}} <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> was first drawn up by the Irish Red Setter Club in Dublin and {{approved}} on 29 March 1886. It consisted of a 100-point scale, with a given number of points awarded {{for each of the}} dog's physical attributes. The points system was later dropped; however, aside from some minor changes, the Standard remains largely unchanged today in most countries where the breed is formally recognised.|$|E
25|$|Brooks is {{descended from}} the Yup'ik Eskimos and Athabascan Indians, two of the {{indigenous}} groups who {{were the first to}} mush dogs in Alaska. His grandfather, Gareth Wright, was a competitive musher who won both major Alaskan sled dog races of the 1940s, the American Championship (twice), and the Fur Rendezvous World Championship (three times). Wright was also a dog breeder and kennel owner who became known for breeding the Wright's Aurora Husky from the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter,</b> the St. Lawrence Siberian Husky, and village dogs.|$|E
50|$|Lauretta later married William R. Golden, a Hollywood executive, {{and became}} a nationally known {{exhibitor}} and breeder of <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters.</b> A resident of Pacific Palisades, she died after an extended illness on July 17, 1972.|$|R
5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters,</b> from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The breed {{was little}} known in Britain and the Kennel Club had {{inadvertently}} listed Harlequin's Crufts entry among the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters.</b> This was the trigger for {{great interest in}} the breed, as it proved the breed was not extinct as was believed.|$|R
25|$|In 1874, the American Field put {{together}} the Field Dog Stud Book and registry of dogs in the United States was born. The FDSB is the oldest pure-bred registry in the United States. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from sires and dams of different breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding of English Setter and, among other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time, the red <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> became a favourite in the dog show ring.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Field and Stream {{magazine}} {{put into}} writing what {{was already a}} well-known fact. The <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> was disappearing {{from the field and}} an outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a working dog. Sports Afield chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrande of Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish Setters in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book, he began an outcross to red and white field champion English Setters. The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to test the dogs and to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white setters. Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} cross {{was of a}} yellow-coloured retriever, 'Nous', with a Tweed Water Spaniel female dog, 'Belle'. The Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct, but {{was then}} common in the border country. Marjoribanks had purchased Nous in 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated retriever pups. In 1868, this cross produced a litter that included four pups; these four became {{the basis of a}} breeding program which included the <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter,</b> the sandy-coloured Bloodhound, the St. John's water dog of Newfoundland, and two more wavy-coated black retrievers. The bloodline was also inbred and selected for trueness to Marjoribanks' idea of the ultimate hunting dog. His vision included a more vigorous and powerful dog than previous retrievers, one that would still be gentle and trainable. Russian sheepdogs are not mentioned in these records, nor are any other working dog breeds. The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is all sporting dogs, in line with Marjoribanks' goals. The Golden Retriever was active and powerful and had a gentle mouth for retrieving games while on hunts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> are {{an active}} breed, and require long, daily walks and off-lead running in wide, open spaces. They are, however, a breed with a {{tendency}} to 'play deaf,' so careful training on mastering the recall should be undertaken before allowing them off-lead.|$|R
25|$|Cerebellar {{hypoplasia}} is {{an incomplete}} {{development of the}} cerebellum. The most common cause in dogs is an in utero infection with canine herpesvirus. It is also seen associated with lissencephaly in Wire-haired Fox Terriers and <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters,</b> and as a separate condition in Chow Chows.|$|R

500|$|In July 1935 Nagle {{entered the}} field {{trials of the}} <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> Association near Ruabon in North Wales, {{competing}} in the Open Stake for Irish Setters and the Puppy Stake for Irish Setters, for puppies which were born the previous year. At the 35th International Gun Dog League trials held at Douglas Castle in August 1935, she was awarded a diploma in the Champion Stakes for Pointers and Setters. The following month, Nagle took the silver perpetual challenge trophy in the Open Stake of the field trials of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society at Newlyn, near Newquay, competing with her <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> Sulhamstead Baffle D'Or. At the Kennel Club field trials for pointers and setters in April 1936, she entered Sulhamstead Bluff D'Or into the All-Aged Stake and was awarded the Penheale Challenge Cup by Captain N. R. Colville for the [...] "best constitutioned dog or bitch, displaying the greatest game-finding ability". At the 18th annual Scottish Field Trial Association's field trials for pointers and setters at Yester estate in Gifford, East Lothian, Scotland in August 1936, Nagle won first prize in the Brace Stake with Sulhamstead Bluff D'Or. The Kennel Club own a pastel painting by Cecil Aldin of two of Nagle's Irish Setters, the Field Trial Champions Sulhamstead Sheilin D'Or and Sulhamstead Valla D'Or. Field trials saw a general downturn in popularity of Irish Setters competing in the 1930s; during the following decade the breed was principally represented by Nagle's dogs. Nagle had eighteen <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> field trial champions during the period she {{was active in the}} breed from the 1920s to the mid-1960s. The male dog Harlequin of Knockalla was pivotal in the revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed in the 1970s; he was a descendant of Nagle's <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> Sulhamstead Natty D'Or, so the Sulhamstead bloodline is behind most modern day red and whites. Nagle withdrew from the field-trial scene in the mid-1960s following the retirement of her handler, George Abbott.|$|E
500|$|Nixon was {{initially}} {{convinced that the}} speech was a failure. Despite the congratulations of Rogers and Chotiner, {{and the fact that}} one of the cameramen had tears running down his face, he reproved himself for not mentioning the address of the Republican National Committee. Though the Young Republicans continued their applause as the Nixon party left the theatre, the candidate fixed on an <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter</b> running alongside his car as it pulled away from the curb. [...] "Well, we made a hit in the dog world anyway." [...] Despite the senator's despair, his wife was convinced that her husband had vindicated himself. Over sixty million Americans had watched or listened to the speech, including the largest television audience up to that point.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} shows Eakins {{and five}} friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each {{of the men}} {{is looking at the}} water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, [...] "apparently lost in a contemplative moment". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c.1865– c.1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' <b>Irish</b> <b>Setter,</b> c.1880–90), George Reynolds (c.1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to address the {{possibility}} of a very restricted gene pool, the Irish Kennel Club (IKC) announced in 2011 that it was to instigate a programme of allowing Irish Red and White Setters to be crossed with <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters.</b> Any such outcross matings were to be carefully monitored. The programme was supported by the Irish Red and White Setter Club of Ireland, the <b>Irish</b> Red <b>Setter</b> Club (Ireland) and other national Kennel Clubs. The IKC felt there was a high degree of inbreeding within ten generations of Irish Red and White setters and wished to increase the genetic diversity of the breed to prevent genetic problems arising from close inbreeding. It considered the genes of the working lines of <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters</b> were very {{similar to those of the}} Irish Red and White setters and the close ancestry had already been used to aid the revival of the Irish Red and White setter. Before any outcross matings could take place, the mating would have to be approved by the official Outcross Committee. Only dogs with current health tests would be considered.|$|R
25|$|Laryngeal {{paralysis}} is unilateral or bilateral paralysis of the larynx. In dogs {{it can be}} congenital, seen in the Bouvier des Flandres, Bull Terrier, Dalmatian, Rottweiler and Huskies, or an acquired, idiopathic disease, seen {{in older}} Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, St. Bernards, and <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters.</b> Signs include change in voice and difficulty breathing.|$|R
50|$|The English Setter is {{a medium}} size breed of dog. It {{is part of}} the Setter family, which {{includes}} the red <b>Irish</b> <b>Setters,</b> <b>Irish</b> Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes {{on the back of the}} legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.|$|R
