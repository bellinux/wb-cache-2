40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theoretical framework}} to explain why governments seek restrictions on IPR protection and allow R&D subsidies through multilateral trade agreements such as the TRIPS Agreement and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. After 7 years of discussion, the Uruguay Round extends GATT’s trade-liberalizing philosophy to worldwide use of subsidies as a secondary means to intervene in international trade. Through the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures the WTO tries to preserve one of basic principles of GATT’s philosophy: Fair Competition. The principle of Fair Competition is of particular importance in understanding the WTO. To harness GATT’s trade liberalizing philosophy, the WTO as a successor of GATT takes this principle as objectives that are pursued through the enforcement and implementation of other principles, for instance the nondiscrimination and reciprocity. As {{an example of the}} fair competition principle, the WTO prohibited any type of export subsidies through the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, but allowed R&D subsidies. The allowance of R&D subsidies by the WTO is a puzzle because {{it is well known that}} R&D subsidization forms the prisoners’ dilemma when governments are active to set R&D policy. In order to find any reasonable logic to explain this puzzle, we focus on the interaction between strategic trade policy tools: R&D subsidization and IPR protection. Indeed, at an international level IPR protection has been a major focus of negotiations along with R&D subsidies. The WTO also requires member countries to strongly enforce patent protection through the TRIPS Agreement. In our analysis, it turns out that it is globally optimal to perfectly disseminate knowledge without IPR protection and to subsidize inventive firms by solving a problem that the weak IPR protection damages firms’ incentive to invest in R&D activities. However, current trade agreements do not match with our global optimum. We show that exporting countries may benefit – at the expense of <b>importers</b> <b>–</b> from a trade agreement to demand stronger enforcement on IPR protection because exporting countries experience the prisoner’s dilemma problem when both countries free ride on the rival firm’s R&D outcome. Therefore we conclude that it is possible to understand the TRIPS Agreement as an inefficient victory of the interests of northern exporting countries over those of southern importing countries.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{understanding}} how manufacturers' heterogeneity affects {{the configuration of}} trading relations and prices in a dynamic environment. The institutional context I study {{is that of the}} Ready Made Garment sector in Bangladesh over the 2005 - 2012 period. The research here represents a contribution to that goal in four dimensions. First, accessing customs records we constructed a dataset containing buyer - seller trade interactions at a disaggregated level, including volumes and unit prices of the traded goods and, for a subsample, prices and quantities of the inputs required for manufacturing them. This feature allows us to go a step further than most studies based on matched <b>importer</b> <b>-</b> exporter data and opens a fruitful research agenda. Second, using this dataset I offer a first characterisation of the dynamics of the relations between manufacturers and large international buyers in matters of (i) duration of the relations, (ii) evolution of volumes, prices, orders and profitability over time, (iii) heterogeneity of the manufacturers and (iv) the probability of trading links arising. I �nd that relations with large buyers tend to be exclusive, that higher prices are associated with longer lasting relations, which tend to grow over time and fail whenever the manufacturer starts dealing with another large player. Importantly, I present a characterisation of suppliers heterogeneity novel in the literature and show evidence on two salient facts: the higher the heterogeneity across suppliers faced by a buyer, the more persistent its relations are and the higher the markup the buyer is willing to pay. Third, I develop a dynamic discrete choice game of linking and bargaining that realises those patterns in the data. I implement an algorithm that computes Markov Perfect Equilibria to discuss aspects of computation, convergence and multiple equilibria in the game and I scan a large parameter space to characterise the mechanisms that drive the dynamics in the industry. Fourth, I present the structural approach developed by Lee and Fong (2013) for estimating network formation games with endogenous bargaining and discuss three aspects in which its application is not immediate in my setting. These are related to (i) the availability of prices in our data, (ii) the difficulties in recovering conditional choice probabilities from the data, and (iii) the construction of the distance score. These difficulties lead to a pseudo Monte Carlo exercise that compares (sixteen) alternative estimation procedures. This preliminary study suggests that restricting the objective function to the observed states, using an auxiliary parametric assumption on the conditional choice probabilities in unobserved states and exploiting the data on prices could be fertile paths to explore towards adapting Lee and Fong's approach to estimate structurally the parameters of my game with the data we constructed...|$|R

A theoretically justified gravity model is estimated for disaggregated trade data using a sample of 104 exporters and 108 <b>importers</b> for 1980 <b>-</b> 2003 to achieve two main goals. First we are able to empirically test some of the theoretical predictions of Markusen (2010), namely that there is a positive dependence of trade on per capita income and that higher inequality increase trade of more sophisticated goods. Second, and in line with the Linder hypothesis, we hypothesized that a higher demands’ overlap implies a more similar demand structure and therefore more trade. We test this hypothesis with new measures of income-distribution similarity. National income distributions are used to calculate income similarity indices that measure how much each country pair overlaps in terms of income distribution and population. We find that per capita income is positively related to bilateral trade and that on average, a 10 percent increase in incomedistribution similarities increases exports by almost 4 percent being this effect stronger for more sophisticated goods in comparison with more homogenous ones.

40|$|The {{complicated}} {{world of}} {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables commerce has inspired me to proceed with this project. The main topic of this research is the production cost of tomato and potato which are the highest- in consumption -vegetables in the Greek market. The study is focused on Greek production versus rest countries around it (European and non European countries) which export these products under specific circumstances. By stating European countries, it is implied that the countries are laid geographically in European continent and they are included in the European Monetary Union. In non European countries there are either countries that belong geographically to Europe but they are not included in the European Monetary Union. Or countries that do not lay geographically in Europe. Therefore the methodology is divided geographically in two main levels of research: 1. Data collection from Greece where there are focus groups of agronomists, cooperative unions, traders. There’s a base of around two hundred farmers who have filled in questionnaires regarding the crops mentioned above. 2. Data collection from rest countries is based from interviews of foreign exporters, local <b>importers</b> <b>–</b> traders, embassies and also from colleagues of the mother company that I am working for. The questionnaires are structured in such a way to avoid coincidental answers by the interviewed people. The analysis was based on the SPSS statistical program and this has led to several findings: - Contracted agriculture in Greece may keep production costs low and reinforce the competitive power towards rest countries. In future, it should obviously expand to more crops. - Low income farmers pay more attention to finding cheap equipment than the rest. - Most farmers, especially the ones with big lands (more than five hectares per person) make precautionary use of chemicals to protect their crops from plant diseases. - Young farmers invest more in new technology and equipment than older generations. - Farmers, who invest in their crop business, believe in the future of biological agriculture. - The current evolution of biological agriculture in Greece remains lower than the average European one. - Large production farmers are more professional and they work on economies of scale to minimize their costs. - The expansion of organic crops in the Greek market can lead to a sustainable level of income for both producers and traders - Apart from unpredictable parameters like weather, the marketing of agricultural production can fully guarantee positive income. - The more professional the farmers are the more the investment in their crops - On a contract basis agriculture, farmers and super markets may become valuable partners Furthermore, the conclusions of this project can probably lead to future research on the topics below: - The successful minimization of production cost to contracted potato crops should find application in other cultivations. - The development of private labels in {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} is another exit to large scale Greek agricultural production. - Once the consumers become familiar with private labels, then the future researchers should concentrate on the evolution of these products. - The Greek exports should prioritize on the production of competitive, safe and qualitative products. These are the key factors to adapt to the European consumers’ demands. - The typical bureaucracy regarding imports and exports to and from Greece has to be lessened, because it often causes delays to loadings and quality reduction. - Exports to Scandinavian countries need to be further investigated in future. These countries have the financial ability to pay the added value of products, but they have high quality standards. The risk of rejection and a permanent collaboration break is quite high in such countries, if there is quality uncertainty. - Commercial challenges among rest countries should also be analyzed in future studies (exports from Fyrom to north Europe, from Turkey to north Europe, from China to Europe and Russia). - New legislation that eliminates the export barriers from the third Mediterranean countries (Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon etc) should change the balances in the European agriculture.

40|$|Awokuse, Titus O. The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the impacts {{of changes in the}} maximum residual limit (MRL) of the antibiotic oxytetracycline on international trade in shrimp and prawns. The MRL is a food safety regulation set by the importing country, which is not consistent among the major importing countries. Increasing limitations on traditional barriers to trade over the past twenty years have caused importers to use sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) restrictions, such as food safety regulations, as barriers to trade. Much research has been done to identify SPS restrictions that limit trade and function as a barrier, but, while previous models have looked at the effect of different regulations on seafood, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, this is the first analysis on the effects of oxytetracycline regulation on international trade of shrimp. This is of importance because shrimp is a highly traded and valuable product that is created primarily in aquaculture. Focusing on a commodity mainly produced in aquaculture helps to isolate the effect of the regulation, which only applies to seafood produced in aquaculture. This thesis uses a gravity model to analyze a panel data set including trade values from top exporters of shrimp and prawns to top <b>importers</b> from 1995 <b>-</b> 2007. The resulting coefficient for the MRL of oxytetracycline indicates whether the restriction has a significant limiting effect on trade, and is then used in a series of simulations of regulation change. These simulations estimate the trade effects of harmonizing regulations on a number of different suggested MRL’s, as well as simulating the creation of an MRL for importers who have a zero tolerance policy in place. The results show the MRL to be a limiting factor, and that a harmonization on the recommended Codex Alimentarius standard would increase trade by 26 % or $ 1. 5 billion. Simulations of the creation of an MRL in countries with a zero tolerance policy would increase trade by 43 % or $ 2. 5 billion. This effect is dominated by imports to the US.

40|$|Abstract Background Chloride {{currents}} in peripheral nociceptive neurons have {{been implicated in}} the generation of afferent nociceptive signals, as Cl - accumulation in sensory endings establishes the driving force for depolarizing, and even excitatory, Cl - currents. The intracellular Cl - concentration can, however, vary considerably between individual DRG neurons. This raises the question, whether the contribution of Cl - currents to signal generation differs between individual afferent neurons, and whether the specific Cl - levels in these neurons are subject to modulation. Based on the hypothesis that modulation of the peripheral Cl - homeostasis {{is involved in the}} generation of inflammatory hyperalgesia, we examined the effects of inflammatory mediators on intracellular Cl - concentrations and on the expression levels of Cl - transporters in rat DRG neurons. Results We developed an in vitro assay for testing how inflammatory mediators influence Cl - concentration and the expression of Cl - transporters. Intact DRGs were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF, 1. 8 μM ATP, 0. 9 μM bradykinin, and 1. 4 μM PGE 2 for 1 – 3 hours. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging with the Cl - -sensitive dye MQAE revealed an increase of the intracellular Cl - concentration within 2 hours of treatment. This effect coincided with enhanced phosphorylation of the Na + -K + - 2 Cl - cotransporter NKCC 1, suggesting that an increased activity of that transporter caused the early rise of intracellular Cl - levels. Immunohistochemistry of NKCC 1 and KCC 2, the main neuronal Cl <b>-</b> <b>importer</b> and exporter, respectively, exposed an inverse regulation by the inflammatory mediators. While the NKCC 1 immunosignal increased, that of KCC 2 declined after 3 hours of treatment. In contrast, the mRNA levels of the two transporters did not change markedly during this time. These data demonstrate a fundamental transition in Cl - homeostasis toward a state of augmented Cl - accumulation, which is induced by a 1 – 3 hour treatment with inflammatory mediators. Conclusion Our findings indicate that inflammatory mediators impact on Cl - homeostasis in DRG neurons. Inflammatory mediators raise intracellular Cl - levels and, hence, the driving force for depolarizing Cl - efflux. These findings corroborate current concepts for the role of Cl - regulation in the generation of inflammatory hyperalgesia and allodynia. As the intracellular Cl - concentration rises in DRG neurons, afferent signals can be boosted by excitatory Cl - {{currents in}} the presynaptic terminals.

The functions do the wholesalers have been weakened {{since the end of the}} war, end of the war, and it is feared that this fact will weaken the economical power of Japan. To solve this problem, the members of the Kansai Branch in the Japan Society of Commercial Science make common researches how to strengthen the functions of the wholesalers, especially of the textile wholesalers and firms in Osaka. However at the start of this common researches, we met the difficulty how to pick up the suitable objects out of more than 3, 000 wholesalers and firms. For the purpose of overcoming this difficulty, the introductory research was made before the main investigation. The office of this introductory research was established in the Osaka University of the Liberal Arts and Education, and we the writer of this treatise took direct charge of it. This treatise is the interim report about this introductry research. There are 20 associations of textile wholesalers which have a membership of 2, 239. We selected 456 companies out of them, and sent each of them a questionaire by post. The 252 companies answered by mail. The items of this questionaire are 18. We can see from this research, the sum of the capital, the number of the employees, the amount sold, the percentage of the export, import and domestic trade, etc. There are five big textile firms which are called the “Go (or Five) Men ”-Itochu, Marubeni, Tomen, Nichimen and Gosho. In the pre-war time the big financial combine, the Mitsui, handled one fourth of the whole trade in Japan. The post-war disorganization of the big financial combines led the advance of the “Go (or Five) Men” to the top of the trade. In the pre-war time, the “Go (or Five) Men” were only the rextile firms, but in the post-war days they have developed to the general firms which handle not only textile goods but machines, foodstuff, etc. But the latest restoration of the financial combines again stimulates the competition with the “Go (or Five) Men” firms. The management index of these big firms is shown in Table 4. Table 6 shows the bales of cotton which were handled by the cotton <b>importers,</b> 1954, Jan. <b>-</b> 1954, Dec. The cotton firms which deal with 290 - 140 thousands bales of cotton are 6, those of 80 - 50 thousands bales are 3, those of 50 - 25 thousands bales are 5 and those of 25 - 20 thousands bales are 3. As for the cotton yarn we can classify the firms as follows : A class- 7, B class- 5, C class- 9, D class- 6. Among the objects of the research there are 88 exporters and 55 importers. Table 8 shows the percentage of the export and import which they handled...|$|R
