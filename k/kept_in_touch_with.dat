5|$|In 1958, when Alf {{was working}} with Charlie Lennon in the Barn Restaurant in Solihull, their brother Sydney sent a {{newspaper}} clipping from the Liverpool Echo reporting that Julia had died. A saddened Alf left Solihull for London, but <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Charlie by phone.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mau {{attempted}} to verify his navigational {{knowledge of the}} wider Pacific by working as a seaman on an inter-island ship run by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic and <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug {{if he wanted to}} come to Hawaii with him.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E

60|$|Sentiment succeeded whimsicality. His {{old friends}} of the office--those were the men to benefit. What good fellows they had been! Some were dead, but he still <b>kept</b> {{intermittently}} <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> {{half a dozen of}} them. And--an important point--he knew their present addresses.|$|R
5000|$|With Washburne's sponsorship, Grant was {{commissioned}} a colonel of volunteers on June 14, 1861, and appointed {{to command the}} 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. [...] During his command of the regiment and through the Vicksburg Campaign, Washburne <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Grant through his brother, Major General Cadwallader C. Washburn.|$|R
5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have taken no part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk appears not to have been trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> her exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on that campaign, in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1915, many Ghadarites (nearly 8,000 in the Punjab {{province}} alone by some estimates) had returned to India. However, they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis. Although some were rounded up by the police on suspicion, many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like Lahore, Ferozepur and Rawalpindi. Various plans {{had been made to}} attack the military arsenal at Mian Meer, near Lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 November 1914. In another plan, a group of Sikh soldiers, the manjha jatha, planned to start a mutiny in the 23rd Cavalry at the Lahore cantonment on 26 November. A further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 November from Ferozepur under Nidham Singh. In Bengal, the Jugantar, through Jatin Mukherjee, established contacts with the garrison at Fort William in Calcutta. In August 1914, Mukherjee's group had seized a large consignment of guns and ammunition from the Rodda company, a major gun manufacturing firm in India. In December 1914, several politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in Calcutta. Mukherjee <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Rash Behari Bose through Kartar Singh and V.G. Pingle. These rebellious acts, which were until then organised separately by different groups, were brought into a common umbrella under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose in North India, V. G. Pingle in Maharashtra, and Sachindranath Sanyal in Benares. A plan was made for a unified general uprising, with the date set for 21 February 1915.|$|E

She encouraged the entire Stax roster from her little perch behind the counter.|$|R
50|$|Roberts escaped, and was {{appointed}} minister of St Augustine Watling Street in the City of London the same year.

50|$|She was desolated by {{the death}} of her sister in 1829, but {{eventually}} resumed her social life among the county gentry and her extended family. Her favourite nephew Henry Gally Knight (a Tory) <b>kept</b> her <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> politics, <b>in</b> which she was a firm Whig and supporter of parliamentary reform. She also remained a firm Christian.|$|R
50|$|Slik Toxik <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> {{their fans}} through mail-outs and contests, which earned the band an {{enthusiastic}} grassroots following.

50|$|In the 1930s the Oxford Group had a {{substantial}} following in Germany. They watched {{the rise of}} the National Socialist party with alarm, as did those elsewhere in Europe and America. Buchman <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his German colleagues, and felt compelled to attempt to reach the Nazi leaders in Germany and win them to a new approach.|$|R
25|$|In {{personal}} terms, 1925 {{was also}} an important year for Zhou. Zhou had <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Deng Yingchao, whom he had met in the Awakening Society while in Tianjin; and, in January 1925, Zhou asked for and received permission from CCP authorities to marry Deng. The two married in Guangzhou on 8 August 1925.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duchess Vera {{was known}} in royal circles as an {{eccentric}} both in appearance and behavior. Although she <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> her Romanov relatives, visiting Russia many times, she identified more closely with her adopted country. In 1909 she abandoned Orthodox Christianity and converted to Lutheranism. She died two years later after a stroke.|$|E
25|$|Until 1935 {{he lived}} at Killermont, his Arts and Crafts house at Rowledge, Surrey. He then {{purchased}} {{a much smaller}} cottage, Woodhall Cottage on Woodhall Road, in Colinton, Edinburgh.

His remains were cremated and his ashes were buried in his father-in-law's plot at Warriston Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of diplomatic ties, and after the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, Cuba became increasingly dependent on Soviet markets and military and economic aid. Cuba was able to build a large military force {{with the help of}} Soviet equipment and military advisors. The Soviets also <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Havana, sharing varying close relations until the collapse of the bloc in 1990.|$|R

Working in tandem, the brothers used all of their considerable political influence to engineer a narrow 57-47 victory in the final vote.|$|R
50|$|In 1875 Balliol {{historian}} Arnold Toynbee {{paid the}} first of many visits to Whitechapel. In 1877, Barnett, who <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> constant <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Oxford, formed a small committee, over which he presided, to consider the organisation of university extension in London. His chief assistants were Leonard Montefiore, a young Oxford man, and Frederick Rogers, a member of the Vellum (Account Book) Binders' Trade Society.|$|R

5000|$|William Watson {{took the}} [...] "appellant" [...] {{side in the}} Archpriest Controversy, hostile to George Blackwell who had been {{appointed}} by the Holy See.

In 1602 he was confined in The Clink, but <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Bancroft.|$|R
50|$|The doges {{normally}} ruled {{for life}} (although {{a few were}} forcibly removed from office). After a doge's death, a commission of inquisitori passed judgment upon his acts, and his estate was liable to be fined for any discovered malfeasance. The official income of the doge was never large, and from early times holders of the office remained engaged in trading ventures. These ventures <b>kept</b> them <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> {{the requirements of the}} grandi.|$|R
25|$|At Bathurst, Rutherford {{became a}} member of the council, had a term as mayor in 1868, and was {{treasurer}} to the Agricultural Society for 30 years.

During his long period as governing-director of Cobb and Co., he <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his large station-properties, riding large distances as a young man, and later often travelling in a kind of Cape cart. Even in his eighties he continued the supervision of his stations, and he died at Mackay, Queensland, on 13 September 1911, when returning from a visit to one of them. He left a widow, five sons, and five daughters.|$|E
25|$|Between 1526 and 1528, Leland {{proceeded}} to Paris, studying {{along with many}} fellow expatriates, both English and German. His original plan to study in Italy, too, never succeeded. Leland honed his skills at composing Latin poetry and sought the acquaintance of humanist scholars whom he much admired, such as Guillaume Budé and Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples. A scholar of particular importance for Leland was François Dubois (Silvius), professor at the Collège de Tournai, who {{had a profound effect}} on his poetic as well as antiquarian interests. While in France, Leland <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his friends and sponsors in England, probably including Thomas Wolsey (d. 1530), Cardinal and Lord Chancellor, who made him rector at Laverstoke, Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s, Mathilde's {{ballet school}} prospered, {{allowing}} Grand Duke Andrei {{and his family}} to have a comfortable, yet modest life. He helped with the financial part of running the school, but continued to be afflicted by ill health due to his weak lungs. Although uninterested in politics, he continued to actively support a number of organization; he headed the Guard association, the Russian Historical and Genealogical Society in Paris {{and he was an}} honorary chairman of the union of Izmaylovsky Regiment. Andrei Vladimirovich also <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his Romanov relatives, particularly his brothers and many of his cousins, such as Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, Jr. and Prince Gabriel Constantinovich. His relationship with his sister, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, became strained as she never truly accepted Mathilde {{as a member of the}} family.|$|E
50|$|He {{was awarded}} the Military Cross. During several days of severe {{fighting}} he <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the battalion, working unceasingly without rest during the whole period, dressing the wounded including the French. He showed great initiative in establishing forward regimental aid posts, reconnoitring their sites beforehand under heavy hostile shell fire, thus greatly assisting the rapid evacuation of casualties. His courage and cheerfulness throughout a period of great strain were beyond praise.|$|R
50|$|IST <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the Bomb Disposal Unit of the Metropolitan Police and the Airport Police Authorities.
