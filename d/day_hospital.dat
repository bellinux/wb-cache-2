40|$|Aims and method: Mental health day centres {{have been}} little researched. We {{carried out a}} 1 -week census at the four day centres run by a London borough. Results: The centres catered for a group with long-standing mental health problems, mostly under {{community}} mental health team care. A surprising number were suffering from physical ill health. They attended the centres primarily for social reasons or to participate in creative groups such as music and art. Very few were concurrently attending <b>day</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Clinical Implications: Further work is essential to understand the distinction between NHS <b>day</b> <b>hospitals</b> and Social Services day centres in terms of utilisation and client group.

40|$|Background: It is {{perceived}} that North American home treatment studies reveal greater success in reducing <b>days</b> in <b>hospital</b> than do European studies. There are difficulties in extrapolating findings internationally. Aims: We aimed {{to determine whether}} North American studies find greater reductions in <b>days</b> in <b>hospital</b> and whether experimental service patients in North American studies spend less time in hospital. Method: The results of a systematic review were analysed with respect to study location. Service components ascertained through follow-up were utilised to interpret the meta-analyses conducted. Results: Most of the 91 studies found were from the USA and UK. North American studies found a difference of one <b>hospital</b> <b>day</b> (per patient per month) more than European studies {{but there was no}} difference in experimental data between the two locations. Conclusions: North American studies demonstrate greater differences in <b>days</b> in <b>hospital</b> but patients in their experimental services seem to spend no fewer <b>days</b> in <b>hospital,</b> implying a disparity in control services...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} nutrition knowledge and dietary practices of hypertensive adults attending hypertensive clinics at <b>Day</b> <b>Hospitals</b> in the Cape Metropole. Ten <b>Day</b> <b>Hospitals</b> were randomly selected from a total of 31 <b>Day</b> <b>Hospitals</b> and the first participants attending the hypertension clinics per day were recruited. A total of 85 participants were evaluated. The weight, height, waist and hip circumference of each participant was measured, as well as their blood pressure. Knowledge of dietary intake was obtained by completing a questionnaire, during an interview with the patient. Knowledge regarding salt usage indicated that a large percentage (34. 1 %) of participants believed that flavour enhancers like Aromat or Fondor could safely be used instead of table salt. Furthermore, 23. 5 % reported that tinned and smoked meat or fish have a low sodium (salt) content. Fruit and vegetables were perceived as having a positive effect on hypertension by 74. 1 % of participants. However, only 15 % of the group knew that the recommendation for their usage was five or more servings per day.
