5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>place</b> in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E

Barron Field was educated as a {{barrister}} and was called to the Inner Temple on 25 June 1814.

25|$|On 10 January 1809 Grandjean's troops {{captured}} a key outwork, the San José Convent. On 22 January Marshal Jean Lannes took {{command of the}} siege from Junot. On 27 January the light companies of Grandjean's 1st Brigade successfully stormed a breach in the city walls near the Palafox Battery and Musnier's division broke into the city <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>place.</b> Ordinarily, a lodgment within a city's walls would prompt the defenders to ask for terms, but the Spanish continued to fight behind barricaded houses and churches. Lannes determined to reduce the city building-by-building if necessary. Grandjean's division stormed the Santa Monica Convent on 30 January. Two days later the French overran the adjoining San Augustin Convent after a murderous struggle amid the pews of the convent church. That day, the 44th Line broke through the defenders and advanced {{to the center of}} the city but were then driven back nearly to their starting point after losing 200 men. Henceforth, Lannes decreed that the attackers must first consolidate their gains. As the French continued to edge forward street by street, covered by their plentiful artillery, the defense finally started to collapse. On 18 February, Grandjean's division seized the University and two days later the Spanish capitulated.|$|E

Some soldiers were reduced to eating grass and leaves. Pérignon's wing consisted of the infantry divisions of Grouchy and Louis Lemoine plus a two-brigade infantry reserve and Antoine Richepanse's cavalry reserve. All demi brigades had two battalions each except where otherwise noted. Grouchy's 5,620-man division had a first brigade under Charles Louis Dieudonné Grandjean made up of the 39th and 92nd Line Infantry Demi Brigades and one battalion of the 26th Light Infantry Demi Brigade. The second brigade of Henri François Marie Charpentier consisted of the 93rd and 99th Line Demi Brigades. Lemoine's 6,410-strong division included a first brigade under Louis Gareau with the 26th Line and 80th Line and one battalion of the 5th Light and a second brigade under Jean Mathieu Seras counting the 20th Light and 34th Line. The three squadron strong 1st Hussar Regiment was attached to Lemoine. The 4,875-man reserve included Bertrand Clausel's brigade with the 29th Light and 74th Line and Louis Partouneaux's brigade with the 105th Line and one battalion of the 26th Light.

2500|$|The role of Juan Diego as both {{representing}} and {{confirming the}} human {{dignity of the}} indigenous Indian populations and of asserting their right to claim a place of honour in the New World is therefore embedded in the earliest narratives, nor did it thereafter become dormant awaiting rediscovery in the 20th century. Archbishop Lorenzana, in a sermon of 1770, applauded the evident fact that the Virgin signified honour to the Spaniards (by stipulating for the title [...] "Guadalupe"), to the Indians (by choosing Juan Diego), and to those of mixed race (by the colour of her face). <b>In</b> <b>another</b> <b>place</b> in the sermon he noted a figure of eight on the Virgin's robe and said it represented the two worlds that she was protecting (the old and the new). This aim of harmonising and giving due recognition to the different cultures in Mexico rather than homogenizing them was also evident in the iconography of Guadalupe in the 18th century {{as well as in}} the celebrations attending the coronation of the image of Guadalupe in 1895 at which a place was given to 28 Indians from Cuautitlán (Juan Diego's birthplace) wearing traditional costume.

In the fifth book of Against Heresies, Irenaeus concentrates primarily on eschatology. In one passage he defends premillennialism by arguing that a future earthly kingdom is necessary because of God's promise to Abraham, he wrote “The promise remains steadfast... God promised him the inheritance of the land. Yet, Abraham did not receive it during all the time of his journey there. Accordingly, it must be that Abraham, together with his seed (that is, those who fear God and believe in Him), will receive it at the resurrection of the just.” <b>In</b> <b>another</b> <b>place</b> Irenaeus also explained that the blessing to Jacob “belongs unquestionably to the times of the kingdom when the righteous will bear rule, after their rising from the dead.

And all of the animals will feed on the vegetation of the earth... and they will be in perfect submission to man. And these things are borne witness to in the fourth book of the writings of Papias, the hearer of John, and a companion of Polycarp.” (5.33.3) Apparently Irenaeus also held to the sexta-/septamillennial scheme writing that the end of human history will occur after the 6,000th year.
