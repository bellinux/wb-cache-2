The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money.

You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And I have my own opinions about political correctness, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> It's Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout December 2014, Banks {{released}} {{a series of}} videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed the '16 Days of Azealia'. During the breakdown video for [...] "Chasing Time", Banks revealed that the song was conceived after the aforementioned occasion of her handing a completed version of the album in to her labels. In response to their request that Banks created something more current, she produced [...] "Chasing Time". This was further confirmed {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork Medias Jeremy Gordon, in which Banks said [...] "it got to a point where they were like, 'Azealia, we get it, you’re cool, but we've spent $2 million on this record, can you just give us one ?'

500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a writer}} of light fiction, I have always till now been {{handicapped}} {{by the fact that}} my disposition was cheerful, my heart intact, and my life unsoured. Handicapped, I say, because the public likes to feel that {{a writer of}} farcical stories is piquantly miserable in his private life, and that, if he turns out anything amusing, he does it simply in order to obtain relief from the almost insupportable weight of an existence which he has long since realized to be a wash-out. Well, today <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> that.|$|R

500|$|Oxford coach Sean Bowden said [...] "We {{had a good}} {{race and}} made all the right moves to Hammersmith, but we couldn't quite shake them off and didn't quite have enough lead to defend", while Cambridge's number six Kieran West said [...] "Credit to Oxford. They threw {{everything}} they had at us, but we absorbed it all." [...] Cambridge head coach Duncan Holland praised his cox: [...] "Rebecca was magnificent. She steered a superb course. She steered exactly where we thought she should steer and she stayed calm, it was great." [...] Dowbiggin herself recounted: [...] "The guys asked me to be very calm, very relaxed, not to panic, even if Oxford were pushing and moving, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> 'okay, they're pushing, they're moving, but we're going to do this'." [...] Bowden criticised the umpire who he claimed [...] "pushed us too tight round the bend. From Hammersmith Bridge on that took away our advantage." [...] Cambridge's Tom James was finally successful, winning the Boat Race at his fourth attempt: [...] "I really couldn't think about losing this race. [...] Oxford really hounded us. The line was getting closer but never quickly enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'Let me do my thing.' I just like to dance and I know when I like what I see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E
500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like'. So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

5000|$|Two days earlier, she {{elaborated}} on why she {{had written}} The Naked Truth, adding, [...] "I wrote The Naked Truth because I wanted people {{to get the full}} story and not a sound bite or the one-hour prep speaking engagement. Most people can’t identify with who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> HIV-Positive but they can identify with who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> before. That is what makes me relate and shows people that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> them. This virus <b>is</b> real and <b>just</b> because you <b>are</b> ignorant or uneducated about HIV that does not make you immune.

500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The singer would record {{late into}} the morning, {{sometimes}} until noon, before riding her bus to the next city. In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: [...] "It was the best [...] ever, it was some rock star [...] This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning I woke up and started crying so hard. I finally just got to my bed from the IV [...] and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'Good I can actually get to sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished [...] at 5pm the day before..." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{one of the}} {{producers}} of the song, Roccstar, he was aiming for authentic music, saying that, [...] "Seeing he’s {{supposed to be the}} next MJ, it’s kind of an automatic influence. I personally carry the Jackson sound a lot because I used to be around them so much. [...] With the bass line, I wasn’t really thinking ‘Let’s make a Michael Jackson song,’ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> ‘let’s make something that feels great.’ Chris was like, 'We got to do some real shit this album. People need to feel exactly what I’m doing, it needs to be emotional and people need to be emotionally attached to this record,' so we just went in." ...|$|E

Fodor stated that he would continue patrolling the city: I will continue to patrol with my team, probably tonight 13, 2011. In addition to being Phoenix Jones, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also Ben Fodor, father and brother. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> everybody else.

He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a man like other men, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a man like you.

2500|$|Sound the Alarm is {{the first}} album in a trilogy with the theme of self-discovery. It was {{followed}} by Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011). Conley said that Sound the Alarm was [...] "an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance." [...] He {{also said that the}} three-album concept was: [...] "just a bit of a therapeutic experiment". I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn’t really deal with the world or myself. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> this has got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{expected}} for a March 2006 release, the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year. Initially {{scheduled for a}} July 11, 2006 release, the album's original draft, entitled My Story, was eventually shelved {{in favor of a}} revamped version with a different vibe. Although manager Matthew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project, Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album's direction, and thus, she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project. Speaking of the delay and the original track listing, she told Billboard: [...] "it was basically a list of songs that I put together about the past three years of my life, with love and relationships", and added: [...] "And I remember listening to the record, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'I don't want this to be too deep to where, you know, [...] lose people.' And the record was too full of midtempos and ballads, so I wanted to bring it up a little bit." ...|$|E
