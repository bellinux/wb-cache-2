5|$|Many of the cannons {{and other}} weapons from the Mary Rose have {{provided}} invaluable physical evidence about 16th-century weapon technology. The surviving gunshields are almost {{all from the}} Mary Rose, and the four small cast iron hailshot pieces are the only known <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> type of weapon.|$|E
5|$|The house {{shows the}} {{transition}} from medieval architecture, in which the hall was the main living and entertaining room, to the more modern plan, where the hall became a reception room. Somerhill {{is one of the}} earliest <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> When built, this was an innovative design.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} whether birds should {{continue}} to be actively collected for research {{has been the subject of}} some debate among ornithologists (<b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> can be found in the lively exchanges between Remsen and Bekoff & Elzanowski, between Vuilleumier and Donegan, and between Dubois & Nemesio and Donegan).|$|E

5|$|The travelogues of {{the later}} 19th century in turn further contributed to the {{elaboration}} and propagation of the Great Wall myth. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> myth's growth are the false but widespread belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon or Mars.|$|E
5|$|There is {{discussion}} among both scholars and political groups regarding the best or most appropriate name {{to use for}} many of the people groups and their languages, as well as the proper romanization of that name. Commonly cited <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ambiguity include (Seediq/Sediq/Truku/Taroko) and (Tao/Yami).|$|E
5|$|When Serbian royalty was canonized, {{the church}} {{sometimes}} used their given names; <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> include: St. Stefan Vladislav ("Св. Стефан Владислав, краљ српски"), Milutin, Stefan Uroš I, Stefan Uroš II, Urošica, and others.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar power}} tower uses {{an array of}} {{tracking}} reflectors (heliostats) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers are more cost effective, offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies. The PS10 Solar Power Plant and PS20 solar power plant are <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> technology.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{adaptation}} is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) {{that fits}} into a common basketball court sized arena. This was quite popular when races {{were held at}} imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.|$|E

5|$|Earmarking is a {{requirement}} that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program’s assistance that must (minimum) or may (maximum) be used for specified activities. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> include limits imposed {{on the federal government}} on the amount of federal funds to cover administrative expenses, or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients. Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered (e.g. a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to).|$|E
5|$|Georgian {{architecture}} {{followed in}} a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath {{is one of the}} best <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace. Since the 1930s various modernist forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{occasionally}} {{an island}} may be {{named after a}} location on the nearby mainland, or a major neighbouring island - or vice versa. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> include: Vementry, which was originally {{the name of an}} island, but whose name has been transferred to a nearby farm on Mainland Shetland; Oldany Island, whose name has been transferred to Oldany; Cramond Island which is named after neighbouring Cramond (a district of Edinburgh); and Eilean Mhealasta in the Outer Hebrides, which is named after Mealista on Lewis.|$|E

5|$|Looting {{has been}} linked to the {{economic}} and political stability of the possessing nation, with levels of looting increasing during times of crisis. It also appears that art collectors have stelae, or portions of them, stolen to order by browsing archaeological books and catalogues for desirable pieces. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> may be found at Aguateca and El Perú, both in Guatemala's Petén department, where only the better preserved hieroglyphs and human faces were cut away.|$|E
5|$|Mapracorat {{is one of}} {{a number}} of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less {{obviously}} steroid-like in structure. Other typical <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group are ZK216348 and 55D1E1. The bulky, bicyclic aromatic substituents (R1 and R2) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.|$|E
5|$|Philippine {{music has}} evolved rapidly {{due to the}} {{different}} influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao. This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang.|$|E

5|$|Spoken English {{south of}} the Danelaw became, from at least the 11th century onwards, characterised by a {{pronunciation}} known as Southern Voicing, such as vrog for frog, or zummer for summer. Vainites or vains, variants of fainites or fains, are surviving <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> on {{the borders of the}} Danelaw to the north of London. Other truce terms prevail within the Danelaw.|$|E
5|$|T1E4/M13 – The Martin turret was {{replaced}} by the M33 and was based on the M3 Half-track. It was accepted as the M13 Half-track in July 1942. A total of 139 <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> variant saw action at Anzio as a ground support weapon used to repel heavy German attacks. It {{was replaced}} by the M16 in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Coatbridge accent {{has been}} {{categorised}} as making less {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently from general Scots usage. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> are seen the pronunciation of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge accent and pronunciation has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E
