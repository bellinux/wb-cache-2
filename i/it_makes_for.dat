25|$|In the United States, {{competitive}} drifters {{are required}} to run US DOT-approved (road legal) tires similar to racing slicks in rubber composition, but with shallow treads included. This is permitted, {{with the exception of}} some major championships including D1GP and Formula Drift which only permits commercially available tires that are approved by the sanctioning body. Professional drifting has come to the point where grip is tuned into cars to be defeated. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> a faster drift necessary in the current professional climate. Tires typically used by drifters are around the DOT treadwear rating of 200. Examples include the Hankook Ventus RS-3, Falken Azenis RT615K, Nitto NT05, Yokohama ADVAN Neova AD08R, and Achilles Radial 123s.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which is very difficult for the horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E

In 1984 he stated that [...] "the one-party state is more in keeping with African tradition. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> greater unity for the people.

The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was [...] "more complex than pure venial dictatorship", {{but that it was}} an [...] "ideo-dictatorship".|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan, however, from Television Without Pity, {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review. She criticized the {{character}} of Monica Reyes and called her [...] "Moronica". She ultimately gave the episode a C+ grade. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk called the entry [...] "borderline weird" [...] and used it as evidence that [...] "the ninth season [...] arguably the worst season of the series." [...] The A.V.

500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} single {{three out of}} a {{possible}} five stars. Copsey wasn't convinced with Cruz's vocal work on the song commenting that Kesha takes over the track, [...] "Cruz's vocals soar over the verses, his delicate tones fails to dent that deliciously trashy chorus. Luckily, guest star Kesha more than steps up to the mark [...] it's a bit of a shame that it's not her version of the song". Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe was negative in his review of the song. Capobianco called the song [...] "salacious", writing that it [...] "features that notorious no-talent, Ke$ha, but with its galloping percussion <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> salacious nonsense." [...] Ash Dosanjh from NME wrote that Cruz' downfall on his album was when he acted as the [...] "player", citing [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] as an example.|$|E

In relation to [...] "This Time Around", Hunter described it as a [...] "dynamite jam" [...] that's [...] "ripe for remixes" [...] and described [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] as being [...] "adventurous" [...] while noting that [...] "Earth Song" [...] as a [...] "noble sentiments" [...] that sounds [...] "primarily like a showpiece". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album a generally mixed review and commented that he would give the album's first disc three stars if it was released on its own. Jon Pareles of The New York Times believed that Jackson [...] "muttered" [...] lyrics such as [...] "They thought they really had control of me". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times said of [...] "This Time Around", [...] "a tough, rhythm-guitar-driven track co-written and co-produced by hit-maker Dallas Austin that sports one of the album's better grooves".|$|E

[...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentators commended {{the first}} half of [...] "Space Race". The A.V. Club {{columnist}} Todd VanDerWerff approved of several aspects of the episode—mainly its animation, character development, and dialogue. In his A grade review, VanDerWerff felt that the producers were playful with the concepts of space. [...] "Archer, of course, takes place in a weird blend of past and present," [...] he professed, [...] "but 'Space Race' goes {{out of its way to}} toss 'future' into the middle of that mix as well. There are so many jokes that come just from the characters hanging out in anti-gravity, for God's sake, including a ping pong paddle strategically covering Pam's breasts." [...] Commenting on the program's animation, The A.V. Club journalist thought that its emphasis on the convergence of various science fiction techniques resulted in aesthetically pleasing visuals. VanDerWerff stated, [...] "Everything about this one gleams, and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> an Archer that will almost certainly look great in HD." [...] Furthermore, he adulated the episode's dialogue, avouching that even the characters with very limited screen time were given opportunities to shine with humor. Although Marcos Canales of Screen Invasion opined that [...] "Space Race: Part I" [...] contained far too many one-liners and jokes, he praised the storyline and was keen to the character progression of Lana. [...] "Usually, she’s the best agent ISIS has and can do pretty much anything," [...] explained Canales, [...] "so putting her in a situation where she was not a bad ass gave the character some added depth which is something most animated shows don’t prioritize." [...] Cinema Blend's Jesse Carp—despite criticizing the show's [...] "nonsensical" [...] narrative—declared it to be hilarious.|$|E

2500|$|Present {{style and}} usage manuals deem simple split infinitives unobjectionable. For example, Curme's Grammar of the English Language (1931) says {{that not only}} is the split infinitive correct, but it [...] "should be furthered rather than censured, for <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> clearer expression". The Columbia Guide to Standard American English notes that the split infinitive [...] "eliminates all {{possibility}} of ambiguity", in contrast to the [...] "potential for confusion" [...] in an unsplit construction.

The Acme thread was developed in 1894 as a profile well suited to power screws that has various advantages over the square thread, which had been the form of choice until then. It is easier to cut via either single-point threading or die than the square thread is (because the latter's shape requires tool bit or die tooth geometry that is poorly suited to cutting); it wears better than square (because the wear can be compensated for); it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread; and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> smoother engagement of the half nuts on a lathe leadscrew than square does.|$|E

He praised the relationship between the characters of Worf and Gowron, saying [...] " [...] always reminding Gowron about honor, but we're on two totally different sides when it comes to honor. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> great drama."
