The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck's patent involves brominating safrole to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor.

Another method uses the Wacker process to oxidize safrole directly to the MDP2P intermediate with a palladium catalyst. Once the MDP2P intermediate has been prepared, a reductive amination leads to racemic MDMA (an equal parts mixture of (R)-MDMA and (S)-MDMA). Relatively small quantities of essential oil are required to make large amounts of MDMA. The essential oil of Ocotea cymbarum, for example, typically contains between 80 and 94% safrole. This allows 500ml of the oil to produce between 150 and 340 grams of MDMA.|$|E

The profiles of isoenzymes induced in vitro were compared with those induced in liver microsomes of rats dosed with the same agents. Clofibric acid, an agent {{which has not been}} thoroughly investigated previously, was shown to induce both in vivo and in vitro several P- 450 isoenzymes normally inducible by phenobarbitone (PB 1 a, PB 3 a and PB 3 b) or steroids (PB 2 c). Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that the inducible isoenzymes of cytochrome P- 450 are not distributed evenly throughout the hepatocyte population, and increasing concentrations of phenobarbitone or beta-naphthoflavone in the medium results in an increasing proportion of 'induced' cells. However, whereas maximal concentrations of beta-naphthoflavone resulted in virtually all cells containing induced levels of MC 1 b, a maximal concentration of phenobarbitone resulted in only 30 % of the cells containing induced levels of PB 3 a/PB 3 b. These results are discussed in relation to the heterogeneous distribution and induction of cytochrome P- 450 in the intact liver...|$|E
40|$|Key words: {{catalytic}} activity, iridium dioxide, olefins, oxide electrodes, ruthenium dioxide The electrocatalytic behaviour of {{a series}} of olefins was studied on thermally prepared Ti/MO 2 and Ti/M 0 : 3 Ti 0 : 7 O 2 electrodes (M = Ru, Ir) in 1. 0 M HClO 4 in mixed solvent (AN/H 2 O, 40 / 60 v/v). The voltammetric investigation was limited to the potential region preceding the OER on these electrodes materials (E < 1 : 2 V vs SSCE). Aliphatic olefins (isophorone and cyclohexene) are inactive while the aromatic olefins show a single (safrole) or two (<b>isosafrole)</b> oxidation peaks. The overall catalytic activity of these electrode materials is about the same for both substrates. However, when morphological effects (differences in electrode surface area) are taken into account, normalizing the geometric current density (or faradaic charge) per surface site activity, a slightly better efficiency of the active surface sites is observed for Ru-based electrodes when compared to the equivalent Ir-based materials. Partial substitution of the noble metal catalysts by TiO 2 results in a synergetic effect depressing the efficiency of the active surface sites of the TiO 2 -stabilized electrocatalysts. The decrease with potential cycling of the substrate oxidation current is attributed to dimeric/polymeric film formation blocking the electrode surface. Reflectance and FTIR spectroscopy as well as ohmic resistance data support film formation. 1...|$|E
