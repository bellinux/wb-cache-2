40|$|MIKYSKA Josef: The {{manufacture}} of <b>hold-down</b> <b>arm</b> by technology of fine blanking process. The diploma thesis deals with innovative technology of „hold-down arm“ by fine blanking technology. The component {{is made of}} steel plate no. 12 041. 20, 3 mm thick. The theoretical part presents possible solutions. In the project there are compared versions of fine blanking technology. Regarding the required size accuracy, surface quality and assumed series production of 600 000 pieces per year the fine blanking technology using V-ring was proposed as the innovative technology. On the basis of technological calculations the triple action hydraulic press GKP-F 100 (produced by Feintool) and a blanking tool were determined. The blanking tool solution is accomplished including calculations and futher documentation. Then, the project implies technical and economical evaluation of the present technology (conventional blanking with consequentional cutting) and of the newly designed technology. According to the analysis using the newly designed production technology economic and time savings are achieved...|$|E
50|$|Most rockets need stable {{support for}} a few seconds after {{ignition}} while the engines build up to stable, full thrust. Therefore, the vehicle is commonly held on the pad by <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> or explosive bolts, which are triggered when the vehicle is stable and ready to fly, at which point all umbilical connections with the pad are released.|$|R
50|$|Months before launch, {{the three}} {{stages of the}} Saturn V launch vehicle and the {{components}} of the Apollo spacecraft were brought inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and assembled in one of four high bays into a 363 ft-tall space vehicle on one of three Mobile Launchers. Each mobile launcher consisted of a two-story, 49 by 41 m launch platform with four <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> and a 136 m Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) topped by a crane used to lift the spacecraft into position for assembly. The MLP and unfueled vehicle together weighed 12600000 lb.|$|R
5000|$|As fully {{operational}} ICBMs, the Atlas E and F, which differed only in guidance systems, had upgraded engines and inertial control {{instead of the}} Atlas D's radio ground guidance. The ignition system was also {{different from the one}} used on the D-series, which used a [...] "wet" [...] start, meaning that the propellants were injected into the combustion chamber prior to ignition, and a hypergolic igniter on the fully developed version. The Atlas E/F for comparison used pyrotechnic cartridges and a dry start (ignition coming before propellant injection) for an extremely rapid ignition that required no hold-down time on the pad to prevent combustion instability. The booster engines had separate gas generators unlike the Atlas D which had one gas generator for both engines. The launcher system used for the E and F series was also different than the D series, eliminating the <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> in favor of a mechanism that would immediately release the missile as thrust built up.|$|R
2500|$|At 8.9 {{seconds before}} launch, {{the first stage}} {{ignition}} sequence started. The center engine ignited first, followed by opposing outboard pairs at 300-millisecond intervals to reduce the structural loads on the rocket. When thrust had been confirmed by the onboard computers, the rocket was [...] "soft-released" [...] in two stages: first, the <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> released the rocket, and second, as the rocket began to accelerate upwards, it was slowed by tapered metal pins pulled through dies for half a second. Once the rocket had lifted off, it could not safely settle back down onto the pad if the engines failed. The astronauts considered {{this one of the}} tensest moments in riding the Saturn V, for if the rocket did fail to lift off after release they had a low chance of survival given the large amounts of propellant. A fully fueled Saturn V exploding on the pad would have released the energy equivalent of two kilotons of TNT. To improve safety, the Saturn Emergency Detection System (EDS) inhibited engine shutdown for the first 30 seconds of flight. (See Saturn V Instrument Unit) ...|$|R
50|$|Missile 8B on September 14 {{continued}} the streak of pneumatic system difficulties when the LOX tank pressure regulator went full open for five seconds starting at T+210 seconds, {{resulting in a}} surge in tank pressure. The problem {{in this case was}} suspected to be caused by above-normal helium bottle temperatures. In addition, vernier hydraulic pressure failed again during vernier solo phase. Missile 6B broke the streak of successful flights on September 18 when it exploded 82 seconds after liftoff. The cause of the failure was traced to a seized turbopump, which resulted in abrupt termination of B-1 engine thrust at T+80 seconds. LOX regulator pressure fell off, resulting in gas generator flameout and complete shutdown of both booster engines, followed by missile pitch-up and structural breakup. It was suspected that flying debris from the turbopump had ruptured the LOX regulator sense line. At liftoff, one of the launcher <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> had also not retracted properly, which resulted in holes being torn in the B-1 thrust structure, however this was quickly ruled out as a cause of the failure.|$|R
50|$|LC-14 was {{the first}} Atlas pad in {{operation}} and hosted the initial test flights in 1957-58. It was also {{the only one of}} the original four Atlas pads to never have a booster explode on it. By 1959, it was decided to convert the pad for the Atlas D missile and space launches, and a large service tower was added early in the year. The first Atlas flown from the renovated LC-14 was Missile 7D on May 18, however a problem with the launcher <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> damaged the missile and caused its explosion shortly after launch. This was traced to improper procedures during the renovation of the pad and was quickly fixed. The first space launch off of LC-14 was the Big Joe Mercury test in September. As the designated Mercury-Atlas facility, LC-14 was thus the only Atlas pad sporting the infrastructure needed for manned launches. The first MIDAS satellites, one Atlas-Able launch, and a few more ICBM tests were conducted from LC-14 before it was completely turned over to NASA.|$|R

5000|$|The next attempt did {{not take}} place for nine months, because of the switch to the larger Agena B stage that could be {{restarted}} in orbit and the operational Program 101A satellites, which had a more advanced camera system with better resolution and a wider field of view. Samos satellites after Samos 2 also sported a large [...] "mushroom cap" [...] nose cone, as early plans had envisioned flying a manned capsule similar to Mercury. When it finally happened, the result was a complete disaster. Samos 3 lifted from PALC 1-1 on September 9, but the Atlas booster's engines shut down after the rocket had ascended about 12 inches and it fell back onto the pad in an enormous fireball. Postflight investigation found that an umbilical on PALC 1-1 had not detached on time, resulting in the booster being switched from internal to external power, but since the power umbilicals on the pad had already detached, the result was complete loss of electrical power to all Atlas systems. The accident necessitated improved procedures to umbilical lanyard installation, and modifications to the launcher system to prevent the <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> from releasing the launch vehicle until all umbilicals had detached.|$|R
50|$|The Atlas D {{testing program}} {{began with the}} launch of Missile 3D from LC-13 on April 14, 1959. Engine startup {{proceeded}} normally, but it quickly {{became apparent that the}} LOX fill/drain valve had not closed properly. LOX spilled {{around the base of the}} thrust section, followed by leakage from the RP-1 fill/drain valve. The propellants then mixed and exploded on the launch stand. Because of the open LOX fill/drain valve, the Atlas's propellant system suffered a loss of fuel flow and pressure that caused the B-2 engine to operate at only 65% thrust. Due to the imbalanced thrust, the Atlas lifted at a slanted angle, which also prevented one of the launcher <b>hold-down</b> <b>arms</b> from retracting properly. Subsequent film review showed that no apparent damage to the missile resulted from either the launcher release or the propellant explosion. The flight control system managed to retain missile stability until T+26 seconds when unstable B-2 combustion from the loss of LOX resulted in an explosion that caused the booster section to rip away from the missile. The Atlas sank backwards through its own trail of fire until the Range Safety destruct command was issued at T+36 seconds. The sustainer and verniers continued operating until missile destruction. All other missile systems had functioned well during the brief flight and the LOX fill/drain valve malfunction was attributed to a breakdown of the butterfly acutator shaft, possibly during the Pre-Flight Readiness Firing a few weeks earlier, so Atlas vehicles starting with Missile 26D would use an acutator made of steel rather than aluminum. The leakage from the fuel fill/drain valve was traced to an improper procedure during the prelaunch countdown and was not connected to the LOX fill/drain valve problem. LC-13 sustained some damage due to the anomalous liftoff of Atlas 3D, this was quickly repaired and preparations began for the launch of Missile 5D.|$|R
