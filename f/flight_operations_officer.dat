5|$|Though he {{was only}} a {{lieutenant}} at the time, many of VF-18's green pilots turned to Harris for advice. The squadron's commanding officer similarly recognized Harris's ability and made him <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> <b>officer.</b> According to later testimony from his peers, the tactical and flight training Harris provided to his outfit helped see them through the war. His prowess on the wing would save a number of them in more direct fashion, both in dog fights and carrier landings. On October 29, Intrepid entered a squall with a Combat Air Patrol inbound. Though many from VB-18 and VT-18 were forced to water land, Harris used his dead reckoning and other navigation skills to find the carrier in the storm. He landed successfully and radioed information to men in the air, saving them from the risks of water landing and preserving valuable aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Dispatch Operations Safety Audit (DOSA) is a {{proactive}} and predictive method in {{safety management system}} that detects the capabilities and pitfalls of dispatcher performance. In this study, Dispatch-Line Operations Safety Audit is carried out in an airline and results are analyzed and discussed. Design/methodology: The method of DOSA implementation for <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> <b>officers</b> is similar to LOSA for flight crew. Findings: Results show that DOSA has an important effect on Threat and Error Management (TEM) in the Operations Control Center (OCC). Originality/value: Potential applications of this research include the better threat and error management in OCC {{with the implementation of}} DOSA as well as identification of threats and errors types for FOOs in OCC. Also, distribution of threats and errors in different phases of dispatch shift is discussed, therefore syllabuses of training courses can be provided with respect to threat and error types for <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> <b>officers.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
