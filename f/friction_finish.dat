50|$|An {{abrasive}} is a material, often a mineral, {{that is used}} {{to shape}} or finish a workpiece through rubbing which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by <b>friction.</b> While <b>finishing</b> a material often means polishing it to gain a smooth, reflective surface, the process can also involve roughening as in satin, matte or beaded finishes. In short, the ceramics which are used to cut, grind and polish other softer materials are known as abrasives.|$|R
50|$|The Maple Floor Manufactures Association {{does not}} {{recommend}} {{the use of}} masking, theatrical, construction, electrical, duct, adhesive or {{any other kind of}} tape to mark temporary court boundaries on the surface of a finished maple floor. It is likely that the tape, when removed, will peel away layers of the floor’s surface finish. Most tapes promoted for temporary markings have a different coefficient of <b>friction</b> than <b>finishes</b> applied to the maple playing surface, and can impact a person’s ability to start, stop and pivot. Removing the surface paint/finish and exposing the maple can result in additional chipping and peeling of the remaining paint/finish in adjacent areas.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The MMS- 2 B wear {{machine was}} used to study {{abrasion}} wear of work rolls in cold rolling by simulating emulsion cooling during the cold rolling process. The work roll materials used were 4 %Cr, same as those in industrial production. The surface SEM scanning photographs were taken every 30 minutes until the <b>friction</b> experiment <b>finished,</b> and erosive appearance of emulsion on the work roll surface {{could be seen in}} the photos. The corrosive wear of the work roll surface is discussed. Findings show that the main causes of stress corrosion and pitting corrosion are uneven microstructure on the work roll surface and a large number of dislocation accumulations, which form microscopic cells. Water in steel rolling emulsion is the main conductive medium of electrochemistry reaction, and this intensifies the corrosive wear...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe basic {{principle}} of friction welding is intermetallic bonding {{at the stage}} of super plasticity attained with self-generating heat due to <b>friction</b> and <b>finishing</b> at upset pressure. Now the dissimilar metal joints are especially popular in defense, aerospace, automobile, bio-medical, refinery and nuclear engineerings. In friction welding, some special alloys with dual phase are not joined successfully due to poor bonding strength. The alloy surfaces after bonding also have metallurgical changes {{in the line of}} interfacing. The reported research work in this area is scanty. Although the sound weld zone of direct bonding between Ti– 6 Al– 4 V and SS 304 L was obtained though many trials, the joint was not successful. In this paper, the friction welding characteristics between Ti– 6 Al– 4 V and SS 304 L into which pure oxygen free copper (OFC) was introduced as interlayer were investigated. Box–Behnken design was used to minimize the number of experiments to be performed. The weld joint was analyzed for its mechanical strength. The highest tensile strength between Ti– 6 Al– 4 V and SS 304 L between which pure copper was used as insert metal was acquired. Micro-structural analysis and elemental analysis were carried out by EDS, and the formation of intermetallic compound at the interface was identified by XRD analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{lubrication}} of dry viscose fibres by a two component finish, and the lubrication of wet Iyocell fabric against metal, {{with various}} aqueous lubricant systems, has been studied. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was investigated {{as a means}} of providing direct chemical information from finished fibre surfaces. The composition and distribution of a two component finish applied to viscose fibres was determined successfully. When applying finish from a bath, the surface composition of the finished fibres was not controlled by the bath conditions. Increasing the concentration of finish in the bath did, however, increase the total amount of finish deposited, and increasing the concentration of antistat relative to lubricant in the bath increased the amount of antistat relative to lubricant deposited on the <b>finished</b> fibres. Fibre <b>friction</b> was determined using the capstan method. The friction forces, measured for finished viscose fibres, were correlated with the finish application conditions. Increasing the emulsion concentration in the finish bath reduced fibre/metal <b>friction,</b> but <b>finish</b> component ratio, emulsion concentration, dip time and bath temperature did not affect fibre/fibre friction. Spray applying the finish resulted in unfinished regions on the fibre surfaces and the electrical resistance of fibre bundles was not reduced. Bath application of finish did lower electrical resistance in comparison with unfinished fibre, but none of the bath deposition variables had a significant effect on electrical resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{reported}} that the micro wavy surface formed by machining combined with laser heat treatment have higher static coefficient of friction compared with the surface finished by polishing or cutting. Therefore, this study was carried out to clarify the surface formation mechanism {{in order to control}} micro wavy height and the influence of lubricant viscosity on static frictional force. In practical use, high viscosity lubricant is used in wet brake to prevent oil leakage. At cutting after laser heat treatment, when the higher thrust force was, the higher micro wavy height was obtained. Thus, decreasing cutting speed or increasing feed rate, the obtained micro wavy height became higher. The static coefficient of <b>friction</b> of surface <b>finished</b> by polishing was decreasing with lubricant viscosity. This tendency was also seen at micro wavy surface. However, the static coefficient of friction of micro wavy surface was constantly higher than polished surface regardless of lubricant viscosity. © 2011 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the liquid}} phase’s driving action, {{particles}} would be collided the surface and impacted {{with each other in}} the flow passage, the surface will be machined though the continuous action of impact force and <b>friction</b> force. The <b>finishing</b> results of structural surface is related to the collision frequency and the pressure, abrasion situation in different area of the structural surface can be analyzed obviously by investigating dynamic characteristic and distribution of particle group. Based on coupled wave theory of liquid-solid two phases flow, using mixture model which belongs to Euler-Euler multiphase flow model and realizable k-ε turbulence model, turbulence effects of liquid-solid two-phase flow in the wall is numerical simulated and some parameters such as turbulent velocity and turbulent energy are calculated with different particles concentration in the flow passage which has V-shaped texture and semicircular cross-section. The simulation results show that the disorder degree of turbulence can be improved by assembling V-shaped constrained component, because V-shaped passage is benefit of eddy current’s generation. As the concentration of particles being enhanced, the velocity of particle would be increased in a certain range, turbulence energy reduces gradually, fluctuation margin of particle volume fraction is smaller and smaller, and curves of every kind of parameters change as continuous oscillation, area of surface corresponded with crest of the curve. The concentration of particles should be selected properly and different particles distribution and finishing performance would be obtained with different particles concentration...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium alloys {{are being}} {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry {{as a means of}} light-weighting the vehicle body to reduce emissions. The forming characteristics of aluminium alloys, however, differ from those of conventional deep-drawing quality materials, and the drive to reduce vehicle development times has led to reliance on simulation of forming operations to establish feasibility in the early design stages. It is known that friction has a major influence on the forming characteristics of a material and changes as the material plastically deforms and surface roughness increases, causing a transition from hydrodynamic to a mixed friction regime where metal to metal contact is increased. In the simulation environment however, friction is usually assumed to be constant. The development of higher strength alloys requiring higher forming forces suggest that a constant friction value may not always be a valid assumption. In this paper the friction behaviour of three commercially available automotive aluminium grades are compared, at different levels of strain, using a strip draw test. The results show that for a material with a standard mill <b>finish</b> <b>friction</b> is anisotropic, remaining so even at relatively high strains and the anisotropy is independent of the direction of strain. The friction coefficient increases with the level of strain but the use of solid wax lubricants helps to overcome this maintaining a uniform friction at strains up to 10 %. For aluminium with an EDT finish the roughening effects due to plastic strain are completely overcome and again a constant friction value is valid. In some alloys the formation of stretcher strains also help to reduce the metal to metal contact promoting hydrodynamic friction and a constant friction coefficient at lower strains...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSingle point {{incremental}} forming (SPIF) is {{a highly}} versatile and flexible process for rapid manufacturing of complex sheet metal parts. In the SPIF process, a ball nose tool moves along a predefined tool path to form the sheet to desired shapes. Due to its unique ability in local deformation of sheet metal, the friction condition between the tool and sheet {{plays a significant role}} in material deformation. The effects of <b>friction</b> on surface <b>finish,</b> forming load, material deformation and formability are studied using a newly developed oblique roller ball (ORB) tool. Four grades of aluminum sheet including AA 1100, AA 2024, AA 5052 and AA 6111 are employed in the experiments. The material deformation under both the ORB tool and conventional rigid tool are studied by drilling a small hole in the sheet. The experimental results suggest that by reducing the friction resistance using the ORB tool, better surface quality, reduced forming load, smaller through-the-thickness-shear and higher formability can be achieved. To obtain {{a better understanding of the}} frictional effect, an analytical model is developed based on the analysis of the stress state in the SPIF deformation zone. Using the developed model, an explicit relationship between the stress state and forming parameters is established. The experimental observations are in good agreement with the developed model. The model can also be used to explain two contrary effects of friction and corresponding through-the-thickness-shear: increase of friction would potentially enhance the forming stability and suppress the necking; however, increase of friction would also increase the stress triaxiality and decrease the formability. The final role of the friction effect depends on the significance of each effect in SPIF process...|$|R
40|$|Moving machine {{assemblies}} {{are generally}} designed {{to operate in}} full film lubrication regime to ensure high efficiency and durability of components. However, {{it is not always}} possible to ensure this owing to changes in operating conditions such as load, speed, temperature etc. The overall frictional losses in machines are thus dependent on the operating lubrication regimes (boundary, mixed or full-film). The present work is thus aimed at investigating the role of different surface modification technologies on friction of a conformal tribopair both in boundary and full film lubrication regimes. The conformal pair chosen is a hydrodynamic bearing with some hydrostatic lift. A special test rig comprising of two bearings was built for the experimental studies. Tribological tests were conducted in a wide speed range so as to enable studies in all lubrication regimes i. e., in boundary, mixed and full-film lubrication. The influence of application of different surface modification technologies on friction has been studied. In all, rollers with five coatings (four hard DLC coatings and one self-lubricating coating) and two rollers without coating having different surface <b>finish.</b> <b>Friction</b> measurements were made on the new as well as the previously run-in components. The different coatings exhibit different levels of boundary friction, with the self-lubricating coating having lowest boundary friction, closely followed by those with hard DLC coatings. The softer amongst the hard DLC coatings showed similar boundary friction compared to that with uncoated rollers. The lift-off speed, i. e., the transition between full-film to mixed and boundary lubrication mainly governed by the surface topography characteristics. A smooth surface finish can be achieved either by polishing before the test or by effective running in of the new surface. The effectiveness of running-in of surfaces was influenced by the surface roughness and hardness of the interacting surfaces. Godkänd; 2010; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20100628 (ysko...|$|R
