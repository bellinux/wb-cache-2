Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more <b>food</b> <b>choices</b> and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E

In order to effectively promote healthy ea ting, {{it is necessary to}} detect those determinants of eating behaviour t hat are most influential in target groups and in situations in which int erventions are to be implemented. Despite a scarcity of evidence on the relative importance of various det erminants of eating behaviour, it was concluded in Part I of the dissert ation (1) that <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> is determined by the interaction between thre e broad factors  the food, the person, and the environment or the situa tion, (2) that food likes are an important if not dominant determinant, and (3) that processes of mere exposure, Pavlovian conditioning and soci al learning shape the associations between interrelate liking, other det erminants, and eating behaviour. The general aim of this dissertation wa s to further map the relative importance of <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> determinants. In Part II, {{a number of studies have}} focused on personal and situational determinants of <b>food</b> <b>choice.</b> It has been assumed that these factors exe rt their influence on an individuals <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> though his weighing of values or motives. <b>Food</b> <b>choice</b> motives were measured with the Food Choi ce Questionnaire (FCQ). In Chapter 3, two models were tested involving t he food-related personality traits of food involvement and food neophobi a, <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> motives, and (healthy) food intake: (1) a mediational mod el, stating that <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> motives represent the generative mechanism through which these traits exert an influence on food intake, and (2) a moderator model, stating that the relation between <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> motives a nd dietary behaviour varies with the level of food involvement or neopho bia. Support was found for both models, although the mediational model w as only supported when food intake was operationalized as specific food group consumption. Chapter 4 compared obese and non-obese women as regar ds their motives for daily <b>food</b> <b>choice.</b> The expectation that liking woul d outperform other motives in obese participants to greater extent than in non-obese controls, could not be confirmed. Rather, the results corro borated the association between education and <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> motives report ed by previous research. In Chapter 5, situational variability in food c hoice motives was explored, and compared to individual variability. To t his end, the general context component in the instructions of the FCQ wa s substituted with several situational scripts. The findings suggested t hat <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> motives can be situation-specific, but that individual v ariability in <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> motives by far exceeds situational variability. Part III addressed methodological questions. In Chapter 6, two methods w ere compared as regards their ability to assess situational variability in <b>food</b> <b>choice</b> motives. It was argued that varying the measurement setti ng may be more appropriate than varying the context components of the qu estionnaire. In Chapter 7, it was tested whether the FCQ is factorial in variant over Western urban populations. This condition for cross-cultura l comparison was not met, which may have important implications for prev ious and future research with the FCQ. Part IV presented two types of strategies for health promotion, focusing either on personal or on situational determinants of <b>food</b> <b>choice.</b> It wa s suggested that interventions may be more effective when they pay speci al attention to food likes and learning mechanisms, and combine elements of both strategies, carefully taking into account the characteristics o f the target group and the choice situation. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Whether an {{individual}} develops certain diseases or disorders is also established, {{to a certain}} degree, {{on the basis of}} nature and nurture. Genes often predispose individuals to certain disorders or diseases, while environmental factors can trigger the onset. Susceptibility of diabetes is determined by inherited differences in DNA, but environmental factors such as diet, weight, age, and physical activity seem to be triggering the onset of the disease. Genetic make-up, in addition to the environment with which the genes are exposed to, is influencing the behaviour of consumers with regard to the <b>food</b> <b>choices</b> they make. Addiction to substance abuse is partially determined by genes, which predispose individuals to have addictive personalities; however the stimuli with which an addiction develops is dependent on the environment. Addiction is persistent and compulsive, and has a significant impact upon consumer behaviour.

Conversely, in the multiple option choice task, the additive impact of explicit and implicit attitudes was qualified by an interaction indicating that, even if explicit and implicit attitudes towards confectionery were inconsistent, more confectionery was chosen than fruit if either was positive. This compensatory ‘one is sufficient’-effect indicates that the structure of the choice environment modulates the relationship between attitudes and choice.

25|$|The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) {{has been}} shown to be quite {{effective}} for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens. Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent's <b>food</b> <b>choices</b> and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} truckers have unhealthful eating {{patterns}} {{as a result}} of poor <b>food</b> <b>choices</b> and food availability at truck stops is partially to blame. The options at truck stops are generally high calorie and high fat foods available through restaurants, fast-food, diners and vending machines. Fresh produce and whole grain items are few and far between. Though 85% of mini-mart items are categorized as extremely unhealthy, 80% of these meals are considered a truck driver’s main meal of the day. Also, most of the foods carried by drivers in their trucks, whether or not stored in a refrigerator, are purchased from truck stops. Research suggests that drivers value quality and taste much more than nutrition when selecting food. Another issue is the pattern of extensive and irregular snacking while on the road and consumption of one large meal at the end of day. The daily meal is often high in calories and may be the highlight of the trucker’s day. Food intake varies during working hours compared to days off and truckers eat meals at the wrong circadian phase during the day.|$|E
