5|$|Following the Draft, the 1994–95 NHL {{season was}} {{suspended}} for three-and-a-half months due to a labour dispute between NHL players and owners. Consequently, Jovanovski remained in junior <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 1994–95 OHL season. When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995, it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call {{him up to the}} NHL. However, then-Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor, citing that he would likely not receive much playing time with the club. He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season, scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests. He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated. Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All-Star Team.|$|E

5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{as one of}} {{the first}} European {{settlers}} in the Americas, he initially participated in, but eventually felt compelled to oppose the atrocities committed against the Native Americans by the Spanish colonists. In 1515, he reformed his views, gave up his Indian slaves and encomienda, and advocated, before King Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, on behalf of rights for the natives. In his early writings, he advocated the use of African slaves instead of Natives in the West-Indian colonies; consequently, criticisms have been leveled at him as being partly responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Transatlantic slave trade. Later in life, he retracted those early views as he came to see all forms of slavery as equally wrong. In 1522, he attempted to launch a new kind of peaceful colonialism on the coast of Venezuela, but this venture failed, causing Las Casas to enter the Dominican Order and become a friar, leaving the public scene for a decade. He then traveled to Central America undertaking peaceful evangelization among the Maya of Guatemala and participated in debates among the Mexican churchmen about how best to bring the natives to the Christian faith.|$|E
5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E
