500|$|... "Teeth" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, Taja Riley, Pete Wyoming Bender, and Teddy Riley, and was {{produced}} by Gaga and Teddy Riley. It {{has been described as}} a [...] "perverse march" [...] and a [...] "gospel ode" [...] to sadomasochism. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said the song is [...] "part musical, part country, and a little bit tribal in spots". Popjustice described [...] "Teeth" [...] as a [...] "wobbly, stompy, bouncy marching song" [...] that opens with the lyric [...] "don't want no money, just want your sex" [...] and later chants, [...] "show me your teeth!" [...] Lyrically, Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her. According to MusicOMH, [...] "In the background another voice intones strange messages, which may or may not revolve around dentistry". Music Times said the [...] "skank-y" [...] horns in the track exhibit Riley's work. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics: [...] "It is meant to mean two things, the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. 'Show me your teeth' means 'tell me the truth' and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a long time in my life that I replaced sex with the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Connor {{also said}} Letitia Dean was [...] "absolutely thrilled, because she [...] and Jenna {{were in the}} same year at drama school {{together}} as children. So we're articulating a 30 year old relationship between these two women, and that's something that they already have." [...] and [...] "there's a genuine affectionate recognition in that from Adam [...] for Jenna, because they've known each other for such a long time. Again, it shows - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Jenna, being part of EastEnders has been the destiny of her career." [...] Tully [...] "gave the idea" [...] of recasting Michelle [...] "her blessing, and it was really delightful when she did." [...] Tully was also involved in telling O'Connor, Russell and the writing team about Smith and Holland's original ideas for Michelle.|$|E

50|$|Problem solution: My girlfriend {{wants to}} make up with me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> better <b>for</b> both of us (thinking about the other's {{intended}} actions).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} very unfortunate, Lady Angela," [...] I said. [...] "Your father is displeased with me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> but <b>for</b> Colonel Ray I should have been {{dismissed}} yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{an instant}} {{she had been}} frightened at her own words. She was now quite angry and short of breath. She had {{contrived}} a rapid indignation against Mary and myself.|$|E
60|$|Our {{meeting was}} not wholly free from embarrassment. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} in our lives there was a cloud between Allan and myself. He stood up and faced me squarely.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could find}} all the {{qualifications}} that I require, I should not be particular about that; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> choice I would take a lad of from sixteen to twenty." ...|$|E

60|$|FERRAND. [With a shrug.] Again I {{have beaten}} all London, Monsieur --not one bite. [Contemplating himself.] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> perhaps, <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> the bourgeoisie, {{there is a}} little too much colour in my costume.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> quite {{a number}} of the cadets are far from rich and yet they are {{considered}} good fellows. It's Ritter's ways. He is too domineering. The fellows won't stand for his bullying manner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are all selfish," [...] Josephine murmured. [...] "Life {{closes in}} around {{us, and we}} are mostly {{concerned}} with what may happen in our own time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{as long as we}} live, peace is assured." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{the first}} few moments there was some slight awkwardness, for we were men, and we spoke seldom of the things which touched us most. Arthur, however, broke almost {{immediately}} into speech, and relieved the tension.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can match}} this envelope, I think," [...] Mr. Fentolin said softly. [...] "The seal we can copy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> {{the sake of}} others, we must {{discover}} the cause for this hurried journey {{on the part of}} Mr. John P. Dunster." ...|$|E
30|$|Amy: There’s {{three of}} us on the team. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> helpful <b>for</b> {{students}} <b>that</b> maybe don’t necessarily bond with the one teacher…. If there’s something going on, sometimes they feel safer with one teacher over the other to talk to them it seems.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{only what}} Jack says. It's Jack that calls it beastly. Of course he's {{not much of}} a man as yet, but he is your own son. And <b>I</b> do <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> an earnest spirit about a thing, Jack is a very fine fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hear," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "that they have searched many houses for fugitives, {{and it is}} {{probable}} the hunt may become even more strict; therefore <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Ned, <b>that</b> <b>for</b> our sake {{as well as your}} own you had better try to escape." ...|$|R
60|$|McGann, I understand, is dead. I am {{not sorry}} for it. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{most of us}} the time has gone by when {{we can see the}} fun of putting tacks on chairs, or thistles in beds, or live snakes in people's boots.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Adam, {{there is}} much common sense in your suggestion, though it startled me at first. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> all reasons, you {{would do well to}} buy the {{property}} and to have the conveyance settled at once. If you want more money than is immediately convenient, let me know, so that I may be your banker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother {{says you}} are going to take charge of my {{education}}, Stephen," [...] said Betty, as soon as she could speak. [...] "I'm glad, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> an old person, you have a good deal of sense. I suppose my education has to be seen to, some time or other, and I'd rather you'd do it than anybody else I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is the {{tendency}} of the age," [...] she answered, [...] "to seek escape from many things it would be wiser to face. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> myself <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> good or evil, the sooner it is over--the sooner both {{the man and the}} woman know--the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>for</b> {{the present}} {{done with that}} sort of thing; I have served my apprenticeship, and am now setting up on my own account." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe you are right. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is wisest <b>for</b> all. And now on {{the three}} of you--aye, and on your children's children's children--let my blessing rest, as rest it shall. Come hither, Emir." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Milray went on, [...] "That was why I was so {{provoked}} with you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a {{young girl}} {{to stand up and}} dance alone before a whole steamer full of strangers"--Clementina looked at her without speaking, and Mrs. Milray hastened to say, [...] "To be sure I advised you to do it, but I certainly was surprised that you should give an encore. But no matter, now. This letter--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{found that}} it was a man living in the village, who had been doing some work on the School grounds. He had evidently noticed the value of the cups, and {{determined}} to try his hand at appropriating them. He is well known as a poacher in the village, it seems. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the future he will confine himself to that--ah--industry, for he is hardly likely ever to--ah--shine as a professional house-breaker. No.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] he said. [...] "True. I {{think you}} are right there. My nervous system is so delicately attuned that {{anything}} {{in the shape of}} a brawl would reduce it to a frazzle. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> this occasion only, we will promote Comrade Maloney to the post of editor. He is a stern, hard, rugged man who does not care how unpopular he is. Yes, I think that would be best." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{interviewed by}} Suburban Horror, McMahon {{stated that the}} song was his {{favourite}} from the Everything In Transit album. It was as the last song I wrote on the record. I always find that my favorite song is the last one that I worked on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> song <b>for</b> me sums up the record {{in a lot of}} ways. I wrote it to do that...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the sake}} of those whom one loves," [...] she said, [...] "one will do much that one hates. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> but <b>for</b> this man my father might still have been alive, might have lived {{to know how much}} I loathed those who sent him into exile--well, I feel then that {{there is nothing in the}} world I would not do to crush him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> must, {{because it}} is true. If I do not tell her the truth, who is there that will do so? It may be bitter now, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is <b>for</b> her welfare." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{very long}} {{we had all}} trooped into the drawing-room, the door of which Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for every one. The Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time we}} {{realized}} that the thing was not a bad dream, but a tangible reality. We had read of such things--now we ourselves were actors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England, would blazon out the news in staring headlines: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not, {{though of}} course I will do {{whatever}} you believe to be best; {{but there are a}} score of plantations between us and the town, and I have no doubt that the slaves will have risen everywhere. Besides, if your own negroes fail to follow our track, they will make sure that we have gone in that direction, and will be on the look-out for us; therefore <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the present we had better remain in the forest." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{produced}} the tinder-box which I carried with me, and struck the flint. Ten minutes later {{we had a}} cheerful blaze, and within three-quarters of an hour good soup, for iron pots were not wanting--only food to put into them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of that}} day those poor creatures did little else but eat, sleeping between their meals. Oh! the joy I had in feeding them, especially after the wagons arrived, bringing with them salt--how they longed for that salt!--sugar and coffee.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too, Kreta. If {{they hear the}} horse's hoofs coming from behind they will suppose it is a mounted {{messenger}} from the hills. Anyhow, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a dash <b>for</b> it is our best chance." ...|$|R
60|$|Whether Euphemia's {{acceptance}} {{was in the}} American {{manner is}} more than I can say; <b>I</b> incline to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> fluttering grateful trustful softly-amazed young hearts {{there is only one}} manner all over the world.|$|R
60|$|Here the Zulu's {{voice broke}} and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he wept, <b>for</b> in the faint light I saw him draw his long {{hand across his}} eyes, whereon I took the {{opportunity}} to turn my back and light a pipe.|$|R
