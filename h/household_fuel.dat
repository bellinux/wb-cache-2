5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses crammed into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as <b>household</b> <b>fuel,</b> and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E

As {{compared to}} the [...] "direct blowing" [...] technology, no toxic by-products are present in the gas: those are disabled in the reaction zone.

The reason for reviving the interest to this type of gasification process is that it is ecologically clean and able to produce two types of useful products (simultaneously or separately): gas (either combustible or syngas) and middle-temperature coke. The former may be used as a fuel for gas boilers and diesel-generators or as syngas for producing gasoline, etc., the latter - as a technological fuel in metallurgy, as a chemical absorbent or as raw material for <b>household</b> <b>fuel</b> briquettes.

As the Soviet Union and its KATEKNIIUgol' ceased to exist, the technology was adopted by the individual scientists who originally developed it and is now being further researched in Russia and commercially distributed worldwide.

Combustion of solid fuels in inefficient stoves under poor ventilation conditions can result in large exposure burdens, par-ticularly for women and young children, who spend the major part of their time at home. The importance of this public health and environmental issue is reflected in the inclusion of the per-centage of <b>households</b> using solid <b>fuels</b> as an indicator towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for environmental sustainability.

40|$|Nearly {{half of the}} world's {{population}} {{does not}} have access to cleaner cooking fuels, and this is attributed to several things including the lack of resources (fuel), infrastructure (production and distribution), purchasing power (poverty), relevant policies, and a combination of these reasons. A <b>household's</b> <b>fuel</b> choice aims to minimize cost and maximize benefit, both of which are intricate functions of many factors. The factors influencing a <b>household's</b> <b>fuel</b> preference, and how manipulating these factors such as subsidies, improved distribution networks and user awareness will affect fuel preference is reported. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) model was developed to study the fuel preferences of rural Indian <b>households.</b> Seven cooking <b>fuels</b> (biomass (wood and crop residue), dung, charcoal, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, kerosene and electricity) were ranked in order of household preference. Various scenarios were considered to demonstrate the sensitivity of fuel preference to multiple factors such as subsidies and improvement in cooking technology. Results obtained from the model demonstrated strong agreement with the current fuel usage pattern in rural India. The model was then applied to compare traditional cookstoves (TCS) to non-subsidized improved cookstoves (ICS). The benefit-to-cost ratio of solid fuels when used in ICS was lower than that when used in TCS. A similar trend was observed for fully-subsidized ICS; indicating that price is not the only obstacle to the adoption of an ICS. Sensitivity analysis was performed to demonstrate the utility of this CBA model in framing policies to promote fuel transition in rural India. Although providing subsidies on LPG and electricity can make these cleaner fuels an attractive option, biomass will remain a <b>household's</b> preferred <b>fuel</b> unless distribution networks and infrastructure is developed to ensure their uninterrupted supply and accessibility.

40|$|Background: India {{contributes}} 24 % of {{the global}} annual child deaths due to acute respiratory infections (ARIs). According to WHO, nearly 50 % of the deaths among children due to ARIs is because of indoor air pollution (IAP). There is insufficient evidence {{on the relationship between}} IAP from the use of solid fuels and incidence of life threatening respiratory illnesses (LTRI) in children in India. Methods: Panel data of children born during 2001 - 02, from the Young Lives Study (YLS) conducted in India during 2002 and 2006 - 07 was used to estimate the impact of household use of solid fuels for cooking on LTRI in children. Multivariable two-stage random effects logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of suffering from LTRI among children from <b>households</b> using solid <b>fuels</b> relative to children from <b>households</b> using other <b>fuels</b> (Gas/Electricity/Kerosene). Results: Bivariate results indicate that the probability of an episode of LTRI was considerably higher among children from <b>households</b> using solid <b>fuels</b> for cooking (18 %) than among children from <b>households</b> using other <b>fuels</b> (10 %). Moreover, children from <b>households</b> using solid <b>fuels</b> in both the rounds of YLS were more likely to suffer from one or more than one episode of LTRI compared to children from <b>households</b> using solid <b>fuels</b> in only one round.
