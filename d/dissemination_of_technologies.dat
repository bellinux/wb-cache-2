Both parametric and non-parametric econometric techniques are used to ensure robustness of the results from the econometric analyses. Since the assumption of pooled regression is rejected, we run separate food security regressions at plot level both for Male Headed Households (MHHs) and Female Headed Households (FHHs). Both descriptive and econometrics results shows that FHHs in general are more likely to be food insecure compared to their male counterparts. The analysis further reveals that Female Headed Households‘ food security increases with quality of extension workers; land quality, farm size while distance to the market reduces the probability of food security. For the quality of extension staff, policy makers should focus on improving the skill of extension staff for efficient and effective <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> and other important information that has impact on food security. Since area expansion is infeasible due to land scarcity in Kenya, policy makers focusing on land augmenting practices can help farm households to escape food insecurity.

40|$|Technology {{transfer}} {{and sustainable development}} The development, {{transfer and}} <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> is vital in enabling countries to speed up progress towards sustainable development {{as reflected in the}} outcome document of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+ 20). This is also true for the agricultural sector which remains a key source of national income in many developing countries, contributing on average 29 per cent of GDP and 65 per cent of all employment in Asia and the Pacific, yet accounting for the highest share of poor people. It is apparent from these statistics that the sector must raise land and labour productivity while operating under the constraint of increasing degradation of natural resources, including land, soil, water and nutrients, and having to adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts. The Rio+ 20 outcome document stresses the importance of cooperative action in technology innovation, research and development, and of exploring modalities for enhanced access to technologies by developing countries.
