5000|$|These retrometabolic design {{strategies}} were introduced by Nicholas Bodor, {{one of the}} first and most prominent advocates for the early integration of metabolism, pharmacokinetic and general physicochemical considerations in the drug design process. [...] These drug design concepts recognize the importance of design-controlled metabolism and directly focus not on the increase of activity alone but on the increase of the activity/toxicity ratio (therapeutic index) in order to deliver the maximum benefit while also reducing or eliminating unwanted side effects. The importance of this field is reviewed in a book dedicated to the subject (Bodor, N.; Buchwald, P.; Retrometabolic Drug Design and Targeting, 1st ed., Wiley & Sons, 2012), as well as by a full chapter of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Design, 7th ed. (2010) with close to 150 chemical structures and more than 450 references. [...] At the time of its introduction, the idea of designed-in metabolism represented a significant novelty and was against mainstream thinking then in place that instead focused on minimizing or entirely eliminating drug metabolism. Bodor's work on these design concepts developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and came to prominence during the mid-1990s. Loteprednol <b>etabonate,</b> a soft corticosteroid designed and patented by Bodor received final Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1998 as the active ingredient of two ophthalmic preparations (Lotemax and Alrex), currently the only corticosteroid approved by the FDA for use in all inflammatory and allergy-related ophthalmic disorders. Its safety for long-term use [...] further supports the soft drug concept, and in 2004, loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> [...] was also approved as part of a combination product (Zylet). A second generation of soft corticosteroids such as etiprednol dicloacetate is in development for a full spectrum of other possible applications such as nasal spray for rhinitis or inhalation products for asthma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Topical {{corticosteroids}} {{are routinely}} used as postoperative ocular anti-inflammatory drugs; how-ever, adverse effects such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP) are observed with their use. While older corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and predniso-lone acetate offer good anti-inflammatory efficacy, clinically {{significant increases in}} IOP (C 10 mmHg) are often associated with their use. Loteprednol eta-bonate, a novel C- 20 ester-based corticosteroid, was retrometabolically designed to offer potent anti-inflammatory efficacy but with decreased impact on IOP. After exerting its therapeutic effects {{on the site of}} action, loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> is rapidly converted to inactive metabolites, resulting in fewer adverse effects. Randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> ophthalmic suspension 0. 5 % for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in post-cataract patients with few patients, if any, exhibiting clinically signif-icant increases (C 10 mmHg) in IOP. Furthermore, safety studies demonstrated a minimal effect of loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> on IOP with long-term use or in steroid responders with a much lower propensity to increase IOP relative to prednisolone acetate or dexamethasone. The anti-inflammatory treatment effect of loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> appears to be similar to that of rimexolone and difluprednate with less impact on IOP compared to difluprednate, although confirmatory comparative studies are needed.

Topical ocular corticosteroids {{are commonly used}} {{in the treatment of}} anterior segment diseases and inflammation associated with ocular surgery, and manufacturers continually strive to improve their characteristics. We describe the development of a novel ophthalmic gel formulation of loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> (LE), a C- 20 ester-based corticosteroid with an established safety profile, in the treatment of ocular inflammatory conditions. The new LE gel formulation is non-settling, eliminating the need to shake the product to resuspend the drug, has a pH close to that of tears, and a low preservative concentration. The rheological characteristics of LE gel are such that the formulation is instilled as a drop and transitions to a fluid upon instillation in the eye, yet retains sufficient viscosity to prolong ocular surface retention. The new formulation provides consistent, uniform dosing as evidenced by dose extrusion studies, while pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits demonstrated rapid and sustained exposure to LE in ocular tissues following instillation of LE gel. Finally, results from two clinical studies of LE gel in the treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery indicate that it was safe and effective. Most patients reported no unpleasant drop sensation upon instillation, and reports of blurred vision were rare.

Pterygia show characteristic histological features {{that suggest that}} inflammation plays {{a prominent role in}} their initial pathogenesis and recurrence. Appropriate surgery is the key to successful treatment of pterygia, {{but there is also a}} rationale for the use of anti-inflammatory agents to reduce the rate of recurrence following surgery. Multiple surgical techniques have been developed over the last two millennia, but these initially had little success, due to high rates of recurrence. Current management strategies, associated with lower recurrence rates, include bare sclera excision and various types of grafts using tissue glues. Adjunctive therapies include mitomycin C and 5 -fluorouracil, as well as the topical ocular steroid loteprednol <b>etabonate,</b> which has been shown to have a lower risk of elevated intraocular pressure than have the other topical ocular steroids. Here, the surgical management of pterygium is presented from a historical perspective, and current management techniques, including the appropriate use of various adjunctive therapies, are reviewed, along with an illustrative case presentation and a discussion of the conjunctival forceps designed to facilitate surgical management. Despite thousands of years of experience with this condition, there remains a need for a more thorough understanding of pterygium and interventions to reduce both its incidence and postsurgical recurrence. Until that time, the immediate goal is to optimize surgical practices to ensure the best possible outcomes. Loteprednol <b>etabonate,</b> especially the ointment formulation, appears to be a safe and effective component of the perioperative regimen for this complex ocular condition, although confirmatory prospective studies are needed.

40|$|Pterygium is an {{ocular disease}} characterised by {{the growth of}} fibrovascular {{conjunctiva}} on the cornea. It occurs more often in men, at an older age, and in individuals exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Surgical treatment is the primary treatment for pterygium {{and there are two}} common procedures for pterygium excision. In the first method, the head of the pterygium is separated from the corneal surface using a surgical blade. The second method is based on avulsion. Other approaches to excising the pterygium include the use of argon laser and excimer laser. Because of a high recurrence rate, adjuvant therapies, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and graft procedures, are used after pterygium excision.

Setting: John A Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. Design: Prospective, randomized, partially masked trial. Methods: PRK was performed on 261 eyes of 132 participants. Patients were randomized to a postoperative corticosteroid regimen of either loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> 0. 5 % gel (loteprednol) or prednisolone 1 % acetate suspension followed by fluorometholone 0. 1 % suspension (prednisolone/fml). Primary outcome measures included incidence and grade of postoperative corneal haze and incidence of increased intraocular pressure of 10 mmHg above baseline, or any intraocular pressure over 21 mmHg. Secondary outcome measures included uncorrected distance visual acuity, best corrected distance visual acuity, and manifest refraction spherical equivalent. Results: The incidence of haze in the first 3 months was 2. 6 % (3 / 114 eyes) in the loteprednol group and 4. 8 % (7 / 147 eyes) in the prednisolone/fml group and {{was not statistically significant}} between groups (P= 0. 37).

Primary outcomes included postoperative IOP elevations, adverse events, and early discontinuations. Results: Data were collected on 189 LASIK eyes (96 patients) and 209 PRK eyes (108 patients). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) years of age at surgery was 36. 0 (11. 7) and 33. 9 (11. 3) in LASIK and PRK patients. LE gel was prescribed most often four times daily during the first postoperative week, regardless of procedure; the most common treatment duration was 7 – 14 days in LASIK and ≥ 30 days in PRK patients. No unusual corneal findings or healing abnormalities were reported. Mean postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20 / 24 in LASIK and 20 / 30 in PRK eyes. Mild/trace corneal haze was reported in 20 % of PRK patients; two PRK patients with moderate/severe corneal haze were switched to another corticosteroid. Mean postoperative IOP did not increase over time in either LASIK or PRK eyes (P≥ 0. 331); clinically significant elevations from baseline in IOP (≥ 10 mmHg) were noted in only three eyes of two PRK patients. Conclusion: LE gel appears to have a high level of safety and tolerability when used for the management of postoperative pain and inflammation following LASIK and PRK surgery.

Methods: Two randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies were conducted. Patients aged &ge; 18 years with a combined postoperative anterior chamber cells and flare (ACI) &ge; Grade 3 following uncomplicated cataract surgery participated in seven study visits. Patients self-administered either topical LE ointment or vehicle four times daily for 14 days. Efficacy outcomes included the proportion of patients with complete resolution of ACI and the proportion of patients with no (Grade 0) pain at postoperative day 8. Safety outcomes included the incidence of adverse events, ocular symptoms, changes in intraocular pressure and visual acuity, and biomicroscopy and funduscopy findings. Results: Data from the two studies were combined. The integrated intent-to-treat population consisted of 805 patients (mean [standard deviation] age 69. 0 [9. 2] years; 58. 0 % female and 89. 7 % white). Significantly more LE ointment-treated patients than vehicle-treated patients had complete resolution of ACI (27. 7 % versus 12. 5 %) and no pain (75. 5 % versus 43. 1 %) at day 8 (P &lt; 0. 0001 for both). Fewer LE ointment-treated patients required rescue medication (27. 7 % versus 63. 8 %), and fewer had an ocular adverse event (47. 2 % versus 78. 0 %, P &lt; 0. 0001) while on study treatment. The most common ocular adverse events with LE ointment were anterior chamber inflammation, photophobia, corneal edema, conjunctival hyperemia, eye pain, and iritis. Mean intraocular pressure decreased in both treatment groups. Four patients had increased intraocular pressure &ge; 10 mmHg (three LE ointment and one vehicle) prior to rescue medication. Visual acuity and dilated funduscopy results were similar between the treatment groups, with the exception of visual acuity at visits 5 and 6, which favored LE ointment. Conclusion: LE ointment was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery.

40|$|Despite its {{apparent}} easy accessibility, the eye is, in fact, well protected against {{the absorption of}} foreign materials, including therapeutic agents, by the eyelids, by the tearflow, and by the permeability barriers imposed by the cornea {{on one side and}} the blood-retinal barrier on the other. Most existing ophthalmic drugs were adapted from other therapeutic applications and were not specifically developed for the treatment of eye diseases; hence, they are not well suited to provide eye-specific effects without causing systemic side effects. A real breakthrough in the area of ophthalmic therapeutics can be achieved only by specifically designing new drugs for ophthalmic applications to incorporate the possibility of eye targeting into their chemical structure. Possibilities provided along these lines by designing chemical delivery systems (CDSs) and soft drugs within the framework of retrometabolic drug design are reviewed here. Both are general concept applicable in almost any therapeutic area. This review will concentrate on adrenergic agonists and anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, where clinical results obtained with new chemical entities, such as betaxoxime, adaprolol, loteprednol <b>etabonate,</b> and etiprednol dicloacetate, exist to support the advantages of such metabolism-focused, ophthalmic-specific drug design approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of topical corticosteroids as ocular anti-inflammatory agents following cataract surgery is well-documented. They {{also help to}} prevent a number of complications associated with post-operative ocular inflammation, including corneal edema and cystoid macular edema. However, topical corticosteroids are associated with side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Indeed, corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension {{and the potential for}} steroid-induced glaucoma remain the leading drawbacks of topical corticosteroid therapy. Some individuals are known to experience a high degree of IOP elevation with low doses or short durations of treatment with topical corticosteroids. Careful monitoring of IOP in such individuals is essential. Few randomized, controlled studies are available on the comparative safety and {{efficacy of}} common topical corticosteroids in the treatment of post-operative ocular inflammation. Furthermore, the lack of consistent reporting criteria for clinically significant IOP increases across clinical studies makes meaningful comparisons among corticosteroids difficult. This review aims to examine data from available published studies, including studies in steroid responders, to determine whether topical corticosteroids are the same in terms of their effect on IOP. Early generation corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and prednisolone, are more likely to result in clinically significant increases in IOP. Newer corticosteroids, such as rimexolone and the retro-metabolically designed corticosteroid, loteprednol <b>etabonate,</b> offer similar anti-inflammatory efficacy to olde...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> (LE) {{is a novel}} soft steroid {{that was}} {{designed}} to improve the benefit/risk ratio of topical corticosteroid therapy. This study assesses the clinical efficacy and safety of three different doses of LE nasal spray in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial 165 subjects with SAR to grass pollen received daily single doses of either 100, 200, 400 microg LE nasal spray, or placebo for 14 days. The patients underwent three 4 -h allergen challenges with grass pollen in an environmental exposure unit at a screening visit (baseline) and on days 7 and 14 of treatment. Standardized nasal symptom scores were obtained every 20 min. Nasal flow, nasal secretions, and FEV(1) were measured every hour during allergen challenges. RESULTS: After 14 days of treatment, patients who received 400 microg LE had significantly lower total nasal symptom scores compared with those receiving placebo (P = 0. 007). LE 400 reduced rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, the amount of nasal secretions, and improved nasal flow as compared with placebo (P < 0. 05). LE 100 and LE 200 were not significantly different from placebo. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Loteprednol 400 microg once daily is superior to placebo and the only effective dose tested in improving nasal symptoms and objective parameters in patients with SAR...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} for developing new antiallergic/antiasthmatic agents. One {{of them is}} the improvement of an existing class of effective drug classes. Due to some undesired effects of intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids, {{there is a need for}} better tolerated corticosteroids. Loteprednol <b>etabonate</b> belongs to the so-called class of soft steroids because it is metabolized by a onestep reaction (hydrolysis) without using the cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase system. In in vitro investigations using human cells, loteprednol inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e. g., TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, IL- 4, IL- 5) according to its relative binding potency to the glucocorticoid receptor. In in vivo animal studies, loteprednol effectively inhibited allergically induced vascular leakage in the nasal cavity of actively sensitized Brown Norway rats and rhinorrhea in actively sensitized domestic pigs following nasal challenge. In several models of allergic asthma, it was clearly demonstrated that loteprednol was able to suppress the allergically induced late phase eosinophilia in mice, rats and guinea pigs. After intrapulmonary administration of loteprednol, only a slight, statistically nonsignificant reduction in thymus weight was observed in a dose range far less than the therapeutically relevant doses. Its therapeutic ratio is clearly superior to those of beclomethasone and budesonide. Loteprednol is a safe steroid with an extremely wide range between therapeutic and side effect inducing doses. Its elimination profile, its pronounced binding to plasma protein and erythrocytes and the low oral bioavailability makes this drug highly suitable for nasal or pulmonary use. (C) 2000 Prous Science.
