5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war years, the {{government}} {{concluded that the}} fort was no longer militarily useful and there were unsuccessful attempts to sell <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> development. During the Second World War, the fort initially housed an improvised anti-aircraft operations room, controlling the defences of the Thames and Medway (North) Gun Zone between 1939 and 1940. Trenches were dug across the surrounding area to prevent an airborne attack. The enlisted barracks and the facilities block, as well as probably the sutler's house, were bombed and damaged, being demolished after the war. The fort was transferred out of military use relatively early in the post-war period, and in 1950 the Ministry of Works took over the site. Restoration work {{took place in the}} 1970, including the construction of replica wooden bridges. It was opened to the public in 1982.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990–91 Gulf War, the {{shortage}} of military GPS units caused many troops and their families to buy readily available civilian units. Selective Availability significantly impeded the U.S. military's own battlefield use of these GPS, so the military {{made the decision to}} turn <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> the duration of the war.|$|E

He was given a cursed sword known as Gram as his chosen item upon entry, but loses it in a fight to Kazuma, who uses his Steal skill to swipe it. Kazuma later pawns <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> extra money. Kyōya parties with two girls, spear and dagger users, by his side.

25|$|Arrestin linking: The {{phosphorylated}} receptor can {{be linked}} to arrestin molecules that prevent it from binding (and activating) G proteins, in effect switching <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> a short period of time. This mechanism is used, for example, with rhodopsin in retina cells to compensate for exposure to bright light. In many cases, arrestin's binding to the receptor is a prerequisite for translocation. For example, beta-arrestin bound to β2-adrenoreceptors acts as an adaptor for binding with clathrin, and with the beta-subunit of AP2 (clathrin adaptor molecules); thus, the arrestin here acts as a scaffold assembling the components needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of β2-adrenoreceptors.|$|E
25|$|Kersal {{remained}} {{a rural area}} until about 1840 when the Clowes family, who owned {{most of the land}} in the area, began to sell <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> development, and merchants and manufacturers began to build their mansions in the green fields of Higher Broughton and Kersal. In keeping with their own ideas of social engineering they imposed strict covenants on how the land was used, reserving the higher ground for more well-to-do residents and the lower ground for workers' cottages. The number of public houses was severely restricted and then, only beer houses that didn't sell spirits were allowed. Singleton Road and Moor Lane were the only roads connecting Bury Old Road and Bolton Road and there was a toll bar on the corner of Bury Old Road. When Bury New Road was built in 1831 a gate or bar was erected and travellers had to pay a toll to the turnpike trust to pass through. A toll house was erected on Bury New Road with a bay window projecting out so that the toll collector had {{a clear view of the}} road. By 1848 the local authority had taken over the road, the tolls were abolished and the toll collector's house became a newsagent's. This was the only shop in an area where the landowner's restrictive covenants prevented commercial development. The exterior of the house remains largely unchanged to this day, although it was renovated in 2007 with a two-storey extension being added to the rear. The Toll House is now a Grade II listed building.|$|E

500|$|The {{essential}} {{idea here}} is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. [...] It was articulated by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1961 short story Harrison Bergeron. In Vonnegut’s futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper General uses {{a variety of}} handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. [...] A spectator at a ballet comments: [...] "it {{was easy to see}} that she was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men." [...] Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to [...] "waste" [...] more of some resource by trading <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen's idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.|$|E
500|$|General Clinton {{encountered}} {{the first major}} problem of the attack plan on June 17. An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established {{that part of the}} channel was at least shoulder-deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across, but the Americans, with timely advice from General Lee, adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position. As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range. Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have [...] "the glory of being defeated alone." [...] The attack was originally planned for June 24, but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> several days.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first game}} in April {{came on the}} 5th, an away trip to Wigan. Former Birmingham boss Steve Bruce managed his side to a 2–0 win over Birmingham, with Ryan Taylor scoring both the goals. Also in that match, club captain Damien Johnson was sent off for two-footed foul on Kevin Kilbane. A week later, Birmingham were at home against Everton. Zárate rescued a point for the Blues with a [...] free kick in the 83rd minute, after defender Joleon Lescott put Everton in front. The game ended in a 1–1 draw. At this time Birmingham were 17th in the table. The Birmingham Derby took place eight days later as Birmingham were beaten 5–1 by Aston Villa away at Villa Park. Ashley Young and John Carew each scored twice. Forssell got a {{consolation}} goal for Blues, then Agbonlahor finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> Aston Villa.|$|E
2500|$|By October 1857, Wagner {{had begun}} the {{composition}} sketch of the first act. During November, however, he set five of Mathilde's poems to music known today as the Wesendonck Lieder. This was an unusual move by Wagner, who almost never set to music poetic texts other than his own. Wagner described two of the songs – [...] "Im Treibhaus" [...] and [...] "Träume" [...] – as [...] "Studies for Tristan und Isolde": [...] "Träume" [...] uses a motif that forms the love duet in act 2 of Tristan, while [...] "Im Treibhaus" [...] introduces a theme that later became the prelude to act 3. But Wagner resolved to write Tristan only after he had secured a publishing deal with the Leipzig-based firm Breitkopf & Härtel, in January 1858. From this point on, Wagner finished each act and sent <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> engraving before he started on the next – a remarkable feat given the unprecedented length {{and complexity of the}} score.|$|E
2500|$|A {{third time}} Enki succumbs to temptation, and {{attempts}} seduction of Uttu. Upset about Enki's reputation, Uttu consults Ninhursag, who, {{upset at the}} promiscuous wayward nature of her spouse, advises Uttu to avoid the riverbanks, the places likely {{to be affected by}} flooding, the home of Enki. In another version of this myth Ninhursag takes Enki's semen from Uttu's womb and plants it in the earth where eight plants rapidly germinate. With his two-faced servant and steward Isimud, [...] "Enki, in the swampland, in the swampland lies stretched out, 'What is this (plant), what is this (plant). His messenger Isimud, answers him; 'My king, this is the tree-plant', he says to him. He cuts <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> him and he (Enki) eats it". And so, despite warnings, Enki consumes the other seven fruit. Consuming his own semen, he falls pregnant (ill with swellings) in his jaw, his teeth, his mouth, his hip, his throat, his limbs, his side and his rib. The gods are at a loss to know what to do, chagrinned they [...] "sit in the dust". As Enki lacks a womb with which to give birth, he seems to be dying with swellings. The fox then asks Enlil King of the Gods, [...] "If I bring Ninhursag before thee, what shall be my reward?" [...] Ninhursag's sacred fox then fetches the goddess.|$|E
