In particular, this paper focuses on four crisis-affected countries: Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines and Thailand. To this end, this paper estimates the weights of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen</b> in the determination of the values of the East Asian currencies using daily exchange rate data sets covering the pre-crisis period from January 1990 to June 1997 and the post-crisis period from January 1999 to December 2000. Empirical test results indicate that the impact of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen</b> on East Asian currencies has increased since the 1997 financial crisis. The null hypothesis that the weight of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen</b> remains the same is rejected for all the four countries examined supporting the alternative that it has increased since the financial crisis...|$|R

Our empirical results point to a significant unidirectional return spillover from euro and <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen</b> to USD and bidirectional return spillover between GBP and <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen.</b> We also find evidence of significant volatility spillover effect from USD to GBP, euro and <b>Japanese</b> <b>Yen</b> and from GBP and Euro to USD. Moreover, we find that the time-varying conditional correlations between exchange rate changes dynamically over time and are widely distributed with higher volatility during the period of global financial crisis for all USD and other exchange rate pairs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) framework to numerically {{examine the effect of}} tax/subsidy reforms of health related sectors. The generalized framework with the latest Japanese input-output table of year 2005 with 108 different production sectors provides the following results: A 50 percent tax cut of the pharmaceutical industry, or a 50 percent subsidy increase for the hospitals sector induces a welfare gain of 95. 6 billion or 72. 3 billion <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen,</b> respectively, when the government budget is not balanced. However, such an unbalanced budget policy also generates new deficits of 9. 26 billion and 5. 58 billion <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen,</b> respectively. Even if the government budget is balanced, welfare enhancing reforms are still possible but only with sacrifices of the pharmaceutical industry. If the pharmaceutical industry is also compensated with the balanced budget, then welfare enhancing reforms only within health related sectors seem implausible. While the best reform with a compensation policy results in a welfare gain of 61 billion <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen,</b> such a reform still generates deficits of 4. 4 billion <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen.</b> If the government tries to minimize deficits with a compensation policy, then deficits can be reduced to 0. 62 billion <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen,</b> but a welfare gain completely vanishes...|$|R
40|$|The US dollar {{has kept}} as a {{position}} of key currency {{in the global economy}} in the changing international monetary system where the euro was introduced to some states of the EU in 1999. It is an evidence of inertia of the US dollar as a key currency. Our previous study (Ogawa and Muto, 2017 b) conducted empirical analysis to investigate effects of several events on inertia of the US dollar. One of our findings was that the introduction of the euro increased utility of euro while utility of US dollar was kept unchanged. This paper examines the effects of the global financial crisis and the euro zone crisis as well as the introduction of the euro on the utility of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen.</b> The introduction of the euro significantly decreased the utility of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen.</b> It indicates that the introduction of the euro increased the utility of the euro while reducing the utility of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen</b> rather than the utility of the US dollar. The utility of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen</b> has significantly decreased while the global financial crisis and the euro zone crisis occurred. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>yen</b> has a declining trend in terms of its utility over time in the changing international monetary system...|$|R
