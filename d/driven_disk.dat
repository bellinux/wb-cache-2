50|$|The main {{or driving}} disk {{is faced with}} a disk of aluminum. The <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving.|$|E

The intrinsically time dependent nature of radiation <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> winds that have been predicted by the simulations can be supported by {{a growing number of}} the observed dramatic variability in the UV absorption lines.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{resonance}} line profiles predicted by radiation <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> wind models which extend radially one {{order of magnitude}} farther out than our previous models. Our main {{result is that the}} inclusion of a disk wind at larger radii changes qualitatively and quantitatively the line profiles predicted by the models. Our new models predict line absorption that is significantly stronger than those predicted by old models. Some of the previous line profiles exhibit a doubled-humped structure near the line center which is now replaced by a more plausible single, blueshifted minimum. We emphasize that the improvements in the shape as well as the strength of the absorption were achieved without changing the gross properties of the wind. In particular, our new models do not predict a higher mass-loss rate than the previous models. The main changes in the line profiles are {{due to the fact that}} the ratio between the rotational velocity and poloidal velocity of the wind decreases downstream. The new line profiles reproduce well the line absorption of the nova-like variable, IX~Vel, and promise to reproduce observations of other cataclysmic variables.

This is in {{disagreement with the}} standard Blandford & Payne profile rho_BP proportional to r^{- 1. 5 } expected when the magnetic field is neither advected nor diffusing through the accretion disk. In order to account for this discrepancy, we establish a new paradigm for magnetically driven astrophysical winds according to which the large scale ordered magnetic field that threads the disk is continuously generated by the Cosmic Battery around the inner edge of the disk and continuously diffuses outward. We obtain self-similar solutions of such magnetically advected winds (MAW) and discuss their observational ramifications.

40|$|Abstract — Surface-micromachined {{resonators}} and {{filters are}} attractive for many RF applications. While existing simulation tools allow designers to compute resonant frequencies, few tools provide {{estimates of the}} damping in these devices. This paper reports on a new tool that allows designers, for the first time, to compute anchor losses in high-frequency resonators and account for sub-surface scatterers. By exercising the tool on a family of radially <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> resonators, we show that the anchor loss mechanism for this class of devices involves a parasitic mixed-mode bending action that pumps energy into the substrate. Further, using the tool, we predict a large variation in resonator quality depending upon film thickness.

40|$|The inner {{region of}} the {{accretion}} disk around a magnetized neutron star is subjected to magnetic torques that induce warping and precession of the disk. These torques arise from interactions between the stellar field and the induced electric currents in the disk. We carry out a global analysis of warping/precession modes in a viscous accretion disk, and show that under {{a wide range of}} conditions typical of accreting X-ray pulsars, the magnetic warping torque can overcome viscous damping and make the mode grow. The warping/precession modes are concentrated near the inner edge of the disk (at the magnetosphere-disk boundary), and can give rise to variabilities or quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray/UV/optical fluxes from X-ray pulsars. We examine the observed properties of mHz QPOs in several systems (such as 4 U 1626 - 67), and suggest that some hitherto unexplained QPOs are the results of magnetically <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> warping/precession.

40|$|We explore {{consequences}} of a radiation <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> wind model for mass outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We performed axisymmetric timedependent hydrodynamic calculations using the same computational technique as Proga, Stone and Kallman (2000). We test the robustness of radiation launching and acceleration of the wind for relatively unfavorable conditions. In particular, we {{take into account the}} central engine radiation as a source of ionizing photons but neglect its contribution to the radiation force. Additionally, we account for the attenuation of the X-ray radiation by computing the X-ray optical depth in the radial direction assuming that only electron scattering contributes to the opacity. Our new simulations confirm the main result from our previous work: the disk atmosphere can ’shield ’ itself from external X-rays so that the local disk radiation can launch gas off the disk photosphere. We also find that the local disk force suffices to accelerate the disk wind to high velocities in the radial direction. This is true provided the wind does not change significantly the geometry of the disk radiation by continuum scattering and absorption processes; we discuss plausibility of this requirement. Synthetic profiles of a typical resonance ultraviolet line predicted by our models are consistent with observations of broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs.

40|$|We present {{synthetic}} line profiles {{as predicted}} by the models of 2 -D line- <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> winds due to Proga, Stone & Drew. We compare the model line profiles with HST observations of the cataclysmic variable IX Vel. The model wind consists of a slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a fast stream. We find that these two components of the wind produce distinct spectral features. The fast stream produces profiles which show features consistent with observations. These include {{the appearance of the}} P-Cygni shape for a range of inclinations, the location of the maximum depth of the absorption component at velocities less than the terminal velocity, and the transition from absorption to emission with increasing inclination. However the model profiles have too little absorption or emission equivalent width. This quantitative difference between our models and observations is not a surprise because the line-driven wind models predict a mass loss rate that is lower than the rate required by the observations. We note that the model profiles exhibit a double-humped structure near the line center which is not echoed in observations. We identify this structure with a non-negligible redshifted absorption which is formed in the slow component of the wind where the rotational velocity dominates over expansion velocity. We conclude that the next generation of disk wind models, developed for application to CVs, needs to yield stronger wind driving out to larger disk radii than do the present models.

40|$|One of {{the long-standing}} {{problems}} {{of star formation}} is the excess of angular momentum of the parent molecular cloud. In the classical picture, a fraction of angular momentum of the circumstellar material is removed by the magneto-centrifugally <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> wind that is launched from a wide region throughout the disk. In this work, we investigate the kinematics in the envelope-disk transition zone of the Class I object BHB 07 - 11, in the B 59 core. For this purpose, we used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in extended configuration to observe the thermal dust continuum emission (lambda(0) similar to 1. 3 mm) and molecular lines (CO, (CO) -O- 18 and H 2 CO), which are suitable tracers of disk, envelope, and outflow dynamics at a spatial resolution of similar to 30 AU. We report a bipolar outflow that was launched at symmetric positions {{with respect to the}} disk (similar to 80 AU in radius), but was concentrated at a distance of 90 - 130 AU from the disk center. The two outflow lobes had a conical shape and the gas inside was accelerating. The large off set of the launching position coincided with the landing site of the infall materials from the extended spiral structure (seen in dust) onto the disk. This indicates that bipolar outflows are efficiently launched within a narrow region outside the disk edge. We also identify a sharp transition in the gas kinematics across the tip of the spiral structure, which pinpoints the location of the so-called centrifugal barrier...|$|E

40|$|The first long-baseline ALMA {{campaign}} {{resolved the}} disk around the young star HL Tau {{into a number}} of axisymmetric bright and dark rings. Despite the very young age of HL Tau these structures have been interpreted as signatures for the presence of (proto) planets. The ALMA images triggered numerous theoretical studies based on disk-planet interactions, magnetically <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> structures, and grain evolution. Of special interest are the inner parts of disks, where terrestrial planets are expected to form. However, the emission from these regions in HL Tau turned out to be optically thick at all ALMA wavelengths, preventing the derivation of surface density profiles and grain size distributions. Here, we present the most sensitive images of HL Tau obtained to date with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 7. 0 mm wavelength with a spatial resolution comparable to the ALMA images. At this long wavelength the dust emission from HL Tau is optically thin, allowing a comprehensive study of the inner disk. We obtain a total disk dust mass of 0. 001 - 0. 003 Msun, depending on the assumed opacity and disk temperature. Our optically thin data also indicate fast grain growth, fragmentation, and formation of dense clumps in the inner densest parts of the disk. Our results suggest that the HL Tau disk may be actually in a very early stage of planetary formation, with planets not already formed in the gaps but in the process of future formation in the bright rings.

40|$|International audienceIn 2016 {{we carried}} out a Swift {{monitoring}} programme to track the X-ray hardness variability of eight type-I AGN over a year. The purpose of this monitoring was to find intense obscuration events in AGN, and thereby study them by triggering joint XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST observations. We successfully accomplished this for NGC 3783 in December 2016. We found heavy X-ray absorption produced by an obscuring outflow in this AGN. As {{a result of this}} obscuration, interesting absorption features appear in the UV and X-ray spectra, which are not present in the previous epochs. Namely, the obscuration produces broad and blue-shifted UV absorption lines of Lyα, C[*]iv, and N[*]v, together with a new high-ionisation component producing Fe[*]xxv and Fe[*]xxvi absorption lines. In soft X-rays, only narrow emission lines stand out above the diminished continuum as they are not absorbed by the obscurer. Our analysis shows that the obscurer partially covers the central source with a column density of few 1023 cm- 2, outflowing with a velocity of few thousand km s- 1. The obscuration in NGC 3783 is variable and lasts for about a month. Unlike the commonly seen warm-absorber winds at pc-scale distances from the black hole, the eclipsing wind in NGC 3783 is located at about 10 light days.

40|$|Large-scale {{magnetic}} fields are key ingredients of magnetically <b>driven</b> <b>disk</b> accretion. We study how large-scale poloidal fields evolve in accretion disks, {{with the primary}} aim of quantifying the viability of magnetic accretion mechanisms in protoplanetary disks. We employ a kinematic mean-field model for poloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a field balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We analytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in highly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit {{on the strength of}} large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any excess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we demonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field equations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading protoplanetary disks. We find that the maximum attainable strength is about 0. 1 G at 1 AU, and about 1 mG at 10 AU from the central star. When combined with recent magnetic accretion models, the maximum field strength translates into the maximum steady-state accretion rate of ∼ 10 ^- 7 M_ yr^- 1, in agreement with observations. We also find that the maximum field strength is 1 kG at the surface of the central star provided that the disk extends down to the stellar surface. This implies that any excess stellar poloidal field of strength > kG can be transported to the surrounding disk. This might in part resolve the magnetic flux problem in star formation.
