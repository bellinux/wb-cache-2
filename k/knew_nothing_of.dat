5|$|As {{a result}} of the investigation, lines of {{communication}} were set up between the Navy and the Air Force. The Air Force <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> Operation Market Time and did not routinely communicate with Naval Forces, Vietnam. To avoid a repetition of the incident, aircraft patrolling near the DMZ were instructed not to attack vessels without first contacting CSC Da Nang for clearance.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would {{be in charge of the}} ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> horses, to buy themâ€”with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|The final witness {{called for}} the defence was Coventry. He {{was one of the}} non-playing members of the party who had {{witnessed}} no cheating, understood little about gambling and, as a non-soldier, <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> Article 41 of the Queen's Regulations. When cross-examined by Clarke, Coventry confirmed that {{as far as he was}} aware, the witnesses had all decided to watch Gordon-Cumming's play on the second night, despite their claims to the contrary.|$|E

5|$|Topping {{refused to}} allow Brady a second visit to the moors, {{and a few days}} after his visit Brady wrote a letter to BBC {{television}} reporter Peter Gould, giving some sketchy details of five additional murders that he claimed to have carried out. Brady refused to identify his alleged victims, and the police failed to discover any unsolved crimes matching the few details that he supplied. Hindley told Topping that she <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> these killings.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the Prince and had never heard of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading {{on the left}} of the formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes the beginnings of the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located the beginnings of the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E

5|$|Rush {{arrived in}} Sydney in 1861 {{at the age}} of 16, an {{assisted}} immigrant brought to augment Australia's mostly agricultural workforce. Rush was a farm labourer, who <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> boats or boating, but within ten years of his arrival in Australia, Rush was Champion Sculler of the Clarence River, as well as a selector, cattle-raiser and butcher. His interest in the sport of rowing dominated Rush's life, and hampered his prosperity. He repeatedly travelled from his Clarence River home to compete for large money prizes on Sydney's Parramatta River, neglecting his business affairs. Rush became Champion Sculler of Australia in 1873, and defended his championship several times, not always successfully. Rush succeeded on a few occasions in having the Championship venue moved from Sydney to the Clarence River, the first to shift the focus of sculling away from the capital city. From 1874, there was talk of Rush travelling to England to compete for the World Sculling Championship, but this did not eventuate. Instead, Edward Trickett won the World Championship on the Thames in 1876. Rush and Trickett in 1877 competed on the Parramatta River for the World Championship, but Rush lost this race.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to kiss his hand, he embraced him. The visitors noted that the chamber was hung with tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

Until age twelve he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> professional artists, although art had surrounded him in childhood. He delighted in peasant embroidery, and in decorated walls and stoves. He was able to paint in the peasant style. He studied drawing in Kiev from 1895 to 1896.|$|E
25|$|In forming {{their view}} of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes {{inherited}} from the Greeks. These were the vilest creatures imaginable.

They had no buildings, of course, {{not so much as}} a reed hut, indeed, they feared the very idea of venturing under a roof.|$|E
