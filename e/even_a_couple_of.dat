As noted above, the island has a {{transient}} population comprising employees of SNH and their families, researchers, and a teacher. Until recently SNH have been opposed {{to the development of}} the island as a genuine community, but there has been a change in approach since the beginning of 2007. Di Alexander, development manager for the Highlands Small Communities Housing Trust has said: [...] "It has been clear for many years that the small community on Rùm needs to increase and diversify its housing supply away from exclusively SNH-tied housing. <b>Even</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> new rented houses could make such a difference to the community's wellbeing." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{second point}} I {{want to make}} about {{instruction}} {{is the importance of}} youth. In America, where they contemplate a labour shortage of 2,000,000 men on their farms, they are using boys from sixteen to twenty-one, when their military age begins. Can we not do the same here? Most of our boys from fifteen to eighteen are now on other work. But the work they are doing could surely be done by girls or women. If we could put <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred thousand boys of that age on the land it would be the solution of our present agricultural labour shortage, and the very best thing that could happen for the future of farming. The boys would learn at first hand; they would learn slowly and thoroughly; and many of them would stay on the land. They might be given specialised schooling in agriculture, the most important schooling we can give our rising generation, while all of them would gain physically. By employing women on the land, where we can employ boys of from fifteen to eighteen, we are blind-alleying. Women will not stay on the land in any numbers; few will wish that they should. Boys will, and every one would wish that they may.|$|E

In the simplest forms {{it appears as}} attraction or repulsion, according as the currents {{are in the same}} or different directions: in the current and the magnet it takes up the condition of tangential forces; and in magnets and their particles produces poles. Since the experiments have been made which have persuaded me that the polar forces of electricity, as in induction and electrolytic action (1298. 1343.), show effects at a distance only by means of the polarized contiguous and intervening particles, I have been led to expect that all polar forces act in the same general manner; and the other kinds of phenomena which one can bring to bear upon the subject seem fitted to strengthen that expectation. Thus in crystallizations the effect is transmitted from particle to particle; and in this manner, in acetic acid or freezing water a crystal a few inches or <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> feet in length will form in less than a second, but progressively and by a transmission of power from particle to particle. And, as far as I remember, no case of polar action, or partaking of polar action, except the one under discussion, can be found which does not act by contiguous particles[A]. It is apparently of the nature of polar forces that such should be the case, for the one force either finds or developed the contrary force near to it, and has, therefore, no occasion to seek for it at a distance.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Dallow {{came up to}} London {{soon after}} the meeting of Parliament; she {{made no secret of}} the fact that she was fond of [...] "town" [...] and that in present {{conditions}} it would of course not have become less attractive to her. But she prepared to retreat again for the Easter vacation, not to go back to Harsh, but to pay a couple of country visits. She did not, however, depart with the crowd--she never did anything with the crowd--but waited till the Monday after Parliament rose; facing with composure, in Great Stanhope Street, the horrors, as she had been taught to consider them, of a Sunday out of the session. She had done what she could to mitigate them by asking a handful of [...] "stray men" [...] to dine with her that evening. Several members of this disconsolate class sought comfort in Great Stanhope Street in the afternoon, and them for the most part she also invited to return at eight o'clock. There were accordingly almost too many people at dinner; there were <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> wives. Nick Dormer was then present, though he had not been in the afternoon. Each of the other persons had said on coming in, [...] "So you've not gone--I'm awfully glad." [...] Mrs. Dallow had replied, [...] "No, I've not gone," [...] but she had in no case added that she was glad, nor had she offered an explanation. She never offered explanations; she always assumed that no one could invent them so well as those who had the florid taste to desire them.|$|E
6000|$|We at once {{recognized}} {{the value of}} this discovery when, reaching the tents, we examined the quartz, and found it seamed and pitted with veins and geodes containing Colorado, earthy and crumbling metallic dust, chlorure, iodure, and bromure of silver, with various colours, red, ochre-yellow, and dark chocolate-brown. It stained the fingers, and was suspiciously light--n'importe. I must regret that here, as indeed throughout the exploration, all our specimens were taken from the surface: we had not time to dig <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> feet deep. The lad 'Id almost fainted with joy and surprise when the silver dollars were dropped into his hand, one by one, with the reiteration of [...] "Here's another for you! and here's another!" [...] This lavishness served to stimulate cupidity, and every day the Bedawin brought in specimens from half a dozen different places. But the satisfaction was at its height when the crucible produced, after cupellation, a button of [...] "silver" [...] weighing some twenty grammes from the hundred grammes of what the grumbling Californian miners had called, in their wrath, [...] "dashed black dust;"[EN#109] and when a second experiment yielded twenty-eight grammes (each fifteen grains and a half) and ten centigrammes from 111 grammes, or {{about a quarter of a}} pound avoirdupois. In the latter experiment also, the culot came away without the litharge, which almost always contains traces of silver and antimony. Hence we concluded that the proportions were 30:110--a magnificent result, considering that 12-1/2:100 is held to be rich ore in the silver mines of the Pacific States.[EN#110] The engineer was radieux with pride and joy. The yellow tint of the [...] "buttons" [...] promised gold--two per cent.? Three per cent.? Immense wealth lay before us: a ton of silver is worth 250,000 francs. Meanwhile--and now I take blame to myself--no one thought of testing the find, even by a blow with the hammer.|$|E

60|$|But Lopez himself, {{having with}} his friend's {{assistance}} arranged his affairs comfortably {{for a month}} or two, had, as a first resolution, promised himself a fortnight's freedom from all carking cares. His second resolution had been {{that at the end of}} the fortnight he would commence his operations on Mr. Wharton. Up to the last moment he had hoped,--had almost expected,--that a sum of money would have been paid to him. <b>Even</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousand pounds for the time would have been of great use to him;--but no tender of any kind had been made. Not a word had been said. Things could not of course go on in that way. He was not going to play the coward with his father-in-law. Then he bethought himself how he would act if his father-in-law were sternly to refuse to do anything for him, and he assured himself that in such circumstances he would make himself very disagreeable to his father-in-law. And then his third resolution had reference to his wife. She must be instructed in his ways. She must learn to look at the world with his eyes. She must be taught the great importance of money,--not in a griping, hard-fisted, prosaic spirit; but that she might participate in that feeling of his own which had in it so much that was grand, so much that was delightful, so much that was picturesque. He would never ask her to be parsimonious,--never even to be economical. He would take a glory in seeing her well dressed and well attended, with her own carriage and her own jewels. But she must learn that the enjoyment of these things must be built upon a conviction that the most important pursuit in the world was the acquiring of money. And she must be made to understand, first of all, that she had a right to at any rate a half of her father's fortune. He had perceived that she had much influence with her father, and she must be taught to use this influence unscrupulously on her husband's behalf.|$|E
6000|$|Robert Browning's {{childhood}} {{was passed in}} an unusually serene and happy home. In Development he tells how, at five years of age, he was made to understand the main facts of the Trojan War by his father's clever use of the cat, the dogs, the pony in the stable, and the page-boy, to impersonate the heroes of that ancient conflict. Latin declensions were taught the child by rhymes concocted by his father as memory-easing devices. Stories and even lessons were made intelligible and vivid by colored maps and comic drawings. Until the boy was fourteen, his schooling was of the most casual sort, his only formal training being such as he received in the comparatively unimportant {{three or four years}} he spent, after he was ten, at Mr. Ready's private school. His real education came, through all his early life, from his home. What would now be called nature-study he pursued ardently and on his own initiative in the home garden and neighboring fields. His love for animals was inherited from his mother and fostered by her. He used to keep, says Mrs. Orr in her account of his life, [...] "owls and monkeys, magpies and hedge-hogs, an eagle, and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> large snakes, constantly bringing home the more portable animals in his pockets and transferring them to his mother for immediate care." [...] Browning says that his faculty of observation at this time would not have disgraced a Seminole Indian. In the matter of reading he was not entirely without advice and guidance, but was, on the whole, allowed unusual freedom of choice. He afterwards told Mrs. Orr that Milton, Quarles, Voltaire, Mandeville, and Horace Walpole were the authors in whom, as a boy, he particularly delighted. His love for art was established and developed by visits to the Dulwich picture gallery, of which he afterwards wrote to Miss Barrett with [...] "love and gratitude" [...] because he had been allowed to go there before the age prescribed by the rules, and had thus learned to know [...] "a wonderful Rembrandt," [...] a Watteau, [...] "three triumphant Murillos," [...] a Giorgione Music Lesson, and various Poussins. His marked early susceptibility to music is evidenced by an incident narrated by Mr. Sharp: [...] "One afternoon his mother was playing in the twilight to herself. She was startled to hear a sound behind her. Glancing round she beheld a little white figure distinct against an oak bookcase, and could just discern two large wistful eyes looking earnestly at her. The next moment the child had sprung into her arms, sobbing passionately at he knew not what, but, as his paroxysm subsided, whispering with shy urgency: 'Play! Play!'" ...|$|E
