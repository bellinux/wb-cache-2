500|$|... the {{overcrowding}} of {{the city}} is caused, first by the natural increase in the population and area of the surrounding district; secondly, by the influx of provincial passengers by the great railways North of London, and the obstruction experienced in the streets by omnibuses and cabs coming from their distant stations, to bring the provincial travellers to and from the heart {{of the city}}. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> next to the vast increase of what I may term the migratory population, the population of the city who now oscillate between the country and the city, who leave the City of London every afternoon and return every morning.|$|E
500|$|Hayes had pledged {{himself to}} a one-term presidency, and the Republican {{nomination}} in 1880 attracted many candidates, including Sherman. Hayes's preference was for Sherman to succeed him, but he made no official endorsement, {{and he did not}} think Sherman could win the nomination. Among the early favorites for the nomination were former President Grant, Senator James G. Blaine of Maine, and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont. Grant did not actively promote his candidacy, but his entry into the race energized his partisans, and when the convention met in Chicago in June 1880, they instantly divided the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions, with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group. After Grant and Blaine had been nominated, James Garfield nominated Sherman with an eloquent speech, saying [...] "You ask for his monuments, <b>I</b> <b>point</b> you to twenty-five years of national statutes. Not one great beneficent statute has been placed in our statute books without his intelligent and powerful aid." [...] The speech, while heartfelt, was not particularly stirring. As Senator George Frisbie Hoar later explained, [...] "here was nothing stimulant or romantic in the plain wisdom of John Sherman".|$|E
2500|$|Basil of Caesarea, in {{his writing}} On the Holy Spirit, says: [...] "The honor paid to the image passes to the prototype". He also {{illustrates}} the concept by saying, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>point</b> to a statue of Caesar and ask you 'Who is that?', your answer would properly be, 'It is Caesar.' When you say such you do {{not mean that the}} stone itself is Caesar, but rather, the name and honor you ascribe to the statue passes over to the original, the archetype, Caesar himself." [...] So it is with an Icon.|$|E

2500|$|After the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, Falwell said on Pat Robertson's The 700 Club, [...] "I {{really believe that}} the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are {{actively}} trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them {{who have tried to}} secularize America. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.'" [...] Falwell further stated that the attacks were [...] "probably deserved", a statement which Christopher Hitchens described as treason. After heavy criticism, Falwell said that no one but the terrorists were to blame, and stated, [...] "If I left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else, I apologize." ...|$|E
2500|$|This law thus {{squarely}} {{shifts the}} onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies {{are yet to}} enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, [...] "I have a few IT clients. When <b>I</b> <b>point</b> {{to the need for}} a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." [...] An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: [...] "I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." [...] Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, [...] "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." [...] As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.|$|E
