5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This {{was not enough to}} convince the state selectors and Harvey <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> recall to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E

The number of teams was lowered to 12; the top six teams <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bye and played five preliminary round games. Sweden won the gold medal over Finland and the Czech Republic won the bronze medal. Three months later, Sweden won the 2006 World Championships and became the first team to win the Olympic and World Championship gold in the same year.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|At JAMMA's 1992 Amusement Machine Show in Japan, {{held during}} 27–19 August 1992, Namco debuted a racing game called Sim Drive for the Namco System 22 arcade system board. It was {{a sequel to}} Eunos Roadster Driving Simulator, a Mazda MX-5 driving {{simulation}} arcade game that Namco developed with Mazda and released in 1990. Its 3D polygon graphics stood out for its use of Gouraud shading and texture mapping. After a location test at the show, where it was previewed by the November 1992 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Sim Drive had a limited Japanese release in December 1992, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> mass-market release.

However, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Men on a Mission {{challenged}} The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked Men on a Mission before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pinfall. Men on a Mission regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, {{to pull his}} wrestlers out of the ring.

Commercial success returned to Moore with The Forgotten, a psychological thriller in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one.|$|E

He also succeeded in taking 6 wickets at an average of 31.16; his best figures were 3/16. His strong performances led to his inclusion in the Asia Cup squad. He played three matches and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to bat but he proved himself with the ball taking 4/32 in the first match of the series against Sri Lanka. He picked up two more wickets in the next two games. He was the part of the team touring South Africa for the one T20 played on 31 March 2012 where he had figures of 4–0–44–1 but was yet to bat. Pathan also played for the Delhi Daredevils the Indian Premier League in 2012, taking only 8 wickets from 17 matches with an average of 58.12.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, {{he played}} in the Country trials in Brisbane. He was selected for the Queensland Colts in 193233 and represented Queensland Country against Douglas Jardine's England cricket team during the Bodyline tour. In England's innings of 376, Tallon conceded only five byes and stumped Herbert Sutcliffe, {{regarded as one of the}} finest batsmen in Test history. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to display his batting prowess as the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood rattled him with a series of deliveries aimed at the throat, before bowling him for two. Tallon's fast and efficient skills behind the stumps further caught the eye of cricket officials in early 1933 at the Country Week Carnivals. Tallon distinguished himself with his tidy keeping to the express pace bowling of Eddie Gilbert, whose suspect action and indigenous heritage were later the subject of controversy.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Mota {{was named}} the Marlins' closer in spring {{training}} since Benítez became a free agent following the 2004 season. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> save opportunity until April 22, which he converted in a 4–2 win over Cincinnati. He got his second save of the year {{the next day in}} another 4–2 win over Cincinnati. However, he was placed on the disabled list on May 1 (retroactive to April 24) with inflammation in his right elbow. He was activated on May 27, but Todd Jones, who had been filling in for Mota, remained the closer. Mota had a 1.69 ERA through his first 11 games, but 12 earned runs allowed over his next seven games raised his ERA to 7.27. On June 24, he was the winning pitcher in the Marlins' 7–4 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He got his only other win of the year on August 30, when he gave up a run in two innings in a 7–6 victory over St. Louis. Mota posted a 3.81 ERA over his final 38 games to finish the season 2–2 with a 4.70 ERA in 56 games. On November 24, Mota was traded with Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell to the Boston Red Sox for four prospects: Jesús Delgado, Harvey García, Hanley Ramírez, and Aníbal Sánchez.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{good look at the}} creature, he describes it {{to the rest of the}} team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 2012, Balotelli came on as a {{substitute}} during a match against Tottenham Hotspur. He appeared to stamp on Scott Parker during the match against Tottenham, but, already booked, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> second yellow from referee Howard Webb, who {{did not see the}} incident. Balotelli subsequently scored his first goal of 2012, an injury-time penalty which secured a 3–2 win for City. He was charged for violent conduct for the kick against Scott Parker and was suspended for four matches, three for violent conduct and one for his second sending off. On 25 February, he scored his tenth league goal of the season in a 3–0 home win against Blackburn Rovers. He scored again the following game in a 2–0 win against Bolton Wanderers. On 31 March, Balotelli scored twice as City drew 3–3 at home against Sunderland. However, Balotelli was criticized for his actions in the match after squabbling with Aleksandar Kolarov over a free kick. Roberto Mancini claimed after the game that he had considered substituting Balotelli just five minutes into the match. On 8 April 2012, Balotelli received his fourth red card of the season, after receiving his second yellow card during the match for a tackle against Bacary Sagna during City's 1–0 loss to Arsenal in April 2012. He was banned for three games (one for the two yellow cards and two for the previous two red cards in the same season). After the Arsenal match, Mancini appeared to have finally lost his patience with Balotelli, suggesting that Balotelli would not play any part in the remainder of City's season and be sold by the club. Despite this, Balotelli did make an appearance as a late substitute in the last game of the season, a title-deciding match against Queens Park Rangers. Balotelli provided the assist to striker Sergio Agüero, who scored in the 94th minute to give City their first league title since 1968.|$|E
