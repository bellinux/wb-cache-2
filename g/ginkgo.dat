5|$|<b>Ginkgo</b> nuts (<b>Ginkgo</b> biloba) are {{a common}} {{ingredient}} in Chinese cooking. They are starchy, low in fat, protein and calories, but high in vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|The single extant {{species of}} Ginkgophyta (<b>Ginkgo</b> biloba) has fleshy seeds {{produced}} {{at the ends}} of short branches on female trees, and Gnetum, a tropical and subtropical group of gymnosperms produce seeds at the tip of a shoot axis.|$|E
5|$|Curcumin as of 2010 has {{not shown}} benefit in people {{even though there}} is {{tentative}} evidence in animals. There is inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that <b>ginkgo</b> has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia. As of 2008 there is no concrete evidence that cannabinoids are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia; however, some research looks promising.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ginkgos</b> adapt well to {{the urban}} environment, tolerating {{pollution}} and confined soil spaces. They rarely suffer disease problems, even in urban conditions, and are attacked by few insects. For this reason, and for their general beauty, <b>ginkgos</b> are excellent urban and shade trees, and are widely planted along many streets.|$|R

25|$|Extreme {{examples}} of the <b>ginkgo's</b> tenacity {{may be seen in}} Hiroshima, Japan, where six trees growing between 1â€“2km from the 1945 atom bomb explosion were among the few living things in the area to survive the blast. Although almost all other plants (and animals) in the area were killed, the <b>ginkgos,</b> though charred, survived and were soon healthy again, among other hibakujumoku (trees that survived the blast).|$|R
5|$|A pagoda-style {{pavilion}} {{based on}} a structure that Wong had seen in Suzhou is located near the park's western boundarythe Chicago River. Site Design Group designed the pavilion's ornamentation and railings and obtained its traditional Chinese roof tiles from a source in Japan. The park's entrance is marked by four -tall columns, each etched with Chinese dragons and is modeled after a traditional Chinese courtyard. The park containers Chinese-influenced gardens that include <b>ginkgo</b> trees and bamboo. A children's playground {{is located at the}} north end of the park.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in {{the late}} Miocene contributed to the Mascall Strata, layers of stream-deposited {{volcanic}} tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt. Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of animals such as horses, camels, rhinoceroses, bears, pronghorn, deer, weasels, raccoons, cats, dogs, and sloths. These fauna thrived in the monument's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12million years ago. The fossils of oak, sycamore, maple, <b>ginkgo,</b> and elm trees reflect the area's cool climate during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin also {{interacts with}} many herbs and spices, some used in food (such as ginger and garlic) and others used purely for {{medicinal}} purposes (such as ginseng and <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba). All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin; similar effects {{have been reported}} with borage (starflower) oil or fish oils. St. John's Wort, sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, reduces {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.|$|E
50|$|Conifers were {{dominant}} in the Middle Jurassic. Other plants, such as <b>ginkgoes,</b> cycads, and ferns were also common.|$|R

50|$|There {{are more}} than 600 {{different}} shrubs composed not just by hackberries and yew trees, but also by cedars, horse chestnuts, beech trees, <b>ginkgos,</b> maples, elms and robinias.|$|R
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include <b>ginkgo,</b> echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping {{on the south lawn}} was carried out by Bishop George Henry Law in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one of the towers. Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a black walnut, Lebanon cedar, catalpa and <b>ginkgo.</b> In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to the springs. This acts as a mirror on a still day providing reflections of the east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Paleogene period between 63 and 52 Ma, the last {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} British Isles were formed. As North America and Greenland separated from Europe, the Atlantic Ocean slowly formed. This led to a chain of volcanic sites west of mainland Scotland including on Skye, the Small Isles and St. Kilda, in the Firth of Clyde on Arran and Ailsa Craig and at Ardnamurchan. Sea levels began to fall, {{and for the first}} time the general outline of the modern British Isles was revealed. At the beginning of this period the climate was sub-tropical and erosion was caused by chemical weathering, creating characteristic features of the Scottish landscape such as the topographical basin of the Howe of Alford near Aberdeen. The vegetation of the period is known from Paleocene sedimentary deposits on Isle of Mull. The rich flora here included temperate-climate tree species such as plane, hazel, oak, Cercidiphyllum, Metasequoia and <b>ginkgo.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ginkgos</b> {{are also}} popular {{subjects}} for growing as penjing and bonsai; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. Furthermore, the trees are easy to propagate from seed.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ginkgos</b> are dioecious, with {{separate}} sexes, some trees being female and others being male. Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls, each bearing two microsporangia spirally arranged around a central axis.|$|R
5000|$|Arboretum - {{focusing}} on conifers, including Sequoiadendron giganteum and Metasequoia glyptostroboides, {{as well as}} alders, ash, birches, <b>ginkgos,</b> hazels, maples, oaks, deciduous poplars, sycamores, and willows, representing both native and exotic species.|$|R
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, <b>Ginkgo,</b> and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} tree-like organisms were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, {{which grew}} in {{forests in the}} Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been Wattieza, fossils {{of which have been}} found in New York State in 2007 dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree. Both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic period. The gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and these may have appeared {{as a result of a}} whole genome duplication event which took place about 319 million years ago. Ginkgophyta was once a widespread diverse group of which the only survivor is the maidenhair tree <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic deposits.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ginkgo</b> leaf is {{the symbol}} of the Urasenke school of Japanese tea ceremony. The tree is the {{official}} tree of the Japanese capital of Tokyo, and {{the symbol of}} Tokyo is a <b>ginkgo</b> leaf.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ginkgos</b> {{are large}} trees, {{normally}} reaching {{a height of}} , with some specimens in China being over [...] The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (one to 15days). A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood {{and the ability to}} form aerial roots and sprouts makes <b>ginkgos</b> long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500years old.|$|R
50|$|Changyuraptor {{is thought}} to have existed {{alongside}} a variety of predatory and herbivorous dinosaurs of the Jehol Biota, including Yutyrannus, in moist temperate forest, primarily vegetated by <b>ginkgos</b> and conifers, with hot, dry summers and frosty winters.|$|R
2500|$|In some areas, most {{intentionally}} planted <b>ginkgos</b> {{are male}} cultivars grafted onto plants propagated from seed, because the male trees will not produce the malodorous seeds. The popular cultivar [...] "Autumn Gold" [...] is a clone {{of a male}} plant.|$|R
25|$|Extracts of <b>ginkgo</b> leaves contain {{phenolic}} acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, such as myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin and quercetin, and the terpene trilactones, ginkgolides and bilobalides. The leaves {{also contain}} unique <b>ginkgo</b> biflavones, {{as well as}} alkylphenols and polyprenols.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ginkgo</b> {{may have}} {{undesirable}} effects, especially {{for individuals with}} blood circulation disorders and those taking anticoagulants such as aspirin or warfarin, although recent studies have found <b>ginkgo</b> {{has little or no}} effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of male <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba trees {{is that they}} are highly allergenic. Male <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba trees have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 7 (out of 10), whereas female trees, which can produce no pollen, have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 2.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ginkgos</b> {{are large}} trees, {{normally}} reaching {{a height of}} 20 - 35 m, with some specimens in China being over 50 m. The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages.

5000|$|... â€¢ <b>Ginkgos</b> {{are large}} and {{beautiful}} trees which are usually planted as street trees. People can obtain high-quality wood from them. Also, their leaves and fruits are used as a valuable medicine. Magnificent view of the trees means prosperity and eternal peace in Paju City.|$|R
50|$|Plant fossils {{from the}} Mist Mountain Formation include remains of ferns, cycads, cycadeoids, <b>Ginkgos</b> and extinct conifers. No remains of {{flowering}} {{plants have been}} reported. Indeterminate fossil ornithischian tracks are also known from the formation. None of the fossils are sufficiently time-sensitive to date the formation precisely.|$|R
25|$|Some authors {{claim that}} <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba extracts, which are co-administered with {{anticoagulant}} {{drugs such as}} warfarin (coumadin), increase the risk for bleeding because of their assumed antiplatelet activity. Concerns that standardized <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba preparations (GBE) significantly impact haemostasis or adversely affect the safety of anticoagulant drugs are however not supported by current medical literature.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ginkgo</b> is {{classified}} {{in its own}} division, the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family Ginkgoaceae, genus <b>Ginkgo</b> {{and is the only}} extant species within this group. It is one of the best-known examples of a living fossil, because Ginkgoales other than G. biloba are not known from the fossil record after the Pliocene.|$|E
25|$|For centuries, it {{was thought}} to be extinct in the wild, but is now known to grow in at least two small areas in Zhejiang {{province}} in eastern China, in the Tianmushan Reserve. However, recent studies indicate high genetic uniformity among <b>ginkgo</b> trees from these areas, arguing against a natural origin of these populations and suggesting the <b>ginkgo</b> trees in these areas may have been planted and preserved by Chinese monks over a period of about 1,000 years. This study demonstrates a greater genetic diversity in Southwestern China populations, supporting glacial refugia in mountains surrounding eastern Tibetan Plateau, where several old-growth candidates for wild populations have been reported. Whether native <b>ginkgo</b> populations still exist has not been demonstrated unequivocally, but evidence grows favouring these Southwestern populations as wild, from genetic data but also from history of those territories, with bigger <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba trees being older than surrounding human settlements.|$|E
50|$|The Beaver Mines Formation was {{deposited}} in floodplain and fluvial channel environments by meandering river systems. It contains {{a variety of}} plant fossils including remains of ferns, cycads, cycadeoids, <b>Ginkgos</b> and extinct conifers, but remains of flowering plants do not appear until the overlying Ma Butte Formation.|$|R
50|$|The Bennettitales bore remarkably flower-like organs, {{protected}} by whorls of s {{which may have}} played a similar role to the petals and sepals of true flowers; however, these flower-like structures evolved independently, as the Bennettitales are more closely related to cycads and <b>ginkgos</b> than to the angiosperms.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Ginkgos</b> {{have not}} only existed for a long time, but also have a long life span, with some having an age of over 2,500 years. Six {{specimens}} survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, 1 to 2 kilometers from ground zero. They still live there today.|$|R
