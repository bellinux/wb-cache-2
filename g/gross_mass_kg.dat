40|$|AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference July 10 - 13, 2005, Tucson, AZ. An {{innovative}} {{propulsion system}} concept that enables powered flight on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, is discussed. This propulsion system concept uses waste heat from a NASA Multi-Mission Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) to power a gas turbine engine. The propulsion system captures MMRTG waste heat by utilizing the in-situ resources of Titan’s cold dense nitrogen atmosphere {{as a working}} fluid, passed through a heat exchanger. The heated gas is then run through a turbine to extract electrical power significantly greater than that available from the MMRTG’s thermoelectric effect. In addition to analysis, an experimental system was constructed to validate the feasibility of the proposed concept. This investigation compares the results obtained with this experimental system to analytic predictions. Experimental system performance exceeding 500 watts of measured power output was achieved. This propulsive performance enables consideration of a robotic vertical takeoff and landing vehicle with an altitude ceiling of 15 km, range of 50 km, endurance of 3 - 4 months, payload capacity of 25 <b>kg,</b> and a <b>gross</b> <b>mass</b> of 400 <b>kg</b> as a future Titan aerial platform...|$|R

5000|$|From the {{perspective}} of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a larger amount of ordinary (baryonic) matter implies a denser early universe, more efficient conversion of matter to helium-4, and less unburned deuterium remaining. If all of the dark matter in the universe were baryonic, then would be much less deuterium in the universe than is observed. This could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated, but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur. For instance, MACHOs, which include, for example, brown dwarfs (bodies of hydrogen and helium with masses less than 0.08 solar <b>mass</b> <b>kg),</b> never begin nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but they do burn deuterium.
