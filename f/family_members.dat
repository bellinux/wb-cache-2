5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} <b>family</b> <b>members</b> usually {{become the}} children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives. Extended <b>family</b> <b>members</b> often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that extended <b>family</b> <b>members</b> mistreat orphans whose parents {{have died from}} HIV/AIDS. For example, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> {{who are unable to}} support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analysis}} {{the role}} of family control on financial performance of family business by using the key financial data of family businesses of 16 firm registred to Gebze Chamber of Commerce. In this paper, financial performance of a family business is measured by using Return on Assets, Return on Sales and Total Debt/Total Assets ratios. The <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO is more successful as far as ROA ratios concerned, but is less successful as far as TD/TA ratios concerned, in comparison to non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO. In other words, the non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO is more successful as far as TD/TA ratios concerned, but is less successful as far as ROA ratios concerned, in comparison to <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO. Additionally, as far as ROS ratios concerned, {{there is no significant}} difference between <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO and non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO. Overall, the results are consistent with the hypotheses that there is difference between ROA of <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO and non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO, and there is difference between TD/TA of <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO and non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO...|$|R

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When <b>family</b> <b>members</b> fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when <b>family</b> <b>members</b> are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
