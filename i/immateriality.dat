In this paper I argue that the materialities and <b>immaterialities</b> of many mundane media technologies, the way they articulate and translate particular programmes of government, and the way they instil practices of self-government in citizens, are important but frequently overlooked dimensions of the geographies of government. I focus on the codes of countryside conduct ? The Country Code/Countryside Code ? that have been published in England and Wales since 1951. I examine how the National Parks Commission, and subsequently the Countryside Commission and Countryside Agency, identified the potential strengths and limitations of using the Country Code booklet to govern the conduct of visitors to the countryside.

40|$|We {{are proud}} to welcome you to the conference ‘In the Flow: People, Media, Materialities’. It is {{arranged}} by the Advanced Cultural Studies Institute of Sweden (ACSIS), a national centre for interdisciplinary and international networking in cultural research. This is the sixth biennial ACSIS conference. All the conferences have had different themes connected to various aspects of cultural research. ‘In the Flow: People, Media, Materialities’ {{is a continuation of}} the fifth conference, ‘On the Move’, which explored the ‘mobility turns’ various extensions in cultural research. This conference also emphasizes spatial, cultural and social flows, but the focus is on mediatization and how new and old media interact with bodies, institutions and various industries to produce social, cultural and material effects. We are especially proud to welcome our two keynote speakers, Anna Reading, Professor of Culture and Creative Industries at Kings College, London, and Mike Crang, Professor of Geography at Durham University, two scholars who in recent years have set out to rework the borders of, on the one hand, the cultural and the symbolical and, on the other hand, the material and the physical. The borderlands between the representational and the corporeal are explored by the plenary panel led by André Jansson, Professor of Media and Communication Studies at Karlstad University, discussing what body-monitoring technologies do to our experiences of being human. The keynotes and the plenary panel set the tone for sessions and individual papers presented by cultural researchers from many different countries. There are, for example, a number of presentations on digital technology. Similar to the plenary panel, some look at the nexus of mediatization and material embodied in everyday life actions and habits, examining the interplay between physical movement and affective engagement regarding wearable devices. Others approach the overarching theme of flows and slowdowns by discussing various aspects of understanding and tracking the circulation of images, music, texts and materialities, such as the mundane practices tied to online searches, methodologies to analyze online data, the curbing of the contemporary abundance of documents in institutions or how patents and copyrights regulate the distribution of on-screen <b>immaterialities</b> as well as material objects. The conference suggests that the ways in which digital media saturate contemporary everyday life have energized and renewed classic cultural studies fields, such as the study of identities, music consumption and television viewing. Theoretical redirections such as new materialism and ANT have directed attention to the agency of non-human actors such as computers in cultural processes {{at the same time as}} scholars have kept their eyes open for the everyday life agency of, for example, children and young people. Digital media are a very significant theme running through the conference. Another is the flows of objects and ideas through space as well as the effect of flows on people and places, investigating, for example, two-way flows between colonized lands and the metropole itself, flowbacks of labour and capital, urban transformations and the reconfiguration of resort cities. A third theme is heritage flows. A series of sessions discuss how new technologies, globalization, policies and changing classification systems set heritage values, exhibitions and institutions in motion. Additional themes such as cultural sociology, feminist culture studies and the future of gender and sexualities remind cultural researchers of the importance of keeping their eyes open for power relations, inequalities, identities and politics. We are also very pleased to present our series of spotlight sessions. Here we have invited researchers to discuss time, media history, heritage institutions, the impact of digital media on fan and celebrity cultures, and feminist culture studies. Thanks to an initiative from the master’s students on the Linköping University Programme for Culture, Society and Media Production, we have a spotlight session on education and research. The conference is supported by Linköping University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Swedish universities which co-fund ACSIS, and the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation. We are also enormously grateful for and impressed by the unpaid efforts of all invited speakers, panellists, moderators, session organizers and paper presenters. We invite you to discover the conference’s rich and varied content, which encourages interdisciplinary exchanges as well as conversaions across empirical fields. Finally, we wish to stress that conferences are a great opportunity to meet old friends and make new ones. In addition to the discussions at the sessions, there will be plenty of time to socialize at the reception on Monday evening at the art gallery Verkstad and at the conference dinner on Tuesday night.

Instead, he goes much deeper, extending to the mechanisms of composition to expand the possibilities of materiality. [...] He utilizes technological advancements which can challenge unexpected materials, such as stone, into providing {{the same sense of}} lightness and softness as glass or wood.

2500|$|In English Renaissance theatre, ghosts {{were often}} {{depicted}} in the garb of the living and even in armour. Armour, being out-of-date {{by the time of}} the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity. The sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 1800s because an armoured ghost had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators, and eventually became clichéd stage elements and objects of ridicule. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory, point out, [...] "In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'." [...] An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that [...] "at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to believe in them at all it seems to be necessary to assert their <b>immateriality,</b> their invisibility. [...] The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed." ...|$|E
2500|$|While he {{was imprisoned}} {{in the castle}} of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous [...] "Floating Man"– {{literally}} falling man– thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality and <b>immateriality</b> of the soul. Avicenna believed his [...] "Floating Man" [...] thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even {{in a situation that}} prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all , which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from sense experience, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this [...] "Floating Man" [...] indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument: ...|$|E

60|$|As {{has been}} already said, Hume is {{not content with}} denying that we know {{anything}} about the existence or the nature of the soul; but he carries the war into the enemy's camp, and accuses those who affirm the <b>immateriality,</b> simplicity, and indivisibility of the thinking substance, of atheism and Spinozism, which are assumed to be convertible terms.|$|E

60|$|I liked well to {{see that}} strange life, which even the stout, dead-in- earnest little Bohemian musicians, piping in {{the centre of the}} Piazza, could not {{altogether}} substantialize, and which constantly took <b>immateriality</b> from the loveliness of its environment.

60|$|Indeed, {{besides the}} bearing of these {{views on the}} {{happiness}} of the children, {{it is not at}} all improbable that the question of health may be seriously involved in them. For, however certain we may be of the <b>immateriality</b> of the soul in its essence, it is a perfectly well established fact that all its operations and functions, as an animating spirit in the human body, are fulfilled through the workings of material organs in the brain; that these organs are in childhood in an exceedingly immature, tender, and delicate condition; and that all sudden, sharp, and, especially, painful emotions, greatly excite, and sometimes cruelly irritate them.|$|E
60|$|There is {{certainly}} {{no apparent reason}} why there should be any antecedent presumption against the supposition that the soul performs the act of remembering or of conceiving an imaginary scene through the instrumentality of a bodily organ, more than that it should receive a sensation of light or of sound through such a channel. The question of the independent existence and the <b>immateriality</b> of the thinking and feeling principle, which takes cognizance of these thoughts and sensations, {{is not at all}} affected by any inquiries into the nature of the instrumentality by means of which, in a particular stage of its existence, it performs these functions.|$|E
6000|$|There {{remained}} {{only one}} possible position, which, {{had it been}} taken up earlier, might have saved an immensity of trouble; {{and that was to}} affirm that we do not, and cannot, know anything about the [...] "substance" [...] either of the thinking thing, or of the extended thing. And Hume's sound common sense led him to defend this thesis, which Locke had already foreshadowed, with respect {{to the question of the}} substance of the soul. Hume enunciates two opinions. The first is that the question itself is unintelligible, and therefore cannot receive any answer; the second is that the popular doctrine respecting the <b>immateriality,</b> simplicity, and indivisibility of a thinking substance is a [...] "true atheism, and will serve to justify all those sentiments for which Spinoza is so universally infamous." ...|$|E
6000|$|V. This, probably, {{is because}} you have no {{sufficiently}} generic conception of the term [...] "substance" [...] itself. We must not regard it as a quality, but as a sentiment:--it is the perception, in thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus--many things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings--to the angels--the whole of the unparticled matter is substance--that is to say, the whole of what we term [...] "space" [...] is to them the truest substantiality;--the stars, meantime, through what we consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its <b>immateriality,</b> eludes the organic.|$|E
60|$|What a vile slip {{of the pen}} was that! How absurd in me to {{talk about}} burying the bones of Byron, who, I have just seen alive, and incased in a big, round bulk of flesh! But, to say the truth, a prodigiously fat man always impresses me as a kind of hobgoblin; in the very extravagance of his mortal system I find {{something}} akin to the <b>immateriality</b> of a ghost. And then that ridiculous old story darted into my mind, how that Byron died of fever at Missolonghi, above twenty years ago. More and more I recognize that we dwell in a world of shadows; and, for my part, I hold it hardly worth the trouble to attempt a distinction between shadows in the mind and shadows out of it. If there be any difference, the former are rather the more substantial.|$|E
60|$|I {{was so far}} in my {{reflections}} when, as I have said, a {{side light}} began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to perceive more deeply {{than it has ever}} yet been stated, the trembling <b>immateriality,</b> the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul.|$|E
60|$|Few pastimes {{are more}} {{delightful}} than tossing pebbles into some still, dark pool, {{and watching the}} ripples that rise responsive, as they run in ever widening circles to the shore. Most of us have felt its fascination second only {{to that of the}} dotted spiral of the skipping-stone, a fascination not outgrown with years. There is something singularly attractive in the subtle force that for a moment sways each particle only to pass on to the next, a motion mysterious in its <b>immateriality.</b> Some such pleasure must be theirs who have thrown their thoughts into the hearts of men, and seen them spread in waves of feeling, whose sphere time widens through the world. For like the mobile water is the mind of man,--quick to catch emotions, quick to transmit them. Of all waves of feeling, this is not the least true of religious ones, that, starting from their birthplace, pass out to stir others, who have but humanity in common with those who professed them first. Like the ripples in the pool, they leave their initial converts to sink back again into comparative quiescence, as they advance to throw into sudden tremors hordes of outer barbarians. In both of the great religions in question this wave propagation has been most marked, only the direction it took differed. Christianity went westward; Buddhism travelled east. Proselytes in Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy find counterparts in Eastern India, Burmah, and Thibet. Eventually the taught surpassed their teachers both in zeal and numbers. Jerusalem and Benares at last gave place to Rome and Lassa as sacerdotal centres. Still the movement journeyed on. Popes and Lhamas remained where their predecessors had founded sees, but the tide of belief surged past them in its irresistible advance. Farther yet from where each faith began are to be found to-day the greater part of its adherents. The home that the Western hemisphere seems to promise to the one, the extreme Orient affords the other. As Roman Catholicism now looks to America for its strength, so Buddhism to-day finds its worshippers chiefly in China and Japan.|$|E
6000|$|Sixthly, From all {{which it}} is evident, that the EXTENT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE comes not only short {{of the reality of}} things, but even of the extent of our own ideas. Though our {{knowledge}} be limited to our ideas, and cannot exceed them either in extent or perfection; and though these be very narrow bounds, in respect of the extent of All-being, and far short of what we may justly imagine to be in some even created understandings, not tied down to the dull and narrow information that is to be received from some few, and not very acute, ways of perception, such as are our senses; yet it would be well with us if our knowledge were but as large as our ideas, and there were not many doubts and inquiries CONCERNING THE IDEAS WE HAVE, whereof we are not, nor I believe ever shall be in this world resolved. Nevertheless, I do not question but that human knowledge, under the present circumstances of our beings and constitutions, may be carried much further than it has hitherto been, if men would sincerely, and with freedom of mind, employ all that industry and labour of thought, in improving the means of discovering truth, which they do for the colouring or support of falsehood, to maintain a system, interest, or party they are once engaged in. But yet after all, I think I may, without injury to human perfection, be confident, that our knowledge would never reach to all we might desire to know concerning those ideas we have; nor be able to surmount all the difficulties, and resolve all the questions that might arise concerning any of them. We have the ideas of a SQUARE, a CIRCLE, and EQUALITY; and yet, perhaps, shall never {{be able to find a}} circle equal to a square, and certainly know that it is so. We have the ideas of MATTER and THINKING, but possibly shall never be able to know whether [any mere material being] thinks or no; it being impossible for us, by the contemplation of our own ideas, without revelation, to discover whether Omnipotency has not given to some systems of matter, fitly disposed, a power to perceive and think, or else joined and fixed to matter, so disposed, a thinking immaterial substance: it being, in respect of our notions, not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that GOD can, if he pleases, superadd to matter A FACULTY OF THINKING, than that he should superadd to it ANOTHER SUBSTANCE WITH A FACULTY OF THINKING; since we know not wherein thinking consists, nor to what sort of substances the Almighty has been pleased to give that power, which cannot be in any created being, but merely by the good pleasure and bounty of the Creator. For I see no contradiction in it, that the first Eternal thinking Being, or Omnipotent Spirit, should, if he pleased, give to certain systems of created senseless matter, put together as he thinks fit, some degrees of sense, perception, and thought: though, as I think I have proved, lib. iv. ch. 10, Section 14, &c., it is no less than a contradiction to suppose matter (which is evidently in its own nature void of sense and thought) should be that Eternal first-thinking Being. What certainty of knowledge can any one have, that some perceptions, such as, v. g., pleasure and pain, should not be in some bodies themselves, after a certain manner modified and moved, as well as that they should be in an immaterial substance, upon the motion of the parts of body: Body, as far as we can conceive, being able only to strike and affect body, and motion, according to the utmost reach of our ideas, being able to produce nothing but motion; so that when we allow it to produce pleasure or pain, or the idea of a colour or sound, we are fain to quit our reason, go beyond our ideas, and attribute it wholly to the good pleasure of our Maker. For, since we must allow He has annexed effects to motion which we can no way conceive motion able to produce, what reason have we to conclude that He could not order them as well to be produced in a subject we cannot conceive capable of them, as well as in a subject we cannot conceive the motion of matter can any way operate upon? I say not this, that I would any way lessen the belief of the soul's immateriality: I am not here speaking of probability, but knowledge, and I think not only that it becomes the modesty of philosophy not to pronounce magisterially, where we want that evidence that can produce knowledge; but also, that it is of use to us to discern how far our knowledge does reach; for the state we are at present in, not being that of vision, we must in many things content ourselves with faith and probability: and in the present question, about the <b>Immateriality</b> of the Soul, if our faculties cannot arrive at demonstrative certainty, we need not think it strange. All the great ends of morality and religion are well enough secured, without philosophical proofs of the soul's immateriality; since it is evident, that he who made us at the beginning to subsist here, sensible intelligent beings, and for several years continued us in such a state, can and will restore us to the like state of sensibility in another world, and make us capable there to receive the retribution he has designed to men, according to their doings in this life. [And therefore it is not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other, as some, over-zealous for or against the <b>immateriality</b> of the soul, have been forward to make the world believe. Who, either on the one side, indulging too much their thoughts immersed altogether in matter, can allow no existence to what is not material: or who, on the other side, finding not COGITATION within the natural powers of matter, examined over and over again by the utmost intention of mind, have the confidence to conclude--That Omnipotency itself cannot give perception and thought to a substance which has the modification of solidity. He that considers how hardly sensation is, in our thoughts, reconcilable to extended matter; or existence to anything that has no extension at all, will confess that he is very far from certainly knowing what his soul is. It is a point which seems to me to be put out of the reach of our knowledge: and he who will give himself leave to consider freely, and look into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis, will scarce find his reason able to determine him fixedly for or against the soul's materiality. Since, on which side soever he views it, either as an UNEXTENDED SUBSTANCE, or as a THINKING EXTENDED MATTER, the difficulty to conceive either will, whilst either alone is in his thoughts, still drive him to the contrary side. An unfair way which some men take with themselves: who, because of the inconceivableness of something they find in one, throw themselves violently into the contrary hypothesis, though altogether as unintelligible to an unbiassed understanding. This serves not only to show the weakness and the scantiness of our knowledge, but the insignificant triumph of such sort of arguments; which, drawn from our own views, may satisfy us that we can find no certainty on one side of the question: but do not at all thereby help us to truth by running into the opposite opinion; which, on examination, will be found clogged with equal difficulties. For what safety, what advantage to any one is it, for the avoiding the seeming absurdities, and to him unsurmountable rubs, he meets with in one opinion, to take refuge in the contrary, which is built on something altogether as inexplicable, and as far remote from his comprehension? It is past controversy, that we have in us SOMETHING that thinks; our very doubts about what it is, confirm the certainty of its being, though we must content ourselves in the ignorance of what KIND of being it is: and it is in vain to go about to be sceptical in this, as it is unreasonable in most other cases to be positive against the being of anything, because we cannot comprehend its nature. For I would fain know what substance exists, that has not something in it which manifestly baffles our understandings. Other spirits, who see and know the nature and inward constitution of things, how much must they exceed us in knowledge? To which, if we add larger comprehension, which enables them at one glance to see the connexion and agreement of very many ideas, and readily supplies to them the intermediate proofs, which we by single and slow steps, and long poring in the dark, hardly at last find out, and are often ready to forget one before we have hunted out another; we may guess at some part of the happiness of superior ranks of spirits, who have a quicker and more penetrating sight, as well as a larger field of knowledge.] ...|$|E
