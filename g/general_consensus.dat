5|$|There is a <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> {{that the}} {{cerebellum}} {{is involved in}} pain processing. The cerebellum receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar pathways, through the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the motor system inducing a conscious motor avoidance of pain, graded according to pain intensity.|$|E

Their other colleagues have remained low profile and refused comment.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as evidence of great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E

5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} of bulk silicate Earth (mantle and crust) {{has been estimated}} from three <b>general</b> <b>consensuses.</b> (1) The Sun, planets and meteorites {{of the solar system}} are related in composition since they were very probably derived via the same set of nucleosynthetic events. (2) The Earth was formed from accretion (condensation) of solar dust. (3) The Earth was then differentiated into a metal core and a silicate outer portion, which is sometimes referred to as the “primitive mantle ” (Fig. 1 a.). This silicate Earth or “primitive mantle ” is, therefore, composed of “lithophile elements ” (elements concentrated in silicate phases) with relative abundances similar to that of chondritic values...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we extend {{and analyze the}} dis-tributed dual {{averaging}} algorithm [1] to handle communication delays and <b>general</b> stochastic <b>consensus</b> protocols. Assuming each network link experiences some fixed bounded delay, we show that distributed dual averaging converges and the error decays at a rate O(T− 0. 5) where T {{is the number of}} iterations. This bound is an improvement over [1] by a logarithmic factor in T for networks of fixed size. Finally, we extend the algorithm to the case of using <b>general</b> non-averaging <b>consensus</b> protocols. We prove that the bias introduced in the optimization can be removed by a simple correction term that depends on the stationary distribution of the consensus matrix. I...|$|R
5|$|Before {{releasing}} the film, Madonna invited {{a group of}} friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. <b>General</b> <b>consensus</b> was that there was too much of Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided to prune those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures gave Spider-Man 3 a US {{release on}} May 4, 2007. The film begins with Peter Parker basking in his success as Spider-Man before an {{extraterrestrial}} symbiote takes control of him. Peter must then battle a rival photographer that the symbiote then takes control of (Topher Grace) and the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). The <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> among critics {{was that the}} final installment was not as refined as the first two entries, with it being criticized for its excessive use of villains, romantic conflicts and weak plot points. Nonetheless, Spider-Man 3 surpassed the previous two films' openings, making $151 million at over 4,250 locations.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{introduced}} the Latin script, {{which was used}} to record {{a large body of}} Aztec prose, poetry and mundane documentation such as testaments, administrative documents, legal letters, etc. In a matter of decades pictorial writing was completely replaced with the Latin alphabet. No standardized Latin orthography has been developed for Nahuatl, and no <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> has arisen for the representation of many sounds in Nahuatl that are lacking in Spanish, such as long vowels and the glottal stop. The orthography most accurately representing the phonemes of Nahuatl was developed in the 17th century by the Jesuit Horacio Carochi, building on the insights of another Jesuit, Antonio del Rincon. Carochi's orthography used two different diacritics: a macron to represent long vowels and a grave for the saltillo, and sometimes an acute accent for short vowels. This orthography did not achieve a wide following outside of the Jesuit community.|$|E

5|$|There is a <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> among historians that Bhimsen was not {{behind the}} poisoning. Bhimsen {{had nothing to}} gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the {{accusation}} was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen's imprisonment. It was a general practice among the physicians of the time to check {{the strength of their}} medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their new born. It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her new born. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth.|$|E
5|$|At the conference, {{in light}} of the little {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E
5|$|British {{policy-makers}} regarded Portugal as {{a traditional}} friend—the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance dated back to 1386, and both countries were in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Free Trade Association—but the combined strength of the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby in the United Nations forced the British to peel back {{their support for the}} pluricontinental Estado Novo ("New State") during the early 1960s. Portugal's Colonial War, starting in Angola in 1961, pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its African territories, most of which subscribed to communist political thinking. Britain opposed communist encroachment into southern Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly opposed <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> at the UN, which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist-backed insurgencies across the region, regarding them as racial liberation movements. It therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose Portugal without meaningfully doing so.|$|E

5|$|The British government's {{refusal to}} grant {{independence}} to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely {{the result of}} the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> in the post-colonial UN—particularly the General Assembly, where the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black nationalist insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the Cold War, Britain opposed the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), even maintaining the status quo became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve a}} {{harmonious}} visual look, producer designer Hans Bacher and art director Ric Sluiter, along with Robert Walker and Head of Backgrounds Robert Stanton collaborated {{to establish a}} proper chronological location for the film in Chinese history. Since there was no <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> {{on the time of}} Mulan's existence, they based on the visual design on the Ming and Qing dynasties. An important element of Bacher's design was to turn the art style closer to Chinese painting, with watercolor and simpler design, as opposed to the details of The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Bacher further studied more than thirty-five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism, British and American epics of the 1950s and 60s, and the spaghetti westerns for inspiration for composition, lighting, and staging that would establish settings that enhanced the characters, and additional inspiration was found in the earlier Disney animated films such as Bambi, Pinocchio, and Dumbo to establish a sense of staging.|$|E
