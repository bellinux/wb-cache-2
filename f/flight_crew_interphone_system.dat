50|$|Neither <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> member {{conformed}} to the instructions about <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> responsibilities during a visual approach, as {{published in the}} COM.

Neither <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> member {{conformed to}} the instructions about <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> coordination, as also outlined in the COM. Had they more carefully planned the second approach, and closely cooperated with each other, they may have achieved a safe approach and landing.

40|$|Abstract. When a <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> has {{situation}} awareness {{they have a}} complete and accurate understanding of the physical, temporal and emotional environments {{in which they are}} situated. This allows the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to interpret and evaluate elements or events in the environment in which they are situated and determine the risks associated with these events and an appropriate strategy to minimize and manage these risks. This paper describes the architecture for an intelligent software agent which assesses a <b>flight</b> <b>crew’s</b> {{situation awareness}} through the observation of a pilot’s eye movements. The agent perceives pilot behavior using a proprietary eye tracking device. This behavior is compared to a behavior database to decide whether the behavior of the pilot is appropriate or inappropriate in terms of the safety of the <b>flight.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> is alerted if the behavior is judged to be consistent with the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> losing situation awareness...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> {{was unable}} to regain control due to airspeed, {{inverted}} nose-down position, and insufficient altitude. The <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> did manage to reduce the angle of descent from 45° to 40° before hitting the ground at over 300 mi/h km/h.|$|R
40|$|When a <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> has {{situation}} awareness {{they have a}} perception and cognition of {{the physical and emotional}} environments in which they are situated that is an accurate representation of the actual physical and emotional environment. This allows the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to interpret and evaluate the situation they are in and determine the risks associated with that situation and an appropriate course of action to minimize or manage these risks. Further, it allows the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to make valid predictions of potential future situations. This paper will present two examples where <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> have lost {{situation awareness}} and describe a situation awareness agent being developed as part of the KES/AERO Lab collaboration. ...|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances. Contributing to the accident were (1) {{the complexities of the}} autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) the <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and (5) <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> fatigue, which likely degraded their performance.|$|R

50|$|Like the NTSB, the JCAA also {{recommended}} that <b>flight</b> <b>crews</b> {{be required to}} perform arrival landing distance assessments which include a conservative safety margin before every landing, and that actions {{should be taken to}} require appropriate <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> guidance and training regarding tailwind landings.|$|R

50|$|The {{meteorological}} conditions were good as Flight 365 approached Phuket International Airport. As they prepared to land, the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of <b>Flight</b> 365 {{expressed concern about}} a Dragonair Boeing 737 that was also landing at the airport but behind and below their aircraft. A lapse in concentration by the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> occurred allowing the speed of Flight 365 to fall below the minimum limit.

50|$|The report {{stated that}} the crash {{resulted}} from the <b>flight</b> <b>crew’s</b> inability to control the aircraft in alternate law. The cracking of a solder joint resulted in {{the failure of the}} Rudder Travel Limiter Unit four times during the <b>flight.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> action to the first three faults was in accordance with the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor messages. Following the fourth fault, the Flight Augmentation Computer's circuit breakers were reset by the <b>flight</b> <b>crew,</b> resulting in electrical interruption to the computers causing the autopilot to disengage and the flight control logic to change to Alternate Law. The rudder deflected 2 degrees to the left, causing the aircraft to roll up to 54 degrees. Subsequent <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> actions resulted in the aircraft entering a prolonged stall from which they were unable to recover.|$|R
