5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> inconsistently treated in {{extensive}} debates of Hindu literature. In some Hindu texts, certain sins and intentional acts are debated as naturally unforgivable; for example, murder and rape; these ancient scholars argue whether blanket <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> morally justifiable in every circumstance, and whether forgiveness encourages crime, disrespect, social disorder and people not taking you seriously. Other ancient Hindu texts highlight that <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> not same as reconciliation.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{personality}} and situational variables that influence forgiveness. The relations between empathy and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>were</b> studied, {{followed by the}} examination of the relation of these two variables to the Big Five personality traits, as well as honesty, absorption, the propensity to mystical experiences, and dissociation. Empathy was then tested as a mediating variable between the personality variables and forgiveness. Empathy and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>were</b> then studied in relation to childhood maltreatment. Finally, the effects of six different motivations to forgive were examined in relation to the personality variables. Participants were 142 undergraduate students recruited from the ftrst year psychology class at Brock University; 75 % were either 18 or 19 years of age, and 84 % were female. All of the variables were measured using self-report questionnaires. The relation between empathy and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>was</b> only partially replicated. In terms of personality, <b>forgiveness</b> <b>was</b> found to be related to honesty, emotionality, and agreeableness. Empathy at least partially mediated the relations between forgiveness and agreeableness, honesty and emotionality. Childhood maltreatment was negatively related to forgiveness, and positively related to openness to experience, absorption, and dissociation from reality, but not to the propensity for mystical experiences. Six different motivations for forgiveness emerged from an exploratory factor analysis. Out of these, Forgiveness to Promote Reconciliation was related to emotionality and dispositional empathy. Religious <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>was</b> related to honesty, emotionality, and mystical experiences. Forgiveness to Feel Better was related to honesty, emotionality, agreeableness, conscientiousness, absorption, mystical experiences, and empathy. Forgiveness to Assert Moral Superiority over the Injurer was negatively related to honesty, empathy, and positively related to extraversion. Forgiveness out of Fear was related to agreeableness. Finally, Altruistic <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>was</b> related to honesty, emotionality, and agreeableness, absorption and the propensity to mystical experiences. Altruistic Forgiveness correlated most highly with all the measures of forgiveness, followed by Forgiveness to Feel better.

25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> further refined in Hinduism by rhetorically {{contrasting}} it in feminine and masculine form. In feminine form, {{one form of}} <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> explained through Lakshmi (called Goddess Sri {{in some parts of}} India); the other form is explained in the masculine form through her husband Vishnu. Feminine Lakshmi forgives even when the one who does wrong does not repent. Masculine Vishnu, on the other hand, forgives only when the wrong doer repents. In Hinduism, the feminine forgiveness granted without repentance by Laskmi is higher and more noble than the masculine forgiveness granted only after there is repentance. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Sita - the wife of King Rama - is symbolically eulogized for forgiving a crow even as it harms her. Later in the epic Ramayana, she is eulogized again for forgiving those who harass her while she has been kidnapped in Lanka. Many other Hindu stories discuss forgiveness with or without repentance.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei {{believes}} abrogation in Quranic verses is not {{an indication}} of contradiction but an indication of addition and supplementation.

He also mentions 4:15 where the abrogated verse indicates its temporariness.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{criticism}} of penal substitution {{raised by the}} moral influence perspective concerns God's forgiveness. The moral influence framework depicts God as concerned about only {{the present and future}} states of people's moral character, and not their past states. God desires people to become more loving. When people truly change, God is no longer concerned with their previous character and thus is willing to freely forgive their previous actions. The moral influence framework thus teaches that God's <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> free and conditional only on repentance (i.e. moral change). This link between repentance and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> well-attested to in the New Testament. By contrast, moral influence advocates argue that the penal substitutionary theory portrays God as unable or unwilling to forgive wrong actions and requiring that there be full and complete punishment for all past wrongs, regardless of repentance. They often critique this idea on biblical grounds, pointing to numerous biblical instances of forgiveness and verses that appear to teach that forgiveness depends on repentance. Many also argue that penal substitution's depiction of God as demanding full punishment for every crime regardless of repentance is morally reprehensible and does not reflect a loving, forgiving God.|$|E

It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1002 /jclp. 20367 Metadata only entryThe present study investigated forgiveness in a traditional cognitive model of stress appraisal and coping and in a more recent model that includes the construct of low control stressors. One-hundred sixty six men and 168 women completed measures of forgiveness, primary stress appraisals, and coping strategies. For men, <b>forgiveness</b> <b>was</b> found to be positively {{associated with the use}} of challenge appraisals, and negatively {{associated with the use of}} loss appraisals and emotion-focused coping. For women, <b>forgiveness</b> <b>was</b> found to be positively associated with emotion-focused coping and acceptance, and negatively associated with avoidance. The results for women indicate that when <b>forgiveness</b> situations <b>are</b> conceptualized as low-control stressors, we are able to explain the relationships between forgiveness, appraisal, and coping. The results for men are broadly in line with a more traditional model of coping, which does not consider the construct of low control.

25|$|The {{theological}} {{basis for}} forgiveness in Hinduism {{is that a}} person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, of anger and unresolved emotions that affect his or her present as well as future. In Hinduism, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else. <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.|$|E
25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and {{letting go of the}} harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E
25|$|According to Catholic teaching, perfect contrition, {{coupled with}} a firm {{resolution}} to sin no more, can restore a person's relationship with God, as well as God's saving grace. Under ordinary circumstances this takes place through absolution, which is received during the Sacrament of Penance. However, as God's mercy and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> not bound by the Sacrament of Penance, under extraordinary circumstances a mortal sin can be remitted through imperfect contrition, which is a human act that arises from a person's love of God. When perfect contrition is {{the means by which}} one seeks to restore one's relationship with God, there must also be a resolution to confess all mortal sins (that have not been confessed and absolved previously) in the Sacrament of Penance. A resolution to confess these sins should be made with an act of perfect contrition, {{regardless of whether or not}} a person believes that they will have access to the Sacrament of Penance.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: : Attitudes toward {{guilt and}} <b>forgiveness</b> may <b>be</b> {{important}} factors determining distress in cancer patients. Direct comparative studies {{in patients with}} different life expectancies exploring attitudes toward guilt and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>are</b> lacking. Also, sociodemographic and religious characteristics determining the attitudes toward guilt and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>are</b> unknown. OBJECTIVE: : The objective {{of this study was}} to compare attitudes toward guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients. METHODS: : A descriptive research design was used. Ninety-seven patients without evidence of disease and 55 advanced cancer patients filled out the Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument and the Forgiveness of Others Scale. RESULTS: : Both groups had an attitude of nonreligious guilt and forgiveness, but not of religious guilt. No significant differences in attitudes toward guilt and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>were</b> observed between the 2 groups. In contrast to sociodemographic characteristics, religious characteristics were relevant predictors for guilt and forgiveness. Significant differences in relations between images of God and attitudes toward guilt were observed between the 2 patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: : An attitude of nonreligious guilt and <b>forgiveness</b> <b>was</b> found in cancer patients, irrespective of the stage of disease. Religious characteristics were significantly associated with attitudes of guilt and forgiveness. This correlation differed in the early and the advanced setting of disease.

2500|$|Afw ( [...] {{is another}} term for {{forgiveness}} in Islam; it occurs 35 times in Quran, {{and in some}} Islamic theological studies, it is used interchangeably with ghufran. Afw means to pardon, to excuse for a fault or an offense. According to Muhammad Amanullah, forgiveness ('Afw) in Islam is derived from three wisdoms. First {{and the most important}} wisdom of <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> that it is merciful when the victim or guardian of the victim accepts money instead of revenge. The second wisdom of <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> that it increases honor and prestige of the one who forgives. <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> not a sign of weakness, humiliation or dishonor. <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> honor, raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah, and enables a forgiver to enter paradise. The third wisdom of <b>forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> that according to some scholars, such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi, forgiveness expiates (kaffarah) the forgiver from the sins he or she may have committed at other occasions in life. <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>is</b> a form of charity (sadaqat).
