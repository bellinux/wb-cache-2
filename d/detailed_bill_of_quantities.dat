Smeaton again reviewed the plans in September, suggesting improvements to the foundations, and this was his last involvement with the scheme.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{awareness}} regarding carbon emissions and desirable reduction, this paper provides a calculator for the estimation of carbon footprint resulting from construction projects. For this purpose, we developed a software toolkit dubbed ‘Carbon Footprint Calculator for Construction Projects (CFCCP) ’ capable of building a complete construction material database of carbon emissions. This is accomplished by accounting for wide range variables including construction size, landscape, and material construction. This calculator yields more accurate estimates as compared with other recently introduced calculators which consider only the general inputs of a certain project and produce estimates within ± 25 % accuracy. In this paper, {{the cost of the}} accuracy is accomplished via quality library variables such as project design plan, <b>detailed</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> (BOQ), and schedule timeline. The tool automatically outputs a detailed report describing the tasks and their associated carbon emissions which enables managers to take corrective measures to minimize these emissions before the onset of the project. Although the focus of this paper is on construction projects, the utilization of CFCCP may also be extended to other project types if database files for the project material can be built. For example, potential applications may involve the design of green buildings given that these kinds of buildings typically utilize materials from distant sources resulting in noticeable increase in their initial carbon footprint.

The study was carried out using secondary data from some recently completed building projects within the Northern Ireland construction industry.

Results showed that the budgetary reliability <b>of</b> the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> seems to vary depending on project types. Whilst a deviation of - 3 to 4 % was obtained on housing projects analysed, the deviation on educational projects was between - 4 and 17 % whist on commercial project, it came out to be between - 20 and 20 % and in the case of refurbishment projects, a deviation of between - 11 and 37 % was obtained. This seems to suggest that the more complex a project is, the less reliable it is to use the BOQ to guarantee cost certainty...|$|R
40|$|In our master’s degree thesis we {{have dealt}} with {{and focused on the}} {{establishment}} of the standardization proposition for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> for the road superstructure according to the parametrization principle.

Each value defines separately the technology of the building, dimensions, material quality, transport and other characteristics, which are necessary for the formation <b>of</b> the <b>quantity</b> items. The standardization <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> is a constant process, as it must include all the modern characteristics and standards in the sense of correct technology definition, materials {{and the quality of the}} final product accordingly. Due to the ongoing development in different engineering industries, and the high numbers in the characteristic permutations, there still prevails the everlasting dilemma: what and how to include the most important characteristics of the final product into the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> in order for them to be still (and at the same time) accurate, flexible and manageable enough to enable the connection between the productive and manufacturing (<b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> and calculation) project model (plans, resources dynamics).

The thesis specifically {{deals with the}} estimated value of the public tender that may be published on the procurement portal. A questionnaire and statistical analysis are used to verify the impact of published estimates on the act of fixing the prices by suppliers. <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> (BoQ) is an essential part of the tender documentation and the basis for costing of construction works.

However, hysteresis quality of quota cannot timely reflect the current situations of market, causing the interface failure between the two modes, and even the failure of investment control. The paper, in light of foreign advanced experience and China’s national condition characteristics, puts forward the design philosophy of information data base of construction cost which is more suitable for valuation with bill quantity, which provides completed construction cost data as basis for the construction cost overall-process management based on <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity...</b>|$|R

40|$|Producing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> is a knowledge-based, {{dynamic and}} {{collaborative}} process, and evolves with variances and current evidence. However, {{within the context}} of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items’ signify the elements included in a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity,</b> including <b>details</b> <b>of</b> their description, <b>quantity</b> and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain use...|$|R
