40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was {{determine}} the influence of <b>honey</b> <b>harvesting</b> age {{in the area of the}} calliandra plant to diastase enzyme activity, hidroxymetilfurfural (HMF) and acidity. The method {{of this study was}} experiments (RAL) with 3 treatments and five replication. The observations of this study were P 1 (<b>honey</b> <b>harvested</b> in 11 days), P 2 (<b>honey</b> <b>harvested</b> in 14 days), and P 3 (<b>honey</b> <b>harvested</b> in 17 days). The variable in this study is the activity of diastase enzyme, hidroxymetilfurfural (HMF) and acidity. Data of this study were analyzed with the Range Analysis (ANOVA), if there is a significant difference between treatments, analysis of data was continued with the Smallest Real Difference Test (BNT). The results of this study showed that the <b>honey</b> <b>harvesting</b> age gave significant effect (p< 0. 01) on diastase enzymes activities, hidroxymetilfurfural and acidity. As a conclusion, <b>honey</b> <b>harvesting</b> age influences the quality of the activity of the diastase enzyme, hidroxymetilfurfural and acidity. The best content of diastase enzyme, was found in P 3 treatment that is generated in 17 th day of harvesting with the value 11. 12 DN due to it was longer in the nest before harvested. The best content of hidroximetilfurfural was found in P 3 with the value 4. 48 mg/kg and the best content of acidity honey was found in P 3 with the value 28. 42 NaOH/kg...|$|R

50|$|The {{key factor}} in this is the {{prevention}} or skillful management of the swarming impulse. If a colony swarms unexpectedly and the beekeeper does not manage to capture the resulting swarm, {{he is likely to}} harvest significantly less honey from that hive, since he has lost half his worker bees at a single stroke. If, however, he can use the swarming impulse to breed a new queen but keep all the bees in the colony together, he maximizes his chances of a good harvest. It takes many years of learning and experience to be able to manage all these aspects successfully, though owing to variable circumstances many beginners often achieve a good <b>honey</b> <b>harvest.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} honey stored within the central brood frames, the bees store surplus honey in combs above the brood nest.

5000|$|Prokopovych {{studied the}} biology of bee colonies and strove to improve {{existing}} methods of beekeeping. His main intention was to develop methods that allowed the least disturbance and damage to bees. These efforts resulted in 1814 in {{the invention of the}} world's first frame hive, which allowed an easier <b>honey</b> <b>harvest.</b> [...] Another invention was a wooden partition with apertures passable only by worker bees, now called a queen excluder. It made possible the harvest of pure honey from the frames. Prokopovych's inventions represented a landmark in the history of beekeeping and marked the beginning of commercial beekeeping. His scientific work resulted in more than sixty articles in printed media such as newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5000|$|In 1814 Petro Prokopovych {{invented the}} world's first frame hive, which allowed an easier <b>honey</b> <b>harvest.</b> Intermediate stages in hive design were {{recorded}} for example by Thomas Wildman in 1768/1770, who described advances over the destructive old skep-based beekeeping {{so that the}} bees {{no longer had to}} be killed to harvest the honey. Wildman, for example, fixed a parallel array of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive or skep (with a separate straw top to be fixed on later) [...] "so that there are in all seven bars of deal" [...] a 10 in [...] "to which the bees fix their combs". He also described using such hives in a multi-story configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers: he described adding (at the proper time) successive straw hives below, and eventually removing the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey, so that the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest for a following season. Wildman also described a further development, using hives with [...] "sliding frames" [...] for the bees to build their comb, foreshadowing more modern uses of movable-comb hives. Wildman acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de Reaumur - he included a lengthy translation of Reaumur's account of the natural history of bees - and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.|$|E
40|$|Forming of nucleus colonies is {{efficient}} {{method in}} growth control of Varroa destructor population. Its {{goal is to}} decrease parasite’s pressure on bee colony. The advantage of this bio-technical measurement lays in its implement during vegetation season which delays use of the chemical resources for Varroa destructor control population in beehives for the post major <b>honey</b> <b>harvest</b> period. Nucleus colonies were formed from approx. half of sealed brood (35. 5 ± 5. 8 dm²) and average of 5915 ± 912 bees. Results showed that there were 37. 2 ± 5. 6 % mites removed from parental colonies. Minimum was 30. 8 %, and maximum was 45. 5 %.

40|$|Protected areas cover 13 % of the world's {{terrestrial}} surface. With increasing {{demands on}} land and with challenges of land degradation and climate change, conflicts between conservation and use are on the rise, particularly in developing countries. Effective management of these conflicts requires viable livelihood options for local land users which {{are in line with}} nature conservation goals. Consolidation of nature conservation guidelines with local land use practices may be particularly challenging where keystone species are affected or where land uses have the potential for leading to ecosystem changes. This can be an issue even in ecosystems like savannahs, where fire largely defines ecosystem structure. The Miombo woodlands, covering around 2. 4 million km 2 of land, harbour important diversity and are crucial for livelihoods of around 75 million people in southern Africa. As a result of various pressures, cover and biomass of Miombo woodlands are declining throughout their range. <b>Honey</b> <b>harvesting</b> is an important land use in Miombo areas, both economically and culturally. Wild bees use cavities in trees for their colonies. Harvesting practices in some places include felling of trees with honeycombs to collect the honey and setting fire for pacifying bees. This leads to starvation and death of bee colonies. Given that most tree species are bee pollinated, trees with cavities colonised by wild bees can be classified as keystone elements in these ecosystems. Although ecologically far reaching, the effects of this harvesting practice on tree population structures in Miombo woodlands have seldom been studied. We characterised the ecological effects of destructive <b>harvesting</b> of wild <b>honey</b> on tree population structure and tree species distribution in Miombo woodlands in the Niassa wildlife reserve in Mozambique. The results show that forest structure and tree diversity differed along <b>honey</b> <b>harvesting</b> intensity gradients, with the highest number of fire tolerant tree species in areas with high <b>honey</b> <b>harvesting</b> intensity, which also showed the lowest tree regeneration density and Shannon diversity. Options for reconciling livelihoods with ecosystem maintenance do exist and include non-destructive harvesting based on climbing trees with locally produced ropes and leaving larval combs behind so the colony could continue to grow...|$|R
