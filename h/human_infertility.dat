5|$|Children of Men is a 2006 British-American dystopian thriller film {{directed}} and co-written by Alfonso Cuar√≥n. The screenplay, based on P. D. James' 1992 {{novel of the}} same name, was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of <b>human</b> <b>infertility</b> have left society {{on the brink of}} collapse. Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>humans,</b> <b>infertility</b> {{is one of}} the {{characteristics}} of individuals with mutational defects in the FANC genes. [...] In mice, spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, and spermatocytes in the meiotic stages of leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene are enriched for FANC proteins.

2500|$|In <b>humans,</b> <b>infertility</b> may {{describe}} {{a woman who}} is unable to conceive as well as being unable to carry a pregnancy to full term. [...] There are many biological and other causes of infertility, including some that medical intervention can treat. Estimates from 1997 suggest that worldwide [...] "between three and seven per cent of all [...] couples or women have an unresolved problem of infertility. Many more couples, however, experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year: estimates range from 12% to 28%." [...] 20-30% of infertility cases are due to male infertility, 20-35% are due to female infertility, and 25-40% are due to combined problems in both parts. In 10-20% of cases, no cause is found. The most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory problems which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods. Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.|$|R

The {{objective of the}} present study is to identify the gene underlying this phenotype. Results: In the present study, we refined the QTL position to a 5 Mb fragment encompassing only 11 genes. We showed that the low testis weight phenotype was due to kinetic alterations occurring during the first wave of the spermatogenesis where we could point out to an abnormal lengthening of spermatocyte prophase. We identify Fidgetin-like 1 (Fignl 1) as the gene underlying the phenotype, since if fulfilled both the physiological and molecular characteristics required. Indeed, amongst the 11 positional candidates it is the only gene that is expressed during meiosis at the spermatocyte stage, and that presents with non-synonymous coding variations differentiating the two mouse strains at the origin of the cross.

40|$|Abstract: Genetic lesions causing <b>human</b> male <b>infertility</b> are manifold. Besides gross {{chromosomal}} aneuploidies and rearrangements, microdeletions {{and single}} gene defects {{can interfere with}} male fertility. Male fertility is not only dependent on genes controlling the male germ line but also on genes of the networks functional for male gonad development and male somatic development, respectively. It is popular to unravel these netweorks with mouse gene knock-out mutants displaying reproductive defects. However, substantial arguments can be given for more functional studies directly on the human genes, because multiple reproductive proteins evolve quickly most likely for adopting to {{the specific needs of}} the species class. Prominent examples are mutations of the FSHR gene causing different pathologies in mouse and human and the DAZ gene family not found in the mouse genome but in the human genome with an essential male fertility function. Therefore this review is focussed on a comprehensive overview of human genes known with mutations causing male infertility (AR; AZF gene families; CFTR, DM- 1, DNAH gene family, FGFR 1, FSHR, INSL 3, KAL- 1, LGR 8 - GREAT, LHR, POLG). Then some human genes are described well recognised as functional in spermatogenesis and male fertility although gene specific mutations causing infertility were not yet identified (CREM, CDY 1, DAZL 1, PHGPx, PRM- 1, PRM- 2). They are designated as ‚Äúspermatogenesis phase marker ‚Äù or ‚Äúmale fertility index ‚Äù genes, because they are useful tools for diagnosing the patient¬¥s ¬¥ spermatogenesis disruption phase and for predicting the presence and quality of his mature sperms.
