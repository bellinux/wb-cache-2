5000|$|George was {{occasionally}} floated as {{a candidate}} for justice of the United States Supreme Court as a conservative acceptable to Democrats, such as when Democratic United States Senator Barbara Boxer suggested George as a potential nominee for the seat on the Court vacated by Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> retirement. Boxer described both George and his fellow California Supreme Court Justice Kathryn Werdegar, as Republicans who [...] "reflect the spirit of Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> tenureindependent and nonideological." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor</b> and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor</b> wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{agreed with}} {{the finding that the}} state court's decision was reasonable.

5|$|On July 12, 2005, {{while in}} South Africa, Bush {{suggested}} her husband replace retiring Supreme Court justice Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor</b> with another woman.

50|$|This {{opinion was}} joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas; Breyer filed a {{separate}} opinion concurring in the plurality's judgment. It is perceived as undermining the legacy of Justice Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> contribution to American jurisprudence by the majority's rejection of the Lemon test as announced in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Several books have since {{been written about the}} case.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{postponed}} {{ruling on}} whether it had jurisdiction while it considered {{the merits of the}} case. In April 1984 it handed down its 7-2 decision.

Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> dissent was joined by William Rehnquist, who had himself written a pointed dissent in Cone.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, the {{law school}} {{established}} the Center for Dispute Resolution, an alternative dispute resolution program. In 1992, the Collins Legal Center went through an award-winning renovation and expansion that ended with a dedication ceremony and speech by former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O’Connor.</b> In her dedication speech, O'Connor advocated for civility among those in the legal profession and for avoiding personal attacks among lawyers. In December 2005, the school's moot courtroom was used for a real civil trial after the Marion County Courthouse was damaged the previous month.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Building {{is at the}} {{intersection}} of Van Buren Street and First Avenue downtown, and contains various federal field offices and the local division of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. This building formerly housed the U.S. District Court offices and courtrooms, but these were moved in 2001 to the new Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor</b> U.S. Courthouse. Before the construction of this building in 1961, federal government offices were housed in the historic U.S. Post Office on Central Avenue, completed in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court had allowed the same suit to proceed by {{unanimously}} holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the claim. Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor.</b>|$|E
50|$|O'Connor {{returned}} to the United States and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. There he joined {{the law firm of}} Fennemore, Craig, von Ammon, McClennen & Udall.

5000|$|Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (2006). Planned Parenthood et al. {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} a New Hampshire parental notification law related to access to abortion. In Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> final decision before retirement, the Supreme Court sent the case back to lower courts with instructions to seek a remedy short of wholesale invalidation of the statute. New Hampshire ended up repealing the statute via the legislative process.|$|R
5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor,</b> joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity. The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor,</b> 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor, 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, is excluded.|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor</b> to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E
50|$|The {{court found}} that the former {{legislative}} leaders lacked standing, but that that authority had passed by design to the current leaders of the New Jersey legislature. Justice Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> majority decision was joined by six other justices, with Justice Byron White writing a concurring opinion. There was no ninth vote, as Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. had resigned earlier in the year, and no replacement had yet been confirmed.|$|R
25|$|Aside from Roe v. Wade, notable {{majority}} opinions {{written by}} Blackmun include Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia, and Stanton v. Stanton. He joined part of Justice Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey but also filed a separate opinion, warning that Roe was in jeopardy. He wrote dissenting opinions in notable {{cases such as}} Furman v. Georgia, Bowers v. Hardwick, and DeShaney v. Winnebago County.|$|R

5|$|O'Connor began {{competing}} internationally in {{the late}} 1970s, and in 1986 started riding with the US national eventing team, beginning with the Australian Gawler World Championships, mounted on Lutin V. She won multiple CCI3* events, including the Rolex Kentucky Three Day and the Fair Hill International, and the CCI4* at the 1999 Rolex event, riding Prince Panache. During the 1990s, O'Connor and her horse Biko were mainstays of the US eventing team, riding to multiple top-ten finishes at major international events, including the Badminton Horse Trials and the Rolex Kentucky Three <b>Day.</b> <b>O'Connor</b> rode at the 1994 World Equestrian Games and the 1998 World Equestrian Games, helping the US team to a bronze medal at the latter. At the 2006 World Equestrian Games she rode Upstage as an individual, but did not compete in the team portion of the event.|$|E
5|$|Ruth Bader Ginsburg (born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was {{appointed}} by President Bill Clinton and took {{the oath of office}} on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice to be confirmed to the Court (after Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor),</b> and one of four female justices to be confirmed (with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following Justice O'Connor's retirement, and prior to Justice Sotomayor joining the Court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the Court. Notable majority opinions Ginsburg has authored include United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.|$|E

5000|$|The {{compromise}} {{was further}} {{tested by the}} confirmation battle over the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy left by Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> retirement. Some Democratic Senators attempted a filibuster; however, the entire Gang of 14 voted for cloture, which passed by 72 to 24 (with 60 [...] "aye" [...] votes needed). Several members of the Gang of 14 then voted against confirming Alito, including Republican Lincoln Chafee.|$|R
50|$|Grant got {{his start}} on Arizona {{television}} by covering Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> Senate confirmation hearings for KAET Channel 8 and PBS. After the hearings, KAET producers came to Grant with a concept for a daily discussion show. The special Friday edition was to be modeled after Washington Week in Review. Known as the roundtable discussion, local journalists would review the week's top news stories in an informal, conversational format. Monday through Thursday's shows would focus on interviews with subjects close to a particular newsworthy event or issue.|$|R
2500|$|On June 26, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 6–3 {{decision}} in Lawrence v. Texas {{struck down the}} Texas same-sex sodomy law, ruling that this private sexual conduct is protected by the liberty rights implicit in the due process clause of the United States Constitution, with Sandra <b>Day</b> <b>O'Connor's</b> concurring opinion arguing that they violated equal protection. (See Sodomy law.) This {{decision in}}validated all [...] state sodomy laws insofar as they applied to noncommercial conduct in private between consenting civilians and overruled its 1986 ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick which upheld Georgia's sodomy law.|$|R
