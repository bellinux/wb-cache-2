5|$|Among the key {{indicators}} of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists which are generally east-west <b>in</b> <b>orientation.</b> These cemeteries are suspected, or {{known to be}} Christian, because of their proximity to a church, or because of Christian inscriptions found in them. They are found for {{between the end of}} the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland. Most scholars agree that the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. Most of these in Scotland are located in the south of the country. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to c. 450. In the east and north, Class II Pictish stones began to show Christian symbolism from the early eighth century.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. In Scotland {{most of these are}} located in the south of the country {{in the area of the}} British successor states that would be known as the Hen Ogledd, or the Old North. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to around 450. A slightly later stone at Kirkmadrine commemorates sacerdotes, which may be bishops. Among the key indicators of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists, which are generally east-west <b>in</b> <b>orientation,</b> like Christian graves. These cemeteries are suspected, or known to be Christian, because of their proximity to a church, or because they have Christian inscriptions. They are found from between the end of the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland. Writing in the sixth century, St. Patrick also mentioned Coroticus, who probably ruled from the fort at Dumbarton rock and who had already accepted Christianity. The poem Y Gododdin, set in the early sixth century and probably written in what is now Scotland, indicates that the warriors of Gododdin, probably a kingdom based the site of modern Edinburgh, were Christian, receiving communion and confessing their sins before battle.|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{orientation}} is usually {{considered to be}} determined in early life and stable {{in the course of}} adulthood. In contrast, some transgender individuals report a change <b>in</b> sexual <b>orientation.</b> A common reason for this phenomenon is not known. We included 115 transsexual persons (70 male-to-female "MtF" and 45 female-to-male "FtM") patients from our endocrine outpatient clinic, who completed a questionnaire, retrospectively evaluating the history of their gender transition phase. The questionnaire focused on sexual orientation and recalled time points of changes <b>in</b> sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>in</b> the context of transition. Participants were further asked to provide a personal concept for a potential change <b>in</b> sexual <b>orientation.</b> <b>In</b> total, 32. 9 % (n =  23) MtF reported a change <b>in</b> sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>in</b> contrast to 22. 2 % (n =  10) FtM transsexual persons (p =  0. 132). Out of these patients, 39. 1 % (MtF) and 60 % (FtM) reported a change <b>in</b> sexual <b>orientation</b> before having undergone any sex reassignment surgery. FtM that had initially been sexually oriented towards males ( = androphilic), {{were significantly more likely to}} report on a change <b>in</b> sexual <b>orientation</b> than gynephilic, analloerotic or bisexual FtM (p =  0. 012). Similarly, gynephilic MtF reported a change <b>in</b> sexual <b>orientation</b> more frequently than androphilic, analloerotic or bisexual MtF transsexual persons (p = 0. 05). In line with earlier reports, we reveal that a change <b>in</b> self-reported sexual <b>orientation</b> is frequent and does not solely occur in the context of particular transition events. Transsexual persons that are attracted by individuals of the opposite biological sex are more likely to change sexual orientation. Qualitative reports suggest that the individual's biography, autogynephilic and autoandrophilic sexual arousal, confusion before and after transitioning, social and self-acceptance, as well as concept of sexual orientation itself may explain this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Naming novel {{objects with}} novel count nouns changes how the objects {{are drawn from}} memory, {{revealing}} that object categorisation induces reliance on orientation-independent visual representations during longer-term remembering, but not during short-term remembering. Serial position effects integrate this finding with a more established conceptualisation of short-term and longer-term visual remembering in which the former is identified as keeping an item in mind. Adults were shown a series of four novel objects <b>in</b> <b>orientations</b> <b>in</b> which they would not normally be drawn from memory.

40|$|In this study, {{we aim to}} {{investigate}} whether motor commands, emanating from movement planning, are customized to movement orientation relative to gravity from the first trial on. Participants made fast point-to-point elbow flexions and extensions in the transverse plane. We compared movements that had been practiced <b>in</b> reclined <b>orientation</b> either against or with gravity with the same movement relative to the body axis made <b>in</b> the upright <b>orientation</b> (neutral compared to gravity). For each movement type, five rotations from reclined to upright orientation were made. For each rotation, we analyzed the first trial <b>in</b> upright <b>orientation</b> and the directly preceding trial <b>in</b> reclined <b>orientation.</b> Additionally, we analyzed the last five trials of a 30 -trial block in upright position and compared these trials with the first trials <b>in</b> upright <b>orientation.</b> Although participants moved fast, gravitational torques were substantial. The change <b>in</b> body <b>orientation</b> affected movement planning: we found a decrease in peak angular velocity {{and a decrease in}} amplitude for the first trials made <b>in</b> the upright <b>orientation,</b> regardless of whether the previous movements <b>in</b> reclined <b>orientation</b> were made against or with gravity. We found that these decreases disappeared after participants familiarized themselves with moving in upright position in a 30 -trial block. These results indicate that participants used a general strategy, corresponding to the strategy observed in situations with unreliable or limited information on external conditions. From this, we conclude that during movement planning, a priori knowledge of gravity was not used to specifically customize motor commands for the neutral gravity condition. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|R
