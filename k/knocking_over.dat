5|$|Eventually, Finn has enough, {{and knocks}} the king's clock from the wall. It crashes into the kingdom's huge stove, <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> {{a pot of}} water. The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm updraft going into the chimney to cease; this updraft was {{actually}} holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. The barge comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E
5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains and <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials {{try to stop the}} car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E
50|$|The player, using spin, {{launches}} {{the ball}} onto either {{the left or}} right long incline and to achieve a valid throw, has to <b>knock</b> <b>over</b> at least the small pin and one large pin.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a microphone positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> the microphone stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the same three dancers, whilst shots of men watching them are shown. Roberts then leads the three women through the hall before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in a small white room are shown, leading to a shot of Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook {{page that}} Red, the main protagonist of the game, would receive an ability {{in a new}} episode. On June 26, Rovio {{released}} a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design. On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> the pigs' castles, the player's goal {{is to keep the}} pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.|$|E

50|$|Any pin <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> {{is worth}} one point but {{if only the}} central pin is <b>knocked</b> <b>over,</b> two points are won. After having thrown three balls, the player passes over to the zona de birle. They are then allowed to bowl the three balls again from where they fell in the first throw, a move called birlar. If a ball comes to rest very close to two pins, a special move called segar in which the player <b>knocks</b> <b>over</b> the close pins while aiming for others.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} special {{combinations}} of pins <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> and {{path of the}} ball which can be worth up to 16 points (called ahorcada), for example if the ball touches down in the castro, only <b>knocks</b> <b>over</b> the miche and then comes to rest inside the parada.|$|R

25|$|In the past, {{there had}} been several occurrences of large non-school {{sponsored}} gatherings labeled as riots, where UMass officials had been called in. After the Red Sox won the World Series in 2013, an estimated 3,000 students gathered in the outdoor space around South West Residence Hall. In response to the situation, UMass police officials were called in. Police accounts state that some students participated in disruptive behavior: <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> trash bins and climbing trees. Rubber bullets and tear gas were dispersed into the crowds. According to WGGB, 14 people were arrested for failing to disperse and 1 for disorderly conduct. Whether or not the use of police force was necessary is still a controversial topic among students, the administration, and UMass and Amherst Police Department.|$|E

History repeated at the Eindhoven Marathon, where he entered as favourite but finished in fourth place. A personal best of 2:04:49 hours came in his first race of 2013 at the Dubai Marathon, but the quick pace of the race left him in third place, four seconds behind winner Lelisa Desisa.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when he latched onto a defence {{splitting}} pass from Jan Mølby to round Everton goalkeeper Bobby Mimms and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, Mølby was again {{at the heart of}} another attack. Picking the ball up inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for Craig Johnston to score. Liverpool were now 2–1 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when Ronnie Whelan led another attack. With the game stretched, he picked the ball up and drove towards the edge of the Everton area. Dalglish made a run across his path into space, but Whelan used it as a dummy and clipped an exquisite ball over three Everton defenders into the path of Rush who, from the angle of the six-yard area, thumped the ball past Mimms, <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> a camera in the process. Liverpool held on to win 3–1 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal. However, the ban on English clubs in European competition was continued, and Rush was unable to have a crack of winning another European Cup in 1986–87.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} to Hannah A. (née Morrow) and Robert C. Martin (a brick merchant) in New York City on June 6, 1883. He was the {{youngest}} of nine children (seven boys, two girls). The family home was then situated between 8th and 9th Ave., on 31st St. in Manhattan. The Martin clan moved way up to Central Harlem on Edgecombe Ave. in 1891. They relocated within Central Harlem, to 129th St. and 5th Ave. in 1898. They belonged to the 24th Street M.E. Church (till 1891) and Calvary M.E. Church (till 1908). Paul's father Robert was the superintendent of their Sunday schools. Martin immensely enjoyed drawing as a boy. He studied commercial art at the National Academy of Design in New York City from 1902-06 (summer only 1906). He began working for the New York Tribune around 1905. This led to a seven-year stint as its art manager. Martin and family members moved from Upper Manhattan to Maplewood, New Jersey in 1908. He started competing in sanctioned tennis tournaments one year later. Martin married Lauretta Willey in 1912. (Her brother would own the Willey Book Co.) Their first rented home was in the University Heights section of the Bronx in 1912. They relocated a block away in 1915. He was employed with the O. J. Gude Company and Gotham Studios from c.1915–20. These two were giants in the advertising world. Martin joined the Artists' Guild and went freelance in early 1921. Paul and Lauretta moved from the Bronx to a rural area of Millwood, New York, in 1925. Their first owned home doubled as a working studio (upper floor) from 1925 to 1932. Its centerpiece was a long flat-top table that held the canvases, drawing pads, paint brushes and tubes. Also nearby were art books, easels and props for photo shoots. He occasionally used family members as models. Uncle Paul's niece Edna is shown, writing down the license number of a boy's wagon (for <b>knocking</b> <b>over</b> her doll carriage), on the Liberty cover of September 12, 1925. She's also highlighted on an American Junior Red Cross poster. His mother-in-law is shown basting a turkey for Thanksgiving, on the People's Home Journal cover of November 1928.|$|E
