40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide some insights for developing a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university through democratizing the contemporary university management practices. The <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university has often the quality academic programs, quality teaching faculty members, and quality students for establishing high educational standards. The faculty of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> universities engages in <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> research and produce <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> and quantity of new knowledge and publications. The graduates of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> universities usually obtain <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> professional positions. They also generate the necessary physical and financial resources and endowments for supporting themselves. Those universities that develop these quality characteristics offer a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education. Democratization of the university management practices plays a key role for a university to develop a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education and become a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university. In this study, democratization process includes the ownership, the practice of sharing the authority and responsibility, group decision-making, horizontal network organizational structure and long term employment practices of university management. Those universities utilizing these practices together and acting collectively as a team are able to achieve a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education and become a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university. Democratization process will also help stakeholders of the university to establish close cooperation and relations with public and private institutions for financing the university...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} fitness {{consequences}} of foraging on patchy resources, consumption rates, growth rates and survivorship of Armadillidium vulgare were monitored while feeding in arenas {{in which the}} spatial distribution of patches of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food (powdered dicotyledonous leaf litter) was varied within a matrix of low quality food (powdered grass leaf litter). Predictions from behavioural experiments that these fitness correlates would be lower when <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food is more heterogeneously distributed in space were tested but not supported either by laboratory or field experiments. To investigate whether A. vulgare can develop the ability to relocate <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patches, changes in foraging behaviour, over a comparable time period to that used in the fitness experiments, were monitored in arenas {{in which there was}} a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patch in a low quality matrix. A. vulgare increased its ability to relocate the position of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food over time.

5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys.

However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques.
