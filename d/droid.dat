5|$|On Naboo, Padmé reveals {{herself to}} the Gungans as Queen Amidala, and persuades them into an {{alliance}} against the Trade Federation. Jar Jar leads his people in a battle against the <b>droid</b> army while Padmé leads the hunt for Viceroy Gunray in Theed. During a battle in a starship hangar to free Naboo pilots, Anakin takes shelter in a vacant starfighter, and inadvertently triggers its autopilot, joining the battle against the Federation <b>droid</b> control ship in space. Anakin blunders into the hangar of the <b>droid</b> control ship and destroys the ship from within before escaping, deactivating the <b>droid</b> army. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan battle Darth Maul, who mortally wounds Qui-Gon before being bisected by Obi-Wan. As he dies, Qui-Gon requests Obi-Wan to train Anakin. Subsequently, Palpatine is elected as the new Supreme Chancellor, and Gunray is arrested. The Jedi Council promotes Obi-Wan {{to the rank of}} Jedi Knight and reluctantly accepts Anakin as Obi-Wan's apprentice. Padmé presents a gift of appreciation and friendship to the Gungans at a festive ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Minifigures {{built from}} special, uniquely molded pieces were first {{introduced}} in Life on Mars. Martians {{are composed of}} five tools: two pairs of double arms, a mechanical torso, a conjoined leg piece, and a head. This configuration is also used for many Star Wars Droids; Battle <b>Droids</b> follow the same pattern, while Super Battle <b>Droids</b> feature a head fixed to a torso, General Grievous has space for four arms, and IG-88 has a head constructed of other Lego pieces. Other <b>droids,</b> such as Droidekas, Spider <b>Droids</b> and Pit <b>Droids,</b> are constructed entirely from standard Lego pieces, yet are still generally considered minifigures. R2-D2 and other astromech <b>droids</b> are constructed from unique parts, with a separate top, body and legs. The robots of Exo-Force, Mars Mission commander aliens and Bionicle miniatures have a design similar to the Star Wars Battle <b>Droids,</b> but with separate legs, movable hands, and a head affixed to a small torso.|$|R
5|$|Now {{in charge}} of the {{resistance}} on Naboo, Sykes leads a mission to liberate the Camp 4, a detention center where the Trade Federation has placed most of Naboo's important leaders.
