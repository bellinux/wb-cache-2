40|$|Previously we have {{described}} a mutant Hfr strain in which <b>incompatibility</b> <b>between</b> the integrated F factor and an autonomous F-prime (F') factor was abolished. The mutation (inc) {{was located in}} the integrated F factor. F-prime factors isolated from the mutant Hfr strain have the same incompatibility behavior as those isolated from normal Hfr strains. Reintegration of these F' factors into the chromosome restores the Inc- phenotype characteristic of the mutant Hfr. The inc mutation thus affects <b>incompatibility</b> <b>between</b> integrated F and autonomous F(Fi-Fa incompatibility) but not <b>incompatibility</b> <b>between</b> two autonomous F factors (Fa-Fa incompatibility). The implications of this finding for the mechanism of plasmid incompatibility are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the land management system and the town planning system {{play a crucial role}} in the process of land development, especially as Henan province is experiencing accelerated industrialization. In recent years, China has adjusted its land management system. The findings of the research show that the current land management system and town planning system of China are not compatible with each other when faced with the rapid industrialization of the core towns in Henan province. Furthermore, the <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>between</b> China’s current land management system and town planning system have impeded the growth of the industrial scale and raised the costs of industrialization. There are two main reasons which cause the <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>between</b> these two systems, namely the contrasting characteristics between the town planning system and land management system and the different objectives between the local governments and the central government of China. The <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>between</b> China’s town planning system and land management system are rooted in and shaped by the central-local relations...|$|R
40|$|This Technical Report is {{the second}} of a {{sequence}} of five reports that analyse {{the problem of the}} interoperability between the EDI and X. 509 worlds, and specify one possible solution in order to eliminate the barriers of communication between both certification infrastructures. This sequence of works have been structured in two parts. The first part is concentrated in the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>between</b> the UN/EDIFACT and X. 509 certificates, and the second in the interoperability between certification services. This report bellongs to the part related to the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>between</b> the UN/EDIFACT and X. 509 certificates. This part performs a technical analysis of the X. 509 and UN/EDIFACT certificates, identifies the <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>between</b> them, and brings a possible solution to this incompatibility specifying a mapping of each one of the certificate elements in both senses (from UN/EDIFACT to X. 509 and from UN/EDIFACT to X. 509).

40|$|Speciation {{often results}} from the {{accumulation}} of ``complementary genes,'' i. e., from genes that, while having no deleterious effect within species, cause inviability or sterility when brought together with genes from another species. Here I model speciation as the accumulation of genic <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>between</b> diverging populations. Several results are obtained. First, and most important, the number of genic <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>between</b> taxa increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular, the probability of speciation increases at least {{as fast as the}} square of the time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all hybrid incompatibilities must initially be asymmetric. Third, at loci that have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is ``easier'' to evolve complex hybrid incompatibilities requiring the simultaneous action of three or more loci than to evolve simple <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>between</b> pairs of genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses of speciation...|$|R
