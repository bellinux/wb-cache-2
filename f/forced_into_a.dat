5|$|Consequent to {{his defense}} of an African American who was <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> form of {{commercial}} slavery after incarceration, Black was befriended by A. O. Lane, a judge connected with the case. When Lane {{was elected to the}} Birmingham City Commission in 1911, he asked Black to serve as a police court judge, an experience that would be his only judicial experience prior to the Supreme Court. In 1912, Black resigned that seat in order to return to practicing law full-time. He was not done with public service; in 1914, he began a four-year term as the Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> more participatory role in the story development.

This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E

5|$|Having {{earned a}} first down with the final play of the first quarter, Drew Weatherford and the Florida State offense ran into {{difficulty}} as the second quarter began. An incomplete pass and a rush for no gain were followed by a false start penalty and another incomplete pass, and Florida State was forced to punt. Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26-yard line, but failed {{to capitalize on the}} defensive stop. Marcus Vick threw two incomplete passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> punt.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke {{has suggested that}} they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, makes it clear that the relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.|$|E

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Australian {{forces were}} heavily {{reinforced}} by the 7thDivision's 21st and 25th Brigades. Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, often forcibly, to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel, the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track. In early November, they had been <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua. Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November1942. The Allied force consisted of the exhausted 7thDivision and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32ndInfantry Division, and was short of artillery and supplies. Due {{to a lack of}} supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications. These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22January1943.|$|E
5|$|Between August 1994 and August 1995, two {{companies}} of the regiment, initially A Company, 2/4 RAR and then B Company, 2 RAR, {{served with the}} Australian contingent of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). From 20 to 23 April 1995, a 50-member detachment, including infantrymen from 5 Platoon, B Company, 2 RAR were forced to witness the Kibeho Massacre of around 4,000 Hutu refugees at the Kibeho camp {{by members of the}} Rwandan Patriotic Army. Vastly outnumbered and frustrated by a mandate that did not allow them to engage the perpetrators, the infantrymen were <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> passive role during the massacre. Throughout the incident, however, they worked under fire attempting to assist wounded refugees. Meanwhile, 8/9 RAR was disbanded in 1997 after the discontinuation of the Ready Reserve scheme.|$|E
5|$|I Airborne Corps {{became part}} of the First Allied Airborne Army, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton, in August 1944. While retaining command of the corps, Browning also became Deputy Commander of the Army, despite a poor relationship with Brereton and being disliked by many American officers, including Major General Ridgway, now commanding the newly created U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, in turn handing over the 82nd Airborne Division to Brigadier General Gavin. During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, due to differences in military culture, Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order. Browning was <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> humiliating backdown.|$|E

5|$|In 1700 Sweden was {{attacked}} {{by a coalition of}} Saxony, Russia, and Denmark–Norway. Saxony, under Augustus II, invaded Swedish oversea dominions in Livonia and quickly attacked the city of Riga. Meanwhile, Frederick IV of Denmark attacked the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp in order to secure his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under Peter I swept into Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. Unprepared for these developments, the Swedes were <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> war on three fronts.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Amadi {{signed with}} the Calgary Stampeders and joined the team {{in the middle of}} {{training}} camp. Amadi was initially considered unlikely to play a large role, but he was <b>forced</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> starting role after two knee injuries to starting defensive halfbacks Brandon Smith and J. R. Ruffin. Amadi struggled in his first starts for the Stampeders, but he improved as the season continued. He started in 11 consecutive games before being moved to the practice squad, where he remained {{for the rest of the}} season. Before being moved off the active roster, Amadi recorded 28 tackles, three pass deflections, and a sack. He later re-{{signed with the}} Stampeders but was released after suffering a strained quadriceps in the preseason. Amadi played for the Tulsa Talons of the AFL in 2010, recording 24 solo tackles, six tackle assists, seven pass breakups and one fumble recovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} after Burebista's death {{and between the}} rule of Domitian and Tiberius, Dacian {{activity}} was minimal.

The regional factions that remained posed no substantial threat to the Roman empire and the Roman sources themselves stop mentioning plans of Roman invasion during this time. Dacian power, resurged during the reigns of Duras – who reigned 68–87 AD – and peaked {{during the reign of}} Decebalus – who reigned from 85/87-106 AD. By this time the Dacian tribes had united once more, under the ruler of Decebalus, and again posed a threat to Rome.|$|E
