5|$|At the {{shipping}} yard, Dexter breaks into the container in the picture, {{only to find}} it full of bananas. Doakes appears and asks him what he is doing, and after a fist fight, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave. Doakes tells Dexter that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is up to something, and says {{that he will be}} watching him. Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and set him up. Rita becomes annoyed as Paul persists that Dexter is dangerous and should not be around their children. Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
25|$|The song is famously {{played in}} The Godfather Part II, at the New Year's Eve party in Cuba where Michael Corleone tells his brother Fredo Corleone that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> betrayed him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a jew whereas <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not.|$|R
60|$|And in {{that long}} kiss {{darkness}} came upon him again, and when again <b>he</b> was conscious <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was alone and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to die. He was wearily glad <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to die.|$|R
60|$|And {{still more}} {{secretly}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not refuse her.|$|R
25|$|In {{the process}} of {{escaping}} we learn about the fundamental modes of motion and introduce basic quantum concepts. The message scroll is partially damaged, so David does not know who the space commander is, but <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needs {{to get to the}} Cassini Space craft, because something bad will happen.|$|E
25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His stance is set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks {{to be full of}} anxiety as if <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E
60|$|Right {{then and}} there Whitefoot's heart was filled so full of {{something}} that {{it seemed as if}} it would burst. It was love. All in <b>that</b> instant <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had found the most wonderful thing in all the Great World, which of course is love. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> just couldn't live without little Miss Dainty.|$|R
60|$|It was sufficient. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did {{not require}} to press his point.|$|R
60|$|You see it {{was this}} way: Reddy's wits were working very fast there in Farmer Brown's henhouse. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had only a forlorn chance of {{escaping}} when Farmer Brown's boy should come to open the henhouse in the morning. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must {{make the most of}} <b>that</b> forlorn chance. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> freedom is a thousand times better than a full stomach.|$|R
25|$|Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) helps Rhys {{out of the}} marquee. Rhys {{insists that}} he has just hurt his ribs and since he is a doctor, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will be fine. Ajay finds Priya is unconscious; having been crushed by a heavy pot plant that has fallen on her abdomen. Karl has to {{resuscitate}} Priya, while Sonya and Rhys are taken to hospital. At the hospital, Rhys is checked over and Priya is brought in. Karl discreetly tells Rhys {{that she had to}} be resuscitated again in the ambulance. Rhys's mother comes to see him and he maintains that he is fine. Sonya has a bleed on the brain, but Toadie insists she will be okay. Ajay tries to get hold of Rani, but she ignores the calls. Kyle finds her and brings her to the hospital, where Ajay explains what happened. Rhys checks himself out of the hospital, against Karl's wishes. Rhys tells Kyle that he has decided to meet with his estranged father. As Kyle struggles with his ute's lock, he notices Rhys has collapsed. He calls out for help and Karl tries to revive Rhys, who has died from an undetected blood clot.|$|E
500|$|Steinberg {{next came}} up with the idea of showing Oguri moving through two busy Los Angeles intersections. The result is the 11-minute dance film [...] "Xing", which was {{screened}} in 2003 at the Getty Center during Dance Camera West. [...] "Nothing was choreographed beforehand. Oguri does not choreograph, he improvises. But the shots are very specific and the direction is very specific. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has to get from point A to point B, but I do not mind how." [...] Steinberg made her first feature-length documentary, Height of Sky, about Oguri, and it was shown on the Sundance Channel in 2008.|$|E
500|$|After {{the defeat}} of the look-alike bio-noid, the door to the interdimensional rift throws wide open, and Clancy appears, telling Ryu, Irene, and Foster that they were all used as pawns in his plan to take over the ruins and claim all the life energy as his. Foster tries to follow Clancy through the door, but the energy tears him apart and is destroyed. Ryu instructs Irene to stay behind while he goes through the rift into the subspace, as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will be {{protected}} from the power that is inside. Ryu encounters the look-alike bio-noid again while inside the subspace, who was resurrected and transmuted into a super creature. After he defeats the look-alike, Ryu is instantly teleported into a room, where he meets Clancy once again. He tells Ryu that he has already claimed the life energy as his and explains the truth behind Castle Rock– that the ruins are a dimensional warship called the [...] "Ancient Ship of Doom". He says that [...] "these super-dimensional ruins are the foundation upon which a new world will be created", and that it will now be where all new life will originate from. The ship reappears in the real world, and Clancy then fires a test shot from the ship into the distance to demonstrate its power, which Irene watches in horror. He then drops Ryu through a trap door to the outside of the ship.|$|E
60|$|Now, how did <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> <b>he</b> {{asked himself}} as he went down the stairs.|$|R
60|$|Yet all {{the while}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to be by himself, because he could thus be {{with the spirit of}} Ruth. And <b>he</b> <b>knew,</b> subconsciously, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to hurry back to Mineola and {{telephone}} to her.|$|R
60|$|But Steve, {{just because}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was wet and fancied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must look ridiculous, held his peace.|$|R
2500|$|Burton (1899) commented, that [...] "in the Baldwin Locomotive Works... {{piecework}} {{rates are}} seldom altered... Some rates have remained unchanged {{for the past}} twenty years, and a workman is there more highly esteemed when he can, by his own exertions and ability, increase his weekly earnings. He has an absolute incentive to increase his output {{as much as he}} possibly can, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not, by increasing his own income, lead to cutting piece-work rates, and so be forced to make still further exertions {{in order to maintain the}} same weekly wage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} kind of you," [...] said my mother, [...] "I would do {{anything}} to give him pleasure, anything-I could. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> understands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, mamma, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is welcome. If he {{had gone}} to America without writing to me--Oh, it would have been impossible! I should have gone after him." ...|$|E
60|$|Next moment <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not mad, for {{she said}} one word, only one, {{but it was}} enough.|$|R
60|$|She gave a {{contented}} little sigh, and let {{her head}} rest against his shoulder. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was forgiven.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{might have}} spoken more plainly without offence, {{when he saw}} Chisholm's smile, but the latter looked satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{something}} that he finds by experience does him good; and so learns to like it, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needs it, as my patients do my physic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will strike}} {{him to the}} ground, Mrs. Orme. I shall have murdered him. I {{do not think that}} he will live when <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is so disgraced." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again Clara was silent, {{not knowing}} how to answer that last question. And when she did answer it, she {{answered}} it thoughtlessly. [...] "Of course <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can do that." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} reply. In {{the depths of}} his miserable heart, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have loved her the same.|$|R
50|$|Example: (Matt. 26:36-46) Jesus {{was deeply}} grieved because <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> {{was going to}} be crucified. He was {{struggling}} with it.|$|R
60|$|Here Rollo {{began to}} look pretty sober. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had done what he had very often been {{forbidden}} to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{tongue of}} Attick is forked. He lies {{when he says}} that the {{daughter}} of Weeum agreed to follow him. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> carried her from the camp by force against her will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} know that," [...] replied Striped Chipmunk, [...] "but {{what we want}} to know is how he ever found out that he could fool people that way, and how <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will fool them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is {{in danger}} of losing his situation, and it is his {{endeavor}} to get me and my son in his power, so we will influence others to help him keep him in his place." ...|$|E
60|$|Brand hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was doing}} an unchivalrous thing, but the passion he {{hitherto}} had kept in check mastered him.|$|R
50|$|Enzo Williams {{spent his}} {{childhood}} weekends watching movies, {{and at the}} age of nine <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to become a filmmaker.|$|R
60|$|He walked on. Perhaps {{his cheeks}} paled {{and his lips}} were set close, because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was walking to his death.|$|R
