They noticed that the song had accumulated around 20 million plays on Spotify, which Clark initially presumed to be a mistake. Previously, [...] "Check Yes Juliet" [...] was the group's most popular song, selling 2,000 copies per week. [...] "Sad Song", however, was selling 3,000 copies per week. Clark called it [...] "so strange. [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> finding out that it happened and just being so blown away that for once in our career, we let our fans choose, kind of accidentally, which song {{we were going to}} go with." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] {{includes}} {{references to}} numerology in the lyrics [...] "If man is five/then the Devil is six/and God is seven". Francis later expanded on {{the significance of}} the lyrics in an interview to Alternative Press, saying [...] "It's a reference from what I understand to be Hebrew numerology, and I don't know a lot about it or any of it really. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> someone telling me of the supposed fact that in the Hebrew language, especially in the Bible, you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th. [...] I didn't go to the library and figure it out". The song's numerology is alluded to on the single's cover, which features figures of five, six and seven, and also a monkey with a halo.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} released by HBO for [...] "The Door", David Benioff and D. B. Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E

2500|$|Julie Fernandez, {{who later}} {{appeared}} in BBC television programmes Eldorado and The Office, {{was invited to}} a BBC studio to appear on Jim'll Fix It.

2500|$|On 20 November 1968, {{two days}} before the release of The Beatles, McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an {{exclusive}} interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs. Speaking of [...] "Helter Skelter", he said: [...] "Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hansen {{intended}} {{to record the}} album in late 2001, but due to the September 11 attacks, [...] "it {{took a while for}} people to line up." [...] Before working with Godrich, Beck recorded tracks with Dan [...] "The Automator" [...] Nakamura in January 2002 in preparation for the new record, but no songs from those sessions were used for Sea Change. Many songs, such as [...] "Lost Cause", were performed live prior to the album's recording. Another new song, [...] "Evil Things", was also performed and demoed but ultimately not recorded for the album, due to loss of time. Regarding the performances of more personal tracks in the days before Sea Change, Beck explained in a 2008 interview that [...] "Those were the kinds of songs I would play {{in the middle of the}} show. I'd try to throw a couple of them in. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> the audience kind of disregarding them, or moshing, or throwing things. Just because those were the kinds of persons that came out." ...|$|E
2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album. Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> feeling like that at a point in my life.

60|$|Beautiful and {{touching}} to me your conjoined appeal, with dear Clare's, but I beg {{you to see}} the matter in the clear and happy light when I say that I'm afraid it won't do and that the blest Babe must really be placed, on the threshhold of life (there should be but one h there--don't teach her to spell by me!) under some more valid and more charming protection than that of my accumulated and before long so concluding years. She mustn't be taken, for her first happy holiday, to visit her late godfather's tomb--as would certainly be the case were I to lend myself to the fond anachronism her too rosy-visioned parents so flatteringly propose. You see, dear Wilfred, I speak from a wealth of wisdom and experience--life has made me rather exceptionally acquainted with the godpaternal function (so successful an impostor would I seem to have been,) and it was long since brought home {{to me that the}} character takes more wearing and its duties more performing than I feel I have ever been able to give it. I have three godchildren living (for to some I have been fatal)--two daughters and a son; and my conscience tells me that I have long grossly neglected them. They write me--at considerable length sometimes, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> that I have one of their last sweet appeals still unanswered. This, dear Clare and dear Wilfred, is purely veracious history--a dark chapter in my life. Let me not add another--let me show at last a decent compunction. Let me not offer up a helpless and unconscious little career on the altar of my incompetence. Frankly, the lovely child should find at her font a younger and braver and nimbler presence, one that shall go on with her longer and become accessible to her personal knowledge. You will feel this together on easier reflection--just as you will see how my plea {{goes hand in hand with}} my deep appreciation of your exquisite confidence.|$|E
