500|$|The light curves for TypeIa {{are mostly}} very uniform, with a {{consistent}} maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity. [...] Their optical energy output {{is driven by}} radioactive decay of ejected nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days). These radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence. Studies of cosmology today rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the [...] "standard candles" [...] of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014. The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted. [...] The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but {{this is only a}} hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> and the ejecta become transparent to it. The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation. [...] After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the design and the {{realization}} of a new thermoelectric sensor (Seebeck), sensitive to the infrared radiations emitted by different sources.

The constantan track, covered with a resin of great absorptivity, collects the <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiations</b> and generates temperature gradients between the junction points of the first circuit.

However the attained degree of non-stoichiometry is limited and the sulfur-enriched layer at the surface relaxes spontaneously with the formation of stoichiometric PbS and sulfur species. Oxidized PbS surfaces adsorb xanthate from deoxidized solutions easily and fast, even if the oxidized lead species have been removed from the surface. The electrosorption of xanthate radicals driven by the oxidation of xanthate ions by the sulfur species present at the surface seems to be the most probable explanation of that behavior...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a combined dynamic atmosphere and maser propagation model of SiO maser emission in Mira variables. This model rectifies {{many of the}} defects of an earlier model of this type, particularly {{in relation to the}} <b>infra-red</b> (IR) <b>radiation</b> field generated by dust and various wavelength-dependent, optically thick layers. Modelled masers form in rings with radii consistent with those found in VLBI observations and with earlier models. This agreement requires the adoption of a radio photosphere of radius approximately twice that of the stellar photosphere, in agreement with observations. A radio photosphere of this size renders invisible certain maser sites with high amplification at low radii, and conceals high-velocity shocks, which are absent in radio continuum observations. The SiO masers are brightest at an optical phase of 0. 1 to 0. 25, which is consistent with observed phase-lags. Dust can have both mild and profound effects on the maser emission. Maser rings, a shock and the optically thick layer in the SiO pumping band at 8. 13 appear to be closely associated in three out of four phase samples. Comment: accepted by MNRAS, MN- 08 - 1478 -MJ.

Las radiaciones ultravioletas (UV) (&# 955;s de 200 - 400 nm) pueden dividirse: UVA (&# 955;s 315 - 400 nm); UVB (&# 955;s 280 - 315 nm) y UVC (&# 955;s The {{energy of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation {{is derived from}} the fusion in the sun of four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The sun radiates energy representing the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. All electromagnetic radiation has wave characteristics and travels at the same speed (c: speed of light). But radiations differ in wavelength (&# 955;). Light energy is transmitted not in a continuum stream but only in individual units or photons: E = h c/&# 955;. Short wave light is more energetic than photons of light of longer wavelength. Ultraviolet radiations (UV) (&# 955;s 200 - 400 nm) can be classified in UVA (&# 955;s 315 - 400 nm.); UVB (&# 955;s 280 - 315 nm) and UVC (&# 955;s < 280 nm). UVB and UVC are the most significant UV radiations to induce biological responses. Electromagnetic radiations on molecular oxygen lead to several reactive products known as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). High O 2 content in biological systems promotes ROS synthesis. If ROS are not controlled by endogenous antioxidants, cell redox status is affected and tissue damage is produced ("oxidative stress"). ROS induce lipid peroxidation, protein cross-linking, enzyme inhibition, loss of integrity and function of plasmatic and mitochondrial membranes conducing to inflammation, aging, carcinogenesis and cell death. While <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiations</b> lead to noticeable tissue temperature conducing to severe burns, UVA and UVB undercover react with skin chromophores producing photochemical alterations involved in cellular aging and cancer induction.
