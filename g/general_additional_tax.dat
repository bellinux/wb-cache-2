40|$|This note {{shows that}} residence- and source-based taxes on capital income are not {{sufficient}} to sustain an efficient Nash equilibrium when several goods are internationally traded, apart from two special cases. With several traded commodities, domestic fiscal policies affect foreign welfare not only through changes in the world interest rate but also through changes in the equilibrium relative prices of traded commodities. In order to guarantee {{the existence of an}} efficient Nash equilibrium in the <b>general</b> case, <b>additional</b> <b>tax</b> instruments are required. In particular, destination-based taxes on traded commodities are needed to enable the government to control the relative commodity prices faced by domestic consumers. In addition, in order to shield domestic producers from changes in world prices, the government must levy either origin-based commodity taxes or taxes on the immobile factors.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} combining an international cap-and-trade scheme with national carbon taxes. We consider a two-country stochastic partial equilibrium model with log-normally distributed uncertainty. The situation {{is analogous to the}} situation where European countries impose national carbon taxes in addition to the EU emissions trading. The allowance price in the joint cap-and-trade scheme depends on the tax rate, the relative size of countries and abatement options, the magnitude of uncertainty, and correlation of abatement costs. In most cases, the <b>additional</b> <b>tax</b> will not lead to additional production of the public good beyond the fixed targets. The <b>additional</b> <b>tax</b> results in higher costs of abatement to the country introducing the <b>additional</b> <b>tax,</b> and higher costs overall...|$|R
