Both of the vessels are cited as being highly influential in subsequent merchant hull design.

40|$|Renal {{scintigram}} with 2031 -Ig-Neohydrinw as performed o n 139 patients (145 cases) with {{renal diseases}} {{who visited the}} Department of Urology at Kyoto University. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1) It was noted that a trend of faint depiction of the bilateral lower poles of kidney and a overlap of hepatic uptake on the upper pole if the right kidney are noteworthy in scintigram of normal kidneys. In addition, an increase of hepatic uptake {{in the case of}} total renal hypcfunction remarkably affected to the renal scintigram. Normal pattern was demonstrated in the cases of idiopathic renal bleeding. 2) In 8 cases of unilateral renal hyperten s ion out of 32 cases of patients with hypertension, in which various examinations were performed for determination of the unilaterality, it was confirmed that the renal scintigram has advantages on simplicity and reliability. This method was especially useful in the case of segmental ischemia where the diagnosis is difficult by means of other tests. 3) The approximate s ize of intrinsic renal mass, detectable with the scintigram, located in the peripheral and central parts of the kidney was found experimentally to be as small defect as 2 cm and 3 cm diameters respectively, even though these figures vary with the local relation to the renal parenchym. 4) A diagnostic s i gnificance of renal scintigram was clarified in the cases of congenital abnormalities of the shape and localization of the kidney. 5) In renal tuberculosis, where partial defects are not infreqUently seen, the functional surviving areas were more clearly demonstrated by means of renal scintigraphy than IVP or RP. This will give a useful reference for the surgical procedure of partial resection. 6) In patients with pyelonephritis, a normal pattern of renal scintigram was seen in acute period while more or less decreased uptake was shown in chronic period. In generally, the decrease was not localized but diffuse in the most instances. In cases of hydronephrosis, lower uptake was demonstrated in renal scintigram. Severe cases, in addition, showed no depiction at all. However, presence of latent function of the kidney seemed unable to be elucidated with the finding of the scintigram. 8) No specific pattern but lowering of uptake <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> <b>w</b> i th functional disturbances was demonstrated in renal scintigram in patients with renolithiasis. 9) Following surgical operation of the kidney, ren a l scintigram showed defects being reflected the procedures. An unexpectedly prolonged decrease in the renal uptake of 203 Hg was seen following procedure of hemostasis at the operation. 10) The reproducibility of renal scintigram w i th 203 Hg-Neohydrin was studied and illustrated. All instances showed good results. 11) Advantages as well as disadva n tages of renal scintigram with 203 Hg-Neohydrin were presented and the discussion was made on views of improvement...|$|R

40|$|Average {{vertical}} attenuation coefficients, K(av), for irradiance {{calculated by}} linear regression of ln E(z) onz through the euphotic zone or from two irradiance values {{in a certain}} depth interval, are useful but somewhat arbitrary procedures for estimating these important apparent optical properties of the ocean. A more fundamental approach is to calculate an irradiance-weighted coefficient, wK(av), integrated over the whole water column, in which for each increment of depth, the corresponding irradiance value is used to weight the estimate of the irradiance coefficient <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> with <b>w</b> � K(av) � # 0 K(z) E(z) dz/ # 0 E(z) dz. Attenuation coefficients calculated in this way exhibit some interesting relationships both to certain other properties of the light field and to the inherent optical properties of the water. In particular, I find that {{for all types of}} irradiance w � K(av) � E(0) / # 0 E(z) dz, where E(0) is the value of irradiance just below the water surface. For net downward irradiance, wKE(av) � a / c and w � ¯ KE(av) � (a / � ¯ o) [1 � (b/a) (1 � � ¯ s) ], where � ¯ c is the integral average cosine for the water column, � ¯ o is the average cosine of the incoming flux just below the water surface, a is the absorption coefficient, b is the scattering coefficient, and � ¯ s is the average cosine (asymmetry factor) of the scattering phase function.

The public design project simultaneously reflected on the deep ecology of water, recycling and the water cycle. Three different locations exhibited the stitched textile banner exhibition and collected questionnaire responses to the document that proposes that &# 145;An understanding of information design and audience comprehension in an exhibition setting can inform the textile&# 146;s ability to communicate an environmental message, particularly about water. &# 146; This paper documents the use of textiles as a message medium, how a theoretical framework and design theories can inform information design using textiles, and the serendipitous results of analysis of the textile medium in order to deliver the subtle nuances of an environmental message. &# 145;Great to see people using recycled materials as the source of their art/designs.
