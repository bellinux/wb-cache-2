25|$|The volume {{contains}} five {{poems and}} six short stories, {{all on the}} theme of Christianity. Some of the poems can be taken as comments or epilogues on the short stories (e.g. Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh refers to the gifts in the stable which The Naughty Donkey in the preceding story attempts to eat). Although relatively unknown, this work, when referred to at all, is often stated as being for children; however the stories it contains are firmly aimed at an adult audience and with adult themes, especially for 1965.

The novel ends on a redemptive note in which Anna shows that she is willing to forfeit everything- perhaps even her sanity- for her aging mother, and Alyona finds the strength to break away from the domineering Anna in order to be a better mother to her own children.|$|E

[...] In addition, West noted the realism in Ellis' troubled personality, when she considers refusing the heart surgery, due to not being sure of wanting to continue her life {{in a state of}} forgetfulness and confusion. The scene which depicts Ellis interacting with Webber was negatively received by West, which regarded the whole conversation to have been based on his convincing lies, determined to give her peace.

500|$|The schoolgirl outfit is {{considered}} to be one of Spears's iconic looks and is on display at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Wesley Yang in his essay [...] "Inside the Box" [...] in n+1, compared the music video to Britny Fox's [...] "Girlschool" [...] because it featured [...] "a classroom full of Catholic schoolgirls gyrating to the beat in defiance of a stern teacher. [...] But that was a sexist video by a horrible hair metal band that exploited women. Britney Spears was something else—an inflection point in the culture". The music video is also referenced in the music video of Spears's 2000 single, [...] "Stronger" [...] where Spears sings, [...] "My loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] - a reference to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] where she sings, [...] "My loneliness is killing me."
