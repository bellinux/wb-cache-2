40|$|The use of {{different}} 			pressuremeters for in-situ soil testing is now well established. The 			pressuremeters, which provide high quality design parameters, are 			affordable on high cost projects only. Small cost projects permit 			the use of low cost techniques only (e. g. SPT), which often yield 			poor quality design parameters. Usually pressuremeters are employed 			for soil characterization using pre-bored or self-boring or 			full-displacement techniques. There {{was a need}} to develop a device 			in Pakistan that could be used as pre-bored as well as 			full-displacement pressuremeter for characterizing the alluvial soil 			deposits of Punjab province. Moreover, the new device should be 			simple, robust, cost effective and still produces parameters of high 			quality. 			This thesis describes the development of such a new in-situ testing 			device; namely the New Pressuremeter. Certain modifications have 			been made to the design of Newcastle Full-Displacement Pressuremeter 			(NFDPM), developed earlier by Akbar (2001) that has a radial 			displacement measurement system. The length of the probe of NFDPM is 			 420 mm (length to diameter ratio of 8. 4), which creates handling 			problems in the field. To overcome this difficulty it was decided to 			reduce the length of the test section and to keep the length of the 			probe of the new device equal to the length of SPT split spoon 			sampler to get benefit from the available large SPT data. On the 			basis of this fact, the length of the probe of the new device was 			taken as 305 mm giving length to diameter ratio of 6. 3. The analysis 			of a pressuremeter test {{is based on the assumption}} that the membrane 			expands as a right circular cylinder. 			With modifications, the new pressuremeter was developed using most 			of the local resources. The main body of the 48. 2 mm diameter (D) 			probe is made of high strength stainless steel. Both ends of the 			main body are identical. The upper end of the probe is connected to 			drill rods used to push the probe into place. A pressure hose and 			electrical cable pass through the drill rods and are connected to 			the probe by a re-usable <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fitting.</b> A 45 ° stainless steel 			cone having a maximum diameter of 50. 8 mm (surface area 28. 5 cm 2) is 			screwed onto the base of the probe.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate an irrigation controller that was mechanically actuated by soil-water tension within laboratory conditions. The controller was designed and constructed using readily available <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fittings</b> and other componentry. The main components of the controller were a tensiometer; a rubber diaphragm that moves according to the variation in tension inside of the tensiometer; an activation rod that transfers the movement from diaphragm to the switch valve; and a steel spring that regulates the activation of soil water tension. Six irrigation controller samples were tested in the laboratory to evaluate the mechanical performance and component forces required to activate the controllers. The relationship between spring adjustment and soil water tension required to open the irrigation valve was linear with a gradient ranging from 1. 10 to 1. 41 kPa mm- 1 and a coefficient of variation of 9. 2 %. However, differences observed in the activation of the soil water tension could also be reduced by individual controller calibration. The calibration of the soil water tension required to initiate irrigation was easily set by adjusting the spring. The proposed controller is functional, simple to use, can be easily adjusted, and does not require electricity to operate...|$|R

Any inherent defects or damage of fitting can cause system failure and/or physical damage of human body due to highly pressurized fluid. Radiographic testing(RT) technique and additional micro-structure investigation on cut-away surfaces have been accomplished to find out some defect-like-inhomogeneity in the fittings. The radiography results showed that some defect-like-inhomogeneity existed inside body. Additional micro-structure investigation on cut-away surface reveals that the inhomogeneity is due to internal voids.

40|$|Streaming {{potential}} (SPs) is {{the electric}} potential generated by fluid flow in a charged porous medium. The SPs signals {{are related to}} pore water velocity, bulk electrical conductivity, pore water charge excess, and soil porosity. While several studies have estimated hydraulic properties of the saturated zone from SPs, there have been fewer attempts to infer unsaturated hydraulic properties from SPs. From numerical and laboratory experiments in which infiltration and subsequent drainage was monitored with nonpolarizable Ag/AgCl electrodes and tensiometers, we showed that it is feasible to estimate three key Mualemvan Genuchten <b>hydraulic</b> parameters (<b>fitting</b> parameters alpha and n and saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s) and Archie's saturation exponent (n(a)) using a coupled hydrogeophysical inversion approach. In addition to a reasonably good estimate of n(a), coupled hydrogeophysical inversion of actual SPs measurements during drainage provided estimates of alpha, n, and K-s that were comparable to those obtained from an independent inversion of the tensiometric data (matric heads). We concluded that coupled hydrogeophysical inversion of time-lapse SPs signals is a promising method for hydraulic characterization of the vadose zone. Accurate modeling of SPs signals is essential for reliable inversion results, {{but there is still}} debate about the appropriate model for the voltage coupling coefficient at partial saturation. Our experimental data showed a nonlinear and monotonic decrease in the absolute voltage coupling coefficient with decreasing saturation. A comparison of several available models with our experimental data showed that models that consider the relative permeability and the relative electrical conductivity in addition to the saturated coupling coefficient and water saturation were most appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is {{research}} and development concerning a fatigue tester of shock absorber seal systems. Design/methodology/approach: Analytical approach {{has been applied to}} get an understanding of a heat exchange process. The mathematical model has been formulated and validated based on the available measurements. Numerical simulation has been carried out to illustrate a heat exchange process performance. Findings: It is possible to control a seal temperature and mechanical friction related to the rod movement into the seal at the specified velocity. The model accuracy is sufficient to perform sensitivity analysis and optimize the design. Research limitations/implications: The components of a fatigue tester have to withstand the significant temperature differences in the range  30; + 140 ˚C, e. g. <b>hydraulic</b> hoses, <b>fittings,</b> and pumps. Practical implications: We combine the analytical and experimental approach to provide customized and reliable engineering solution in the area of damper component seal development. A typical seal has a lip-like design protecting the moving parts against the leakage. It can be tested in a shock absorber or externally with use of a customized test rigs. Seal tests inside a shock absorber have numerous disadvantages. A shock absorber temperature rises during longer tests and cooling phase is required. This dramatically increases tests duration performed with the use of an expensive general-purpose hydraulic testing machinery. A compressed air or water jacket is used to accelerate the cooling process. Nevertheless, there are limitations related to the physics behind the cooling process. A seal component fatigue tester allows to perform the seal component tests out of the shock absorber. Originality/value: A new testing method provides possibility to quantify the main contributors of seal usage...|$|R

40|$|International audienceModelling and {{understanding}} water fluxes in the vadose zone {{are important in}} regards to water management and require appropriate characterization methods of soil hydraulic properties. The presented work studies three common methods for characterization of soil hydraulic properties based on the inverse modelling of Beerkan water infiltration experiments: the CI method for Cumulative Information method and two BEST methods for Beerkan Estimation Soil pedotransfer methods. These methods estimate the soil sorptivity and saturated <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity by <b>fitting</b> infiltration data using infiltration models. The CI method directly fits the experimental cumulative infiltration to the usual short time expansion of the complete analytical model proposed by Haverkamp et al. (1994). The BEST methods {{are based on a}} specific algorithm that splits the experimental curves into two parts; the first part being fitted to the short time expansion and the second part to the long time expansion. To test the methods, several subsets of infiltration data were generated using the complete analytical model for several radii of the disc source and for times ranging from zero to several truncation times. The methods were then applied and the ratio between their estimations and the target values were evaluated to quantify their related accuracy. The results clearly demonstrated that the CI method must be used only to short time infiltration data. Yet, this method is usually used without any truncation of the experimental data, whereas the truncation should certainly be required. The BEST methods proved efficient and robust, provided the steady state was reached {{at the end of the}} infiltration experiment and both short and long time data solutions were used. The gain in accuracy of the BEST methods was all the more important when the disc radius was small...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to reduce the cost}} of breakwaters, several {{elements}} have been developed. Examples are Accropodes, Tetrapods and concrete cubes. Previous tests were performed with armour layers consisting of a double layer of cubes. This study is based on a single layer of cubes. The great benefit of a single layer of cubes is that it reduces the total cost of concrete. Another benefit is that because of the shape, cubes are easy to prefabricate. Three important aspects considering the stability of a single armour layer of a breakwater consisting of concrete cubes are addressed: The influence of the wave steepness on the stqbility, the influence of the slope on the stability of the single armour layer, and the influence of the packing density on the stability of the single armour layer. This study is based on a literature study and the results from a test program including a small-scale physical model tests. All conclusions in this thesis have been based on model tests, in which the cubes were placed by hand and placed in a stretching bond (half-steensverband). In total eighteen tests were performed in the wave flume of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences. Two different slopes were tested together with three different packing densities and three different wave steepness. It was found that the gentler slope did not contribute to the stability in this setting using a stretching bond. In fact the model failed earlier than the model with a steeper slope in most cases. The best results were found using a slope of cot? = 1. 5. Secondly, the influence of the packing density showed varying failure mechanism. When applying a large packing density (np = 0. 20) the damage occurred below SWL. Contrary to small packing densities (np = 0. 35) where damage occurred higher than SWL. It was found that, from the tested packing densities, a packing density of 0. 28 gives the best results for both slopes. This conclusion is conform the findings of previous tests [Van Gent et al, 1999]. During these tests an optimum packing density of np = 0. 25 – 0. 30 was found. Although the cubes were placed randomly in the tests of Van Gent. In this study the cubes were placed in a stretching bond. Finally it was found that a wave steepness of s 0 p = 0. 04 - 0. 05 causes minimum stability for the armour layer. The tests with a single armour layer of cubes placed in a stretching bond indicated that high sta-bility numbers (Hs/?Dn) can be reached before failure occurs (Nod > 0. 2). the tests show that sta-bility numbers as high as 4. 5 can be realized before Nod > 0. 2 is reached. This study shows that the use of a single top layer of cubes is feasible. The top layer becomes very stable when placed in a stretching bond. In this configuration it is recommended to use a single top layer of cubes instead of a double top layer of cubes. The results during the tests seem to have a strong correlation with pitched stones. Therefore the black box model as well as the analytical method for pitched stones (6 -xi-rule) is treated in {{an attempt to}} optimize the design rules for different configurations. Finally, in combination with an adjusted 6 -xi-rule and the formulae from Van der Meer for loose rock, formulae were developed based on curve <b>fitting.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
