5|$|For example, in Obelia {{there are}} feeding {{individuals}}, the gastrozooids; the individuals capable of asexual reproduction only, the gonozooids, blastostyles and <b>free-living</b> or sexually reproducing individuals, the medusae.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} <b>free-living,</b> nitrogen-fixing bacteria; in {{contrast}} to Rhizobium species, they normally fix molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere without symbiotic relations with plants, although some Azotobacter species are associated with plants. Nitrogen fixation is inhibited {{in the presence of}} available nitrogen sources, such as ammonium ions and nitrates.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a captive}} yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} and two <b>free-living</b> tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) suffering neurological symptoms {{were shown to}} be hosting the rat nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis. They were the first non-mammalian hosts discovered for the organism. A species of feather mite, Psittophagus calyptorhynchi, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.|$|E
5|$|In Cibber's Love's Last Shift, a <b>free-living</b> Restoration rake {{is brought}} to repentance and reform by the ruses of his wife, while in The Relapse, the rake succumbs again to temptation and has a new love affair. His virtuous wife is also {{subjected}} to a determined seduction attempt, and resists with difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The Azotobacter genus was {{discovered}} in 1901 by Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck, {{who was one of}} the founders of environmental microbiology. He selected and described the species Azotobacter chroococcum – the first aerobic, <b>free-living</b> nitrogen fixer.|$|E
5|$|The longest beetle is the Hercules beetle Dynastes hercules, with {{a maximum}} overall length of at least 16.7cm (6.6in) {{including}} the very long pronotal horn. The smallest recorded beetle and the smallest <b>free-living</b> insect (as of 2015), is the featherwing beetle Scydosella musawasensis which may measure as little as 325µm in length.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of earwig species are in Forficulina, grouped into nine families of 180 genera, including Forficula auricularia, the common European Earwig. Species within Forficulina are <b>free-living,</b> have functional wings and are not parasites. The cerci are unsegmented and modified into large, forceps-like structures.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} entomopathogenic {{nematode}} are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a <b>free-living,</b> infective {{stage in the}} soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, {{but it is the}} bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{that emerge}} from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, <b>free-living</b> larvae are fully aquatic, {{but at least one}} species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E
5|$|These {{are often}} called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes {{like that of}} a {{flounder}} (Old English flóc). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a <b>free-living</b> flatworm.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, <b>free-living</b> soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as <b>free-living</b> life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|Most {{crustaceans}} are <b>free-living</b> aquatic animals, {{but some}} are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet, and form {{a vital part of}} the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology (alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology or crustalogy), and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{are mainly}} <b>free-living</b> species that {{directly}} consume {{a large number}} of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first <b>free-living</b> organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are {{a major part of the}} communities of microorganisms that produce biogas.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known <b>free-living</b> platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with <b>free-living</b> black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|Frog larvae {{are known}} as tadpoles and {{typically}} have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The <b>free-living</b> larvae are normally fully aquatic, but the tadpoles of some species (such as Nannophrys ceylonensis) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks. Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming. Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills. The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak. Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} medicinal texts, Platyhelminthes {{are divided}} into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. <b>Free-living</b> flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{species are}} mostly {{external}} parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. In general, isopod parasites have diverse lifestyles and include Cancricepon elegans, found in the gill chambers of crabs; Athelges tenuicaudis, attached to the abdomen of hermit crabs; Crinoniscus equitans living inside the barnacle Balanus perforatus; cyproniscids, living inside ostracods and <b>free-living</b> isopods; bopyrids, living in the gill chambers or on the carapace of shrimps and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans; and entoniscidae living inside some species of crab and shrimp. Cymothoa exigua is a parasite of the spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus in the Gulf of California; it causes the tongue of the fish to atrophy and takes its place in what {{is believed to be}} the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} benthic (living on the seabed) and others pelagic (living in mid-water), {{but most are}} found close to, {{crawling}} on or burrowing into the mud or sand. Most marine species are benthic by day but leave the seabed at night to become planktonic. Locomotion is mostly by swimming, the pleopods being used for this purpose. Some mysids live among algae and seagrasses, some are solitary while many form dense swarms. Mysids form {{an important part of}} the diet of such fish as shad and flounder. In general, they are <b>free-living,</b> but a few species, mostly in the subfamily Heteromysinae, are commensal and are associated with sea anemones and hermit crabs. Several taxa have also been described from different freshwater habitats and caves. Mysis relicta and its close relatives inhabit cold, deep lakes and have a diurnal cycle of vertical migrations.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of {{amphibians}} {{are typically}} laid {{in water and}} hatch into <b>free-living</b> larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) {{and some of the}} African live-bearing toads (Nectophrynoides spp.) are viviparous. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are ovoviviparous. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species. The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a <b>free-living</b> stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may be outcompeting <b>free-living</b> decomposers for either water or nutrients in some systems as well, however to date there is no demonstration of this, {{and it seems that}} arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may more often increase, rather than decrease rates of decomposition by <b>free-living</b> microbial decomposers.|$|E
25|$|Based on this model, it {{is clear}} that endosymbionts face {{different}} adaptive challenges than <b>free-living</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>free-living</b> marine bacterioplanktons {{also shows}} signs of genome reduction, which are {{hypothesized}} {{to be driven by}} natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Parasites use {{a variety}} of methods to infect their hosts, {{including}} physical contact, the fecal-oral route, <b>free-living</b> infectious stages, and insect vectors, suiting their differing hosts.|$|E
25|$|Most nonparasitic copepods are holoplanktonic, {{meaning they}} stay planktonic {{for all of}} their lifecycles, {{although}} harpacticoids, although <b>free-living,</b> tend to be benthic rather than planktonic.|$|E
25|$|All {{nematodes}} {{pass through}} an embryonic stage, four juvenile stages (J1–J4) and an adult stage. Juvenile Meloidogynes parasites hatch from eggs as vermiform, second-stage juveniles (J2), the first moult having occurred within the egg. Newly hatched juveniles {{have a short}} <b>free-living</b> stage in the soil, in the rhizosphere of the host plants. They may reinvade the host plants of their parent or migrate through the soil {{to find a new}} host root. J2 larvae do not feed during the <b>free-living</b> stage, but use lipids stored in the gut.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of {{mycorrhizal}} inhibition of decomposition was in 1971 and came from ectomycorrhizal Pinus radiatia plantations in New Zealand. Authors show that excluding roots and mycorrhizal fungi resulted in net carbon loss, {{and that the}} result could not be explained by soil disturbance effects. The mechanism presented is that ectomycorrhizal fungi can compete with <b>free-living</b> decomposers for nutrients, and thereby limit the rate of total decomposition. Since then {{there have been several}} other reports of ectomycorrhizal fungi reducing activity and decomposition rates of <b>free-living</b> decomposers and thereby increasing soil carbon storage. A theoretical ecosystem model recently demonstrated that greater access to organic nitrogen by mycorrhizal fungi should slow decomposition of soil carbon by <b>free-living</b> decomposers by inducing nutrient limitation. It should be noted however, that Koide and Wu (2003) made a strong case that the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on reducing decomposition may {{have more to do with}} competition for soil water than soil nutrients.|$|E
25|$|In <b>free-living</b> species, {{development}} usually {{consists of}} four molts of the cuticle during growth. Different species feed on materials as varied as algae, fungi, small animals, fecal matter, dead organisms, and living tissues. <b>Free-living</b> marine nematodes are important and abundant members of the meiobenthos. They {{play an important role}} in the decomposition process, aid in recycling of nutrients in marine environments, and are sensitive to changes in the environment caused by pollution. One roundworm of note, Caenorhabditis elegans, lives in the soil and has found much use as a model organism. C. elegans has had its entire genome sequenced, as well as the developmental fate of every cell determined, and every neuron mapped.|$|E
25|$|The {{anatomy of}} {{parasitic}} barnacles is generally simpler {{than that of}} their <b>free-living</b> relatives. They have no carapace or limbs, having only unsegmented sac-like bodies. Such barnacles feed by extending thread-like rhizomes of living cells into their hosts' bodies from their points of attachment.|$|E
25|$|Beetles {{and flies}} {{dominate}} Heard Island's known insect fauna, which comprises up to 21 species of ectoparasite (associated with birds and seals) {{and up to}} 13 <b>free-living</b> species. Approximately half of the <b>free-living</b> insects are habitat-specific, while the remainder are generalists found {{in a variety of}} habitats, being associated with either supralittoral or intertidal zones, Poa cookii and Pringlea antiscorbutica stands, bryophytes, lichen-covered rocks, exposed rock faces or the underside of rocks. There is a pronounced seasonality to the insect fauna, with densities in winter months dropping to a small percentage (between 0.75%) of the summer maximum. Distinct differences in relative abundances of species between habitats has also been shown, including a negative relationship between altitude and body size for Heard Island weevils.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{schistosome}} egg is {{immersed in}} water, a short-lived, non-feeding, <b>free-living</b> stage {{known as the}} miracidium emerges. The miracidium uses cilia to follow chemical and physical cues thought to increase its chances of finding the first intermediate host in its life cycle, a freshwater snail.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they are}} now {{interpreted}} as detached bracts (parts) of the entire siphonophore (which, as stated above, remains unidentified), the specimens were first interpreted as <b>free-living</b> organisms, as they {{did not appear to}} show evidence of having been attached to something else, whether a surface or each other.|$|E
25|$|Bernal {{suggested}} that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. Bernal regarded {{the third stage}} – discovering methods by which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell's boundary – as the most difficult. Modern work on the way that cell membranes self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates may be a halfway house towards the development of independent <b>free-living</b> cells.|$|E
