40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some details}} of operation process for a Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) {{in order to achieve}} the decommissioning of the horizontal fuel channels pressure tube in the CANDU 6 nuclear reactor. The most important characteristic of the Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) is his capability of totally operator’s protection against the nuclear radiation during pressure tube decommissioning. The cutting and extracting pressure tube processes present few particularities due to special adopted technical solutions: a special module with three cutting rollers (system driven by an actuator), a guiding-extracting and connecting module (three <b>fixing</b> <b>claws</b> which are piloted by an actuator and block the device in the connecting position with extracting plugs). The Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) is a train of modules equipped with special systems to be fully automated, connected with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and controlled by an operator panel type Human Machine Interface (HMI). All processes are monitored by video cameras. In case of error, the process is automatically stopped, the operator receiving an error message and the last sequence could be reinitialized or aborted due to safety reasons...|$|R

60|$|The Indian met {{it with a}} {{tremendous}} blow of his axe, seized it by the throat with his left hand, and endeavoured to repeat the blow. [See frontispiece.] But brave and powerful though he was, the Indian was like a mere child in the paw of the bear. The axe descended with a crash on the monster's head, and sank into its skull. But bears are notoriously hard to kill. This one scarcely seemed to feel the blow. Next instant Arrowhead was down, and, with its <b>claws</b> <b>fixed</b> in the man's back, the bear held him down, while it began to gnaw the fleshy part of his left shoulder.|$|R
60|$|And now {{the silent}} and majestic figure of my {{employer}} became {{an object of}} greater interest to me. I began to understand that strangely human look in his eyes, those deep lines upon his care-worn face. He {{was a man who}} was fighting a ceaseless battle, holding at arm's length, from morning till night, a horrible adversary who was forever trying to close with him--an adversary which would destroy him body and soul could it but <b>fix</b> its <b>claws</b> once more upon him. As I watched the grim, round-backed figure pacing the corridor or walking in the garden, this imminent danger seemed to take bodily shape, and I could almost fancy that I saw this most loathsome and dangerous of all the fiends crouching closely in his very shadow, like a half-cowed beast which slinks beside its keeper, ready at any unguarded moment to spring at his throat. And the dead woman, the woman who had spent her life in warding off this danger, took shape also to my imagination, and I saw her as a shadowy but beautiful presence which intervened for ever with arms uplifted to screen the man whom she loved.|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite markers from a {{transcriptome}} sequence library {{were initially}} isolated, and their genetic variation was characterized {{in a wild}} population of the mud crab (Scylla paramamosain). We then tested the association between these microsatellite markers and the growth performance of S. paramamosain. A total of 129 polymorphic microsatellite markers were identified, with an observed heterozygosity ranging from 0. 19 to 1. 00 per locus, an expected heterozygosity ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 96 per locus, and a polymorphism information content (PIC) ranging from 0. 21 to 0. 95 per locus. Of these microsatellite markers, 30 showed polymorphism in 96 full-sib individuals of a first generation family. Statistical analysis indicated that three microsatellite markers {{were significantly associated with}} 12 growth traits of S. paramamosain. Of these three markers, locus Scpa 36 was significantly associated with eight growth traits, namely, carapace length, abdomen width (AW), body height (BH), fixed finger length of the <b>claw,</b> <b>fixed</b> finger width of the <b>claw,</b> <b>fixed</b> finger height of the claw, meropodite length of pereiopod 2, and meropodite length of pereiopod 3 (MLP 3) (P, 0. 05). Locus Scpa 75 was significantly associated with five growth traits, namely, internal carapace width, AW, carapace width at spine 8, distance between lateral spine 2 (DLS 2), and MLP 3 (P, 0. 05). Locus Spm 30 was significantly associated with BH, DLS 2, and body weight (P, 0. 05). Further analysis suggested a set of genotypes (BC at Scpa 36, BC and BD at Scpa 75, and AC at Spm 30) that have great potential in the selection of S. paramamosain for growth traits.

60|$|When {{this sport}} was over, two parties of men entered the arena, amid a shout of {{satisfaction}} from the crowd. After prostrating themselves before Tippoo, they took up their ground facing each other. Each man had, {{on his right}} hand, four steel <b>claws</b> <b>fixed</b> to the knuckles. Approaching each other cautiously they threw, with their left hands, the garlands of flowers they wore round their necks, into the faces of their opponents, trying {{to take advantage of}} the moment to strike a blow, or to obtain a grip. Each blow laid open the flesh as by a tiger's claws. The great object was to gain a grip, no matter where, which would completely disable the opponent, and render him incapable of defending himself. When this was done, the combat between that pair came to an end.|$|R
60|$|That bear either {{understood}} English, or {{the very}} {{sound of the}} human voice caused it irritation, for it turned and rushed at the ice-ledge with such fury that Benjy's heart again leaped into his throat. He had, however, recovered sufficiently to enable him to act with promptitude and discretion. Sitting down with his right foot ready, and his hands resting firmly on the ice behind him, he prepared to receive the charge in the only available manner. So fierce was the onset that the monster ran up the ice-cliff like a cat, and succeeded in <b>fixing</b> the terrible <b>claws</b> of both feet {{on the edge of}} the shelf, but the boy delivered his right heel with such force that the left paw slipped off. The left heel followed like lightning, and the right paw also slipped, letting the bear again fall heavily on the ice below.|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{in front}} of the spot where we stood was an open space or glade of {{considerable}} extent. Towards this the animal approached, as was evident from the increasing loudness of its wild roar, which was almost continuous. In another moment the thick wall of underwood at its farther extremity was burst asunder with a crash, and a wild buffalo bull bounded into the plain and dashed madly across. On its neck was crouched a leopard, which had <b>fixed</b> its <b>claws</b> and teeth deep in the flesh of the agonised animal. In vain did the bull bound and rear, toss and plunge. At one moment it ran like the wind; the next it stopped with such violence as to tear up the turf and scatter it around. Then it reared, almost falling back; anon it plunged and rushed on again, with the foam flying from its mouth, and its bloodshot eyes glaring with the fire of rage and terror, while the woods seemed to tremble with its loud and deep-toned bellowing. Twice in its passage across the open glade it ran, in its blind fury, straight against a tree, almost beating in its skull, and for a moment arresting its progress; but it instantly recovered the shock and burst away again as madly as ever. But no effort that it was capable of making could relieve the poor creature from its deadly burden, or cause the leopard in the slightest degree to relax its fatal gripe.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2015. The aim of the project is to construct a mobile device which would remove waste materials such as leaves, bottles, polyethenes, etc. which we usually see disrupting the water flow in roadside drains. This causes dire problems in our society when the drain overflows, acts as breeding grounds for mosquitoes, produce undesirable smell and in turn becomes a reason for health risk in the community. Thus, our aim is to construct a robot which will help to overcome this problematic situation. The device consists of a conveyer belt fitted with a <b>fixed</b> number of <b>claws</b> {{to pick up the}} waste material and it is driven by a chain bound to a DC motor. The claws will transfer the collected waste into a deposit box and from there it will be displaced in a desired location by means of an actuator...|$|R
5000|$|There was an {{instance}} where Frank Elstner lost a private bet himself; he had bet {{with his family}} that his colleague and friend Kurt Felix would never fool him. (Kurt Felix ran a show similar to Candid Camera, called Verstehen Sie Spaß? ("Can You Take a Joke?").

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I laughed, [...] "what is it {{that has}} {{happened}} to you?" [...] My question had not been in the least intended for pressure, but it made her turn and look at me, and this, I quickly recognised, was all the answer the most pitiless curiosity could have desired--all the more, as well, that the intention in it had been no greater than in my words. Beautiful, abysmal, involuntary, her exquisite weakness simply opened up the depths it would have closed. It was in short a supremely unsuccessful attempt to say nothing. It said everything, {{and by the end of}} a minute my chatter--none the less out of place for being all audible--was hushed to positive awe by what it had conveyed. I saw as I had never seen before what consuming passion can make of the marked mortal on whom, with <b>fixed</b> beak and <b>claws,</b> it has settled as on a prey. She reminded me of a sponge wrung dry and with fine pores agape. Voided and scraped of everything, her shell was merely crushable. So it was brought home to me that the victim could be abased, and so it disengaged itself from these things that the abasement could be conscious. That was Mrs. Server's tragedy, that her consciousness survived--survived with a force that made it struggle and dissemble. This consciousness was all her secret--it was at any rate all mine. I promised myself roundly that I would henceforth keep clear of any other.|$|R

6000|$|This little {{specimen}} {{of the conversation}} must be sufficient. It will show pretty clearly that EACH of the two military commanders was conducting his operations with perfect success. Three of the detachment of five attacked by the Corporal surrendered to him: Mr. Bullock, namely, who gave in {{at a very early}} stage of the evening, and ignominiously laid down his arms under the table, after standing not more than a dozen volleys of beer; Mr. Blacksmith's boy, and a labourer whose name {{we have not been able}} to learn. Mr. Butcher himself was on the point of yielding, when he was rescued by the furious charge of a detachment that marched to his relief: his wife namely, who, with two squalling children, rushed into the [...] "Bugle," [...] boxed Butcher's ears, and kept up such a tremendous fire of oaths and screams upon the Corporal, that he was obliged to retreat. <b>Fixing</b> then her <b>claws</b> into Mr. Butcher's hair, she proceeded to drag him out of the premises; and thus Mr. Brock was overcome. His attack upon John Hayes was a still greater failure; for that young man seemed to be invincible by drink, if not by love: and at the end of the drinking-bout was a great deal more cool than the Corporal himself; to whom he wished a very polite good-evening, as calmly he took his hat to depart. He turned to look at Catherine, to be sure, and then he was not quite so calm: but Catherine did not give any reply to his good-night. She was seated at the Captain's table playing at cribbage with him; and though Count Gustavus Maximilian lost every game, he won more than he lost,--sly fellow!--and Mrs. Catherine was no match for him.|$|R
6000|$|... 61. The fourth letter {{opens in}} the fields of Vespignano. The {{circumstances}} of the finding of Giotto by Cimabue are well known. Vasari's anecdote of the fly painted upon the nose of one of Cimabue's figures might, we think, have been spared, or at least not instanced as proof of study from nature [...] "nobly rewarded." [...] Giotto certainly never either attempted or accomplished any small imitation of this kind; the story has all the look of one of the common inventions of the ignorant for the ignorant; nor, if true, would Cimabue's careless mistake of a black spot {{in the shape of a}} fly for one of the living annoyances of which there might probably be some dozen or more upon his panel at any moment, have been a matter of much credit to his young pupil. The first point of any real interest is Lord Lindsay's confirmation of Förster's attribution of the Campo Santo Life of Job, till lately esteemed Giotto's, to Francesco da Volterra. Förster's evidence appears incontrovertible; yet there is curious internal evidence, we think, in favor of the designs being Giotto's, if not the execution. The landscape is especially Giottesque, the trees being all boldly massed first with dark brown, within which the leaves are painted separately in light: this very archaic treatment had been much softened and modified by the Giotteschi before the date assigned to these frescoes by Förster. But, what is more singular, the figure of Eliphaz, or the foremost of the three friends, occurs in a tempera picture of Giotto's in the Academy of Florence, the Ascension, among the apostles on the left; while the face of another of the three friends is again repeated in the [...] "Christ disputing with the Doctors" [...] of the small tempera series, also in the Academy; the figure of Satan shows much analogy to that of the Envy of the Arena chapel; and many other portions of the design are evidently either sketches of this very subject by Giotto himself, or dexterous compilations from his works by a loving pupil. Lord Lindsay has not done justice to the upper division--the Satan before God: it is one of the very finest thoughts ever realized by the Giotteschi. The serenity of power in the principal figure is very noble; no expression of wrath, or even of scorn, in the look which commands the evil spirit. The position of the latter, and countenance, are less grotesque and more demoniacal than is usual in paintings of the time; the triple wings expanded--the arms crossed over the breast, and holding each other above the elbow, the <b>claws</b> <b>fixing</b> in the flesh; a serpent buries its head in a cleft in the bosom, and the right hoof is lifted, as if to stamp.|$|R
