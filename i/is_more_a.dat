5|$|Jon and Tyrion see the Wall for {{the first}} time as they arrive with Benjen and the other recruits. En route to the Wall, Tyrion and Jon discuss the Night's Watch. Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall (as it was in history), {{pointing}} out that now it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> dumping ground for the unwanted of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E
5|$|Musicologist Francis Maes {{wrote that}} while Rimsky-Korsakov's efforts are laudable, {{they are also}} controversial. It was {{generally}} assumed that with Prince Igor, Rimsky-Korsakov edited and orchestrated the existing fragments of the opera while Glazunov composed and added missing parts, including most of the third act and the overture. This was exactly what Rimsky-Korsakov stated in his memoirs. Both Maes and Richard Taruskin cite an analysis of Borodin's manuscripts by musicologist Pavel Lamm, which showed that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov discarded nearly 20 percent of Borodin's score. According to Maes, the result <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> collaborative effort by all three composers than a true representation of Borodin's intent. Lamm stated {{that because of the}} extremely chaotic state of Borodin's manuscripts, a modern alternative to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov's edition would be extremely difficult to complete.|$|E

25|$|This book {{is about}} finding one's home. The talking horses Bree and Hwin seek their home {{in the land of}} Narnia where they were born.

25|$|Fattening pens can {{be outside}} or in a greenhouse. High summer {{temperatures}} and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails.

25|$|Ung's {{first book}} has been criticized {{by members of the}} Cambodian {{community}} in the United States, a number of whom believe that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> work of fiction than an actual autobiography. She has also been accused of misrepresenting the Khmer race and playing on ethnic stereotypes for the purpose of self-aggrandizement and over-dramatization to increase sales and publicity.|$|E

Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco type, but is usually one of, or a blend of Kentucky, Virginia, and burley, and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco and cigars.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{in honor}} of the game's 80th birthday, Hasbro held an online vote in order to {{determine}} which cities would make it into an updated version of the Here and Now edition of the game. This second edition <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> spin-off as the winning condition has changed to completing your passport instead of bankrupting your opponents. Community Chest is replaced with Here and Now cards while the Here and Now space replaced the railroads. Houses and hotels have been removed.|$|E
25|$|Additive manufacturing, {{starting}} with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization, as end users will {{do much of}} their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations. The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice between}} a {{subsurface}} drainage system by pipes and ditches or by tube wells <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> matter of technical criteria and costs than of agricultural criteria, because {{both types of}} systems can be {{designed to meet the}} same agricultural criteria and achieve the same benefits. Usually, pipe drains or ditches are preferable to wells. However, when the soil consists of a poorly permeable top layer several meters thick, overlying a rapidly permeable and deep subsoil, wells may be a better option, because the drain spacing required for pipes or ditches would be considerably smaller than the spacing for wells.|$|E
25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time before you can cash in on that, and promote Lance and Chariot so they can get involved on the real battle, as you would first have to get your Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E
25|$|Support from Earl Birger Brosa of Sweden <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> sign of pragmatic {{politics}} {{on the part}} of the Swedes, as their ally party in Norway needed a new leader and had chosen Sverre. Sverre was not the Earl's first choice, however. They had first supported Øystein Møyla, who had died at the Battle of Re in 1177. The Swedish dynastic lines were themselves engaged in civil war, and the current rulers of the family after king Erik were at war with the Danish king Valdemar. Erling Skakke had submitted to Valdemar some decades earlier, and it was beneficial for the Swedes at the time to support the opponents of Erling's regime, namely Sverre.|$|E

25|$|When Black is {{only one}} rank weaker (also known as one stone weaker, due to the close {{relationship}} between ranks and the handicap system), Black is given the advantage of playing Black, perhaps without komi, but without any mandatory White passes. For rank differences from two through nine stones, the appropriate number of handicap stones are used. Beyond nine stones, the difference in strength between the players is usually considered great enough that the game <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> lesson where White teaches Black than a competition. Thus, nine stones is the nominal upper limit on handicap stones regardless {{of the difference in}} rank (although higher numbers of stones, up to 41 stones in some cases, may be given if the teacher wants a greater challenge).|$|E
25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> matter of the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E
25|$|Habitus is {{somewhat}} reminiscent of preexisting sociological {{concepts such as}} socialization, but habitus also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment: Habitus does not only, or even primarily, function {{at the level of}} explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has something in common with Anthony Giddens' concept of practical consciousness.|$|E
