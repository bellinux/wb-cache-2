5|$|Under Basil II, the Byzantines {{established}} {{a swath of}} new themata, stretching northeast from Aleppo (a Byzantine protectorate) to Manzikert. Under the Theme system of military and administrative government, the Byzantines could raise a force at least 200,000 strong, though in practice these were strategically placed throughout the Empire. With Basil's rule, the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest height in nearly five centuries, and <b>indeed</b> <b>for</b> the next four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>for</b> much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route16 (NY16) is a {{state highway}} in western New York, in the United States. It runs from the Pennsylvania state line, where {{it is one of}} the highest {{highways}} in the state in elevation, to downtown Buffalo. NY16 is a major route through Erie County, despite the construction of the paralleling NY400 expressway from East Aurora. In Cattaraugus County it also plays an important role, serving as the major connection from Olean to the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate86 or I-86 and NY17). Between those two areas, and <b>indeed</b> <b>for</b> much of its length, it is a two-lane rural road.|$|E

25|$|Protecting {{the brain}} from even minor {{disruption}} is important since exercise depends upon motor control, and particularly, because humans are bipeds, the motor control needed for keeping balance. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>for</b> this reason, brain energy consumption is increased during intense physical exercise {{due to the}} demands in the motor cognition needed to control the body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indeed,</b> <b>for</b> {{almost a}} decade after the Normal was founded, the {{curriculum}} involved diplomas awarded for work that was distinctly below college level. At the time few public high schools turned out female graduates who were prepared to handle college-level work. The curriculum was gradually modified over time and the Normal School became a full-fledged College in 1897. Baccalaureate degrees followed in 1903 and graduates were awarded a “diploma and life license” to teach in North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|After the {{declaration}} of independence, and <b>indeed</b> <b>for</b> the entire duration of its existence, Rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state, although it did maintain diplomatic relations with South Africa, which was then under apartheid. South Africa did not recognise Rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations, but frequently assisted the republic. Portugal maintained informal relations until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. The day following {{the declaration}} of independence, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution (S/RES/216) calling upon all states not to accord Rhodesia recognition, and to refrain from any assistance. The Security Council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions, which were later made comprehensive.|$|E

There are several nightclubs in the area including Voodoo on the lower Main street and The Pulse on the Port Road. The Grill Music Venue {{is a popular}} nightclub on Sundays. There are many pubs such as The Central Bar (established 1808), The Cavern, Sister Sara's, Josie's Bar, McGinley's, The Cottage Bar and Warehouse.|$|E

25|$|Kundera often {{explicitly}} identifies {{his characters}} as figments of his imagination, commenting in the first-person on {{the characters in}} entirely third-person stories. Kundera {{is more concerned with}} the words that shape or mold his characters than with their physical appearance. In his non-fiction work, The Art of the Novel, he says that the reader's imagination automatically completes the writer's vision. He, as the writer, thus wishes to focus on the essential, arguing that the physical is not critical to understanding a character. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>for</b> him the essential may not even include the interior world (the psychological world) of his characters. Still, at times, a specific feature or trait may become the character's idiosyncratic focus.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942, the 34th and 36th Battalions were {{detached}} from the division to garrison Tonga and Norfolk Island respectively. The 36th Battalion was accompanied by detachments from the divisional engineer, artillery and service units as N Force. After completing its initial training in New Zealand the 3rd NZ Division moved to New Caledonia for garrison duty and further training in December 1942 and January 1943. At that time, the third brigade, the 15th, came into being. Each of the brigades consisted of only two battalions, initially, although in March 1943 the New Zealand government approved {{the expansion of the}} division to 17,637 men all ranks and decided that the two battalions on Norfolk Island and Tonga would be assigned to the division. Almost immediately, however, manpower became an issue and during the early months of 1943 it became clear {{that it would not be}} possible to raise the division to full strength. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>for</b> a while it seemed that the division might be disbanded before it saw active service but its commander, Barrowclough urged the government to allow the division to see active service before any decision was made.|$|E
25|$|The {{communist}} 1969 Tet offensive {{began in}} the early hours of 23 February, with attacks against US and ARVN installations and district capitals. Lacking the ferocity of the offensive in 1968, the outburst soon slackened, however. In III CTZ, where 1 ATF operated, over a period of five days there were 175 attacks by fire and just 15 ground assaults, while the communists suffered over 1,800 killed and 320 captured. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>for</b> the Australians the offensive proved to be only a series of relatively minor disturbances when compared to that of the year before; perhaps demoralised following the earlier mauling at Coral and Balmoral the Viet Cong declined to attack major South Vietnamese and US installations in force. Regardless, with the bulk of 1 ATF operating away from Nui Dat in first half of 1969, the Viet Cong again became active in the populated central and southern areas of Phuoc Tuy Province, including Dat Do and Long Dien, and the villages between Dat Do and the coast. Although ARVN forces were by now operating in these areas, communist guerrilla groups operated with freedom, especially at night. As a consequence Australian operations in mid-1969 were forced to focus on the area around Dat Do and the Long Hai Hills, as they attempted to restrict the Viet Cong's access to the local population. Later, on 6–7 June 1969 the Australians were engaged in fierce close-quarter house-to-house fighting with Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces during the Battle of Binh Ba.|$|E
