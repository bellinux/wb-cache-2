40|$|The authors {{investigated}} whether anomalous {{information in}} the periphery of a scene attracts saccades when the anomaly is not distinctive in its low-level visual properties.

One photograph was a control scene in which familiar objects appeared in their canonical form. In the other picture, objects were altered {{in a way that}} rendered them deviant without introducing any obvious changes in low-level visual saliency. In Experiment 1, these alterations involved rotating an object in an unnatural fashion (e. g., an <b>inverted</b> <b>head</b> on a portrait, a truck parked on its front end). In Experiment 2, colors were distributed over objects {{in a way that was}} either reasonable or anomalous (e. g., a green cup vs. a green hand). Subjects fixated the anomalous items earlier (both in time and in order of fixations) than the nondistorted objects, suggesting that violations of canonical form are detected peripherally and can affect the likelihood of fixating an item...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{the body}} {{underwater}} {{in the so-called}} vertical position, where the body is <b>inverted</b> (<b>head</b> down) and balanced, is made possible by performing the support scull movement by the upper limbs. In synchronized swimming, the main criteria for judging this vertical position are maintaining body stability and the maximum height of the lower limbs one is able to extend out of the water. There-fore, it seems important to examine for any correlations between the symmetry of the upper limb’s movement (sculling) {{and the ability to}} maintain balance of the body. The aim {{of this study was to}} use a dynamical asymmetry index (DAI) to assess the symmetry of the upper limb movements performed in synchronized swimming. The use of the dynamical asymmetry index is considered to be advantageous over the asymmetry coefficient, which is better known in literature on the subject and has been used by numerous authors, as it not only evaluates the magnitude of the asymmetry, but also indicates in which phases of movement asymmetry is the greatest or where it is the least significant. Key words: dynamical asymmetry index (DAI), stability, synchronized swimming 1...|$|R
40|$|In birds, the {{position}} and extent of the region of binocular vision appears {{to be determined by}} feeding ecology. Of prime importance {{is the degree to which}} vision is used for the precise control of bill position when pecking or lunging at prey. In birds that do not require such precision (probe and filter-feeders), the bill falls outside the binocular field, which extends above and behind the head, thus providing comprehensive visual coverage. Flamingos Phoenicopteridae are highly specialised filter-feeders. They employ a unique technique that does not require accurate bill positioning in which the <b>inverted</b> <b>head</b> is placed between the feet. Feeding flamingos often walk forwards with the head pointing "backwards". Here we show that in Lesser Flamingos Phoeniconaias minor visual fields are in fact the same as those of birds that feed by precision pecking and that feeding flamingos are blind in the direction of their walking. We suggest that this is due to the requirement for accurate bill placement when flamingos feed their chicks with "crop-milk", and possibly when building their nest. We propose that chick-feeding may be the ultimate determinant of visual field topography in birds, not feeding ecology...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe investigated, {{using three}} comparisons, {{perceived}} size and perceived distance of targets seen {{from between the}} legs. Five targets, varying from 32 to 163 cm in height, were presented at viewing distances of 2. 5 – 45 m, {{and a total of}} 90 observers verbally judged the perceived size and perceived distance of each target. In comparison 1, 15 observers <b>inverted</b> their <b>heads</b> upside down and saw the targets between their own legs; another 15 observers viewed them while being erect on the ground. The results showed that <b>inverting</b> the <b>head</b> lowered the degree of size constancy and compressed the scale for distance. To examine whether these results were due to an inversion of retinal-image or body orientation, comparisons 2 and 3 were performed. In comparison 2, 15 observers stood upright and saw the targets with prism goggles that rotated the visual field 180 °, while other 15 observers stood upright, but viewed the targets with a hollow frame lacking the prisms. The results showed that, in both goggle conditions, size constancy prevailed and perceived distance was a linear function of physical distance. In comparison 3, 15 observers wore the 180 ° rotation goggles and viewed the targets by bending their heads forwardly, and the other 15 observers viewed them while wearing hollow goggles and lying on the belly. The results showed a low degree of size constancy and compressed the scale for distance. Therefore, it is suggested that perceived size and perceived distance are affected by an inversion of body orientation, not of retinal image orientation. When path analysis and partial correlation analysis were applied to the whole data, perceived size was found to be independent of perceived distance. These results supported the direct perception model, rather than the apparent distance model...|$|R

40|$|The human Deleted in Azoospermia genes {{lie within}} the AZFc {{region of the}} Y {{chromosome}} that is frequently deleted in men with severe spermatogenic failure and male infertility. This thesis describes the evolution, structure and function of human DAZ genes. First, we determined that Y-linked DAZ genes arose by transposition from an autosomal ancestor during primate evolution, and were repeatedly amplified and pruned by multiple splicing mutations. This was the first example of acquisition of a male fertility factor by the Y chromosome independent of the X chromosome in any species. Then, we characterized the genomic structure and organization of four Y-linked DAZ genes in two clusters within the AZFc region. We found that each cluster has an <b>inverted</b> <b>head</b> to head pair of two DAZ genes. All DAZ genes appear capable of encoding DAZ proteins and two of these DAZ genes encode proteins with multimeric RNAbinding domains. We found transcripts from three DAZ genes. Next we determined the molecular nature of DAZ gene polymorphism in men. We deciphered 49 f/a TaqI polymorphism, which corresponds to polymorphism in 2. 4 kb repeats within all DAZ genes, and studied homogenization and deletion of {{one or the other}} DAZ gene cluster. We find that DAZ genes and corresponding DAZ proteins are highly polymorphic in different human Y chromosomal lineages. In the first appendix, we describe characterization of AZFc region deletions in three infertile men, two of whom have deletions of one DAZ cluster. In the second appendix, we describe partial rescue of the meiotic entry defect in Drosophila boule by overexpression of human DAZ and mouse DAZL proteins in testes of boule deficient flies. This functional assay suggests some functional conservation of DAZ and boule function. This thesis uncovers the genomic complexity, dynamic instability and evolution of a Y chromosomal gene family that is important for its role in human male fertility. by Richa Saxena. Thesis (Ph. D.)
