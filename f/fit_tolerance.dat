40|$|Abstract. The {{impeller}} mounted {{onto the}} compressor shaft assembly via interference fit {{is one of}} the key components of a centrifugal compressor stage. A suitable <b>fit</b> <b>tolerance</b> needs to be considered in the structural design. A locomotive-type turbocharger compressor with 24 blades under combined centrifugal and interference-fit loading was considered in the numerical analysis. The FE parametric quadratic programming (PQP) method which was developed based on the parametric variational principle (PVP) was used for the analysis of stress distribution of 3 D elastoplastic frictional contact of impeller-shaft sleeve-shaft. The solution of elastoplastic frictional contact problems belongs to the unspecified boundary problems where the interaction between two kinds of nonlinearities should occur. The effect of <b>fit</b> <b>tolerance,</b> rotational speed and the contact stress distribution on the contact stress was discussed in detail in the numerical computation.

Recommendations are worked out for assigning the shaft tolerance for different types of restoration with regard to the prescribed service life. The tolerance field shift by 10 - 13 % increases the durability of the joint and the system of the shaft repair dimensions increases it by 7 - 9 %. A rational method is found for restoring the shaft, i. e. working of the shaft to the repair dimension with surface plastic deformation which prolongs the service life by 12 - 17 %.

One of the methodologies adopted by manufacturers includes mass customization, which attempts to produce near custom made product at near mass production cost. Since swimwear requires tighter <b>fit</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{and still has}} fashion content, {{it has been used}} in this study to illustrate the ease of design change, design modification, and customization. Multi-style design of swimsuit is very demanding and time-consuming if traditional design methods are applied. Swimsuit manufacturers require systems with the capacity to deal with garment design process as a whole, including possibilities to work directly within a 3 D graphic environment. However, it is realised that one of the major challenges in garment design concerns the physically-based simulation of production and 3 D visualization. An innovation method consisting of a computer-aided design (CAD) system, allowing the designer to perform multi-style swimsuit design on a customized virtual human body, is presented in this paper. The 3 D visualization and personalization of the simulation results are presented to help the designers to preview and determine whether the design of the swimsuit is satisfactory and then obtain feedback to improve their designs iteratively. The new functions of the virtual system provide the abilities to perform intelligent design of various swimsuit styles and materials for different body parts according to individual design requirements.

40|$|Coordinate {{metrology}} aims {{to answer}} two questions: whether a manufactured part meets design tolerance specifications {{and how well}} the manufactured part meets the specifications. Existing methods for analyzing measured coordinate data are not adequate or effective for parts of complex tolerance zones. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} dimensional qualification of manufactured parts. In this paper, we view the part qualification problem as an issue of finding an admissible point in transformation space. Based on the concept of admissible point, we develop theories and algorithms for part geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) conformance check. A formulation based on containment <b>fit</b> for <b>tolerance</b> check is developed. An admissible transformation volume (ATV) is used to quantitatively characterize the quality of manufactured parts with respect to design tolerance specifications. We examine our approach in three tolerance examples and conclude that admissible transformation volume is an effective method for part dimensional quality gauging and it is especially useful for multi-tolerance zone check where traditional methods fail to address it effectively. ...|$|R

Joining efficiency, which {{is defined by the}} penetration depth achieved per unit of energy input, was correlated with the residual strain generation. It has been shown that to achieve a specific penetration depth, there is an optimum welding condition for each of the welding processes, which will give minimum tensile residual stress generation.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a recent CTEQ 6. 6 global analysis, we review a new {{technique}} for studying correlated theoretical uncertainties in hadronic observables associated with imperfect knowledge of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The technique is based on the computation of correlations between the predicted values of physical observables in the Hessian matrix method. It can be used, for example, to link the dominant PDF uncertainty in a hadronic cross section to PDFs for individual parton flavors at welldefined (x, µ) values. As an illustration, we apply the PDF correlation analysis to study regularities in the PDF dependence of Z, W, and Higgs boson production cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC. Theoretical description of LHC observables requires accurate parton distribution functions (PDFs), determined from a comprehensive fit of theoretical cross sections to a diverse range of experimental data. Reliability of the existing PDF parametrizations depends on our understanding of rich connections existing between PDFs of different flavors and in different kinematical ranges, arising as a consequence of physical symmetries (such as scale invariance or parton sum rules) and experimental constraints implemented in the global fit. This talk addresses the need to explore such connections effectively with the help of new quantitative tools provided by global PDF analyses. I will refer to the slides of the talk available at [1]. A convenient measure of the relation between the PDF dependence of two physical quantities X and Y is the angle ϕ formed by the gradient vectors ∇X and ∇Y in the space of N PDF parameters ai. The correlation angle was originally introduced in [2, 3] and systematically explored in {{the context of}} the recent CTEQ 6. 6 NLO PDF analysis [4]. Together with the usual PDF uncertainties ∆X and ∆Y, ϕ can be derived using the Hessian matrix method [2] from the values X ± ± i, Y i (i = 1, N) taken by X and Y for maximal positive (+) and negative (−) displacements for each PDF eigenparameter ai within the <b>fit’s</b> <b>tolerance</b> region.

50|$|When {{designing}} mechanical components, {{a system}} of standardized tolerances called International Tolerance grades are often used. The standard (size) tolerances are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight <b>fit.</b> The <b>tolerances</b> work {{in such a way}} that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog).|$|R

A number of cylindrical GFRP composite parts are finish machined by turning. These include axles, bearings, spindles, rolls and steering columns. There is always a tradeoff between quality and productivity during machining operations. Hence it becomes essential to evaluate the optimal cutting parameters setting in order to satisfy these opposing requirements. In this study, a hybrid multiobjective optimization algorithm involving grey and fuzzy coupled with Taguchi methodology is used. Four process parameters, each at three levels are selected for the study viz. cutting tool nose radius, cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Surface roughness parameter Ra, tangential cutting force Fz and material removal rate MRR are the chosen output performance measures. The experimental plan is laid according to Taguchi's orthogonal array L 27. Woven fabric based GFRP/ Epoxy tubes produced using hand layup process are finish turned using PCD cutting tool. Grey relational coefficients of the three performance measures are converted into a single multi performance characteristics index (MPCI) using Mamdani type fuzzy inference system.
