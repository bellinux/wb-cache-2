40|$|A {{vegetation}} {{map of the}} Crater District of Haleakala National Park {{was produced}} at a scale of I : 24, 000, {{which can be used}} as an overlay of the U. S. Geological Survey I : 24, 000 topographic quadrangle maps. Fifty-three structural-floristic communities, which were grouped into four structural vegetation types, were mapped. Areas were calculated for each community using an electronic planimeter. Topographic vegetation profiles were constructed that show changes in vegetation types in relation to climatic gradients. Correlations were observed between certain substrates and community types.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the present century much work has been done in America on tree growth, the greatest part of this being centered around growth exhibited by coniferous species. The literature is less extensive on growth studies of deciduous trees. MacDougal 2 ̆ 7 s work on radial growth with the dendrometer and <b>dendrograph</b> is too extensive for review in a paper of this type. Glock has given excellent review of results from study of annular rings. Dendrometer studies on deciduous trees in the midwest have been carried out by Beilmann, Friesner, and Lodewick. Recently Daubenmire and Peters using a new type of dendrometer have presented the results of comparative studies of coniferous and deciduous species in Idaho. Most of the radial growth studies has consisted of ring counting...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{small to}} large {{man-made}} lakes in Arizona (13 to 909 hectares) were surveyed for 44 variables of lake morphometry, watershed topography and climate, conservative and non-conservative water quality, and lake sediments. Water and sediment collections {{were made in}} two 14 -day sampling tours {{during the summer of}} 1976. R mode factor analysis technique reduced the original data set to 15 independent variables to be used in Q mode factor analysis and <b>dendrograph</b> lake classification. On the basis of the two clustering methods, six classes of lakes are indicated: 1) White Mountain, 2) Southern Arizona, 3) Salt River- Phoenix water supply, 4) Escudilla Mountain, 5) miscellaneous large irrigation, and 6) miscellaneous high altitude. Nine lakes are independent of all others. Predictions of water and sediment quality in Arizona lakes, based upon variables of lake morphometry, watershed topography and climate as selected by the R mode factor analysis technique, were performed using multiple regression analysis. The significant relationships found may be useful in the tentative prediction of water quality and fishery potential in unconstructed water bodies...|$|E

40|$|Taxonomic {{interpretations of}} the North American genus Robinia (Leguminosae) have been diverse, {{the number of species}} {{recognized}} varying from four to twenty. Field and herbarium studies, supplemented by cytological data and phenetic analysis now show clear distinctions between four species of Robinia: R. pseudoacacia L., R. hispida L., R. viscosa Vent., and R. neomexicana Gray. The latter two species each include two varieties. R. hispida L., consisting of four varieties, is a complex that includes a wide range of morphological variability. The preponderance of populations of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain Provinces of the southeastern United States are sterile, mostly triploid clones, reproducing only by root suckering. Populations that are both fertile and diploid are limited to the mountains of western North Carolina and adjacent eastern Tennessee. Preliminary cytological investigations indicate that sterility is due to either abnormal meiosis and non-functional gametes as a consequence of triploidy, or an unknown genetic mechanism in sterile diploids, resulting in failure to set fruit. Phenetic analyses of the species, their subordinate population groups (varieties), and occasional hybrids and hybrid swarms between species, largely corroborates cytological, exomorphic, and geographic data. The phenetic presentation includes <b>dendrographs</b> from cluster analyses and a three-dimensional plot from principal components analysis;A generic description and a key to species is provided, and each taxon is accompanied by a description, key to varieties (if applicable), list of synonyms, distribution map, and illustration.

40|$|The Polyporaceae are a {{large group}} of wood-rotting fungi {{belonging}} to the basidiomycetes. They are generally recognized by their leathery or corky sporocarps which usually have a poroid hymenophore. Early classification of this family consisted of about a dozen genera. More recent treatments have recognized over 100 polypore genera. Because many of these new taxa are based on a subjective evaluation, this study has explored a more objective method for establishing generic limits in the Polyporaceae;Twenty species distributed in nine genera were selected primarily on the basis of availability for electrophoresis. These 20 taxa were assayed for eight enzymes by means of horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. A total of 108 bands were identified, and these data were analyzed by numerical analysis. Morphological data based on 24 characters were also analyzed by similar methods. The results are presented as <b>dendrographs</b> and ordinations. Cluster analyses of morphological and electrophoretic data consisted of similar groups of species. Ordination of both types of data produced only a few discrete taxonomic groupings, but gradations of certain OTUs still reflect some taxonomic integrity;The special significance {{of this study is that}} there is taxonomic congruence between the morphological and electrophoretic data. That is, one classification based on one set of characters reflect a classification obtained by a separate class of characters. The misplaced OTUs and lack of discrete clusters for certain species may be due to the small sample sizes employed in this study. Other sources of distortion may be caused by different algorithms and ordinations techniques used in the analyses of different types of data;A checklist of the polypores of Iowa is also presented in this study. This inventory is based on an examination of specimens from the SUI Herbarium and recent field collections. An updated nomenclature for 151 species distributed in 59 genera is included in the checklist...|$|R
40|$|A marine {{survey was}} {{conducted}} {{in the vicinity of}} the present and proposed Wai'anae sewage ocean outfall site on the southwest coast of 0 'ahu, Hawai'i. The survey at depths of 6 to 30 m (20 - 100 ft) characterized quantitatively the coral reef community, the reef fish population, and micromolluscan assemblages. Diversity indices were calculated for substrate, fish, and micromollusks. Similarity indices were computed and a <b>dendrograph</b> was generated for all stations. The stations could be clustered into three distinct regions: (1) a deep-water region (18 - 30 m depth) with smooth hard algae-covered limestone substrate and sand, low fish abundance and diversity, low micromollusk diversity with high abundance of dialids, and low abundance of archaeogastropods and rissoids; (2) a shallow-water region (6 - 18 m depth) with comparatively high coral cover, high fish abundance and diversity, high micromollusk diversity with low abundance of dialids and high abundance of rissoids and archeogastropods; and (3) the region along the harbor channel at Pōka'ī Bay where coral cover, fish abundance and diversity, and micromolluscan species abundance were distinctly different from those of other stations, indicating a probable influence by the boat harbor and channel on the benthic community. The sewage effluent has not adversely influenced coral growth {{in the vicinity of the}} outfall diffuser, although increased nutrients may account for high abundance of frondose algae at this station.

40|$|Palynology {{involves}} {{the study of}} past climatic and environmental changes through changes in the relative frequencies of different pollen types through time. Several multivariate statistical methods are suggested which can help {{in the description of}} patterns within pollen data. These techniques are based on comparisons between samples. Samples were compared using the product-moment correlation coefficient computed from data which had been subjected to a centering transformation. The methods are described using a geometric model. If there are m samples and n pollen types, then the data can be regarded as a set of m points in an n-dimensional space. Cluster analysis produces a <b>dendrograph</b> or clustering tree in which samples are grouped with other samples {{on the basis of their}} similarity to each other. Principal component analysis produces a set of variates which are linear combinations of the pollen samples, are uncorrelated with each other, and do the best job of describing the data using a minimum number of dimensions. This method is useful in reducing the dimensionality of data sets. Varimax rotation acts on a subset of the principal components to make them easier to interpret. Discriminant analysis is used to find the best way to tell groups of samples apart, where the groups are known a priori. Once a means of discrimination among groups has been established using samples whose groups are known, unknown samples may be classified into the original groups. Canonical analysis produces a way to display the maximum separation between groups in a graphic manner. Examples of applications of these methods in palynology are shown using data from Osgood Swamp, California, and from southern Arizona. These methods offer the advantages of reproducibility of results and speed in pattern description. Once the patterns in the data have been described, however, their interpretation must be done by the palynologist...|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. A vegetation map of the Crater District of Haleakala National Park was produced at a scale o f 1 : 24, 000 which can be used as an overlay of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle maps. Fifty-three structural-floristic communities were mapped which were grouped into four structural vegetation-types (forest, scrub, grassland, and high altitude desert). Areas were calculated for each community using an electronic planimeter. The total area mapped was 7544. 8 ha (18, 643 acres). Topographic vegetation profiles were constructed which show changes in vegetation-types in relation to climatic gradients. Also, matching correlations were observed between certain substrates and community-types. Phytosociological analyses of releve (vegetation sample) data by the synthesis table technique and the <b>dendrograph</b> technique resulted in ecologically meaningful groupings. Both analyses produced similar groupings though detailed comparison {{of the results of the}} two methods revealed interesting minor variations. Some releves were left ungrouped. These were interpreted as unique community types within the sampling area. The hypothesis that the community-types that are characteristic of other tropical alpine and subalpine ecosystems occur in the Crater District of Haleakala National Park was partially supported by the map units and phytosociological analyses of the releve data. Ericaceous (pukiawe-type) scrub, tussock grassland, and high a 1 titude desert occur as mappable vegetation units. Only arborescent and rosette life-forms did not occur as mappable units. However, a rosette life-form, Argyroxiphium sandwicense DC. (silversword), does occur in the study area and may have had a wider and more abundant distribution in the past. The hypothesis that the vegetation map of the Crater District of Haleakala National Park has similar vegetation units and vegetation-types as those mapped by Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg (1974) for the tropical alpine and subalpine ecosystem on the slopes of Mauna Loa in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was supported by a comparison of the two maps. Variation of the vegetation within the study area was associated with variations in climate, substrate, mechanical influences, and the effects of exotic plant species. Climate diagrams confirmed the tropical high mountain character of the study area, while they also illustrated the considerable variation of climate within the Crater as well as its seasonal variation. It was concluded that the diurnal (daily) frost boundary, as indicated by the vegetation, should be used to define the lower limit of the alpine zone in tropical high mountain areas. This conclusion implies that the subalpine zone be defined as those are as below the diurnal frost boundary and above the montane forests and grasslands.

40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 173 - 181. Analysis of {{the pattern}} of zonation of reef corals off the Kona coast of Hawaii {{revealed}} the existence of four clearly defined zones. This pattern was confirmed at three sites where corals were counted using a series of 45 meter long transects running parallel to shore from depths of 3 to 40 meters. Clustering analysis <b>dendrographs,</b> spatial changes in illumination and rates of water movement, as well as growth and survival of coral transplants also confirmed the zonation pattern. Each of the four zones {{is characterized by a}} dominant coral species, substratum type, depth, and range of physical conditions. Each zone also appears to be in a different stage of community succession due to the frequency of large scale environmental disturbances from winter storm waves. The shallowest zone begins {{at the base of the}} shoreline cliff, ranges in depth from 2. 5 to 8 meters, and has a bottom cover consisting mainly of irregularly shaped basaltic boulders; Pocillopora meandrina dominates coral cover in this zone. This species appears to be the first to colonize new substrata and persists in large numbers only in the near-shore boulder zone where mechanical stress from wave action is great enough to restrict the growth forms of more competitive species. Due to this high wave stress, the P. meandrina bolder zone appears to be in an early successional stage with low coral cover and dominance and relatively hiqh species diversity. Moving into deeper water the Porites lobata reef building zone ranges in depth from 6 to 14 meters and is characterized by a gently sloping solid basalt and limestone bottom. Porites lobata dominates coral cover by growing in massive lobed and encrusting colonies. While succession seems to be in an advanced stage, monopolization of available space does not appear to be complete enough to exclude a variety of less competitive species, resulting in relatively high species diversities. The third zone occurs on the reef slope and ranges in depth from 14 to 30 meters. Solid substrata is scarce and succession may be a late stage due to domination of bottom cover by thickets of Porites compressa. Most of the other species that persist in this zone avoid competitive interactions by growing above the level of P. compressa. Storm wave stress is most devastating to corals in this zone, and breakage of living colonies seems to increase diversity by reducing P. compressa dominance. Transport of living coral fragments appears to extend zonal boundaries and create new colonies. Extensive "rubble channels" occur in this zone, and these channels may get progressively larger due to churning of rubble fragments with each successive storm. The Porites lobata rubble zone occurs below the deep border of the P. compressa thickets and extends to approximately 50 meters, the depth at which coraIs cease to appear. Substrata consists mostly of fine sand and a variety of small encrusting corals are found growing on scattered rubble fragments. Specialized species with narrow physiological tolerances limited to this zone also increase species diversity. While maximum size of corals may be reduced in this zone due to low light intensity, lack of solid substrata probably determines the lower depth limit of coral occurance. Sand and rubble that is carried downslope during storms cause this zone to be physically unstable and succession appears to be constantly interrupted at early stages. This is in contrast to other deep reef areas, such as off Maui and the Red Sea, where substrata is solid to the depth limit of coral growth. These communities appear to be highly stable and diverse, and in late or climax stages. The depauperate nature of Hawaiian coral fauna is probably due to fairly rigorous environmental conditions in combination with difficulties in larval transport from coral evolutionary centers in the western Pacific. However, reef areas off Kona are relatively rich for Hawaii due to complete protection from tradewind generated seas, partial protection from long period north swells, and the steep nearshore slopes that extend below wavebase...|$|R
