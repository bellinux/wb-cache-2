After Hitler committed suicide, Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on 2 May to avoid capture by the Soviets. Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station. The body was buried nearby on 8 May 1945, {{but was not}} found and confirmed as Bormann's until 1972. Bormann was tried in absentia by the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 and 1946.

5|$|The Allies {{commenced}} {{legal proceedings}} against captured Nazis, establishing the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> at Nuremberg in 1945. The first war crimes trial of 24 prominent {{figures such as}} Göring, Albert Speer, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945. They were accused of four counts: conspiracy, waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law. Twelve received the death penalty, including Kaltenbrunner, {{who was convicted of}} crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946. The former commandant at Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, who testified on behalf of Kaltenbrunner and others, was tried and executed in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The SS was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims in the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E

5|$|Following Nazi Germany's collapse, the SS {{ceased to}} exist. Numerous {{members of the}} SS, many of them still {{committed}} Nazis, remained at large in Germany and across Europe. On 21 May 1945, the British captured Himmler, who was in disguise and using a false passport. At an internment camp near Lüneburg, he committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule. Several other leading members of the SS fled, but some were quickly captured. Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA and the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief upon Himmler's suicide, was captured and arrested in the Bavarian Alps. He was among the 24 defendants put on trial at the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> in 1945–46.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{responsible}} for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> for the Far East. In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and Manila massacre. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and {{of which he was}} probably unaware. Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila was ending.|$|E
5|$|Additional SS {{trials and}} {{convictions}} followed. Many defendants attempted to exculpate themselves using the excuse {{that they were}} merely following superior orders, which they had to obey unconditionally {{as part of their}} sworn oath and duty. The courts did not find this to be a legitimate defense. A trial of 40 SS officers and guards from Auschwitz took place in Kraków in November 1947. Most were found guilty, and 23 received the death penalty. In addition to those tried by the Western allies, an estimated 37,000 members of the SS were tried and convicted in Soviet courts. Sentences included hangings and long terms of hard labor. Piotr Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, estimates that of the 70,000 members of the SS involved in crimes in concentration camps, only about 1,650 to 1,700 were tried after the war. The <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> declared the SS a criminal organization in 1946.|$|E
2500|$|While the Nuremberg Tribunals {{failed to}} charge Nazi war criminals with rape, {{witnesses}} testified about it occurring.

[...] Similarly, {{it would have been}} possible to prosecute war rape as crime against humanity under Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter: [...] "other inhumane acts" [...] and [...] "enslavement". However, notwithstanding evidence of sexual violence in Europe during World War II, a lack of will led to rape and sexual violence not being prosecuted at the Nuremberg Tribunals.|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the {{prosecution}} by the Allies of thousands of enemy war criminals in Europe and the Far East, {{and the creation of}} <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunals</b> at Nuremberg and Tokyo, are seen by many as a landmark in the development of international criminal law. This development is widely asserted to have given rise to universal jurisdiction over war crimes for {{the prosecution}} of perpetrators of gross human rights offences. By using primary research, {{the purpose of this article}} is to challenge the perceived emergence of universal jurisdiction and to show that it has been allowed to develop as a myth, a hollow concept. The article seeks to provide an alternative view, by arguing that jurisdiction over war crimes is better explained as an important development of the protective principle, which was exercised collectively by some Allies, for the punishment of a ‘common enemy’...|$|R

5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy to wage a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement in decision making. Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy to wage a war of aggression. On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging, with the provision that if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E
5|$|The Empire of Japan invaded {{other parts}} of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). The Imperial Japanese Army swiftly {{captured}} the capital Nanjing and conducted the Nanking Massacre. In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, British forces in Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, bringing the United States and the United Kingdom into World War II in the Pacific. After Allied victories across the Pacific during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on August 15. The war cost Japan, its colonies, China and the war's other combatants {{tens of millions of}} lives and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories. The Allies also convened the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> for the Far East on May 3, 1946, to prosecute some Japanese leaders for war crimes. However, the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers despite calls for the trial of both groups.|$|E

40|$|The {{trials of}} German and Japanese state {{officials}} following {{the end of}} World War II at the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunals</b> in Nuremberg and Tokyo along with treaty obligations undertaken by states since at least the establishment of the United Nations, have together given rise {{to the question of whether}} states and their officials are entitled to immunity for violations of human rights. This question was highlighted by the case against Pinochet Ugarte of Chile, which came more recently before the United Kingdom House of Lords. The case propelled the immunity of state officials into the limelight of judicial and academic discourse and resulted in increased human rights advocacy for accountability against senior state officials. Since the 1990 s, the practice of the United Nations Security Council of establishing ad hoc international criminal tribunals under their peace and security mandate, and the referral to the International Criminal Court and/or its preliminary investigation of later cases arising from conflicts in places like Darfur, Libya, and North Eastern Nigeria, sustain the impetus for this article...|$|R

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} about the post-war {{retribution}} on all its levels, from <b>international</b> <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> in Nuremberg and Tokyo to work of two extraordinary people's courts in Plzeň and Most, of whose activity the text applies. The text aims on women, because previous theses were mostly focused on men, which hold the more important position in the Nazi regime. On account of different roles of both sexes there is a diverse structure of committed crimes - the most frequented type of crimes for men were crimes against the state, while in a women's case it was denunciation. This fact could be partly explained by lesser possibilities of women for direct using of a repressive apparatus of the regime. The aim of the thesis is {{to bring in a}} comparison of activity of both mentioned courts against women. Main difference between those two regions is that the most of the Plzeň region was in Czech inland, but the Most area was located in the borderlands with a German majority.

40|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{the axis}} leaders were tried for waging a war of aggression. The <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunals</b> in Nuremberg and Tokyo were the last to try and punish {{individuals}} for committing such an offence. With the creation of the International Criminal Court great effort has been put into producing a clear definition of aggression that would allow the international community to once again exercise jurisdiction over this crime. The working group that was given this task managed to prepare a set of draft articles for the Assembly of States Parties to vote on. The draft articles consisted of the definition of the crime of aggression {{as well as of the}} rules under which the court would be allowed to exercise its jurisdiction. As no consensus was reached within the working group on the rules of jurisdiction, different alternatives were proposed. The aim of this article is to examine and analyze the various alternatives offered by the working group and to give an assessment of the draft definition of aggression. This article argues that the best solution is to opt for a regulation that gives the court the broadest jurisdiction available. Only by having extensive competence will the court be able to uphold the rule of law. In addition, the author believes that despite some minor drafting flaws, the definition of crime of aggression has the potential to bring forth a new world order where perpetrators of this most serious crime could not escape the clutches of justice...|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMObjective of {{the study}} – The primary goal of this {{research}} {{study was to investigate}} and document the evolution and historical development of the crime of aggression. Design / methodology / approach – The research study was primarily a desk-top based research by design and methodology. It reviews a range of published books, expert commentaries, and journal articles that provide theoretical and practical research on the evolution and development of crime of aggression through the past centuries to the present day. The discussion is majorly premised around key historical debates and events that shaped, and defined the rubric of the crime of aggression. These include: the philosophers' conceptualisation of the doctrine of "just war" or "unjust war", states' practice before and after the First World War and Second World War, the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunals,</b> the birth and role of the United Nations, the 1998 Rome Conference and the 2010 Kampala ICC Review Conference. Findings – This study provides information on each author's perspective on the status of the crime of aggression before and after the First ICC Review Conference. The study generally concedes that although today the crime of aggression is defined under the Rome Statute, and the jurisdiction of the ICC over it spelt out; its status under the treaty regime remains distinctly different from that under international customary law. Significance {{of the study}} – The significance of this research study {{lies in the fact that}} it is useful with regard to documenting the historical development of the crime of aggression. It also fulfils an identified need to clarify the position of the crime of aggression after the landmark First ICC Review Conference that took place in Kampala during May / June 2010.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the way in}} which the concept of criminal law defences for individuals has been imported to international law and the consequences of doing so. The idea of defending one’s criminal act with a legally defined reason which removes criminal responsibility originates in national law. Self-defence is a good example of the ‘best’ kind of defence to plead: acquittal will result where serious assault, for example, was only committed against an attacker in order to save one’s life. Domestic law places restrictions on the availability of such defences, particularly where serious offences such as murder are concerned and more flexible defences, such as duress, tend to be limited in their application to more serious crimes against the person. For example, self-defence is accepted as a full defence for murder in most jurisdictions, but there is a far greater reluctance to allow duress as a full defence for murder. In some jurisdictions, duress is not even recognised as a defence in the first place. At the international level, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court has codified defences, directly importing a number of recognisable defences from domestic legal systems. However, {{the way in which}} this has been done is problematic: the Rome Statute was drafted to prosecute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, yet it does not restrict or limit the application of any of the defences for the most serious crimes, as domestic systems tend to do. The first part to this thesis demonstrates the way in which national law has been used as a source of principles for the concept of defences, leading to the conclusion that the defences have been imported in part from domestic law. This part to the argument looks at the influence of domestic law at the international level, acknowledging it as a source of and influence on international law and demonstrates the close connection between both. It then turns to the use of domestic defences before internationalised <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> and the <b>International</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunals</b> at Tokyo and Nuremberg, concluding that defences have been available but were inapplicable, given the nature and seriousness of the crimes. The codification of defences in the Rome Statute is then explored, identifying the use of domestic law at the international level. However, this use is considered problematic where the crimes are so serious and the defence of duress is identified as a particularly flexible, and thus undesirable, defence for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The second part builds on this argument by undertaking a comparative study of the defence of duress at the national level to demonstrate the lack of consensus in relation to the concept for even one charge of murder, before exploring the definition and inclusion of duress in the Rome Statute. The thesis concludes by identifying ways in which the structure of defences in the Rome Statute could be improved in order to further the aim of the creation of the International Criminal Court: the avoidance of impunity...|$|R
