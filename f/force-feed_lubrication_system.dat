40|$|Preliminary bench {{tests have}} been carried out on an original-design 2 -stroke single-cylinder {{prototype}} engine, which is equipped with an electronically controlled gasoline direct injection apparatus. The main design and operating features of the engine concern: a unidirectional airflow during the scavenging process (from the inlet ports near the BDC to overhead cam-actuated valves), an external air pump (a Roots volumetric type driven by an electric motor) and a <b>force-feed</b> <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> like those usually exploited in mass-produced 4 -stroke engines. Experimental bench tests were carried out under low load, intermediate rotational speed operating conditions. The performances were compared to those obtained from a commercial crankcase-scavenged 2 -stroke engine using an indirect injection fuel feeding system. Encouraging results were obtained as far as fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are concerned. Other improvements are expected thanks to scheduled modifications regarding a new piston design along with a new arrangement of both the spark-plugs and the injector positio...|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} 2 -stroke prototype engine, {{equipped with}} an electronically controlled gasoline direct-injection apparatus, has been tested {{over the last few}} years, and the performances of these tests have been compared with those obtained using a commercial crankcase-scavenged 2 -stroke engine. Very satisfactory results have been obtained, as far as fuel consumption and unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas are concerned. Large reductions in fuel consumption and in unburned hydrocarbons have been made possible, because the injection timing causes all the injected gasoline to remain in the combustion chamber, and thus {{to take part in the}} combustion process. Moreover, a <b>force-feed</b> <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> like those usually exploited in mass-produced 4 -stroke engines, has been employed, because of the presence of an external pump. In fact, it is no longer necessary to add oil to the gasoline in the engine, as the gasoline does not pass through the crankcase volume. The aim of this paper is to present the main features of a new 2 -stroke engine, which mainly pertain to the adoption of a turbo compressor for the scavenging and supercharging processes, as well as a small volumetric impeller for the start transitory. Because of its limited size, weight and high specific power output, this engine should be of particular interest for range extender applications in electric vehicles. A numerical simulation has been carried out, to confirm results of the experimental phase, by means of a one-dimensional model that has furnished encouraging results...|$|E

40|$|Flooded oil <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems</b> are {{commonly}} utilized for many manufacturing processes. However, {{there is an}} increasing concern with the flooded <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems</b> due to their biological and envi-ronmental impact {{as well as their}} maintenance and disposal cost. Polymer-based material, a sponge-like solid lubricant allowing the oil to weep out while in use, provides a promising alternative environ-mentally benign lubrication solution to satisfy the lubrication requirements for some manufacturing processes. In addition, it can minimize contamination of the coolant system, reduce waste processing and disposal costs, and alleviate the in-plant safety hazard from oil leakage on floor surfaces. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop and improve the current <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> by applying a poly-mer-based near-dry <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> in order to replace the oil flooded transfer line lubrication sys-tems currently in production use. Using a laboratory reciprocating bench test based on the design of experiments, this study characterized the tribological performance of the polymer-based <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> under a variety of operating conditions, identified the main factor that impacts the tribologi-cal performance of the polymer-based <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> and developed a model to predict the wear loss of the polymer-based lubricant plate.

40|$|The {{selection}} criteria for lubricating grease in rolling bearings {{are different from}} those for a <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> that provides the bearings with grease. For optimum performance in bearings, the main properties are related to lubrication, whereas for optimum performance in a <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> the grease should fulfill flow criteria. The main flow properties of a grease are its viscosity at low shear rates (including shear thinning) and its yield stress. In this article, a simple and robust method is described to measure both parameters simultaneously. The method is based on measuring flow through a pipe, simulating the so-called venting process, which makes the method directly applicable to <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems.</b> The Ventmeter measurements are compared to those obtained with plate–plate and capillary flow rheometers. It will be shown that the measured effective viscosity can readily be used to predict the pressure drop in <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems,</b> which makes it possible to design the system for optimum performanc...|$|R

40|$|Wind energy {{accounts}} for 9. 1 % {{of the total}} energy capacity in Europe. Recent studies have raised critical questions regarding the dependability of current wind turbines. The statistical data reveals that gear box is the most critical component reducing dependability caused by increased failure rate, downtime, and high repair cost (J. Ribrant and L. Bertling, 2007). Gear box failures in wind farms reveal a staggering 19. 4 % of downtime of operation (J. Ribrant and L. Bertling, 2007). A significant reduction in the failure rate has been observed in the recent years, but downtime of operation and high repair investment still remains a bottleneck. Wear is the most critical failure mode {{and a number of}} theories have been proposed {{in order to understand the}} system behavior of wear mechanism. The empirical and historical incident data shows that the <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> has the largest share of contribution of gearbox failures and wear rate. On other hand, a number of commercial <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> have developed to cope with wear mechanism, however, these systems have different capabilities and characteristics and needed to be assessed in a new life cycle perspective. The purpose of the thesis is to analyze the influence of <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> on the current problem of wear in Wind Turbine Gearbox and improve the existing <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> architecture.
