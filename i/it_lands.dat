5|$|Homer and Bart are {{watching}} television {{when they are}} interrupted by Lisa playing her saxophone in her bedroom. Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her, but he inadvertently tosses it out the window. <b>It</b> <b>lands</b> {{in the middle of}} the street and is run over by traffic and stomped on by Nelson Muntz. In a period of mourning, Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever not having that saxophone, so Homer recounts the instrument's origins.|$|E
5|$|While Sayid is gone, Daniel asks Regina (Zoë Bell), a {{colleague}} on the freighter {{to shoot a}} projectile onto the island. Regina does so, but the projectile does not arrive for thirty minutes. When <b>it</b> <b>lands,</b> Daniel extracts a clock from the payload and finds that the two times, that running {{on the island and}} that running outside, are not synchronized.|$|E

5|$|White-bellied sea eagles feed alone, in pairs, or {{in family}} groups. A pair may {{cooperate}} to hunt. Prey can be eaten while {{the bird is}} flying or when <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> on a raised platform such as its nest. The white-bellied sea eagle skins the victim as it eats it. It is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food, and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when <b>it</b> <b>lands.</b> Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) discovers a bat in the ceiling. It flies {{through the}} office, sending the {{employees}} scurrying for cover. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and {{is turning into}} a vampire. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5:00 passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith who continues {{to hide in the}} breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> on Meredith's head.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{crossed the}} frozen Danube early in 1242. A Mongol {{detachment}} {{under the command}} of Kadan, a son of Great Khan Ögödei, chased Béla from town to town in Dalmatia. Béla took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir. Before Kadan laid siege to the town in March, news arrived of the Great Khan's death. Batu Khan wanted to attend at the election of Ögödei's successor with sufficient troops and ordered the withdrawal of all Mongol forces. Béla, who was grateful to Trogir, granted <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> near Split, causing a lasting conflict between the two Dalmatian towns.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E

5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before <b>it</b> <b>lands,</b> the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
25|$|House dust {{can become}} {{airborne}} easily. Care is required when removing dust to avoid causing the dust to become airborne. A feather duster tends to agitate the dust so <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> elsewhere. Products like Pledge and Swiffer are specifically made for removing dust by trapping it with sticky chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Penny flipping, coin tossing, or {{heads or}} tails is the {{practice}} of throwing a coin {{in the air and}} checking which side is showing when <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> to choose between two alternatives, sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties.

25|$|The {{flight is}} slow, with quick, shallow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides; the bird rarely if ever soars. When <b>it</b> <b>lands,</b> it will jerk the tail forcefully {{just like a}} wagtail. A laughing falcon frequently and often conspicuously stays on a perch for hours, sitting upright and observing the ground alertly, sometimes flicking its tail or nodding, or moving around a bit on its perch with slow, cautious little steps. It is generally peaceful and unlike other falcons will not harm smaller birds.|$|E
25|$|At {{the funeral}} of an old man's wife, mourners are {{gathered}} by an open grave, among them her husband (Bela Lugosi). Overhead, an airliner is heading toward Burbank, California. The pilot Jeff Trent (Gregory Walcott) and his co-pilot Danny (David De Mering) are blinded by a bright light and loud sound. They look outside and see a flying saucer. The pilots follow the saucer's flight until <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> at the graveyard, where the funeral's gravediggers are killed by a female zombie (Maila Nurmi).|$|E
25|$|In the mid-10th century, a new {{internal}} {{challenge to}} the authority of the Armenian Church and the kingdom arose when the Tondrakians experienced a revival. An anti-feudal and heretical Christian sect that had been crushed by the Arabs with the Armenian Church’s support in the 9th century, the Tondrakian movement attracted many followers during this period. Ashot III had realized the danger the Tondrakians posed against the kingdom and this was of his reasons why he directly subjected the Church to him, gave <b>it</b> <b>lands,</b> and sponsored the construction of new monasteries and churches. The message of the Tondrakians, however, continued to spread and successive Armenian kings would work to suppress its expansion.|$|E

25|$|Bolo punch : Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which {{owes its}} power to the {{shortening}} of a circular arc rather than to transference of body weight; it tends {{to have more of}} an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the Ali shuffle. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former welterweight champions Sugar Ray Leonard, and Kid Gavilan. Middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.|$|E
25|$|Lucilia cuprina {{is often}} used as a very helpful tool to aid medical and {{forensic}} professionals. It {{is known to be}} one of the first flies to occupy a corpse upon its death. Once <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> on a corpse, it continues in the formation of its next generation by laying its eggs. The eggs are followed by its larva, pupa and finally the adult. Forensic professionals may form a postmortem interval by the life stage found on the corpse. L. cuprina, although it is a worldwide pest, is very climate specific. It occupies dryer climates. A forensic investigator may conclude that a corpse has been relocated from its original location if it is found in a moist climate with L. cuprina on it.|$|E
25|$|Lisa {{protests that}} the Simpsons cannot accept the tobacco executives' money, but Homer misinterprets this {{statement}} and rejects the offer as insulting, demanding $150 billion for tomacco, which they refuse. Dumped {{back at the}} farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. With only one plant left, the family runs into the house, where Lisa urges Homer to destroy it, but Homer refuses until the livestock breaks in. He tosses the plant {{into the air and}} <b>it</b> <b>lands</b> {{in the hands of a}} Laramie executive. The executives' helicopter leaves, but a tomacco-addicted sheep has sneaked on board and attacks them. The helicopter crashes, killing everyone on board except for the sheep and destroying the final tomacco plant. The Simpsons return home to find that the Southern gentleman and his wife are still waiting for Homer to go through the duel. Homer does and is shot in the arm, but declines to go to the hospital until after eating one of Marge's mincemeat pies.|$|E
