2500|$|Crossbows were {{eventually}} replaced in warfare by gunpowder weapons, although early guns had slower rates {{of fire and}} much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows. The Battle of Cerignola in 1503 was largely won by Spain {{through the use of}} matchlock <b>firearms,</b> <b>marking</b> the first time a major battle was won through the use of firearms. Later, similar competing tactics would feature harquebusiers or musketeers in formation with pikemen, pitted against cavalry firing pistols or carbines. While the military crossbow had largely been supplanted by firearms on the battlefield by 1525, the sporting crossbow in various forms remained a popular hunting weapon in Europe until the eighteenth century. [...] Up until the seventeenth century most beekeepers in Europe kept their hives spread across the woods and had to defend them against bears. Therefore, their guild was granted {{the right to bear arms}} and is commonly depicted carrying heavy crossbows.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1969, {{police and}} {{civilian}} <b>firearm</b> and tool <b>mark</b> examiners regularly met during annual {{meetings of the}} American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) to discuss concerns specific to their field.|$|R
50|$|Dowling {{spent the}} summer of 1863 at the earthen fort instructing his men in gunnery. To mark the optimum {{distance}} and elevation {{for each of the}} guns, he implemented the technique of setting long slender poles (painted white, in this instance) in both channels at several places. This was an old method for guiding boats and, especially since the advent of <b>firearms,</b> to <b>mark</b> an aiming points for guns.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{firearms}} were inferior in {{rate of fire}} (a Tudor English author expects eight {{shots from}} the English longbow in the time needed for a [...] "ready shooter" [...] to give five from the musket), and François Bernier reports that well-trained mounted archers at the Battle of Samugarh in 1658 were [...] "shooting six times before a musketeer can fire twice". Firearms were also very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had a longer effective range (up to 200 yards for the longbow, up to 600 yards for the musket), greater penetration, and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also penetrated steel armour without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. The Battle of Cerignola in 1503 was won by Spain mainly {{by the use of}} matchlock <b>firearms,</b> <b>marking</b> the first time a major battle was won through the use of firearms.|$|R

40|$|Every firearm has {{individual}} characteristics {{that are as}} unique to it as fingerprints are to human beings. When a firearm is fired, it transfers these characteristics – {{in the form of}} microscopic scratches and dents – to the fired bullets and cartridge casings. The rifling of the barrel of the <b>firearm</b> <b>marks</b> the bullets travelling through it, and the <b>firearm's</b> breech mechanism <b>marks</b> the ammunition's cartridge casing. Characterising these marks is the critical element in identifying firearms. Traditionally the comparison of ballistic evidence has been a tedious and time-consuming process requiring highly skilled examiners. In the past decade, engineers have created automated ballistics identification systems that meld traditional comparison microscopes with digital cameras, computers, huge databases, and image analysis techniques. This kind of system can help investigators to link crimes by automatically finding similarities among images of bullet but suffering significant drawbacks and minimal matching. More recently, approaches based on 3 D digital representations of evidence surface topography have started to appear, both in research and industrial products. Potentially the introduction of 3 D surface topography measurement can overcome the limitations of digital imaging systems by making the bullet surface measurement reproducible and reliable. A 3 D quantitative approach for bullet identification is proposed in this paper. In this system the surface topography of the whole bullet can be acquired for analysis and identification. Primary researches have been done by applying advanced surface topography techniques for bullet marks’ characteristics extraction. A variety of 2 D and 3 D visualization graphics have also been provided to help firearm examiners to make final decisions...|$|R
5000|$|Model: Many <b>firearms</b> are not <b>marked</b> {{with a model}} designation, {{and many}} models look identical. The {{configuration}} of a firearm can sometimes be easily changed by exchanging parts to conform to a completely different model, or a completely different manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|According to Walther “Plus-P” (+P) {{overpressure}} ammunition {{may affect}} the wear characteristics of the PPQ pistol or exceed the margin of safety. Use of “Plus-P” ammunition may, according to Walther, result in {{the need for more}} frequent service.Walther recommends against the use of “Plus-P-Plus” (+P+) overpressure ammunition in Walther <b>firearms.</b> This <b>marking</b> on the ammunition designates that it exceeds established industry standards, but the designation does not represent defined pressure limits and therefore such ammunition may vary significantly as to the pressures generated.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, 35 {{examiners}} {{from the}} United States and Canada {{met at the}} Chicago Police Department Crime Laboratory and formed the Association of <b>Firearm</b> and Tool <b>Mark</b> Examiners. The first official Association publication was AFTE Newsletter Number 1, published on May 15, 1969. In 1972, {{the title of the}} publication was changed to AFTE Journal.|$|R
5000|$|Membership in the Association {{is limited}} to persons [...] "of integrity" [...] with {{suitable}} education, training and experience in the examination of <b>firearms</b> and/or tool <b>marks.</b> Membership levels include Provisional, Regular, Distinguished and Emeritus.

50|$|Forensic {{ballistics}} involves {{analysis of}} bullets and bullet impacts to determine information {{of use to}} a court or other part of a legal system. Separately from ballistics information, <b>firearm</b> and tool <b>mark</b> examinations ("ballistic fingerprinting") involve analyzing firearm, ammunition, and tool mark evidence {{in order to establish}} whether a certain firearm or tool was used in the commission of a crime.|$|R
50|$|He evolved {{a simple}} {{technique}} to identify old suspected bullet hit marks by lifting the impression using a moldable putty which neither damaged nor made it unfit for further examination of suspected <b>firearm</b> bullet hit <b>marks.</b> More than 2-year-old marks were detected by Professor Dogra at many scenes of occurrences; {{that is why}} people started calling it as a Dogra's test.|$|R
40|$|Data on {{disparities in}} {{mortality}} within low and {{middle income countries}} are limited, with little published data from the Caribbean or Central America. Our aim was to investigate disparities in overall and cause specific premature adult mortality in the multi-ethnic middle income country of Belize. Mortality data from Belize 2008 - 2010 classified using the International Classification of Diseases 10 and the 2010 census stratified by age and ethnicity were used to calculate age, sex, and ethnic specific mortality rates for those 15 - 59 years, and life table {{analysis was used to}} estimate the probability of death between the ages of 15 and 59 (45 q 15). The probability of death among those aged 15 to 59 years was 18. 1 % (women 13. 5 %, men 22. 7 %). Creole and Garifuna ethnic groups have three times the 45 q 15 probability of death compared to Mayan and Mestizo groups (Creole 31. 2 %, Garifuna 31. 1 %, Mayan 10. 2 %, Mestizo 12. 0 %). This pattern of ethnic disparity existed in both sexes but was greater in men. The probability of death from injuries was 14. 8 % among Creole men, more than twice the rate of other ethnicities and peaks among young Creole men. These deaths are dominated by homicides and unspecified deaths involving <b>firearms.</b> <b>Marked</b> disparities in mortality between ethnic groups exist in this Central American/Caribbean country, from rates that are typical of high-income countries to those of low-income countries. The pattern of these extreme differences likely suggests that they reflect underlying social determinants rooted in the country's colonial past...|$|R
40|$|The {{digital image}} has a {{predominant}} position among multimedia data types, and it plays a valuable role in numerous human activities, such as law enforcement, forestry management, environment management, weather forecasting and entertainment. In forensic sciences, digital images {{have been widely}} used, such as fingerprints, scene photos, <b>firearm</b> tool <b>marks,</b> and so on. Therefore, the arrangement of tremendous image data becomes a big issue, such as &quot;how to get an interested image fast? &quot; In this paper, we provide a retrieval method for digital image databases of crime scene photos. We use experimental results to show the capability of the proposed method. We also show the potential of applying the image databases to forensic sciences, such as case data management...|$|R

50|$|Prophet and {{his friends}} are carnies and {{itinerant}} criminals in Arizona. After robbing a liquor store Prophet and a friend evade the local Sheriff and stop at the ranch of Mark Hand, a decorated war veteran. Feeling suspicious, Mark tells Prophet he can help himself to water at a pump behind the house but covers him with a rifle. Prophet's friend overpowers Mark from behind, ties him up and beats him prior to robbing Mark's house. Attracted by the mass amount of <b>firearms</b> in <b>Mark's</b> cabinet, they are distracted by Mark's daughter Mary who Prophet's friend attempts to rape. Mary wounds him with a knife and escapes in the desert coming across the car returning home driven by Mrs Hand and Mary's brother Olie who has returned from the Vietnam War with decorations and mental illnesses. Prophet and his friend make their escape with Mark puzzled that Olie doesn't want to hunt the criminals, preferring to let the sheriff handle the matter.|$|R

50|$|The rifle {{was adopted}} {{during a period}} of rapid {{development}} in <b>firearms</b> technology, and <b>marked</b> Germany's shift to a smokeless powder. This explains why its period as the primary German service rifle was just over a dozen years, but it remained in limited service for much longer. In 1898 a Mauser design was adopted, the Gewehr 98, which was the culmination of a series of Mauser models in the 1890s. It was a superior replacement using the same ammunition with a stronger powder charge. However, this rifle soon had to be converted to fire the new pointed round that Germany adapted {{after the turn of the}} century. With these modifications the newer design remained in use until the end of World War II.|$|R
