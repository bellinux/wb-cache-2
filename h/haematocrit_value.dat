30|$|This {{study reveals}} that more {{surgical}} time is needed when performing MIS-TLIF, however, less hidden haemorrhage is observed. Thus, {{it may be}} speculated that surgical duration is not the main contributor to hidden haemorrhage, {{which is consistent with}} the previous study conducted by Shen et al. [6]. However, when performing THA, minimally invasive surgical technique is associated with a larger amount of hidden haemorrhage [8, 18], which is contradictory to our finding. This difference may be explained by less surgical field inside the wound associated with MIS-TLIF procedures, namely reduced and compressed wound surface following suture contributes to decreased hidden haemorrhage. In order to accurately calculate total and hidden haemorrhage, the lowest postoperative <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> is of great importance among several parameters [19]. In this study, <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> of consecutive 5  days following operations were recorded instead of measured <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> 2 or 3  days postoperatively [5, 12]. Based on the data of this research, it could be observed that the majority of included cases presented the lowest <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> during the third to fifth day postoperatively. On the contrary, the amount of patients showing the lowest haematocrit on the second day postoperatively was relatively small. For certain cases, if we use the <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> on the second or third day postoperatively, then calculated amount of total and hidden haemorrhage would be underestimated because of the “falsely” lowest <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value.</b> Previous study has also found that when performing TKA and THA, haemoglobin started to return following 4  days postoperation [6, 19], which is similar to our observations. In our opinion, if the haematorit values of consecutive postoperative 5  days have the tendency to decrease continuously, and the lowest <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> may not appear during this period, prolonging the time frame of blood routine test is needed until the lowest <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> emerges for the purpose of accurate assessment.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} {{hypoxaemia}} develop secondary polycythaemia that improves oxygen-carrying capacity. Therefore, normal haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> {{in the presence}} of chronic arterial hypoxaemia in cystic fibrosis constitute 'relative anaemia'. We sought to determine the cause of this relative anaemia in patients with cystic fibrosis. We studied haematological indices and oxygen saturation in healthy volunteers (n= 17) and in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (n= 15). Patients with cystic fibrosis had lower resting arterial oxygen saturation when compared with normal volunteers (P< 0. 0001), and exercise led to a greater reduction in arterial oxygen saturation (P< 0. 0001). However, haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> in patients with cystic fibrosis did not significantly differ from normal volunteers. Serum iron (P= 0. 002), transferrin (P= 0. 02), and total iron-binding capacity (P= 0. 01) were lower in patients with cystic fibrosis. There {{were no significant differences in}} serum ferritin, percentage iron saturation, serum erythropoietin or red cell volume between the groups. The data presented demonstrate a characteristic picture of anaemia of chronic disease in adult patients with cystic fibrosis, except for normal haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values.</b> Normal haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> in patients with cystic fibrosis appear to represent a combination of the effects of arterial hypoxaemia promoting polycythaemia, counterbalanced by chronic inflammation promoting anaemia of chronic disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{the usual}} {{practice}} to clamp umbilical cord immediately after birth. There is no sound evidence to support this approach, which might deprive the newborn of some benefits, such an increase in iron storage. Objectives: The study was done {{to determine the effect}} of timing of cord clamping on neonatal venous haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> and clinical outcome within neonatal period. Methodology: This was a randomized, controlled trial performed in Obstetrical Unit with support of Neonatal Unit of Paediatrics and Department of Clinical Pathology of BSMMU on neonates born at term without complication to mothers with uneventful pregnancies. After obtaining written parental consent newborns were randomly assigned to cord clamping within first 15 seconds (group-I Early Cord Clamping, ECC), at around 1 minute (group-II Late Cord Clamping, LCC) after birth. The infant’s venous haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> were measured at 6 hours and 24 to 48 hours after birth. Results: 130 mothers were selected for study purpose. Finally 98 were analyzed, 50 in early cord clamping group and 48 in late cord clamping group. Mean venous haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> at around 6 and 24 to 48 hours of life were measured. Results were within physiological limit but difference were significant between 2 study groups. The prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 14 gm%) was not significantly higher in group-I than group-II but relatively more newborns were anaemic in group-I. There {{was no significant difference in}} other neonatal outcomes and maternal postpartum events. Conclusions: Delayed cord clamping at birth increases neonatal venous haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> within a physiologic range. No harmful effects were observed among both groups. Furthermore this intervention seems to reduce the incidence of neonatal anemia. This practice has been shown to be safe and should be practiced to increase neonatal haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> at birth.

Blood coagulation was assessed by computerized Thrombelastograph analysis. Data were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance and post-hoc paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Decreasing the haematocrit from 40 to 10 % resulted in a shortening of reaction time (r) and coagulation time (k), and an increase in angle alpha, maximum amplitude (MA) and clot strength (G) (all P< 0. 02).

Patients on an established chronic respiratory failure due to DIPF or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were studied. The erythropoietic response to hypoxaemia in both conditions was assessed. We studied 18 patients with DIPF and 29 patients with COPD in respiratory failure in a stable stage, free from acute infection and congestive heart failure. Blood gases, erythrocytic parameters, as well the serum levels of iron, ferritin and erythropoietin were determined. All the DIPF patients studied, apart from two, had normal or subnormal <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values.</b> The patients with COPD had an inconsistant response to hypoxaemia; 12 had normal or subnormal <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> and the remaining 17 were erythraemic. The mean value of erythropoietin (EPO) in both DIPF and COPD patients was significantly higher than normal. In conclusion, patients with DIPF exhibit a lack of erythropoietic response to hypoxaemia, despite the augmented erythropoietin levels.

40|$|Anaemia is {{a feature}} almost {{invariably}} complicating chronic renal failure. Its pathophysiology is multifactorial {{but the most}} important cause is erythropoietin (Epo) deficiency. However, either no relation or even a weakly positive relation generally exists between serum immunoreactive (i) Epo and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> in uraemic anaemia, whereas in anaemias of non-renal origin the correlation is most often strongly negative. Recent evidence indicates that growth hormone also stimulates erythropoiesis. Moreover, late erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E) require insulin and/or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) for development in vitro. IGF-I has been shown to have a synergistic action with Epo. We have measured serum iEpo and IGF-I levels in 17 haemodialysis patients with severe hyperparathyroidism (mean +/- SEM serum iPTH, 988 +/- 88 pg/ml). Mean age and duration of dialysis treatment were 46. 1 +/- 3. 4 and 8. 8 +/- 1. 0 years respectively. Mean <b>haematocrit</b> and haemoglobin <b>values</b> wer 28. 1 +/- 1. 7 % and 9. 39 +/- 0. 54 g/dl respectively.

The experiment duration was 14 days and the blood samples were taken 1 st, 7 th and 14 th day of experiment. The obtained results show that the enrichment of the horse feeding ration with copper changed the monitored haematological parameters values. Assessment of the changes of haematological indicators between individual trial groups fed with copper-enriched feed with the copper coming from different sources showed the best results in the group with the intake of copper in the inorganic form. This group showed a statistically significant (P < 0. 01) increase in erythrocyte count (by 0. 85 T. l− 1) and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> (by 0. 04 l. l− 1) and a statistically significant (P < 0. 05) change in haemoglobin level (increasing by 8. 9 g. l− 1) between initial and final blood sample. Although the group taking organic form of copper showed a significant (P < 0. 01) increase in erythrocyte count and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>value</b> in the second blood sample comparing with initial one, the final sample did not corroborate this highly significant correlation. The control group showed no difference between the initial and final blood samples in any of the monitored parameters...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] frequency of uterine contractions was studied in 37 patients with severe abruptio placentae. They ranged from 3 to 16 per 10 minutes, {{with a mean of}} 7, 86. When frequency of contraction was correlated with haematological and clinical data, a slight negative correlation was found between the frequency and haemoglobin and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values.</b> In patients with intra uterine fetal death, the mean frequency was 8, 85 as opposed to 5, 55 when the infant was born alive. This difference is statistically significant. The possible role of these abnormal contractions in causing intra uterine death is discussed. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{blood flow}} (CBF) was {{measured}} at varying <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> in 8 streptozotocin-diabetic and in 7 control rats using the intracarotid " 3 Xe technique. A hyperbolic relationship between CBF and haematocrit was {{established for the}} individual rats in both groups. Diabetic animals showed a preserved CBF response to changes to haematocrit. In 10 normal rats, CBF was measured during acute hyperglycaemia induced by intraperitoneal glucose injection. A significant, inverse correlation was found between CBF and blood glucose. We conclude that the CBF response to changes in haematocrit and thereby in p 02 is preserved in experimental diabetes. Secondly, in acute hyperglycaemia CBF varies inversely with blood glucose, by mechanisms not fully understood...|$|R

Measurements of the haematological parameters revealed {{that there is not}} statistical difference between males and females specimens from North-east Bulgaria. Only the number of granulocytes (GRA) and <b>haematocrit</b> <b>values</b> (HCT) differed significantly among both sex. The present examination and statistical analysis of the defined haematological parameters has established the initial norm of their variation described by the 95 % confidence interval of their mean values in adult males and females and it {{can be used as a}} bio-indicative marker for evaluating the changing conditions in natural and agricultural ecosystems with various degrees and types of anthropogenic pollution in Bulgaria...|$|R
