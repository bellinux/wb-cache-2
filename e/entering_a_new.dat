5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} {{to examine the effects of}} initiatorstatus and remarriage on the mental health after divorce. Furthermore, the question if the effects of the initiatorstatus differ between initiators who <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> relationship and those who do not will be addressed. No prior research has focused on this question. We address this omission using the retrospective lifetime research ‘Scheiden in Nederland’ from 2000. This data contains 2394 respondents of whom 1782 are divorced. Out of these divorced respondents, 923 have <b>entered</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> relationship. Our results suggest, contrary to similar prior research, that initiators do not have a better mental health than non-initiators do. However, initiators do tend to remarriage earlier. Besides that, our results suggest that people who <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> relationship have <b>a</b> better mental health than people who do not. In conclusion, our results do not suggest any difference in the mental health between initiators who <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> relationship and initiators who do not...|$|R

25|$|Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through Gertrude Stein, at a {{time when}} both artists had {{recently}} acquired an interest in Tribal art, Iberian sculpture and African tribal masks.

25|$|Yogesh Joshi of University of Maryland, David Reibsteinand and John Zhang of Wharton Business School {{found that}} when the {{question}} of optimal entry timing arises, firms shouldn’t necessarily enter a new market based on a strong leverage effect, a situation where a firm's presence in an existing market has {{a positive influence on}} product adoption in a new market. Also, a backlash effect shouldn’t prevent the firm from <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> market, a situation where social influence on the existing market is negative.

Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through Gertrude Stein, {{at a time when}} both artists had recently acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and African tribal masks.

25|$|Genome {{sequencing}} {{reveals that}} obligate bacterial endosymbionts of insects have among {{the smallest of}} known bacterial genomes and have lost many genes that are commonly found in closely related bacteria. Several theories have been put forth to explain the loss of genes. It is presumed {{that some of these}} genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in 'purging' deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel phylogeny of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the belief that the primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically (i.e., from the mother), and not horizontally (i.e., by escaping the host and <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> host).|$|E

Nasser insisted that attacks on Najran, Qizan and other [...] "bases of aggression" [...] would continue, arguing that [...] "these were originally Yemeni towns, which the Saudis usurped in 1930".|$|E
