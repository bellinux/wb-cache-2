500|$|Exhausted {{from his}} wartime concerts routine, Grainger {{spent much of}} 1946 on holiday in Europe. He was {{experiencing}} a sense of career failure; [...] in 1947, when refusing the Chair of Music at Adelaide University, he wrote: [...] "If I were 40 years younger, and not so crushed by defeat in every branch of music I have essayed, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would have welcomed such a chance". In January 1948 he conducted the premiere of his wind band setting of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart, written for the Goldman Band to celebrate the 70th birthday of its founder. Afterwards, Grainger denigrated his own music as [...] "commonplace" [...] while praising [...] Darius Milhaud's Suite Française, with which it had shared the programme.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle {{from the}} San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "there {{may be more}} {{entertaining}} and less problematic movies, but Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has something about it that hangs in there, working on the mind like a dog gnawing on a table leg. The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I'm not sure Confessions is a good movie, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> like it." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't really have the look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to Vienna, his indisposition {{increased}} visibly and made him gloomily depressed. His wife was truly distressed over this. One day when she was driving in the Prater with him, {{to give him a}} little distraction and amusement, and they were sitting by themselves, Mozart began to speak of death, and declared that he was writing the Requiem for himself. Tears came to the eyes of the sensitive man: 'I feel definitely,' he continued, 'that I will not last much longer; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> have been poisoned. I cannot rid myself of this idea.' ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} the rebels were hanged {{including}} Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews, others were shot. Their deaths were a strong motivation for the continuing Patriot War. Many more prisoners were transported, but most were pardoned, e.g. Enoch Moore (Loyalist turned rebel). A general pardon (for everyone but Mackenzie) was issued in 1845, and Mackenzie himself was pardoned in 1849 and {{allowed to return to}} Canada, where he resumed his political career. [...] Mackenzie was strongly disillusioned after his time in the United States, writing to his son that [...] "after what I have seen here, I frankly confess to you that, had I passed nine years in the United States before, instead of after, the outbreak, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would have been the last man in America to be engaged in it." [...] In later life however, Mackenzie advocated annexation of Canada by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|When I was {{at first}} asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I {{did not wish to}} go. Later, when I was told that I would receive good {{attention}} and protection, and that the President of the United States said that it would be all right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of whom I had never heard ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should have been compelled to defend myself often.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{wrote to}} Adair on 12 September {{that he would}} support the {{government}} on the war and [...] "on all occasions where they support establishment against innovation, monarchy and aristocracy against the inroads of sans-culottism; but beyond these points I profess no friendship or goodwill towards an administration from which I have received such gross ill-treatment". The Foxites were no better: [...] "I don't know that they would wish for the appearance of connexion with me, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should but little wish it with them, till such time as all the leaven of sans-cullotism is worked out of their composition". He was now the pre-eminent spokesman for Burkean principles: he wrote to Burke on 30 August 1796 to offer the seat of Peterborough to Burke's friend French Laurence. Fitzwilliam said he was [...] "the inveterate enemy of all innovation" [...] and [...] "though a friend to popular privileges on ordinary occasions, and having no dislike to the check on public men by popular discussion...I had rather see a bad Minister go uncorrected than a good constitution stabbed in its vitals". He further claimed: ...|$|E

2500|$|The History thus met a mixed {{critical}} response – [...] "praise, misgivings and puzzlement {{in varying}} proportions" [...] – but a generally positive public one. Most readers warmed to Clark's great gift for narrative prose and {{the depiction of}} individual character, and were not troubled by the comments of academic critics on his factual inaccuracies or their doubts about his historiographic theories. The books sold extremely well and were a major earner for Melbourne University Press (MUP) and its director, Peter Ryan. Even critics who found fault with the History as history admired it as literature. In The Age, Stuart Sayers hailed it as [...] "a major work, not only of scholarship... but also of Australian literature". Some reviewers complained that Clark was [...] "too pre-occupied with tragic vision" [...] or condemned his [...] "Biblical and slightly mannered style", but [...] "recognised that Clark's very excesses gave the History its profundity and distinctive insight". The respected historian John La Nauze, author of a highly regarded biography of Alfred Deakin, wrote {{that the importance of}} Clark's work [...] "lies not in the apocalyptic vision of our history... which I do not understand, and which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would disagree with if I did," [...] but in [...] "the particular flashes of interpretation" [...] which gave [...] "a new appearance to familiar features". Alastair Davidson stated in a review in the magazine Dissent in 1968: [...] "The astonishing savaging of volume one of A History of Australia, when it appeared in 1962, seems almost symbolic. What is important is that such pettiness did not harm such as Gibbon and Taine. Manning Clark will not go into the dustbin of history because of Ellis' quibbling about the precise time this or that event happened. Nor will McManners's more gentle questioning about whether he had really understood the nature of the Enlightenment correctly really be important. Great history is not determined by the precision of the facts it contains. What will decide this is the meaningfulness of the vision of Man which it has".|$|E
