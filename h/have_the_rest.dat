He said, [...] "During those practices, I was trying to wait for Krist and Dave {{to come up with}} something but it just turned into noise all the time." [...] One day Cobain made one last attempt at completing the song. Cobain was able to come up with a vocal melody and the band finally finished writing the song. Cobain said that when they completed [...] "Heart-Shaped Box", [...] "We finally realized that it was a good song." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{dealing with}} the {{dialogue}} in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters {{as if they were}} actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: [...] "If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, not even if you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the troop talk their heads off about them." [...] Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that [...] "a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb." [...] The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore [...] "shares with [...] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".|$|E

500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let me <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of it' and I wrote this thing in it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s. Love referred to it as a [...] "feminist anthem" [...] after performing it during MTV Unplugged in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Jam noted it was commonplace for Jackson to sing her vocals {{with the}} base track {{first and then}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the song built around {{it in order to}} make her voice the center of the piece. [...] "Janet did all of her {{background}} vocals and not just the lead vocals. The idea with her has always been that she does all of her own vocals, so that it's totally a Janet record." [...] On the title track [...] "Rhythm Nation", her vocals range from Bb3 to G5, climaxing within its middle eight. Musicologist Richard J. Ripani observed the album and title track showcased the variety of contemporary R styles, making [...] "use of elements across the R spectrum, including use of a sample loop , triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes (D naturals and G naturals)." [...] This style of music, known as new jack swing, was immensely popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though officially credited to the production techniques of Teddy Riley, Ripani theorized Riley was influenced by Jackson's 1986 single [...] "Nasty", which also features a distinctive triplet swing. Jon Pareles observed the album's diversity catered {{to a wide variety of}} radio formats, including pop, quiet storm, Adult contemporary and mainstream rock. [...] "Black Cat" [...] was a stand-out for the record, not only for being composed exclusively by Jackson, but for its stark departure from her general style of music, delving into hard rock. While Jellybean Johnson was elected to produce it, Dave Berry was recruited to play guitar for the song. It was recorded using a mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give the song a heavy metal sound.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2017, Nyong'o {{wrote an}} op-ed with New York Times {{revealing}} that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her twice in 2011, {{while she was}} still a student at Yale School of Drama. She claimed that Weinstein led her to his bedroom and announced that he wanted to give her a complete body massage, which she declined and, panicked, offered him one. Nyong'o also claimed that Weinstein wanted to take off his pants, when she rejected his advances and left the room terrified. Another encounter took place in New York, where she met with Weinstein for dinner after a screening. She quoted Weinstein: [...] "Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of our meal." [...] She again declined and left the restaurant. She vowed that she would never work with Weinstein, hence her declining a role in Southpaw (2015). Nyong'o mentioned that she hasn't had any more encounters during her time in Hollywood and would rather work with women directors or male feminist directors, who have not abused their power.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} to Hsinking, Puyi hired an American public {{relations}} executive, George Bronson Rea, to lobby the U.S. government to recognize Manchukuo. In late 1935, Rea published a book The Case for Manchukuo, in which Rea castigated China under the Kuomintang as hopelessly corrupt, and praised Puyi's wise leadership of Manchukuo, writing Manchukuo was [...] "...the one step {{that the people of}} the East have taken towards escape from the misery and misgovernment that have become theirs. Japan's protection is its only chance of happiness." [...] Rea continued to work for Puyi until the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but he failed signally in lobbying Washington to recognize Hsinking. [...] At the second trial relating to the long-running Kaspé case in Harbin in March-June 1936, the Japanese prosecutor argued in favor of the six defendants, calling them [...] "Russian patriots who raised the flag against a world danger-communism." [...] Much to everyone's surprise, the Chinese judges convicted and sentenced the six Russian Fascists who had tortured and killed Kaspé to death, which led to a storm as the Russian Fascist Party called the six men [...] "martyrs for Holy Russia", and presented to Puyi a petition with thousands of signatures asking him to pardon the six men. Puyi refused to pardon the Russian Fascists, but the verdict was appealed to the Hsinking Supreme Court, where the Japanese judges quashed the verdict, ordering the six men to be freed, a decision that Puyi accepted without complaint. The flagrant miscarriage of justice of the Kaspé case, which attracted much attention in the Western media, did much to tarnish the image of Manchukuo and weakened Puyi's already weak hand as he sought to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the world recognize Manchukuo.|$|E
