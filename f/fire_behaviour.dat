40|$|Abstract: One aspect often needed when {{modelling}} {{systems of}} any kind is time-based analysis, especially for real-time or in general time-critical systems. Algebraic place/transition (P/T) nets do not inherently provide a way to model the passing of time or to restrict the <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour</b> with regards to passing time. In this paper, we present an extension of algebraic P/T nets by adding time durations to transitions and timestamps to tokens. We define categories for different timed net classes and functorial relations between them. Our first result {{is the definition of}} morphisms preserving <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour</b> for all timed net classes. As second result, we define structuring techniques for timed P/T nets in a way that our category fulfills the prop-erties ofM-adhesive systems, a general categorical framework for structuring and transforming high-level algebraic structures. We demonstrate our approach by ap-plying it to model a real-time communication network...|$|R
40|$|Our {{goal was}} to {{investigate}} how the propagation of alternating signals (i. e. AC), like action potentials, into the dendrites influenced nonlinear <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour</b> of motor neurons using a systematically reduced neuron model. A recently developed reduced modeling approach using only steady-current (i. e. DC) signaling was analytically expanded to retain features of the frequency-response analysis carried out in multicompartment anatomically reconstructed models. Bifurcation analysis of the extended model showed that the typically overlooked parameter of AC amplitude attenuation {{was positively correlated with}} the current threshold for the activation of a plateau potential in the dendrite. Within the multiparameter space map of the reduced model the region demonstrating "fully-bistable" firing was bounded by directional DC attenuation values that were negatively correlated to AC attenuation. Based on these results we conclude that analytically derived reduced models of dendritic trees should be fit on DC and AC signaling, as both are important biophysical parameters governing the nonlinear <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour</b> of motor neurons...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{magnesium}} silicates as sintering promoters in porcelain stoneware tiles {{was investigated in}} order to understand their effect on technological properties and <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Three formulations were designed, replacing sodic feldspar with 3 % wt talc or chlorite in a reference porcelain stoneware body, and experimented at a laboratory scale simulating the industrial tilemaking cycle. The occurrence {{of magnesium}} silicates does not affect the technological properties of semi-finished products, but it influences remarkably the <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Bodies containing talc or chlorite exhibit a faster densification kinetics, with slightly larger firing shrinkages, due to their larger amount of glassy phase, which appears to be less viscous than the reference one. On the other hand, the addition of magnesium silicates brings about a slightly lower bulk density, basically due to a larger amount of closed porosity, being water absorption negligible over 1160 ?C. Notwithstanding the different porosity, porcelain stoneware bodies containing talc or chlorite present just a moderate decrease of mechanical strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to relate the {{expected}} inter-subject variability in voluntary drive of the knee extensor muscles during a sustained isometric contraction to the changes in firing rates of single motor units. Voluntary activation, as established with super-imposed electrical stimulation was high (range: 91 - 99 %, n= 8) during a short maximal contraction, but was lower (range: 69 - 100 %) in most subjects at the point of force failure during a sustained (49. 1 ± 10. 1 s) fatiguing contraction at 50 % of maximum force. On a different experimental day the <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour</b> of 27 single motor units was recorded with wire electrodes in the vastus lateralis muscle, 24 of which could be monitored from the time of recruitment to the point of force failure (53. 6 ± 9. 8 s). Motor unit <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour</b> differed considerably among subjects. During the second half of the sustained, fatiguing contraction the changes in firing rate firing rate variability of early recruited units ranged from - 10 % to + 100 % and from - 50 % to + 160 % respectively among subjects. There were significant positive linear relations between voluntary activation, on the one hand, and rectified surface electromyogram (rsEMG, r= 0. 82), the changes in motor unit firing rate (r= 0. 49) and firing rate variability (r= 0. 50) towards the point of force failure on the other. The present data suggest that differences in voluntary drive that appear among subjects during fatigue may be an important determinant of motor unit <b>firing</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sprinkler {{protection}} {{is currently the}} most widely used and reliable technology to mitigate fire hazards for combustible commodities. The basic mechanism of sprinkler protection relies on water transport on solid fuel surfaces to control and suppress the fire. In previous studies water surface flows were characterized for an idealized commodity consisting of corrugated cardboard boxes. The results showed that local surface flows are highly non-uniform on commodity surfaces even with uniform water fluxes applied directly on top of the commodity. In the present work, an experimental study was conducted to investigate <b>fire</b> suppression <b>behaviours</b> of the same commodity using uniform water fluxes. The objective is to examine the impact of non-uniform water surface flows on <b>fire</b> suppression <b>behaviour.</b> All <b>fire</b> tests were carried out using a rack storage configuration. The overall <b>fire</b> suppression <b>behaviour</b> was quantified using the chemical heat release rates measured by a 20 -MW calorimeter, with the uniform water fluxes generated by a water application apparatus. The experimental results show that the measured heat release rates under various experimental conditions are reasonably repeatable. Therefore, local surface flows on the commodity, although highly non-uniform, do not {{have a significant impact on}} the overall <b>fire</b> suppression <b>behaviour.</b> This suggests that more global or averaged quantities related to water transport control the fire suppression, which should be investigated in future work...|$|R

50|$|The {{tests on}} the <b>fire</b> <b>behaviour</b> of {{materials}} with different flame retardants revealed that halogen free flame retardants produce less smoke and toxic fire emissions, {{with the exception of}} the aryl phosphates RDP and BDP in styrenic polymers. The leaching experiments showed that the nature of the polymer is a dominating factor and that the leaching behaviour of halogen free and brominated flame retardants is comparable. The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more flame retardants can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules. The impact assessment studies reconfirmed that the improper waste and recycling treatment of electronic products with brominated flame retardants can produce dioxins which is not the case with halogen free alternatives. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) has been carrying out a series of projects related to the environmental assessment of alternative flame retardants, the “design for environment” projects on flame retardants for printed wiring boards and alternatives to decabromo diphenylethers and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD).|$|E

After responding to a severe interface fire in Barriere BC, the provincial government requested federal aid, which was initially provided by B Company, 3 PPCLI from Edmonton. The province followed up with multiple requests as the fire situation grew more desperate and, ultimately, over 2,200 Canadian Forces (CF) personnel were mobilized. After receiving a day of basic forest firefighting training from the British Columbia Forest Service, including safety procedures, fire ratings, hose handling, and <b>fire</b> <b>behaviour,</b> the soldiers took to the fire lines.

The operation lasted 45 days, and at its height more than 2,600 military personnel were in action.
