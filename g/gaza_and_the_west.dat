25|$|Palestinian {{groups in}} the Gaza Strip have fought {{sporadically}} against Israel, since the country occupied the coastal region following the 1967 Six-Day War. Though the Oslo accords established a partial control of the Palestinian Authority self-governing over the Gaza Strip {{within the scope of}} peace process, the conflict escalated during the Second Intifada, a large-scale armed uprising against Israeli occupation by Palestinians in both <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim Brotherhood is a movement, not a {{political}} party, but its members have created political parties in several countries, such as the Islamic Action Front in Jordan and Hamas in <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank and the now disbanded Freedom and Justice Party in Egypt. These parties are staffed by Brotherhood members but they are kept independent from the Muslim Brotherhood to some degree, unlike Hizb ut-Tahrir which is highly centralized.|$|E
25|$|After the Israeli {{withdrawal}} of settlers, the Palestinian Authority {{took control of}} Gaza. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections in both <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank. Israel, the U.S. {{and a number of}} European governments refused to recognize Hamas’ election victory and imposed an economic blockade on Gaza. During June 2007, an internal civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah resulted in Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah ruled the West Bank.|$|E

25|$|In January and February 2011, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) {{assessed}} {{measures taken}} {{to ease the}} blockade and concluded that they were helpful but not sufficient {{to improve the lives}} of the local inhabitants.

25|$|The Fatah–Hamas {{conflict}} has further limited {{the freedom of}} the press in the PNA territories and the distribution of opposing voices in Hamas-controlled <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank where Fatah still has more influence. In July 2010, with the easing of the blockade of the Gaza Strip, Israel allowed the distribution of the pro-Fatah newspapers al Quds, al Ayyam and al-Hayat al-Jadida to Gaza, but Hamas prevented Gazan distributors from retrieving the shipment. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) condemned the Hamas restrictions of distribution of the West Bank newspapers in Gaza, and also condemned the Fatah-led government in the West Bank for restricting publication and distribution of the Gazan newspapers al-Resala and Falastin.|$|E

25|$|In December 1987, the First Intifada began. The First Intifada was a mass Palestinian {{uprising}} against Israeli {{rule in the}} Palestinian territories. The rebellion began in the Jabalia refugee camp and quickly spread throughout <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank. Palestinian actions ranged from civil disobedience to violence. In addition to general strikes, boycotts on Israeli products, graffiti and barricades, Palestinian demonstrations that included stone-throwing by youths against the Israel Defense Forces brought the Intifada international attention. The Israeli army's heavy handed response to the demonstrations, with live ammunition, beatings and mass arrests, brought international condemnation. The PLO, which until then had never been recognised as {{the leaders of the}} Palestinian people by Israel, was invited to peace negotiations the following year, after it recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.|$|E
25|$|Fatah's {{internal}} conflicts have also, due to {{the creation}} of the Palestinian Authority, merged with the turf wars between different PA security services, e.g., a longstanding rivalry between the West Bank (Jibril Rajoub) and Gaza (Muhammad Dahlan) branches of the powerful Preventive Security Service. Foreign backing for different factions contribute to conflict, e.g., with the United States generally seen as supportive of Abbas's overall leadership and of Dahlan's security influence, and Syria alleged to promote Faruq al-Qaddumi's challenge to the present leadership. The younger generations of Fatah, especially within the militant al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, have been more prone to splits, and a number of lesser networks in <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank have established themselves as either independent organizations or joined Hamas. However, such overt breaks with the movement have still been rather uncommon, despite numerous rivalries inside and between competing local Fatah groups.|$|E
25|$|From December 2006 to mid-September 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority met 36 times; {{there were}} also lower-level talks. In 2007 Olmert welcomed the Arab League's re-endorsement of the Arab Peace Initiative. In his bid to {{negotiate}} a peace accord and establish a Palestinian state, Olmert proposed a plan to the Palestinians. The centerpiece of Olmert's detailed proposal is the suggested permanent border, which {{would be based on}} an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank. Olmert proposed annexing at least 6.3% of Palestinian territory, in exchange for 5.8% of Israeli land, with Palestinians receiving alternative land in the Negev, adjacent to the Gaza Strip, as well as territorial link, under Israeli sovereignty, for free passage between <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank. Israel insisted on retaining an armed presence in the future Palestinian state. Under Abbas's offer, more than 60 percent of settlers would stay in place. Olmert, for his part, was presenting a plan in which the most sparsely populated settlements would be evacuated. Olmert and Abbas both acknowledged that reciprocal relations would be necessary, not hermetic separation. They also acknowledged the need to share a single business ecosystem, while cooperating intensively on water, security, bandwidth, banking, tourism and much more. Regarding Jerusalem the leaders agreed that Jewish neighborhoods should remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Arab neighborhoods would revert to Palestinian sovereignty. The Palestinians asked for clarifications of the territorial land swap since they were unable to ascertain what land his percentages affected, since Israeli and Palestinian calculations of the West Bank differ by several hundred square kilometres. For them, in lieu of such clarifications, Olmert's 6.3–6.8% annexation might work out closer to 8.5%, 4 times the 1.9% limit the Palestinians argued a swap should not exceed. The talks ended with both sides claiming the other side dropped follow-up contacts.|$|E

500|$|The {{first stage}} of the Intifada was a {{response}} to an incident at the Erez checkpoint, where an Israeli military vehicle hit a group of Palestinian laborers, killing four of them. However, within weeks, following persistent requests by al-Wazir, the PLO attempted to direct the uprising, which lasted until 1991, or 1993, according to various authorities. Al-Wazir had been assigned by Arafat the responsibility of the Palestinian territories within the PLO command. According to author Said Aburish, he had [...] "impressive knowledge of local conditions" [...] in the Israeli-occupied territories, apparently knowing [...] "every village, school, and large family in <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank". He provided the uprising with financial backing and logistical support, thus becoming its [...] "brain in exile." [...] Al-Wazir activated every cell he had set up in the territories since the late 1970s in an effort to militarily back the stone-throwers who formed the backbone of the Palestinian revolt. He also used the opportunity to reform the PLO. According to author Yezid Sayigh, al-Wazir believed that the Intifada should not have been sacrificed to Arafat solely for use as a diplomatic or political tool.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) {{confirmed}} {{the need for}} humanitarian relief in the Palestinian territories.
