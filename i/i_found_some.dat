And then I also worked with Lupita Nyong'o, who is Kenyan but she did her {{training}} at Yale. So she really shifted her speech so she could do American speech.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Thomas Schnauz, and was {{directed}} by Kim Manners. It was Schnauz's first writing credit, and Manner's second directing credit for the season. The episode, whose title is an English translation {{for the name of}} the semitic demon Beelzebub, marked a return of [...] "the comedy episode" [...] for the series. According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode [...] "revisit [...] themes of genetic grafting experiments from 'Travelers' in a humorous context." [...] Series co-star Robert Patrick had a difficult time with the episode; he later explained, [...] "I couldn't deal with some of the material. As an actor, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> of it to be a little silly." [...] Accordingly, Manners helped Patrick traverse the script, an action that helped him achieve the desired delivery for his lines.|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Meessen's {{photographic}} {{ventures in}} the Indies {{and the resulting}} albums cost some 34,000Netherlands Indies gulden, which included camera equipment (though {{it is not known}} what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his albumen prints. In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote, [...] "made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: [...] "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted. Once I told them, they promised their assistance. At exactly 5a.m. the following morning <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> 60warriors waiting for me on the beach." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> {{aspects of}} this chapter to be interesting, challenging, and logical. For example, the author's {{characterizations}} {{of the degree of}} difficulty in actually doing something meaningful about climate change through mitigation [...] and coping/adaptation are perceptive and valuable. In principle, such characterizations could provide a foundation for more meaningful policy planning on this difficult problem. [...] Unfortunately, the author's lack of rigor and consistency on these larger issues is likely to negate any real respect for his insights.|$|E
2500|$|Singh recollected {{to reporters}} about his childhood: [...] "When {{we were kids}} we couldn't afford golf balls {{so we had to}} make do with coconuts.
