5|$|By November 1954, {{following}} {{the end of}} the Korean War, the RAAF's need for further aircrew to help meet the Australian military's international obligations had eased and {{the decision was made to}} combine the syllabus of No.1 IFTS with No.1 BFTS starting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year.</b> No.1 IFTS was disbanded on 24January 1955, and its base facilities handed over to No.23 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Nick Sheppard, {{formerly}} of the Bristol-based band the Cortinas, and Vince White were recruited as the Clash's new guitarists. Howard continued as the drummer. The reconstituted band played its first shows in January 1984 with a batch of new material and launched into the self-financed Out of Control Tour, travelling widely over the winter and into early summer. At a striking miners' benefit show ("Scargill's Christmas Party") in December 1984, they announced that a new album would be released early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer Rouge advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Year</b> Zero, the Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E
5|$|With {{most of the}} Revie built team {{retiring}} {{or moving}} on to other clubs, Armfield had to rebuild the squad, though Bremner would still play 38 games in the 1975–76 campaign. However, he missed a lengthy spell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year</b> due to injury and results dipped during this time and ultimately ended the club's title hopes; {{they went on to}} end the campaign in fifth spot.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} make the Detroit roster out of {{training}} camp, Henderson was assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets, to begin the 1963–64 season. He appeared in 38 games for the Hornets and his speed and aggressive nature helped him score 10 goals and 24 points. Henderson earned a brief recall to Detroit in November, then joined the NHL team permanently early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year.</b> He scored his first NHL goal on January 29, 1964, against the Chicago Black Hawks. It came {{late in the game}} against goaltender Glenn Hall and resulted in a 2–2 tie. In 32 regular season NHL games, Henderson recorded three goals and three assists in 32 games, then appeared in 14 playoff games where he added five points. The Red Wings reached the 1964 Stanley Cup Final, but lost in seven games to Toronto.|$|E

5|$|After {{serving in}} a staff {{position}} at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Walker was promoted to major {{at the end of}} 1976, and rejoined 1st Battalion, to become a company commander, based in Tidworth, Wiltshire. In 1979, he took up another staff post at the MoD, after which he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1982. Until 1985, he served as Military Assistant (MA) to the Chief of the General Staff. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> Honours List in December 1984.|$|E

His next post was the then-Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, where held the position of Development Secretary. He was appointed political agent (then equivalent to ambassador) of Abu Dhabi in 1961, a post that he held until 1965.

5|$|After the war, the 2/15th {{remained}} on Brunei until November when it moved to Mempakul as personnel {{were returned to}} Australia in drafts based on priority of discharge. A small group of personnel volunteered {{at this time to}} undertake occupation duties in Japan and were subsequently transferred to the 66th or 67th Battalions. In early December, the battalion's vehicles were returned and after the appropriate clearances were received, the remaining cadre was transported to Labuan. From there, they sailed back to Australia aboard the Pachaug Victory, arriving at Brett's Wharf, in Brisbane on 19 December. The cadre moved into a camp at Chermside, where they completed unloading of stores and equipment before a short Christmas leave. Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> the final administrative tasks were completed and the last group of personnel were posted for demobilisation and discharge. Finally, the 2/15th was officially disbanded on 21 January 1946.|$|E

5|$|American {{proceeded}} to Halifax, {{where she had}} her collision damage repaired {{over the next six}} weeks. She departed for Gibraltar on 27 November, {{a little more than two}} weeks after the signing of the Armistice with Germany that ended the fighting. After calling at that British port on 9 December, American docked at Marseilles, before leaving for New York <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> arriving there on 9 February 1919. American was decommissioned and returned to American-Hawaiian on 4 March, and formally struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 May.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating at Wondecla, on the Atherton Tablelands {{in north}} Queensland, after an {{extended}} period of home leave during which time the Victorian and South Australian personnel took part in a march through Melbourne, the 2/5th Battalion spent the next year training on the Tablelands {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Division. There was also a large turn over in the battalion's personnel at this time, as it had been severely depleted due to illness during its previous campaign, and it was brought up to strength by April 1944 with several drafts of reinforcements, with the majority coming from New South Wales. To counter boredom and malaise amongst the men during late 1944, the battalion was occupied with a series of various sporting events and further leave. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> a series of amphibious exercises were undertaken during this time with a view to preparing the battalion for future operations.|$|E
5|$|Diaby {{grabbed his}} fifth {{goal of the}} season in a 3–0 win over Hull City on 19 December. He also {{assisted}} on a goal in the win. A week later, Diaby scored his fourth goal overall against Aston Villa in another 3–0 victory. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> Diaby began the 2010 calendar year by assisting on goals in a 2–2 draw against Everton and a 4–2 win over Bolton. On 10 February, he scored the only goal in a victory over Liverpool. Despite failing to score a goal {{for the rest of the}} season, Diaby was ever-present in the waning moments of the season starting 12 of the final 14 matches he appeared in. He finished the campaign with career-highs in matches played, goals, and assists.|$|E

5|$|Dolan {{brought in}} Paul Tomlinson, Brian Mitchell and Lee Sinnott {{in a bid}} to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City. They mounted a {{promotion}} challenge in 1987–88 and were top for much of the season until they faltered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year.</b> When promotion was missed initially by one point {{on the last day of}} the season after a 3–2 defeat against Ipswich Town and then through play-off defeat to Middlesbrough, McCall left the club, signing for Everton for £850,000 in June 1988. He had played 238 league games for the club, scoring 37 goals, and in total played 285 games, scoring 46 goals. McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, The Real McCall, about City's failure to strengthen the side to secure promotion.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chadwick {{carried out}} {{research}} {{as part of}} the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, Chadwick became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 15th Battalion {{moved to}} Mouquet Farm, where they {{supported}} {{an attack by}} the 14th Battalion and carried out defensive duties. They remained there until early September, when they were withdrawn back to Warloy and then to Reingheist, via Doulens. Before this occurred, on 30 August, the 15th experienced a change in command, as Cannan, who had been promoted to brigadier-general, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Terence McSharry. The remainder {{of the year was}} spent in the Ypres salient, around St Eloi and Boorlartbeek, before winter fell on the Western Front. It was the worst winter in Europe in 40 years, and the men suffered heavily from sickness and the cold as they rotated through the line, conducting defensive duties and labouring before moving to Gueudecourt, and then later Lagnicourt, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1858, the Mint {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October of the 2013–14 season, Holloway quit as manager, {{with the}} club having only taken three points from the first eight games of the season. He was {{replaced}} by former Stoke City manager Tony Pulis, who led the team to safety. Pulis then resigned just {{two days before the}} start of the 2014–15 season. Neil Warnock returned to the club for a second spell as manager, but was sacked on 27 December {{with the club}} in the relegation zone. In January 2015, former Palace player Alan Pardew was confirmed as the new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club after a compensation package of £3.5 million was agreed with Newcastle United. Under Pardew the club won eight games out of twelve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> eventually securing mid-table safety and a third consecutive season in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> Benfica {{suffered}} {{their first}} league loss, falling to second place and beginning their erratic spell. Despite a sterling League Cup (where they earned their first honour in four seasons), the club's league play {{was not as}} impressive. They battled Porto for first place until March, when they had another costly loss and were passed by Sporting CP. Benfica tried to retake {{second place in the}} remaining eight matches, but in early May, the club dropped five points, sealing their fate; they finished third, missing the UEFA Champions League for a second consecutive season.|$|E
