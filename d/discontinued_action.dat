The purpose of the exemption request was to remove requirements for hydrogen control systems (i. e., containment post-accident hydrogen monitors and recombiners) from the Oconee, Units 1, 2, and 3 (ONS) design basis. With this change, the consideration of hydrogen generation {{would no longer be}} included in the design basis of ONS. In addition, the referenced letter requested a license amendment to remove the post-accident hydrogen control systems from the ONS Technical Specifications (TS) and provided the basis for deletion of a Selected Licensee Commitment concerning hydrogen recombiners. The license amendment would also remove the hydrogen control system from the ONS licensing bases. This letter requests the NRC <b>discontinue</b> <b>action</b> on the aspects of the referenced letter related to the post-accident hydrogen monitors.

50|$|Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) {{has also}} been used to help those with DES. Because {{individuals}} with this syndrome have trouble integrating information into their actions it is often suggested that they have programmed reminders delivered to a cell phone or pager.

5000|$|The {{phrase to}} {{turn a blind eye}} is {{attributed}} to an incident in the life of Admiral Horatio Nelson. Nelson was blinded in one eye early in his Royal Navy career. During the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 the cautious Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, in overall command of the British forces, sent a signal to Nelson's forces ordering them to <b>discontinue</b> the <b>action.</b> Naval orders were transmitted via a system of signal flags at that time. When this order was brought to the more aggressive Nelson's attention, he lifted his telescope up to his blind eye, saying, [...] "I really do not see the signal," [...] and most of his forces continued to press home the attack. The frigates supporting the line-of-battle ships did break off, in one case suffering severe losses in the retreat.|$|R

5000|$|On its {{becoming}} {{known that}} Napoleon intended {{to break the}} blockade of Ferrol, {{as a prelude to}} his invasion, the Admiralty ordered Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling to join Calder and intercept the Franco-Spanish fleet on their passage to Brest. The approach of the enemy was concealed by fog; finally on 22 July 1805 the fleets came into sight. The allies outnumbered the British; but Calder ordered his fleet into action. The ensuing battle was battle of Cape Finisterre: fifteen British ships had engaged twenty French and Spanish ships and captured two. The British losses were 39 officers and men killed and 159 wounded; the allies lost 158 dead and 320 wounded. After four hours, as night fell, Calder gave orders to <b>discontinue</b> the <b>action.</b> Over the following two days the fleets remained close to one another, but did not re-engage. Calder focused on protecting his newly won prizes, while the French Admiral Villeneuve declined to force another engagement. [...] Villeneuve left the area on the 24th, sailing to Ferrol, and eventually Cádiz, instead of resuming his course to Brest. Villeneuve had failed in all his objectives: he had landed no troops in Ireland, and the plan of linking with the fleet at Brest, driving off the British Channel squadrons, and supporting Napoleon's invasion of Britain came to nothing: the Armée d'Angleterre waited uselessly at Boulogne as before. In the judgment of Napoleon, his scheme of invasion was baffled by this day's action; but much indignation was felt in England at the failure of Calder to win a complete victory.|$|R
60|$|Her chief {{antagonist}} at {{this time}} was the San Nicholas. Into that ship she poured a tremendous fire, and then {{passed on to the}} San Isidro and Santissima-Trinidada, with which the Captain had been engaged from the beginning. The fire of the Excellent had completed the work done by the Captain, and the San Nicholas and the San Josef had collided with each other. Nelson, being in so crippled a state that he could no longer take an active part in the action, laid his ship alongside the San Nicholas and carried her by boarding; and after this was done the crew crossed to the San Josef, and carried her also. Other prizes had been taken elsewhere; the Salvador Del Mundo and Santissima-Trinidada surrendered, as did the Soberano. The Santissima-Trinidada, however, was towed away by one of her frigates. Evening was closing in, and as the Spanish fleet still greatly outnumbered the British, Jervis made the signal to <b>discontinue</b> the <b>action,</b> and the next morning the fleets sailed in different directions, the British carrying their four prizes with them. Considering the desperate nature of the fighting the British loss was extraordinarily small, only seventy-three being killed and two hundred and twenty-seven wounded. Of these nearly a third belonged to the Captain, upon which the brunt of the fight had fallen. For this victory Admiral Jervis was made an earl, and two admirals baronets. Nelson might have had a baronetcy, but he preferred the ribbon of the Bath. Also, he shortly afterwards was promoted to the rank of Rear-admiral. Captain Calder received the ribbon of the Bath, and all the first lieutenants were promoted.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{describe}} the clinical {{history of a}} child with aggressive behavior and recurring death-theme speech, and report the experience of the team of authors, who proposed an alternative to medication through the establishment of a protection network and the inter-sector implementation of the circle of security concept. Case descriptionA 5 -year-old child has a violent and aggressive behavior at the day-care. The child was diagnosed by the healthcare center with depressive disorder and behavioral disorder, and was medicated with sertraline and risperidone. Side effects were observed, and the medications were <b>discontinued.</b> Despite several <b>actions,</b> such as talks, teamwork, psychological and psychiatric follow-up, the child's behavior remained unchanged. RemarksA unique therapeutic project was developed by Universidade Estadual de Campinas' Medical School students in order to establish a connection between the entities responsible for the child's care (daycare center, healthcare center, and family). Thus, the team was able to develop a basic care protection network. The implementation of the inter-sector circle of security, as well as the communication and cooperation among the teams, produced very favorable results in this case. This initiative was shown to be a feasible and effective alternative to the use of medication for this child...|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, {{the station}} <b>discontinued</b> its {{longtime}} <b>Action</b> 7 News moniker for its newscasts and rebranded its news programming under the 7 News banner.

In late May of that year, KSWO broadcast its early morning newscast, Good Morning Texoma, with limited backup electricity; the newscast was conducted virtually in the dark due to electrical outages that had affected the Lawton area after a complex of severe thunderstorms rolled through southern Oklahoma the previous night with areas of damaging straight-line winds. The only power available to the studio came from a portable generator located {{in one of the}} station's live trucks, which also served as a makeshift studio-transmitter link to relay the signal to the transmitter dish at the Grandfield site. The broadcast was done with one camera, one tape deck and one microphone (which was passed between the anchors).|$|R
5000|$|During {{his absence}} he was tried in {{absentia}} by the Ottoman Court of Bitola and was acquitted. He returned to Macedonia in early 1907 and continued the action {{until the time}} of the Young Turk Movement in 1908, which marked the end of the hard phase of the Macedonian Struggle because of the belief, at this time, that the liberties of minorities in the Ottoman Empire would be respected. In late July 1908, the Greek guerilla groups in the region of Bitola vilayet took an order from the Greek Consulate of Bitola to <b>discontinue</b> their <b>action,</b> but not to surrender their weapons and withdraw to the mountains. This order of the Greek Consulate conveyed by Lazaros to the rebel group of Simos Ioannidis which at the time was acting in the Pisoderi area. The formation of the Young Turk Parliament has not improved the situation in Macedonia. Soon the hopes of changing the behavior of the Young Turks disappointed. In early September 1908, was established the new organization Panhellenic Organosis with Colonel Panagiotis Daglis as Director General. A circular to ..... especially to all the Offices and Agents .... gives guidance on the operation of the organization and communicated to the agent Lazaros Tsami that [...] ".... in general is {{under the supervision of the}} Consuls to announce any such action ..." [...] In 1912, Lazaros as president of the Community of Pisoderi covers the action, of Vasilis Balkos a Greek agent from Arta, initially in the capacity of the Director of Modestos School who was bearing even priest’s robe and subsequently as acting as Director of the Greek Schools of the Florina region assumes the direction of the struggle in the area. [...] Reports later received by the Greek Government on the actions of local rebel bodies by Tsontos Vardas and Special Envoy Vasilios Xirouchas and from Pavlos Giparis, convince the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos that his decision to withdraw the Greek forces from Macedonia was wrong.|$|R
6000|$|Nelson {{was at this}} time, in all the {{excitement}} of action, pacing the quarter-deck. A shot through the mainmast knocked the splinters about; and he observed {{to one of his}} officers with a smile, [...] "It is warm work, and this day may be the last to any of us at a moment:"--and then stopping short at the gangway, added, with emotion--"But mark you! I would not be elsewhere for thousands." [...] About this time the signal-lieutenant called out that number Thirty-nine (the signal for <b>discontinuing</b> the <b>action)</b> was thrown out by the Commander-in-Chief. He continued to walk the deck, and appeared to take no notice of it. The signal officer met him at the next turn, and asked if he should repeat it. [...] "No," [...] he replied, [...] "acknowledge it." [...] Presently he called after him to know if the signal for close action was still hoisted; and being answered in the affirmative, said, [...] "Mind you keep it so." [...] He now paced the deck, moving the stump of his lost arm in a manner which always indicated great emotion. [...] "Do you know," [...] said he to Mr. Ferguson, [...] "what is shown on board the Commander-in-Chief? Number Thirty-nine!" [...] Mr. Ferguson asked what that meant. [...] "Why, to leave off action!" [...] Then shrugging up his shoulders, he repeated the words--"Leave off action? Now, damn me if I do! You know, Foley," [...] turning to the captain, [...] "I have only one eye,--I {{have a right to be}} blind sometimes:" [...] and then putting the glass to his blind eye, in that mood of mind which sports with bitterness, he exclaimed, [...] "I really do not see the signal!" [...] Presently he exclaimed, [...] "Damn the signal! Keep mine for closer battle flying! That's the way I answer signals! Nail mine to the mast!" [...] Admiral Graves, who was so situated that he could not discern what was done on board the ELEPHANT, disobeyed Sir Hyde's signal in like manner; whether by fortunate mistake, or by a like brave intention, has not been made known. The other ships of the line, looking only to Nelson, continued the action. The signal, however, saved Riou's little squadron, but did not save its heroic leader. This squadron, which was nearest the Commander-in-Chief, obeyed and hauled off. It had suffered severely in its most unequal contest. For a long time the AMAZON had been firing, enveloped in smoke, when Riou desired his men to stand fast, and let the smoke clear off, that they might see what they were about. A fatal order--for the Danes then got clear sight of her from the batteries, and pointed their guns with such tremendous effect that nothing but the signal for retreat saved this frigate from destruction. [...] "What will Nelson think of us?" [...] was Riou's mournful exclamation when he unwillingly drew off. He had been wounded in the head by a splinter, and was sitting on a gun, encouraging his men, when, just as the AMAZON showed her stern to the Trekroner battery, his clerk was killed by his side; and another shot swept away several marines who were hauling in the main-brace. [...] "Come, then, my boys!" [...] cried Riou; [...] "let us die all together!" [...] The words had scarcely been uttered before a raking shot cut him in two. Except it had been Nelson himself, the British navy could not have suffered a severer loss.|$|R
