5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a <b>double-action</b> only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Milt Joyce, {{a county}} {{supervisor}} {{and owner of}} the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from the Oriental Saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a <b>double-action</b> revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Colt {{received}} an extension on his patent {{since he did}} not collect {{on it in the}} early years. In 1852, gun makers James Warner and Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent. Colt sued the companies and the court ordered that Warner and Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production. Colt then threatened to sue Allen & Thurber over the cylinder design of their <b>double-action</b> pepperbox revolver. However, Colt's lawyers doubted that this suit would have been successful and the case was resolved with a settlement of $15,000. Production of Allen pepperboxes continued until the expiration of Colt's patent in 1857. In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the U.S. Congress, who launched a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed government officials in securing this extension. By August he was exonerated and the story became national news when Scientific American reported that the fault was not with Colt, but with Washington politicians. With a virtual monopoly, Colt sold his pistols in Europe, where demand was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt's pistols, Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{establishing}} his Hartford factory, Colt set out {{to establish}} a factory in Europe and chose London. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain's Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world's leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal. With help from ICE secretary, Charles Manby, Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the Thames River and began production on January 1, 1853. On {{a tour of the}} factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt's revolvers in an 1852 edition of Household Words. The factory's machines mass-produced its parts that were completely interchangeable and could be put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England's top gun makers making each part by hand. Colt's London factory remained in operation for only four years. Unwilling to alter his open-top single-action design for the solid frame <b>double-action</b> revolver that the British asked for; Colt scarcely sold 23,000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy. In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery, tooling, and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford.|$|E
5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is <b>double-action</b> only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The first version, known {{simply as}} the Model 52, {{retained}} the basic trigger mechanism of the Model 39, with the <b>Double-Action</b> function selectable via a simple frame-mounted setscrew, allowing the pistol to be fired in either single-action or <b>double-action</b> mode depending on the setscrew's adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Be <b>double-action</b> only, Hammer or Striker-Fired.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>double-action</b> revolvers may {{be fired}} in two ways.|$|E
25|$|<b>Double-action</b> {{triggers}} {{provide the}} ability to fire the gun whether the hammer is cocked or uncocked. This feature is desirable for military, police, or self-defense pistols. The primary disadvantage of any <b>double-action</b> trigger is the extra length the trigger must be pulled and the extra weight required to overcome the spring tension of the hammer or striker.|$|E
25|$|The D {{models are}} also <b>double-action</b> only pistols {{but without the}} manual safeties.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. the {{traditional}} single-action revolver still reigned supreme {{until the late}} 19th century. In Europe, however, arms makers were quick to adopt the <b>double-action</b> trigger. While the US was producing weapons like the Model 1873, the Europeans were building <b>double-action</b> models like the French MAS Modèle 1873 and the somewhat later British Enfield Mk I and II revolvers (Britain relied on cartridge conversions of the earlier Beaumont–Adams <b>double-action</b> prior to this). Colt's first attempt at a double action revolver {{to compete with the}} European manufacturers was the Colt Model 1877, which earned lasting notoriety for its overly complex, expensive and fragile trigger mechanism, which in addition to failing frequently, also had a terrible trigger pull unless given the attentions of a competent gunsmith.|$|E
25|$|The M1892 Colt Army & Navy was {{the first}} general issue <b>double-action</b> {{revolver}} with a swing-out cylinder used by the U.S. military.|$|E
25|$|A {{swing door}} has special <b>double-action</b> hinges that {{allow it to}} open either {{outwards}} or inwards, and is usually sprung to keep it closed.|$|E
25|$|The second way is <b>double-action,</b> {{or from a}} hammer-down position. In this case, {{the trigger}} first cocks the hammer and {{revolves}} the cylinder, then trips the hammer {{at the rear of}} the trigger stroke, firing the round in the chamber.|$|E
25|$|There are {{thousands}} of examples of DA/SA semi-automatics, the Walther PPK being the first, followed up by the Walther P-38. Modern examples include weapons such as Beretta 92, among hundreds of others. Almost all revolvers that are not specified as single-action models are capable of firing in both double- and single-action mode, for example, the Smith & Wesson Model 27, S Model 60, the Colt Police Positive, Colt Python, etc. Early <b>double-action</b> revolvers included the Beaumont–Adams and Tranter black-powder muzzleloaders. There are some revolvers {{that can only be}} fired in <b>double-action</b> mode (DAO), but that is almost always due to existing double-action/single-action models being modified so that the hammer cannot be cocked manually, rather than from weapons designed that way from the factory.|$|E
25|$|Designed by C. Reed Knight and Eugene Stoner, it {{was hoped}} by Colt that this pistol would {{recapture}} their stake in the police market as departments across the United States switched from <b>double-action</b> revolvers to semiautomatic pistols. However, the pistol was plagued with reports of inaccuracy and unreliability, and is regarded as an embarrassing failure.|$|E
25|$|DAO {{firearms}} resolve some DA/SA shortcomings {{by making}} every shot a <b>double-action</b> shot. Because {{there is no}} difference in pull weights, training and practice are simplified. Additionally, negligent discharges are mitigated due to a heavier trigger pull. This is a particular advantage for a police pistol. These weapons also generally lack any type of external safety. DAO is common among police agencies and for small, personal protection firearms. The primary drawback is that additional trigger pull weight and travel required for each shot reduce accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Semi-automatic {{refers to}} a firearm which uses the force of recoil or gas to eject the empty case and load a fresh {{cartridge}} into the firing chamber for the next shot and which allows repeat shots solely through the action of pulling the trigger. A <b>double-action</b> revolver also requires only a trigger pull for each round that is fired but is not considered semi-automatic since the manual action of pulling the trigger is what advances the cylinder, not {{the energy of the}} preceding shot.|$|E
25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch {{that enables the}} hammer to be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the <b>double-action</b> mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} of cartridge-firing firearms, the LeMat system appeared in pinfire, but this version is exceedingly rare. A centerfire version in 12mm Perrin or 11mm Chamelot-Delvigne, with a 24 gauge shot barrel, was made in later years in Belgium. While having better sales than its pinfire relative, the centerfire LeMat also had no real commercial success due to {{the invention of the}} <b>double-action</b> system. With both weapons, loading was accomplished via a loading gate located at the 4 o'clock position for the cylinder, and by swinging the breech of the shot barrel up and left.|$|E
25|$|The Winchester Liberator is a 16-gauge, four-barrelled shotgun, {{similar to}} a scaled-up four-shot <b>double-action</b> derringer. It was an {{implementation}} of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. Robert Hillberg, the designer, envisioned a weapon that was cheap to manufacture, easy to use, and provided a significant chance of being effective {{in the hands of}} someone who had never handled a firearm before. Pistols and submachine guns were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a high hit probability. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt eight-shot design came late in the war and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.|$|E
25|$|The {{device was}} {{introduced}} to Cornwall in January 1842, following the award of a premium for the best design, by the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. The winner, Michael Loam, built one for the proprietors of the Tresavean Mine, in Lanner near Redruth. He used a double-rod design, driven by a waterwheel. In October of that year Loam proposed that the water wheel {{be replaced by a}} steam engine. A 36-inch bore, 6-foot stroke, <b>double-action</b> steam engine was employed, through reduction spur gearing of 5:1. At the same time the stroke of the man-engine beams was increased from 6feet to 12. Coal consumption was 24hundredweight (1,200kg) per day; the engine was in use for only six hours a day, but the boiler was kept at operating temperature continuously. The miners' journey time (in either direction) was reduced from about an hour to twenty-four minutes and output per shift increased by one fifth.|$|E
25|$|Compared to autoloading handguns, a {{revolver}} is often much simpler to operate {{and may have}} greater reliability. For example, should a semiautomatic pistol fail to fire, clearing the chamber requires manually cycling the action to remove the errant round, as cycling the action normally depends on the energy of a cartridge firing. With {{a revolver}}, this is not necessary as none of the energy for cycling the revolver comes from the firing of the cartridge, but is supplied by the user either through cocking the hammer or, in a <b>double-action</b> design, by just squeezing the trigger. Another significant advantage of revolvers is superior ergonomics, particularly for users with small hands. A revolver's grip does not hold a magazine, {{and it can be}} designed or customized much more than the grip of a typical semi-automatic. Partially because of these reasons, revolvers still hold significant market share as concealed carry and home-defense weapons.|$|E
25|$|Produced from 1989 to 1998, the Model 5904 has an {{aluminum}} alloy frame and blued steel slide. The Model 5903 was manufactured from 1990 to 1997, and featured {{an aluminum}} alloy frame and {{a stainless steel}} slide. The Model 5905 was a very limited version, with a blued steel frame and slide. It was manufactured only in 1992, and in very low volume. The 5906 is an all stainless steel model, hence it is noticeably heavier than the others. It was produced from 1989 to 1999. The stainless steel <b>double-action</b> only variant of this pistol, the Model 5946, along with the Model 3953, produced from 1990 to 1999, was manufactured without safety levers, and is the primary issue service pistol of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia Sheriff Service, and one of three pistols available for selection by New York City Police Department.|$|E
25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a <b>double-action</b> only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E
500|$|The Webley RIC (Royal Irish Constabulary) {{model was}} Webley's first <b>double-action</b> revolver, and {{adopted by the}} RIC in 1868, hence the name. It was a solid frame, gate-loaded revolver, {{chambered}} in [...]442 Webley. General George Armstrong Custer was known to have owned a pair, which he {{is believed to have}} used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{compiled}} during the Northern Song dynasty by {{scholars such as}} Zeng Gongliang (曾公亮), Ding Du (丁度) and Yang Weide (楊惟德), whose writing influenced many later Chinese military writers. [...] The compendium was published {{under the auspices of}} Emperor Renzong, who also authored the book's preface. [...] The book covers a wide range of subjects, everything from naval warships to different types of catapults. [...] It contains the earliest known written chemical formulas for gunpowder, made from saltpeter, sulphur and charcoal along with many added ingredients. [...] In addition to formulas for gunpowder, the compendium contains details on various other gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows, incendiary bombs and projectiles, grenades and smoke bombs. [...] It also describes an early form of the compass (using [...] ), and has the oldest illustration of a Chinese Greek fire flamethrower with a <b>double-action</b> dual-piston cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame.|$|E
500|$|NWMP Commissioner Acheson G. Irvine ordered 200 Mark IIs in 1882, {{priced at}} C$15.75 each, which were shipped by London's Montgomery and Workman in November that year, {{arriving}} in December. They replaced the Adams. Irvine liked {{them so much}} that, {{in one of his}} final acts as Commissioner, he ordered another 600, which were delivered in September 1885. His replacement, Lawrence W. Herchmer, reported the force was entirely outfitted with Enfields (in all 1,079 were provided) and was pleased with them, but concerned about the [...]476 round being too potent. The first batch was stamped NWMP-CANADA (issue number between) after delivery; later purchases were not. They were top-break single- or <b>double-action,</b> and fitted with lanyard rings. Worn spindle arms would fail to hold empty cases on ejection, and worn pivot pins could cause barrels to become loose, resulting in inaccuracy. Its deep rifling would allow firing of slugs of between [...] diameter. Complaints began arising as early as 1887, influenced in part by the British switching to Webleys, and by 1896, hinge wear and barrel loosening were a real issue.|$|E
2500|$|L. W. Seecamp Co. {{was started}} as a pistol smithing company in 1973 specializing in <b>double-action</b> {{conversions}} for the 1911 Colt [...]45. At the time, there were no commercially available <b>double-action</b> 1911 pistols anywhere in the world.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of the Colt Single Action Army and Colt's {{conversion}} of existing percussion revolvers to Richards-Mason conversions, Mason went on to design Colt's first <b>Double-action</b> revolver, the Colt M1877. [...] Following this, he once again teamed up with Richards to produce a larger-framed version, the Colt M1878 Frontier. It was Colt's first large-frame, <b>double-action</b> revolver. It combined {{the front end of the}} Single Action Army revolver with a <b>double-action,</b> 6-shot frame mechanism. It was available commercially in numerous calibers.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>double-action</b> (DA), {{the stroke}} of the trigger pull generates three actions: ...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>double-action,</b> {{also known}} as <b>double-action</b> only (DAO) to prevent {{confusion}} with DA/SA designs, is a design which either has no internal sear mechanism capable of holding the hammer or striker in the cocked position (semi-automatics), or has the entire hammer shrouded and/or has the thumb spur machined off, preventing the user from cocking it (revolvers).|$|E
2500|$|A double-action/single-action (DA/SA) firearm {{combines}} {{the features of}} both mechanisms. This action type {{is also known as}} traditional <b>double-action</b> (TDA).|$|E
2500|$|This design {{requires}} a trigger pull to both cock and trip the hammer/striker {{for every single}} shot, unlike a DA/SA, which only {{requires a}} <b>double-action</b> trigger pull for the first shot (or a typical DA/SA revolver, which can fire single action any time the user wishes, but uses <b>double-action</b> as a default). This {{means that there is}} no single-action function for any shot, and the hammer or striker always rests in the down position until the trigger pull begins. With automatics, this means that unlike DA/SA weapons, the hammer does not remain cocked after the first round is fired, and every shot is in <b>double-action</b> mode. With revolvers, this means that one does not have the option of cocking the gun before shooting, and must always shoot it in double action mode.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} sense, [...] "automatic revolver" [...] {{refers to the}} {{mechanism}} of firing rather than extraction. <b>Double-action</b> revolvers use a long trigger pull to cock the hammer, thus negating the need to manually cock the hammer between shots. The disadvantage {{of this is that}} the long, heavy pull cocking the hammer makes the <b>double-action</b> revolver much harder to shoot accurately than a single-action revolver (although cocking the hammer of a <b>double-action</b> reduces the length and weight of the trigger pull). A rare class of revolvers, called automatic for its firing design, attempts to overcome this restriction, giving the high speed of a <b>double-action</b> with the trigger effort of a single-action. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver is the most famous commercial example. It was recoil-operated, and the cylinder and barrel recoiled backwards to cock the hammer and revolve the cylinder. Cam grooves were milled {{on the outside of the}} cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamber—half a turn as the cylinder moved back, and half a turn as it moved forward[...]38 caliber versions held eight shots, [...]455 caliber versions six. At the time, the few available automatic pistols were larger, less reliable, and more expensive. The automatic revolver was popular when it first came out, but was quickly superseded by the creation of reliable, inexpensive semi-automatic pistols.|$|E
2500|$|The FS {{models are}} Double-action/Single-action (DA/SA) pistols; {{they have an}} initial <b>double-action</b> trigger pull {{subsequently}} followed by single-action operation. The [...] "FS" [...] models have a safety lever that also functions as a decocking lever.|$|E
