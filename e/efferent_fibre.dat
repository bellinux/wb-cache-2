40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that electrotonic coupling is an important mechanism for neuronal synchronisation in the mammalian cortex and hippocampus. Various types of network oscillations {{have been shown to}} depend on, or be sharpened by, gap junctions between inhibitory interneurones or excitatory projection cells. Here we made use of a targeted disruption of the gene coding for Cx 36, a recently discovered neuronal gap junction subunit, to analyse its role in hippocampal network behaviour. Mice lacking Cx 36 are viable and lack obvious morphological or behavioural abnormalities. Stimulation of afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>fibre</b> pathways in hippocampal slices revealed a largely normal function of the synaptic circuitry, including tetanically evoked network oscillations. Spontaneous sharp waves and ripple (∼ 200 Hz) oscillations, however, occurred less frequently in slices from Cx 36 -/- mice, and ripples were slightly slower than in littermate controls. Moreover, epileptiform discharges elicited by 4 -aminopyridine were attenuated in slices from Cx 36 -/- mice. Our findings indicate that Cx 36 plays a role in the generation of certain forms of network synchronisation in the hippocampus, namely sharp wave-ripple complexes and hypersynchronous epileptiform discharges...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} muscle <b>efferent</b> <b>fibre</b> {{activation}} during whole body cooling {{was investigated in}} urethane-anaesthetized rats. Multiunit efferent activity to the gastrocnemius muscle was detected when the trunk skin was cooled by a water-perfused jacket to below 36. 0 ± 0. 7 °C. That efferent activity was not blocked by hexamethonium (50 mg kg− 1, i. v.) and {{was not associated with}} movement or electromyographic activity. Cold-induced efferent activity enhanced the discharge of afferent filaments from the isotonically stretched gastrocnemius muscle, demonstrating that it was fusimotor. Fusimotor neurons were activated by falls in trunk skin temperature, but that activity ceased when the skin was rewarmed, regardless of how low core temperature had fallen. While low core temperature alone was ineffective, a high core temperature could inhibit the fusimotor response to skin cooling. Fusimotor activation by skin cooling was often accompanied by desynchronization of the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG), but was not a simple consequence of cortical arousal, in that warming the scrotum desynchronized the EEG without activating fusimotor fibres. Inhibition of neurons in the rostral medullary raphé by microinjections of glycine (0. 5 m, 120 – 180 nl) reduced the fusimotor response to skin cooling by 95 ± 3 %, but did not prevent the EEG response. These results are interpreted as showing a novel thermoregulatory reflex that is triggered by cold exposure. It may underlie the increased muscle tone that precedes overt shivering, and could also serve to amplify shivering. Like several other cold-defence responses, this reflex depends upon neurons in the rostral medullary raphé...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{functionally}} single gamma-efferents (20 - 42 m/s) to the triceps surae {{were isolated}} in ventral root filaments of the decerebrated and paralysed cat {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} group I muscle afferents on their own fusimotor neurones. All the efferents studied were spontaneously active. During splitting the continuity of the <b>efferent</b> <b>fibre</b> was preserved so that the destination of the target muscle of the efferent could be determined by antidromic stimulation of the muscle nerve using the collision block technique. Thereafter the filament was cut so that the reflex response, uncontaminated by antidromic impulse invasion, could be recorded from the central end. Sixteen of forty gamma-efferents to the triceps were inhibited by repetitive stimulation (range - 3 to - 40 impulses/s) of the homonymous nerve within the group I range. Raising the stimulus strength above the group II threshold produced no further increase in inhibition. Twelve of these sixteen cells were also tested by stretching the triceps; ten showed marked inhibition, and two were not influenced. In ten of the sixteen inhibited cells, the autogenetic inhibition at maximum group I stimulus strength was larger than the maximum antidromic inhibition elicited by stimulation of the remainder of the cut ventral roots L 7 and S 1. Since both effects were additive, it is concluded that Renshaw inhibition is at least not solely responsible for the autogenetic inhibition. Consistent with this assumption is the observation that some cells receiving electrically evoked autogenetic inhibition were not susceptible to inhibition induced by small-amplitude vibration of the triceps. Since small-amplitude vibration is known to excite most of the Ia afferents of the vibrated triceps, Ib afferents must be involved in the autogenetic fusimotor inhibition. A contribution of Ia afferents to the autogenetic inhibition (via alpha-motoneurones and Renshaw cells or via Ib inhibitory interneurones) seems likely since inhibition, induced by small-amplitude vibration, was detectable in many of the cells receiving autogenetic group I inhibition. All of these cells were susceptible to antidromic inhibition. Ten of the forty cells tested responded with tonic facilitation to the homonymous nerve stimulation. Some arguments favour the view that static gamma-motoneurones are involved in the low-threshold autogenetic inhibition. The results strongly support earlier work suggest a regulatory function of low-threshold muscle receptors on their own gamma-motoneurones...|$|E

40|$|This thesis asks two questions. First, {{is there}} an efferent control system of the {{arterial}} chemoreceptors other than by control of the vasculature? Secondly, do single chemoreceptors show an oscillation in their discharge with respiration and, if so, what is {{the natural history of}} the oscillations? The general methods for the recording of the discharge of single chemoreceptor fibres of the sinus nerve of the cat are described. Specific experimental details are described in the appropriate chapters. Efferent control Microelectrodes were used to record intracellular potentials from the carotid body in vitro and in vivo in an attempt to link efferent inhibition arising from electrical stimulation of the sinus nerve with changes in the membrane potentials of the cells. 176 cells were recorded from in vitro and 24 cells in vivo. These were probably Type I cells. Membrane potentials ranged from 15 andndash; 60 andnbsp;mV with a mean of about 30 andnbsp;mV. No 'physiological' or pharmacological stimulus that was used affected these potentials. Potassium chloride solution depolarised the cells reversibly. Stimulation of the sinus nerve at intensities sufficient for maximal excitation of the 'C' fibres within it had no effect on the recorded potentials. Neither transient junctional-type potentials nor slow drifts of potential were seen. In parallel experiments the sinus nerve was stimulated electrically whilst recording the discharge in single chemoreceptor fibres peeled from the nerve distal to the stimulating electrodes. Stimulation could cause adventitious excitation of the recorded afferent resulting in antidromic depression, which mimicked a true physiological inhibition of the discharge. Some of the features of this adventitious excitation and the ease with which it occurred were investigated using an isolated segment of vagus, baroreceptor fibres, and chemoreceptor fibres. Low concentrations of local anaesthetic could raise the threshold for adventitious excitation whilst not affecting the normal passage of impulses. When looking for true inhibition, a continuous check for adventitious excitation was kept, utilizing the fact that chemoreceptors show a minimum interspike interval of about 10 andnbsp;msec. With this check, stimulation of the sinus nerve still caused a reduction in discharge in afferent fibres, to about 70 % of control, though this was rather variable. In four out of five fibres tested, the inhibition was reduced or abolished by close intra-arterial injection of atropine. In conclusion: the true inhibition of discharge would seem not to be synaptic but vasomotor in origin. Oscillations in discharge Most single fibres of the cat and dog showed oscillations in discharge in phase with respiration when summed by computer over many respiratory cycles. The trough in the oscillation followed inspiration with a delay equal to the lung to carotid body circulation time. The amplitude of these oscillations was increased by decreasing respiratory frequencies or by increasing metabolism by poisoning with dinitrophenol. Hypercapnia or hypoxia decreased the relative amplitude of the oscillations but the absolute amplitude remained approximately constant. Oscillations from pairs of fibres recorded simultaneously were similar in phase and relative amplitude. The oscillations were not affected by sectioning or stimulating the cervical sympathetic trunk, nor by sectioning the sinus nerve whilst recording from an afferent from the otherwise intact nerve. The most likely source of the oscillation is thought to be the respiratory oscillation of P a,CO 2 in the carotid blood. It is proposed that the responses can be explained in terms of families of parallel transient P a,CO 2 -response curves that are steeper than the fans of response curves described for the steady state by other workers and cut these curves at the mean P a,CO 2. A non-sympathetic <b>efferent</b> <b>fibre</b> that was recorded from showed no oscillation in the discharge with respiration, and interval distribution histograms of its discharge did not have the simple exponential form shown by afferent discharge. Earlier workers had described the discharge of single chemoreceptors as random and this was seemingly at variance with an oscillating discharge. In an attempt to resolve this it was assumed that the mean frequency of the random process varied over the respiratory cycle, and statistical tests showed that, with this assumption, the impulses were random with respect to each other although they were not random with respect to the respiratory cycle. That is, the probability of the occurrence of an impulse varies with a respiratory periodicity but not with the time since the occurrence of the previous impulse. The technique of recording from two fibres simultaneously on separate electrodes was originally used to see if it would be justifiable to apply the results of summing the discharge of one fibre over many cycles to the response of the whole nerve, i. e. many fibres over one cycle. This recording method allowed farther comparisons between fibres, when the arterial stimulus must have been the same for both receptors, by going back over the experimental records and comparing the frequencies of discharge of the pair of fibres at any time. In some experiments specific manoeuvres were performed to obtain further information. The frequencies of discharge of fibres were compared: at steady mean rates; during the responses to various ventilatory stimuli; at the intra-arterial injection of 100 % CO 2 -saline; as well as in their oscillatory behaviour over the respiratory cycle. If allowances were made for differences in characteristic mean frequencies of discharge, the sensitivities to any change of arterial stimulus proved remarkably similar, that is the discharge of one receptor could give as much information as that of the whole population. There were indications that receptors might differ in threshold, peak response, and adaptation. The most striking finding was that the sensitivity of a receptor could change with time, although, at any one moment, the chemoreceptors are a surprisingly homogeneous population. The results suggest that there is a single mechanism responsible for the sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia. </p...|$|E

40|$|Frog labyrinthine {{receptor}} {{activity is}} controlled by an efferent inhibitory system whose fibres directly synapse with the hair cells. EPSP and spike discharge, recorded at rest and during rotatory stimulation from fibres of the posterior nerve in the isolated labyrinth, were in fact reduced and eventually abolished by electrical stimulation (10 - 200 /sec) either of the proximal end of the same nerve or of the central stumps of the anterior-horizontal nerve. Such inhibitory effect was selectively cancelled by: 1) d-tubocurarine (10 - 6 M); 2) ACh and carbachol (10 - 4); 3) increasing K+ (10 mM) or decreasing Cl- (< 25 mM) concentration in the bath; 4) cutting the VIII nerve at its entrance in the brain stem and allowing degeneration of the <b>efferent</b> <b>fibres.</b> Denervation rules {{out the possibility that}} reoeptor-receptor fibres sustain the observed inhibitory effect, which is most likely mediated by <b>efferent</b> <b>fibres</b> that extensively branch in the VIII nerve and depress the hair cell activity by releasing ACh.

Prior surgical denervation of the joint significantly inhibited this response in the carrageenan and formalin models, but not the others.

In addition, autonomic <b>efferent</b> <b>fibres</b> may also be present in these fibre groups. As no fibre diameters greater than 7 µm were noted, it appears that Group I and II fibres are absent in this nerve. The fibre distribution suggests that the principal role of this nerve is to relay bone-related nociceptive or mechanoreceptive information to {{the central nervous system}} and to provide autonomic regulatory influences on the bone...|$|R

Electrically stimulating the afferent fibres present in the sacral dorsal roots and somatic nerves inhibited the colonic spike potential frequency (n = 97) and increased the slow variations in the sphincteric membrane potential (n = 76). These effects were found to have disappeared after administering an alpha-noradrenergic receptor blocker (n = 64) or sectioning the sympathetic <b>efferent</b> <b>fibres</b> innervating these organs (n = 69) suggesting the involvement of the sympathetic system in the effects observed. Moreover, no significant differences were observed between the effects of sacral dorsal root vs somatic nerve stimulation on colonic and sphincteric EMG activity. In conclusion, the data obtained here show that neurostimulation applied to the sacral spinal roots may improve fecal continence by inhibiting colonic activity and enhancing IAS activity via a somatosympathetic reflex...|$|R
40|$|Bell-Magendie's law of {{separation}} of spinal function states that afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>fibres</b> join the spinal cord separately in ventral and dorsal spinal nerve roots. For over 100 years {{there have been reports}} that challenge the exclusiveness of this law in mammals; very few studies have referred to man. We conducted a prospective morphological study in patients with preganglionic traction injuries of the brachial plexus to address this question. Avulsed ventral and dorsal roots were examined after variable intervals from the injury for histological and ultrastructural evidence for myelinated afferent fibres entering the cord via the ventral roots. Intact myelinated fibres were found in all ventral root specimens, but the majority of fibres in later biopsies are regenerative. A small number of fibres could be demonstrated that are likely to be ‘wrong way ventral afferents’. Their number is falsely low due to wallerian degeneration of dorsal and ventral afferents following the mechanical and ischaemic effects of traction injury. Our findings are the first morphological evidence in human material that Bell-Magendie's law might not entirely be correct and they underline the difficulties in comparing traumatic with experimental rhizotomy...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the cut distal end of the posterior articular nerve (p. a. n.) of the cat knee joint resulted in significant extravasation of plasma proteins and erythrocytes into the synovial cavity of the knee. This effect was mediated by group IV afferents (C fibres) since {{stimulation of}} p. a. n. suprathreshold for group II or III afferents but subthreshold for group IV afferents did not produce extravasation. Unmyelinated sympathetic <b>efferent</b> <b>fibres</b> in the joint nerve did {{not contribute to the}} extravasation and were responsible for a diminution of this response as shown by the enhanced extravasation occurring after adrenergic blockade. Plasma and erythrocyte extravasation was mediated by afferents containing substance P (SP), as demonstrated by the reversible abolition of extravasation when the substance P antagonist (D-Pro 4,D-Trp 7, 9, 10) -SP (4 - 11) was injected into the synovial cavity. In some animals it was observed that electrical {{stimulation of the}} cut distal end of p. a. n. in one limb resulted in extravasation in the contralateral knee joint. It is suggested that articular C fibre afferents could make a significant neurogenic contribution to the initiation or maintenance of inflammatory joint disease...|$|R
40|$|In unanaesthetized sheep, the {{sensitivity}} of the baroreceptor-cardio-inhibitory reflex was greater when intravenous vasopressin was used to raise blood pressure, than when intravenous phenylephrine was used to raise blood pressure. This difference was still evident in animals in which beta-adrenergic blockade had been carried out using propranolol. In the presence of combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic blockade, a direct negative chronotropic effect of intravenous vasopressin could not be demonstrated. It was concluded, therefore, that intravenous vasopressin enhanced cardiac vagal tone. This effect of vasopressin on efferent cardiac vagal tone was confirmed directly in anaesthetized dogs by recording from single cardiac vagal <b>efferent</b> <b>fibres.</b> Furthermore, recordings from single carotid sinus baroreceptor fibres did not demonstrate a direct action of vasopressin on {{the sensitivity}} of the baroreceptors. However, the pressor effect of vasopressin is associated with a greater increase in efferent cardiac vagal discharge than that seen when equipressor doses of phenylephrine are given, or when blood pressure is raised by a similar amount by inflation of an intra-aortic balloon. Studies in isolated guinea-pig atrial preparations and in anaesthetized rabbits and dogs, revealed no consistent peripheral action of vasopressin on the action of the vagus at the heart...|$|R
