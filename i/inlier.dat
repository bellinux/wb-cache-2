5|$|Windsor Castle was {{originally}} built by William the Conqueror {{in the decade}} after the Norman conquest of 1066. William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march– about – {{from the city and}} from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis. Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings. The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep {{on the top of a}} man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk <b>inlier,</b> or bluff, rising 100ft (30m) above the river. A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward. By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle. In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle.|$|E
25|$|Further to {{the north}} still, {{sandwiched}} between these intake fields and the steep slopes of the Pennine escarpment itself lies a complex geological zone known as the Cross Fell <b>Inlier</b> (see Burgess and Wadge). It consists of a lens of older rocks faulted upwards between the much younger layers that bound it. The whole North Pennines AONB, of which the <b>Inlier</b> forms part, is in fact of such interest to geologists that in 2003 it was designated a Geopark under a Unesco programme to promote public interest in geology.|$|E
25|$|Geology: The oldest rocks {{found on}} the Watermillock Common ridge occur on the lower south eastern slopes (above Ullswater) where {{faulting}} has brought to the present surface an <b>inlier</b> of mudstone from the Tarn Moor Formation, the latest part of the Skiddaw Group. These mudstones were deposited in deep seas about 470 million years ago during the Ordovician period.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inly</b> School {{was founded}} in 1973, as The Montessori Community School. In 2004 the school was renamed <b>Inly</b> School. The adverb “inly” means to do {{something}} with great depth of knowledge and understanding.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Inly</b> campus {{includes}} two playing fields and three playgrounds for different age groups. <b>Inly</b> Middle School sports teams participate in two interscholastic athletic leagues: the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) and the Montessori Athletic Conference (MAC) of Massachusetts.|$|R

25|$|From an {{agricultural}} perspective, however, the Geopark {{is simply an}} area of poorly drained grazing that becomes progressively less useful as its altitude increases. Nevertheless, the lower slopes of the <b>inlier</b> are still sufficiently valuable to be enclosed, largely with drystone walling, and are used for grazing sheep and cattle. Fell ponies are also raised here. Immediately above the village, this area is known as Red Carle.|$|E
25|$|Rocks of Cambrian age occur most {{extensively}} in an <b>inlier</b> in Merionethshire where the up-arched rocks of the Harlech Dome form the Rhinogs. The Harlech Grits Group comprises sandstones, mudstones and greywackes forms the eroded {{core of the}} dome and within this sequence it is specifically the greywackes of the 'Rhinog Formation' which provides the higher hills. Cambrian rocks are also {{to be found in}} north Pembrokeshire, Anglesey and Llŷn.|$|E
25|$|Rocks {{dating from}} the Silurian period are, by one measure, the most {{significant}} for Wales’ landscape; {{a greater percentage of}} the country’s land area is directly underlain by rocks of this age than any other. Much of central Wales is formed in Silurian sandstones and mudstones as is the more gentle landscape of central Monmouthshire where the Usk Anticline gives rise to the Usk <b>Inlier.</b> In the north it is the Ludlow age mudstones and sandstones of the Elwy and Nantglyn Formations which form the Clwydian Range, and the Nantglyn Flags and Wenlockian Denbigh Grits which form the Denbigh Moors, Llantysilio Mountain and the Dee Valley around Llangollen. In west Wales, parts of south and central Pembrokeshire around Haverfordwest and Narberth and between Marloes and Daugleddau are formed by Llandovery aged mudstones, sandstones and conglomerates.|$|E

500|$|The {{southern}} {{slopes of}} the Mendip Hills largely follow the flanks of an anticline, a fold in the rock that is convex upwards and has its oldest beds at its core. On the Mendips {{the crest of the}} anticline is truncated by erosion, forming a [...] plateau. The rock strata here dip 10–15 degrees to the southwest. The outer slopes are mainly of Carboniferous Limestone, with Devonian age Old Red Sandstone exposed as an <b>inlier</b> at the centre. Wookey Hole is a solutional cave mainly formed in the limestone by chemical weathering whereby naturally acidic groundwater dissolves the carbonate rocks, but it is unique in that {{the first part of the}} cave is formed in Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate, a well-cemented fossil limestone scree representing the infill of a Triassic valley.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{cement works}} at Eastgate, until {{recently}} run by Lafarge, {{was based on}} an <b>inlier</b> of limestone. The site recently gained planning permission to form a visitor complex showcasing an eco-village using alternative technology, including a [...] "hot rocks" [...] water heating system. The underlying granite has been drilled and reports confirm their presence. Bardon Aggregates continue to quarry at Heights near Westgate and operate a tarmac [...] "blacktop" [...] plant on site.|$|E
2500|$|Then it gets curiouser. Rock {{very similar}} to the WEMB (including a type called blueschist) is also found in the San Juan Islands, and along the West Coast fault {{on the west side of}} Vancouver Island. [...] This {{suggests}} that the OWL was once a strike-slip fault, possibly a continental margin, along which terranes moved from the southeast. [...] But similar rock also occurs in the Rimrock Lake <b>Inlier,</b> about 75nbsp&km south of the OWL and just west of the projected trace of the SCF, and also in the Klamath Mountains of southwestern Oregon. To account for the wide dispersal of this rock is difficult; many geologists see no alternative to transport along an extended SCF. [...] But that upsets some of the [...] "solutions" [...] described above, and there is yet no consensus on this.|$|E

2500|$|On the Belcher Islands of {{southern}} Nunavut, two volcanic groups {{are known as}} the Flaherty and Eskimo volcanics. The underlying Eskimo volcanics are related with the Richmond Gulf, Persillon, Pachi and Nastapoka Group volcanics. The 1,998million-year-old Minto dikes are also interpreted to be related with the Eskimo volcanics. The overlying Flaherty volcanics remain undated apart from a lead-lead dating of [...] However, the Flaherty volcanics are suggested to have relationships with the Sutton <b>Inlier</b> and Haig sills. Geochemical indications suggest that the overlying Flaherty volcanics might also have relationships with the Povungnituk volcano-sedimentary group in the Cape Smith Belt, indicating the Flaherty volcanics might be 2,040to 1,960million years old. Sills on the Belcher and Snowy islands in Hudson Bay are dated to 1,870million years old, indicating the 1,880million-year-old magmatism also exists in {{this section of the}} Circum–Superior large igneous province.|$|E
2500|$|Four main streams drain {{from the}} Rayleigh Hills, and flow in a {{generally}} easterly direction {{until they reach}} the Rochford Basin. The southernmost is the Prittle Brook. Next comes the Eastwood Brook, and then the Noblesgreen Ditch. The fourth stream originates in Hockley Woods, and is joined by a fifth in Hawkwell, {{on the edge of}} the Rochford Basin. Once they enter the basin, they all flow towards its centre, and join up near Rochford. The way in which they are all roughly parallel until they reach the basin, and then change direction, together with the presence of a small chalk <b>inlier</b> near Stambridge Mill, when the chalk layer throughout the area is between [...] below sea level, has led Stratford to suggest that the Rochford Basin may be the result of an impact by an asteroid in the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene periods.|$|E
2500|$|Still {{further to}} the north, the steep fellsides above the <b>Inlier</b> are unenclosed and grazed {{exclusively}} by sheep. In the past this would perhaps be best described as [...] "ranching" [...] as, in the summer the sheep would range freely {{over the top of}} the Pennine escarpment and down into Teesdale. [...] Regular [...] "gathers" [...] would be held to round them up for dipping and shearing. [...] Much has changed in this respect, however, since the catastrophic foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001. The [...] "hefted" [...] herds which had previously acquired a useful territorial instinct were all lost and are now only slowly being replaced. [...] The old [...] "commoner" [...] system, whereby grazing (and other) rights were granted exclusively to individuals, has also been bought out by English Nature, concerned about the effect of over-grazing. Sheep numbers are now closely controlled. [...] English Nature is also attempting to develop the diversity of the fell side habitat and has planted selected areas with hardy indigenous species such as juniper. A particular aim is to re-introduce the black grouse to the area.|$|E

2500|$|Being sited {{between two}} river mouths, {{the city has}} little natural {{exposure}} of bedrock. This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), {{there is only a}} vague understanding of what underlies the city. To {{the south side of the}} city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an <b>inlier</b> of Devonian [...] "Old Red" [...] sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the Dalradian period (approximately 480–600million years ago) with sporadic areas of igneous Diorite granites to be found, such as that at the Rubislaw quarry which was used to build much of the Victorian parts of the city.|$|E
2500|$|The Devils Mountain Fault {{separates}} two {{similar but}} distinctive ensembles of Mesozoic (pre-Tertiary, [...] before the dinosaurs died) or older rock. On {{the north is}} the Helena—Haystack mélange (HH mélange, purple in the diagram at right), on the south the Western and Eastern mélange belts (WEMB, blue). There are some interesting relationships here. E.g., HH mélange rock {{has been found in}} Manastash Ridge, 110km to the south (look for the small sliver of purple {{near the bottom of the}} diagram). Also, the sedimentary Chuckanut Formation (part of the NWCS, green) north of the DMF correlates to the Suak and Roslyn Formations just north of Manastash Ridge. All this is explained by right-lateral strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault, which initiated about 50 to 48 Ma (millions of years ago). This is just after the terrane carrying the Olympic Mountains came into contact with the North American continent. These mélanges may have been off-shore islands or seamounts that were caught between the Olympic terrane and the North American continent, and were pushed up (obducted) onto the latter. Other similar rock has been found at the Rimrock Lake <b>Inlier</b> (bottom of diagram), in the San Juan Islands, and in the Pacific Coast Complex along the West Coast Fault on the west side of Vancouver Island. It appears the entire DDMFZ and Leech River fault system was pushed onto the early continental margin from an original alignment along the OWL. This is an important observation because the Strawberry Point, Utsalady Point, Southern Whidbey Island, and various other unnamed faults lying between the DDMFZ and the OWL [...] all of which converge at the western end of the DDMFZ [...] seem to be intermediate versions of the DDMFZ.|$|E

50|$|An <b>inlier</b> {{is an area}} {{of older}} rocks {{surrounded}} by younger rocks. Inliers are typically formed by the erosion of overlying younger rocks to reveal a limited exposure of the older underlying rocks. Faulting or folding may also contribute to the observed outcrop pattern. A classic example from Great Britain is that of the <b>inlier</b> of folded Ordovician and Silurian rocks at Horton in Ribblesdale in North Yorkshire which are surrounded by the younger flat-lying Carboniferous Limestone. The location has long been visited by geology students. Another example from South Wales is the Usk <b>Inlier</b> in Monmouthshire where Silurian age rocks are upfolded amidst Old Red Sandstone rocks of Devonian age.|$|E
