Bradley Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, also praised the song's autobiographical lyrics; [...] "The message is sincere, vulnerable and undoubtedly true to Madonna’s story, the music is strong and that chorus is utterly anthemic. Madonna hasn’t had a truly rich, singer-songwriter, sing-along friendly record in a while— maybe since Music?— so it's kind of unbelievable to hear such a strong melody from the Queen again". He called it [...] "one of her best songs in a long time". Stern preferred the leaked demo over the final original version.|$|E
