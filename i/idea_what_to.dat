5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown {{even though there was}} no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{new year}} at McKinley High. New Directions glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) are now sharing an apartment and a bed. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad, is running for Congress but doing badly in the polls. Glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) is now a senior, while fellow members Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) are juniors. Club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), a senior, has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do about his future. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) has a new boyfriend (LaMarcus Tinker); her former boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) moved to another state. Three New Directions members have left: Sam, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who also broke up with Puck (Mark Salling), and Sam's ex-girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), who has completely reinvented herself with pink hair, a nose ring and a tattoo; she has taken up smoking, and has made friends {{with a group of}} outcast girls called the Skanks. She refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions.|$|E

25|$|With the {{decision}} made, the Air Ministry finally allowed window {{to be used}} in July 1943. It was used {{for the first time on}} a raid on Hamburg on the night of 24/25 July 1943. The effects were spectacular; having become accustomed to using radar to guide their defences, window produced so many false targets that the operators had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. AA guns were seen to fire randomly into the sky while night fighters flew in circles. The attacking force lost only 12 aircraft, 1.5% of the force, about what would be expected from entirely random events.|$|E
25|$|Twilight awakens {{again in}} an {{ethereal}} {{place where she}} is greeted by Princess Celestia, who congratulates her and declares that Twilight is ready for a new stage in her life. Twilight undergoes a transformation and returns to Ponyville as a winged unicorn known as an alicorn. Her friends are amazed and happily welcome her change, while Celestia announces that Twilight is no longer her student, but a princess who has demonstrated leadership and other positive attributes from her friends during her stay in Ponyville. Twilight becomes concerned that she has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do now as {{she is no longer}} Celestia's student, but Celestia promises that they will all help each other to learn what may come in the future. Twilight is officially crowned in a grand celebration in Canterlot, and she thanks her friends for being there to help her.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the seventh season, Cindy White of IGN {{said that the}} episode proved to fans that Jim and Pam dragged the series at times. She wrote that the episode {{was one of the}} worst of the series—noting that only the sixth season clip show [...] "The Banker" [...] was worse—and blamed it on the writers, who she said [...] "have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with [...] anymore".|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} way, The Village Voice criticized the album as a [...] "nü-Mariah on mood stabilizers, extended with pseudo-pastiches of semi-popular songs". Todd Burns for Stylus Magazine was also negative toward the album, giving it an [...] "F" [...] score and wrote, [...] "in between ten to twelve mediocre/good songs, we have {{eight to ten}} songs that {{would be better served}} as B-sides". Q provided a two-out-of-five-stars rating and commented that [...] "Sadly, bra-burning rhetoric and gospel warbling make poor substitutes for addictive songs". AllMusic's editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also wrote {{a negative}} review, commenting that the album is [...] "the sound of an artist who was given too much freedom too early and has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with it". Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles also provided a negative review, commenting that Stripped [...] "is a blast of excess that risks alienating Ms. Aguilera's old fans without luring new ones, and it's bursting with misguided energy".|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during {{the start of the}} series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club writer Myles McNutt compared the episode to [...] "Training Day" [...] commenting that The Inner Circle' is {{more successful than}} that episode [...] on some levels", but [...] "both episodes suffer from the same problem: They’re simply not very funny or meaningful, which I'd argue is even more problematic for [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] given {{its position in the}} season." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a C-. TV Squad writer Joel Keller wrote that while [...] "the episode did have its funny moments", [...] "overall, you can just feel that the show has changed in a very fundamental way". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized the writers for still not finding Deangelo's character out commenting that [...] "the fact that the writers so clearly had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with Ferrell doesn't fill me with confidence for whatever guest stars turn up in the final episodes – nor do I feel especially great right now about the idea of an outside character coming in as the permanent new regional manager." ...|$|E

500|$|Since 2016, Chabon {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Donald Trump, both during his {{campaign}} for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his presidency in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with The Guardian before Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, [...] "I really have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect. He’s so unpredictable. He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if {{he said he was going}} to take them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news is, I have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney." ...|$|E

Skinner had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> make of Williams, adds Reeve, as he [...] could {{instantly}} perform in many dialects, including Scottish, Irish, English, Russian, and Italian. Their primary acting teacher was Michael Kahn, who was [...] "equally baffled by this human dynamo," [...] notes Reeve. Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn sometimes criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his convincing role of an old man in The Night of the Iguana, by Tennessee Williams. [...] "He simply was the old man," [...] observed Reeve.

However, when Nicola returns to her current flat, she expresses frustration over Dan's insistence that their new flat must have a study. When challenged as to what Dan needs a study for, his reasons are rather flimsy, such as needing a room to quietly reflect and contemplate things. Nicola is also frustrated by Dan's lack of effort to find a job, and lack of housekeeping. Dan goes out drinking at a hotel bar where he is a regular, known by the bartender, Ambrose, with whom Dan shares his philosophy on women and how hard they are to please. It become clear that Dan has very little <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with his life. He returns drunk, to Nicola's annoyance.|$|E
2500|$|Hoppus {{felt betrayed}} (Barker {{was also in}} Box Car Racer) and a rift {{developed}} between Hoppus and DeLonge that would carry on into the band's future. When the band regrouped to record their next record in 2003, all of the members had become fathers (or, {{in the case of}} Barker, becoming one) and the trio took a darker, more [...] "mature" [...] direction with their eponymous fifth studio album, infusing experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound partially inspired by Box Car Racer. Unresolved feelings from that project would arise in late 2004 when the band began to argue regarding their future and recording process. The February 2005 break-up of Blink-182 affected Hoppus greatly: [...] "I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. After Blink broke up I had such a loss of identity and purpose. I just had a giant sense of void." [...] Hoppus then began to work on even darker, electronic demos with Barker in his kitchen. He also turned to producing, hitting the studio with Motion City Soundtrack to record Commit This to Memory (2005). In October 2005, Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio together (named Opra Music), where they would bring together a full band to expand upon those electronic demos, creating +44's When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006).|$|E
