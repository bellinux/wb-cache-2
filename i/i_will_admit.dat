[...] Gimmers also thought Ben [...] "did well on his first undercover mission too, didn't you think? Apart from verging on sympathy for the young brainwashed bombers. Still, he's young. He'll get over it." [...] On Ros' role in the episode, Gimmers said [...] "I don't think I'll ever be able to say I'm [...] "warming" [...] to such an ice queen as Ros, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> to a growing admiration." [...] Scott Matthewman of The Stage stated [...] "the seventh series of the spy show continues apace," [...] and praised the episode for [...] "the superb performance of Hermione Norris as Ros Myers, fast becoming the twisted moral centre of the show. Both she and Peter Firth's Harry Pearce get some great dialogue every week, so it's a shame {{that the rest of the}} cast arenâ€™t afforded the same luxury." ...|$|E

Etim in an interview with Leadership Newspaper stated: [...] "I am not exactly a rookie {{when it comes to the}} Igbo Language but until Phone Swap, I never needed to speak Igbo as a native would. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that it was quite challenging, because I had to learn a specific dialect. I am very glad for the experience, though Igbo is a very interesting language and I enjoyed myself immensely in the process of learning it".|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes--to {{please you}} <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that,' he said quickly. 'Yes, I admit the {{possibility}} of her being alive, to please you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Dor. All {{this is in}} vain: Assure yourself, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never <b>admit</b> of any {{visit from}} you in private.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, aunt, {{that will}} be quite unnecessary. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> always <b>admit</b> that you did {{everything}} in your power to--to--to--make me run straight, as the sporting men say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those of the King of Prussia {{are such}} as, <b>I</b> hope, <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> of little {{difficulty}} {{on the part}} of France; and my utmost endeavours shall not be wanting to procure all I am able to so good an ally.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the slightest," [...] he answered. [...] "That is to say, sympathetically interested. I am curious. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that. No more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the rest, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that I am puzzled," [...] Peter said. [...] "I need to think. I {{have the}} glimmerings of an idea--no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To err is human," [...] said he, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> the {{possibility}} of my being mistaken in my man. But you will admit the resemblance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe what}} the world believes, what some day <b>I</b> think she <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> to herself--that she cares for the Prince of Seyre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Men {{who have}} {{property}} {{to leave behind}} them usually do marry, and as I am not wiser than others, I probably may do so. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>admit</b> {{that it is a}} matter of course. I may escape yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. I don't {{know the}} extent of your {{knowledge}} of pearls. If it is even moderate, <b>I</b> think you <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lady Georgina has brains,' I answered; 'and they enable her to {{recognise}} a fool {{when she}} sees him. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> {{that she does not}} suffer fools gladly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he said, quietly, [...] "I am {{what you}} are doubtless {{thinking}} me--something of a poseur. Perhaps I do like making a tax upon your sober British rectitude. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> {{that the spirit of}} adventure is in my heart; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that there is in my blood the desire to take from him who hath and give to him who hath not; but, on the other hand, I have my standards, and I seriously do not think that you would be risking very much if you accepted my invitation to lunch to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even the {{soldiers}} of my own dear South looted not only the living but the dead. It is strong circumstantial evidence, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit,</b> {{but it is not}} positive proof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you write}} {{beforehand}} {{to say that}} you are coming, and explain that you are doing so to say good-bye, then <b>I</b> think they <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is where}} James Crockford's land commences," [...] Segerson remarked, riding {{up to his}} companion's side. [...] "Look around you. <b>I</b> think you <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> have not exaggerated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can walk}} {{with whom you}} please presently, Lawrence," [...] she said, [...] "but I want you for a few minutes. <b>I</b> suppose you <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> have some claim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, Sir Marmaduke," [...] said Stanbury, {{throwing}} {{out his hand}} before him so as to give the energy of action to his words. [...] "He has the higher rank. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'E'd 'ave {{come back}} if {{anything}} was wrong," [...] said young Fulcher, and this seemed so obvious and conclusive that presently old Fulcher said, [...] "Well," [...] {{and the three}} went home to bed--thoughtfully <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit....</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} seem trivial to me," [...] I answered; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that is has nothing like {{the value of a}} series of {{sittings}} I held last spring with a psychic in a mid-Western city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hers {{and mine}} {{must be the}} same. As to that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>admit</b> any question. Can you {{undertake}} to fight this matter on my behalf,--and on hers? If you feel absolutely hostile to me you had better decline. For myself, I cannot understand why there should be such hostility.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cora, {{there are}} {{different}} natures which have each their own excellencies and their own defects. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am a coward, believing as I do that I could dare to face necessary danger. But I cannot endure to have my character impugned,--even by Mr. Slide and Mr. Lopez." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> {{think you}} <b>will</b> <b>admit,</b> {{that as the}} civilization of the country advances, some {{material}} changes must occur; your people cannot always remain stationary; they must either go backwards or forward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In reality {{she was an}} angel, eh? To {{escape from}} {{dangerous}} comparisons <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit,</b> then, that I am clever. That will make a difference. But let us talk of you. You are very--how shall I say it?--very eccentric." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those gates will be closed," [...] said O'Moy, {{indicating}} the now gaping massive doors that closed the archway at night. [...] "But if you knock I shall {{be waiting for}} you, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> you by the wicket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maderstrom," [...] he said, [...] "we met last under {{different}} circumstances. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that I cut a poor figure, but mine {{was at least}} an honourable imprisonment. I am {{not so sure that}} yours is an honourable freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, granny, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>admit</b> that.--Come, cheer up; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> {{do my best}} to make {{inquiries}} about her, and as I have had considerable experience in making investigations among the poor of London, perhaps I may fall on some clew. She would be sure to have made inquiries, would she not, at your old lodging, if she had felt disposed to return?" ...|$|R
60|$|There, I cannot persuade you of this, but I believe it. I {{have tried}} {{to stand on the}} facts of things before I began to feel 'dithyrambically.' Thought out coldly, then felt upon warmly. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>admit</b> of 'being heated out of fairness!' I deny it, and stand upon my innocency.|$|R
6000|$|... "This company," [...] {{said the}} first speaker, severely, [...] "has no {{intention}} of taking up road-making and the building of flumes and dams. It has, as <b>I</b> think you <b>will</b> <b>admit,</b> gentlemen, quite enough already on its hands." ...|$|R
60|$|And with that, flinging {{a playful}} curse at me, he {{disappeared}} at once into the tobacco smoke from which I had engendered him. An amusing and cheerful {{person on the}} whole, though <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> his theme was a little undesirable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] she murmured, [...] "what {{would you}} have? I am a woman--I {{have been a}} woman all my days, {{and the memory of}} one kiss grows cold. So <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that with me--it has been different. Come! What then?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{after a while}} Jack and I {{adjusted}} {{ourselves to}} the change in each other and became very good friends again. It was quite a different friendship from the old, {{but it was very}} pleasant. Yes, it was; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that much.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{certainly}} {{the daughter of}} the circus-woman," [...] said my friend. [...] "She may be his daughter too; <b>I</b> am <b>willing</b> to <b>admit</b> that she is. In fact I have no doubt--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{our stories}} I suppose {{have much in}} them that is sad. I have got my son, and no mother can have more reason {{to be proud of}} a son." [...] Mrs. Vincent shook her head. [...] "I say it is so," [...] {{repeated}} the mother; [...] "and having such a son, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>admit</b> that it has all been sad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{said his}} dragoman, {{seemingly}} much struck, [...] "I {{should not be}} surprised if you were right. There is little interest in divorce where no money is involved, and our poor are considered able to do without it. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never <b>admit</b> that this is the reason for the state of our divorce laws. No, no; I am an Englishman." ...|$|R
