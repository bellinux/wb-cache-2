5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing {{was not meant to}} be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically {{in the same way that}} the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

40|$|One way {{in which}} law protects dignity is by {{enforcing}} human rights provisions that explictly or implicitly involve the protection of dignity or the prevention of degradation. But law 2 ̆ 7 s connection with dignity is also much deeper and more pervasive than this. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it operates, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it presents its requirements, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> law expects its requirements to be taken on baord and observed by those to whom the requirements are primarily addressed, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> procedural <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it organizes hearings, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it sponsors argumentation, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it arranages for coercion [...] in all these ways, law treats humans as dignified agents, capable of self-control, {{with a sense of}} themsleves and their interests, and with the ability to respond intelligently and thoughtfully to its demands.

By contrast, she published only two Poirot novels in the next eight years, indicating the possibility that she was experiencing some frustration with her most popular character.

Diacritics can be used for emphasis (érg koud for very cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (één appel = one apple, een appel = an apple; vóórkomen = to occur, voorkómen = to prevent).
