5|$|A devout Buddhist from youth, {{once her}} {{children}} {{had grown up}} Ho decided to serve the Buddhist cause, and to dedicate {{the rest of her}} life to caring for others. In 1958, she became a Buddhist nun at the age of 50. In 1969, aged 61, Ho bought a two-storey detached house in Richards Avenue with her savings, and turned it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> Fut Tong Old Peoples' Home for aged sick and single elderly women. Most of the 20 or so residents had neither enough earnings to support themselves nor any relatives to turn to. To raise additional funds for the home, she cultivated and sold prize-winning white orchids at Tanglin, and vegetarian food at Kong Meng San Temple in Bishan. She cleaned, cooked, took her charges to the doctors, helped them to collect their social benefits and even sometimes saw to their last rites.|$|E

Athena's push for Telemachos's journey helps him grow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> role, that his father once held. She also {{plays a role in}} ending the {{resultant}} feud against the suitors' relatives. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill Eupeithes, the father of Antinous.|$|E

25|$|While {{it is true}} {{that very}} little detail of Hephaestion’s {{childhood}} and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander’s empire, second only to the king himself.|$|E
500|$|Clifton James as Sheriff J.W. Pepper: A Louisiana sheriff {{who happens}} to be on holiday in Thailand. Hamilton liked Pepper in the {{previous}} film, Live and Let Die, and asked Mankewicz to write him <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> with the Golden Gun as well. Pepper's inclusion has been seen as one of [...] "several ill-advised lurches into comedy" [...] in the film.|$|E
500|$|In 1933 Alfred Hitchcock was set {{to direct}} a Bulldog Drummond film with a {{screenplay}} by Charles Bennett entitled Bulldog Drummond's Baby. The rights {{to the character of}} Drummond were then held by British International Pictures who would not sell the rights to use the character's for Bennett's screenplay. [...] Bennett and Hitchcock turned the film <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> Who Knew Too Much without Drummond.|$|E

500|$|Marshall {{retired from}} {{football}} {{at the age}} of 33. [...] He later signed a ceremonial contract in 1996 that allowed him to retire as a Giant. [...] Upon signing the contract he stated, [...] "I wanted to retire as a Giant because it's where my career began.

500|$|Trujillo's {{character}} {{struggles with}} aging {{and the physical}} problems of incontinence and impotence. Through fictional events and first person narrative, the reader is given insight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who, during his [...] "thirty-one years of horrendous political crimes", modernized the country's infrastructure and military, but whose regime's attacks against its enemies overseas (particularly the attempted assassination of Rómulo Betancourt, president of Venezuela) led to the imposition of economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic by the Organization of American States in the 1950s. [...] The resultant economic downturn, {{in conjunction with other}} factors, leads to the CIA supported assassination plot that ends Trujillo's life on May 30, 1961.|$|E
500|$|Several {{references}} to popular culture {{are included in}} the episode. The title [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] refers to the 1984 film Blame It on Rio, which also takes place in Brazil. As Homer and Bart walk on Copacabana Beach, the famous 1939 song [...] "Aquarela do Brasil" [...] (also known as [...] "Brazil") is played. Teleboobies is a parody of the children's television series Xuxa that attracted complaints because of the revealing outfits worn by the host, Brazilian actress and singer Xuxa. The name [...] "Teleboobies" [...] is a reference to the British television series Teletubbies. The Itchy & Scratchy cartoon that Homer and Bart watch {{at the beginning of the}} episode parodies Georges Méliès' 1902 film A Trip to the Moon; Itchy and Scratchy are playing golf when Itchy hits Scratchy's head with his golf club, sending his head crashing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> in the Moon as the rocket does in the film. According to showrunner Al Jean, the staff members of The Simpsons asked American golfer Tiger Woods to do a guest appearance in this cartoon, but they were turned down.|$|E

500|$|Garrett {{said the}} song appeals to everyone, saying [...] "Whether you're a female in love, male in love, it's a real record. Your mama has {{to feel this}} record, your daddy has to feel this record, {{everybody}} has to feel this record. That's what good writers do." [...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it would}} have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama/ I done turned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christie found Belcher [...] "childish, {{mean and}} somehow {{addictive}} as a personality: 'Never, to this day, have I {{been able to}} rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace', wrote Agatha of the fictionalised Belcher, whom she put <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> in the Brown Suit. 'I dare say it's reprehensible, but there it is.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{incident}} {{which happened}} regarding the Soviet Science Academy {{during this period}} is that a jealous scientist would attempt to discredit two famous geneticists. These genetics had government permission to publish their findings in an American journal of science which made the Soviet Union and the Science Academy look distinguished and able {{to compete with the}} Western world. However, the scientist Trofim Densisovich Lysenka would falsely accuse them of collaborations with the West and selling secrets because he wanted to gain recognition of his own and gain funding. He felt as though more money should be put into agriculture instead. [...] However, this attempt would backfire and he would be ignored even during this period of intense concern with such problems. During this era the expected move would have been to arrest the scientists but like the philosopher they were very high profile and so rather than arresting them for flimsy charges they looked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> making the accusations and would choose instead to take a wiser and more reasonable course of action.|$|E

2500|$|The Glass House {{resulted}} in recognition for Johnson, {{not just in}} architectural circles, but also among the public at large. The house was featured in Life magazine, and the New York Times Magazine published a set of cartoons about it. [...] "What really sets Johnson apart [...] " [...] Michael Sorkin wrote in 1978, [...] "is his aptitude for publicity." [...] The Glass House [...] "established Johnson as the titular leader" [...] of Modernist style in 1949. [...] "If it was Mies van der Rohe who provided the real inspiration for the Glass House [...] it was only Johnson who could have built the house and lived in it himself. Johnson's career began when he turned himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> in the Glass House. In an instant, he became the austere apostle for modern architecture [...] or rather the modern apostle for austere architecture." [...] As Life magazine put it in 1949: [...] "Except when entertaining, Johnson lives alone, servantless and accompanied only by weather, paintings and books." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Brenda in Paris, Dylan starts {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time with Kelly, helping her babysit her little sister and entering a doubles beach volleyball tournament with her. The two have a strictly physical affair, but Kelly ends it out of loyalty to Brenda. Upon returning from Paris, Dylan and Brenda reunite. This doesn't last long though, as Brenda (who also has had an affair) runs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> she was seeing in Paris at a video store and starts seeing him behind Dylan's back. Dylan and Brenda break up, and Dylan heads straight for Kelly. This doesn't last long either -- after Brenda sees them on a date and gets angry at them, they take a step back from their potential relationship. Dylan, frustrated, takes a road trip to get away from them. When he returns, Kelly and Brenda tell him to make a choice. When Brenda is unable to show up when he invites both girls to see his father, he decides to choose Kelly.|$|E
