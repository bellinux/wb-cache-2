5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} with Inter, Baggio decided not to renew his expiring {{contract}} due to his conflicts with Marcello Lippi, making him a free agent at age 33. He was linked with smaller Serie A clubs such as Napoli and Reggina, and also several Premier League and La Liga clubs, including Barcelona. Baggio ultimately transferred to Serie A newcomers Brescia, under head coach Carlo Mazzone, aiming to save them from relegation, and staying in Italy <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a greater opportunity of being called up for the 2002 World Cup. He was made captain and was given the number 10 shirt, playing as an attacking midfielder.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E

Charlie is not returned, however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one must be taken from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the background noise on the tape that Charlie is being held near the local high school's swimming pool. The boy is rescued, and killer—Edward Petey—is found and arrested. However, the elder Birckenbeuhl is found hanged in his bedroom, driven to suicide by his guilt.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for Brave Fencer Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game conceptualized as an action oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance.|$|E
5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a stable orbit.|$|E

Consisting of five dance-pop, electronic, and avant-garde tracks, Gagged was released as a digital EP, and was also made available via streaming services.

5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards {{until late in the}} drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
