5|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as being injury-prone. Since returning from his fractured ankle injury in late 2006, the midfielder has endured persistent niggling injuries that have resulted in Diaby failing to play a full season for his current club. During his second season at Auxerre, a season in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> get some significant playing time, Diaby failed to gain the confidence of manager Jacques Santini primarily due to repetitive injuries he endured during the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season. After returning to the team, Diaby struggled to return to form, which ultimately resulted in his sale to Arsenal. His highest output for appearances with Arsenal came in the 2009–10 season when he played in 40 matches. Arsenal played a total of 55 competitive matches in the season.|$|E
5|$|He {{held the}} vicarage of Lochrutton in Kirkcudbrightshire in 1388, when a papal letter {{indicated}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> resign Lochrutton after obtaining the benefice of Maybole {{in the gift}} of the Prioress of the nunnery of North Berwick. He still held Lochrutton on 18 April 1390, when the letter was repeated. Thomas remained provost of Maybole until at least 1401, and perhaps until his consecration as Bishop of Galloway in 1415. No-one else is known to have held the position of provost there until 1439, although this proves nothing as the evidence for such things in the south-west of Scotland in this period is always scarce.|$|E
5|$|He started 2008–09 as an ever-present in {{the team}} before pulling a calf muscle during an FA Trophy second round match away to Oxford United on 13 January 2009, which ruled him out for three weeks. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> make his return ahead of {{schedule}} away to Eastbourne Borough on 24 January 2009, but was not named {{in the team}}. His return came as a 90th-minute substitute in a 0–0 away draw with Ebbsfleet United on 8 March 2009. During the period of his injury, York signed defender Shaun Pejic, whose form alongside Danny Parslow in central defence resulted in McGurk being unable to reaffirm {{his place in the}} team. He started in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 9 May 2009, which York lost 2–0 to Stevenage Borough. He finished the season with 45 appearances.|$|E

5|$|Healthy {{to begin}} the 1975 season, Ellis {{continued}} to perform well {{at the beginning of}} the season. In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E

The Lakers won three of the first four games after Nash returned. However, they lost their next four, including a 125–112 loss to Houston on 8 January 2013, when Nash assisted on an Antawn Jamison jumper to become the fifth player in NBA history to reach 10,000 career assists.|$|E
