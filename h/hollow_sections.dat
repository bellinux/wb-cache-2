2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|E

The seismic {{performance}} of the bridge piers is a basic study in seismic analysis of bridges. <b>Hollow</b> <b>section</b> piers have high bending strength and stiffness, as well as reduced amount of reinforced concrete needed and thus good economic returns, which have been widely applied in the high-pier, large-span bridges in high-intensity area of western China. Current study status and future development trends about the seismic behavior of <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> reinforced concrete piers were presented. The necessity of carrying out seismic performance studies of <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> reinforced concrete bridge piers was also pointed out. 1 Summary of the application of hollow-section bridge piers In recent decades significant improvement has been achieved {{in the construction of}} bridges with the rapid development of economy, technology and industry in China. Current development directions of bridge engineering are large span, heavy load and high speed limit [1]. A large number of high-pier, large-span bridges have been constructed in the mountain areas of western China, the surface of deep sea, intercity rail and highways, as shown in Table 1. Rigid frame bridge piers with continuous spans are mostly in the form of <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> piers because the <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> piers have large flexural strength and stiffness while greatly reducing th...|$|R

40|$|Concrete-filled {{double skin}} steel tubes (CFDST) have widely {{been used in}} {{constructing}} high-rise buildings, arch bridges and factories. Much {{research has been done}} to study its behaviour under axial compression. However, limited information can be found on its performance under lateral impact loading, especially under blast loading. In this paper, numerical models are developed for CFDST with two different cross sections: one is with CHS (circular <b>hollow</b> <b>section)</b> outer and CHS (circular <b>hollow</b> <b>section)</b> inner, and the other one is with SHS (square <b>hollow</b> <b>section)</b> outer and SHS (square <b>hollow</b> <b>section)</b> inner. Conventional concrete is filled in double skin steel tubes. Different blast loadings are applied on the surface of these columns for dynamic analysis. In addition, different axial loads are also applied on the columns to simUlate the combined load condition. The displacement-time history obtained from each simulation is recorded and then compared. The key factors that determine the performance of CFDST columns under blast loading are discussed.

This research deals with agricultural waste of fly ash in terms of partial cement replacement in <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> beam. Concrete is both dominant as a construction material and contributor to greenhouse gas emissions due to cement manufacturing. Therefore, replacing Portland cement with fly ash reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In this research, reinforced <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> beam in rectangular with size 250 mm x 300 mm with 2000 mm length is designed to resist a point load of 50 kN.

The finite element method {{has been used to}} carry out the investigation. The columns were compressed between fixed ends at different column lengths. The geometric and material nonlinearities have been included in the finite element analysis. The column strengths and failure modes were predicted. An extensive parametric study was carried out to study the effects of normal and high strength materials on cold-formed stainless steel non-slender circular <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> columns. The column strengths predicted from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths calculated using the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for cold-formed stainless steel structures.
