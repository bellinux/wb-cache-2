2500|$|Ramban did not {{explicitly}} discuss the Three Oaths, however he did maintain that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> upon Jews in every generation {{as a positive}} commandment to attempt to conquer the Land of Israel.

"The Narmada Bachao andolaan (NBA)has {{rendered}} a yeoman's {{service to}} the country by creating a high-level of awareness about the environmental and rehabilitation and relief aspects of Sardar Sarovar and other projects on the Narmada. But, after the court verdict <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> on it to adopt a new role.

2500|$|The {{narrative}} of Nihon Ōdai Ichiran stops around 1600, most likely {{in deference to}} the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime. [...] Gahō's text did not continue up through his present day; rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler. [...] Gahō [...] modestly observed that [...] "in a book intended for the shogun's eyes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> upon one to be circumspect." [...] This book {{was published in the}} mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, [...] "perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials." ...|$|E
2500|$|Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014 (H.R. 4194; 113th Congress) As {{the ranking}} {{member of the}} House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Connolly co-sponsored this bill with Darrell Issa.

Connolly argued that [...] "in today's challenging fiscal environment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> that we leverage every opportunity to streamline or eliminate antiquated agency reporting requirements that are duplicative, irrelevant or simply ignored." [...] The bill passed in the House in a voice vote on April 28, 2014.|$|E

"This {{is indeed}} a clear {{indication}} of the Master's [...] express desire that nothing whatever should be given to the public by any individual among the friends, unless fully considered and approved by the Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and if this (as is undoubtedly the case) is a matter that pertains to the general interest of the Cause in that land, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> upon the Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration and approval of the national body representing all the various local assemblies.

With this national body also will rest the decision whether a given question is of local or national interest." ...|$|E
2500|$|The monarch's {{position}} as the fount of honour within Spain is codified in Article 62 (f); <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> upon the monarch to [...] " [...] confer civil and military positions and award honors and distinctions in conformity of the law". According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, nobility and grandee titles are created by the [...] "sovereign grace of the king", and may {{be passed on to}} the recipient's heirs, who may not sell the title. Titles may revert to the Crown when their vacancy is observed. Succession of titles may follow one of several courses listed on the Title of Concession when the title is created. As a general rule, most titles are now inherited by absolute Cognatic Primogeniture (as of 2006), in which the first born inherits all titles regardless of gender. However, a title holder may designate his successor, Succession by Assignment, or disperse his titles among his children – with the eldest getting the highest-ranking title, Succession by Distribution.|$|E
2500|$|As {{will be seen}} in the {{following}} discussion, the propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. [...] Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30 percent of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to some [...] of drawbar pull for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. [...] In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as [...] "jerking a lung"). Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, [...] "jerking a lung" [...] could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of automatic train brakes installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.|$|E
6000|$|For {{some reason}} or other {{which she could}} not have {{explained}} to herself, Olive felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incumbent</b> upon her to assert herself, and she answered: [...] "Oh, no, indeed. My father is Lieutenant-Commander Alfred Asher, of the cruiser Hopatcong." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>incumbent</b> on {{a single}} person to give another who was also single; and the widow had been true to the usage; but [...] "good Dr. Wilson" [...] was a half-superannuated clergyman, whom no one could suspect of inspiring {{anything}} beyond friendship.|$|R
