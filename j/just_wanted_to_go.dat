When asked why the song was remixed, Hugo replied with, [...] "We wanted something with more of a straight-ahead, club-bumping beat, just a different take on it.

She imagined Tammy Jo in a serene and loving household, a domesticity representing the polar opposite of her young life. [...] "I thought she <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away and start all over," [...] Dyson said.

When we finished touring, I didn't want to take some time off, I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the studio. But, I really didn't want to book myself in with a band and go record them, so I decided I'd try and make my own record."

2500|$|In November 2001, {{six months}} after the album's release, Skunkhour disbanded, {{frustrated}} by a lack of support from Universal, which was experiencing upheavals in Australia. Aya told Ritchie Yorke of The Sunday Mail that the difficulties with the label meant the band was unable to maximise its opportunities. He said: [...] "We decided that we'd rather move on now and look at some other possibilities while we're still drawing big crowds ... Unfortunately, the last album was only heard on Triple J and some community stations, so we didn't really reach the mainstream with it. This was despite our hopes that the album might have taken us to another level. It was given great reviews and we really thought the music got us back in touch with the fans. But overall, we <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on a high. We didn't want to overstay our welcome".|$|E

2500|$|Deep Purple's troubled North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed {{production}} of the Deep Purple album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. [...] This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the Billboard Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by Warner Bros. Records, who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.) During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. [...] Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer. Paice stated, [...] "A change had to come. If they hadn't left, the band would have totally disintegrated." [...] Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one foot out the door. Simper said that Evans had met a girl in Hollywood and had eyes on being an actor, while Blackmore explained, [...] "Rod <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to America and live in America." ...|$|E

If I had folded my hands and sat down meekly when Uncle Abimelech made known his good will and pleasure regarding Murray and me after Father's death, Murray would never have got to college--nor I either, for that matter. Only I wouldn't have minded that very much. I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to college because Murray did. I couldn't be separated from him.
