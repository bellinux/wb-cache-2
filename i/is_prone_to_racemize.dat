40|$|The {{mechanisms}} for explaining how a stable asymmetric chemical {{system can be}} formed from a symmetric chemical system, {{in the absence of}} any asymmetric influence other than statistical fluctuations, have been developed during the last decades, focusing on the non-linear kinetic aspects. Besides the absolute necessity of self-amplification processes, the importance of energetic aspects is often underestimated. Going down to the most fundamental aspects, the distinction between a single object — that can be intrinsically asymmetric — and a collection of objects — whose racemic state is the more stable one — must be emphasized. A system of strongly interacting objects can be described as one single object retaining its individuality and a single asymmetry; weakly or non-interacting objects keep their own individuality, and <b>are</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>racemize</b> towards the equilibrium state. In the presence of energy fluxes, systems can be maintained in an asymmetric non-equilibrium steady-state. Such dynamical systems can retain their asymmetry for times longer than their racemization time...|$|R
