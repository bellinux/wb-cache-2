60|$|Besides these daily purveyors, {{there are}} men of divers arts who come to {{exercise}} their crafts at your house: not chimney-sweeps merely, but glaziers, {{and that sort of}} workmen, and, best of all, chair-menders,--who bear a mended chair upon their shoulders for a sign, with pieces of white wood for further mending, a <b>drawing-knife,</b> a hammer, and a sheaf of rushes, and who sit down at your door, and plait the rush bottoms of your kitchen-chairs anew, and make heaps of fragrant whittlings with their knives, and gossip with your serving-woman.|$|E
60|$|They {{found the}} rough slabs of lumber {{as they had}} left them, and {{sticking}} them up in convenient places, began the task of smoothing them off into boards, working first with their axes {{and then with the}} <b>drawing-knife</b> and the plane. It was no light labor, and night was again upon them by the time the boards were ready and hauled {{to the edge of the}} lake. After supper Foster Portney brought out a measuring-rule and marked off the different parts of the boat, which was to be a flat-bottom affair, with a blunt stern and rather a long-pointed bow.|$|E
60|$|On Split-up Island {{all were}} ready for the break-up. Waterways have ever been first highways, and the Yukon was the sole highway in all the land. So those bound up-river pitched their poling-boats and shod their poles with iron, and those bound down caulked their scows and barges and shaped spare sweeps with axe and <b>drawing-knife.</b> Jacob Welse loafed and joyed in the utter {{cessation}} from work, and Frona joyed with him {{in that it was}} good. But Baron Courbertin was in a fever at the delay. His hot blood grew riotous after the long hibernation, and the warm sunshine dazzled him with warmer fancies.|$|E
6000|$|In the log schoolhouse, {{which he}} could visit but little, he was taught only reading, writing, and {{elementary}} arithmetic. Among {{the people of the}} settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen, he found none of uncommon intelligence or education; but some of them had a few books, which he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read and reread, AEsop's Fables, learning to tell stories with a point and to argue by parables; he read Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's Progress, a short history of the United States, and Weems's Life of Washington. To the town constable's he went to read the Revised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page that fell into his hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends watched him with wonder, as the uncouth boy, after his daily work, crouched {{in a corner of the}} log cabin or outside under a tree, absorbed in a book while munching his supper of corn bread. In this manner he began to gather some knowledge, and sometimes he would astonish the girls with such startling remarks as that the earth was moving around the sun, and not the sun around the earth, and they marvelled where [...] "Abe" [...] could have got such queer notions. Soon he also felt the impulse to write; not only making extracts from books he wished to remember, but also composing little essays of his own. First he sketched these with charcoal on a wooden shovel scraped white with a <b>drawing-knife,</b> or on basswood shingles. Then he transferred them to paper, which was a scarce commodity in the Lincoln household; taking care to cut his expressions close, so that they might not cover too much space,--a style-forming method greatly to be commended. Seeing boys put a burning coal on the back of a wood turtle, he was moved to write on cruelty to animals. Seeing men intoxicated with whiskey, he wrote on temperance. In verse-making, too, he tried himself, and in satire on persons offensive to him or others,--satire the rustic wit of which was not always fit for ears polite. Also political thoughts he put upon paper, and some of his pieces were even deemed good enough for publication in the county weekly.|$|E
