40|$|Pipeline {{operators}} have {{at their}} disposal multiple resources for evaluating the integrity of identified features and anomalies. With advances in in-line inspection technology, the pipeline industry is being called upon to evaluate an ever-increasing number of features. When a feature is identified as a threat and severe enough to warrant further investigation, operators are faced with sometimes significant costs, including those associated with excavation activities. In this paper the authors provide guidance on the benefits associated with full-scale testing for evaluating mechanical integrity, referred to Intentional Destructive Testing (IDT). Unlike many assessment techniques that require {{the development and implementation}} of assumed operating and boundary conditions, well-designed IDT programs are able to replicate in situ conditions to provide operators with a clear understanding regarding the behavior of pipeline features and anomalies by simulating operating conditions and loading. Three case studies are included in this paper to demonstrate the merits of the IDT approach including the assessment of dents subjected to cyclic <b>pressures,</b> <b>burst</b> <b>testing</b> vintage pipes having long seam weld crack-like features, and evaluating the reinforcement of girth welds using composite materials. In using IDT operators have improved confidence in predicting the behavior of identified features to ensure that maintenance resources are properly allocated for excavating and repairing anomalies...|$|R

In this study compo-site pressure vessels {{are made up of}} aluminum alloy 6063 seamless liner and glass/epoxy composite reinforcement. The aluminum liner, which is developed by extruded aluminum tube of internal diameter 141 mm and wall thickness 4 mm, is subjected to super plastic deformation. Continuous glass fibers impregnated in epoxy resin are wound on the seamless liner by filament winding process. In this work, 10 pressure vessels were manufactured for 3. 5 MPa service pressure with marginal safety of 3.

The <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> is considered simpler and more appropriate than the shear test for this application. Although the geometry, loading and boundary conditions are quite different in the two tests, structural analyses show similarity in the failure mode of the shear test in paragraph QW- 196 and the <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> on the DWPF canister nozzle Non-linear structural analyses are performed using finite element techniques to study the failure mode of the two tests. Actual test geometry and realistic stress strain data for the 304 L stainless steel and the weld material are used in the analyses.

Based on these observations, it is concluded that the use of a <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> in lieu of the shear test for qualifying the canister-plug weld is acceptable. The <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> analysis for the canister-plug also yields the <b>burst</b> <b>pressures</b> which compare favorably with the actual <b>pressure</b> found during <b>burst</b> <b>tests.</b> Thus, the analysis also provides an estimate of the safety margins in the design of these vessels...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{continuous}} fibre reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites {{have been successfully}} employed in the aircraft, military and aerospace industries due to the excellent properties (Brandt et al. 1993 & Nunes et al 2005 a). In these and many other commercial engineering applications, they can replace other materials, such as thermosetting matrix composites. However, {{the high cost of}} the impregnation of {{continuous fibre}} thermoplastic composites, arising from the melting of the polymer or the use of solvents, still restricts their use in commercial applications. Hence, cost reduction largely depends on developing more efficient methods for impregnating fibres with high-viscosity thermoplastics and for processing final composite parts. This chapter summarizes the development of new technologies to fabricate long and continuous fibre reinforced composite structures from thermoplastic matrix semi-products (towpregs and PCT – pre-consolidated tapes) for commercial and highly demanding markets. The production of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic matrix towpregs and PCT’s was done using a recently developed coating line (Nunes et al. 2008, 2010 & Silva, R. F. et al. 2008). Using this prototype equipment, it was possible to produce glass fibre polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) towpregs for commercial markets and towpregs from carbon fibres and Primospire®, an amorphous highly aromatic material developed by Solvay Advanced Polymers, for application in advanced markets (Nunes et al. 2005, 2009 & Silva, J. F. et al. 2010). To process these thermoplastic pre-pregs into composite structures, conventional thermosetting equipments were adapted to fabricate thermoplastic matrix composites. Filament winding, pultrusion and hot compression moulding were the studied technologies. The mechanical properties determined on the final composites were compared with the theoretical predictions and have shown to be acceptable for the targeted markets. As applications, filament wound pressure vessels prototypes for gas and incompressible fluids were produced from towpregs and submitted to internal <b>pressure</b> <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> [Silva, J. F. et al. 2008 & Velosa et al. 2009). These prototypes have accomplished all requirements of the applicable European standards...|$|R

40|$|Laser etched 300 series Stainless Steel Burst Disks (SSBD) ranging between 0. 178 mm (0. 007 -in.) and 0. 508 mm (0. 020 -in.) thick were {{designed}} {{for use in a}} 17 -caliber two-stage light gas launcher. First, a disk manufacturing method was selected using a combination of wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) to form the blank disks and laser etching to define the pedaling fracture pattern. Second, a replaceable insert was designed to go between the SSDB and the barrel. This insert reduced the stress concentration between the SSBD and the barrel, providing a place for the petals of the SSDB to open, and protecting the rifling {{on the inside of the}} barrel. Thereafter, a design of experiments was implemented to test and characterize the burst characteristics of SSBDs. Extensive hydrostatic <b>burst</b> <b>testing</b> of the SSBDs was performed to complete the design of experiments study with one-hundred and seven <b>burst</b> <b>tests.</b> The experiment simultaneously tested the effects of the following: two SSBD material states (full hard, annealed); five SSBD thicknesses 0. 178, 0. 254, 0. 305, 0. 381 mm (0. 007, 0. 010, 0. 012, 0. 015, 0. 020 -in.); two grain directions relative); number of times the laser etch pattern was repeated (varies between 5 - 200 times); two heat sink configurations (with and without heat sink); and, two barrel configurations (with and without insert).

A novel polyurethane has been developed which incorporates nano-engineered polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane within poly(carbonate-urea) urethane to improve the biostability of the latter. Previous investigators have found this material to be cytocompatible and to have low thrombogenicity.

This has been reported using a stringent ovine carotid interposition model which remained patent over the full investigation period representing at least 45 million pulsatile cycles. Physico-chemical analysis; integrity of the structure, microstructure and ultrastructure; preservation of mechanical properties and immunohistological analysis were used to examine the grafts after implantation to show their healing properties and biostability...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} was {{developed}} for injecting a sample on a cross-form microfluidic chip by means of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> combined with electrokinetic forces. The <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> was generated simply by adjusting the liquid level in different reservoirs without any additional driven equipment such as a pump. Two dispensing strategies using a floating injection and a gated injection, coupled with <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> loading, were tested. The fluorescence observation verified the feasibility of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> loading in the separation of a mixture of fluorescein sodium salt and fluorescein isothiocyanate. This method was proved {{to be effective in}} leading cells to a separation channel for single cell analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{phase diagram}} of EuFe 2 (As 1 −x P x) 2 was investigated {{by means of}} magnetization and muon-spin rotation (μSR) studies {{as a function of}} chemical (isovalent substitution of As by P) and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure.</b> The magnetic phase diagrams of the magnetic ordering of the Eu and Fe spins with respect to P content and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> are determined and discussed. The present investigations reveal that the magnetic coupling between the Eu and the Fe sublattices strongly depends on chemical and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is found that chemical and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> have a similar effect on the Eu and Fe magnetic order...|$|R
40|$|Since {{inner ear}} hair cells are mechano-electric {{transducers}} {{the control of}} <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> in the inner ear is crucial. Most studies analyzing dynamics and regulation of inner ear <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> performed pressure measurements in the cochlea. The present study {{is the first one}} reporting about absolute <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> values in the labyrinth. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> of the endolymphatic system was recorded in all three semicircular canals. Mean pressure values were 4. 06 cmH(2) O +/- A 0. 61 in the posterior, 3. 36 cmH(2) O +/- A 0. 94 in the anterior and 3. 85 cmH(2) O +/- A 1. 38 in the lateral semicircular canal. Overall <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> in the vestibular organ was 3. 76 cmH(2) O +/- A 0. 36. Endolymphatic <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> in all three semicircular canals is the same (p = 0. 310). With regard to known endolymphatic pressure values in the cochlea from past studies vestibular pressure values are comparable to cochlear values. Until now it is not known whether the reuniens duct and the Bast's valve which are the narrowest passages in the endolymphatic system are open or closed. Present data show that most likely the endolymphatic system is a functionally open entity...|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} vessels with winding lamination of [90 /± 15] were manufactured adopting a vinylester and an epoxy resin reinforced with carbon fibres. An experimental setup was design {{to test the}} vessels up to the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>tests</b> results demonstrate a higher ultimate pressure of the carbon/vinylester composite vessel {{with respect to the}} epoxy reinforced counterpart. The full field strain measurements by the digital image correlation technique show a delayed of the initiation and propagation of the damage in the carbon/vinylester. Moreover, the carbon/vinylester vessel performed more homogeneous strain distribution with less and shorter hoop cracks than the carbon/epoxy one, as observed also with an X-ray micro tomography system, a laser microscope and a scanning electron microscope...|$|R
