5|$|In the meantime, Farnese {{entrusted}} to Count Hannibal d'Altemps {{the capture of}} Weert and continued his advance upon the Dutch Army. D'Altemps encircled Weert with 6,000 men and breached its walls with a two-cannon battery. The defenders of the castle surrendered at discretion but, on Farnese orders, were hanged on the windows, which the Count willingly <b>did</b> <b>because</b> his steward had lost an eye during the siege. Farnese, instead of following the Dutch Army to its quarters, lodged in Turnhout with his troops and his court to forage. Before moving to Antwerp he dealt with John Casimir's German Army. Spanish troops attacked and defeated part of the German reiters near Eindhoven on 10 February. Moreover, while John Casimir himself was in England dealing with Elizabeth I, Farnese agreed with his lieutenant, Maurice of Saxe-Lauenburg, {{the withdrawal of the}} Calvinist Army, which the Spaniards allowed to leave the Netherlands freely. Once this matter was finished, Farnese advanced upon Borgerhout.|$|E

25|$|Frederick von Nolan, a 19th-century {{historian}} and Greek and Latin scholar, spent 28 years attempting {{to trace the}} Textus Receptus to apostolic origins. He was an ardent advocate of the supremacy of the Textus Receptus over all other editions of the Greek New Testament, and {{he argued that the}} first editors of the printed Greek New Testament intentionally selected the texts they <b>did</b> <b>because</b> of their superiority and disregarded other texts, which represented other text-types because of their inferiority.|$|E

The banker decided to substitute counterfeit banknotes. Even so, the sight of their incineration was so unnerving {{that he could not}} accomplish his part of the tryst. Another source, however, states that the courtesan burned the notes, one by one, during her sexual congress with Gaiffe, who bet his friends {{he would be able to}} access her favors without payment -- and so he <b>did,</b> <b>because</b> the money was fake.|$|E

25|$|The older Calvinistic {{emphasis}} on free grace was given {{new life in}} Methodist publications, preaching God's wonderful method of saving even the worst of sinners. It was viewed with suspicion and distrust by mid and late 18th century Anglican priests, since it carried with it the belief that salvation could be obtained without adherence to the moral law as delivered in the Ten Commandments. Men were not damned for the crimes they committed but for not believing in the great truths of the Gospel. If men had faith in the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, they might be under no dread of what they <b>did,</b> <b>because</b> he stood clean before the eyes of God from the day in which Christ died upon the cross.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{officials}} who fell victim to Lü Yi's abuses of power were the general Zhu Ju, the Imperial Chancellor Gu Yong, and the commandery administrators Diao Jia (刁嘉) and Zheng Zhou (鄭胄). In Zhu Ju's case, which happened sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi falsely accused him of embezzling military funds when some funds designated for Zhu Ju's army went missing. Zhu Ju, unable to explain himself, suffered in silence. The finance officer in his army also died under torture during interrogation. Later, another inspector discovered the real culprit and cleared Zhu Ju's name. As for Gu Yong, Lü Yi initially prepared {{to make a case}} against him for incompetence and ask Sun Quan to remove him from office. However, after an official Xie Gong (謝厷) pointed out that Pan Jun, the Minister of Ceremonies, would most likely become the next Imperial Chancellor if Gu Yong were to be removed from office, Lü Yi immediately dropped the case against Gu Yong because he knew that Pan Jun resented him and would take action against him if he became Imperial Chancellor. In Diao Jia's case, Lü Yi falsely accused him of defaming the imperial court, resulting in an angry Sun Quan ordering Diao Jia's arrest. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, they all said they <b>did,</b> <b>because</b> they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Only Shi Yi said he did not, and he eventually managed to convince Sun Quan that Diao Jia was innocent. In Zheng Zhou's case, earlier on he had arrested and executed Lü Yi's retainer(s) for breaking the law, so Lü Yi bore a grudge against him and spoke ill of him in front of Sun Quan. Sun Quan, believing what Lü Yi said, turned furious and summoned Zheng Zhou to meet him. Pan Jun and Chen Biao spoke up for Zheng Zhou and succeeded in convincing Sun Quan to spare him.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the sixth}} series finale aired in December 2007, it was {{announced}} that Rupert Penry-Jones would leave the series sometime in series seven.

He also stated that working in Spooks was [...] "great," [...] but felt he was [...] "getting to the point where I needed to move on." [...] Before the seventh series aired, Penry-Jones revealed his character would leave in what he believed was [...] "one of the best" [...] Spooks exits.

500|$|She {{attended}} North High School in Phoenix, {{where she}} was active in school plays. She stated that her biggest influence as a teenager was her teacher Bud Brown, whose lectures about the Civil Rights Movement, poverty, the free press, and anti-semitism in Europe [...] "absolutely inflamed" [...] her and changed her life. Brown was later investigated as a Communist. She went to Dominican College, an all-girls Catholic institution in San Rafael, California for a year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1948. She stopped acting in college because her father refused to support her in that career. She chose Education, {{even though she was}} not interested in becoming a teacher, on the recommendation of her mother and because as she later stated, [...] "It was something that girls of my generation <b>did</b> <b>because</b> teaching was acceptable".|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{was split}} between two designs for Jill. He either wanted to depict {{her as a}} [...] "funny little megaman character" [...] or a grown woman; however, both {{approaches}} had their own pitfalls. He felt that the former could come off as too much like Japanese lolicon-styled art, while the latter could make the story seem too serious. The Queen's more realistic design made him question whether a child-like Jill would be appropriate. He designed several versions of Jill with different proportions {{and sent them to}} Anthropy so she could pick her favourite. He compared two of the designs to Nintendo characters Mario and Link; the Mario-like design he called a [...] "standard video game design", while the Link-like design he called [...] "slightly realistic". The Link-like design was the most realistic design that he <b>did</b> <b>because</b> he felt that making it too realistic could make it too difficult for players to identify with, and could diminish the humorous elements of the game. He also intended to design her as [...] "dumpy and podgy" [...] to make her more [...] "lovable".|$|E

Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we {{would not be able to}} live." [...] In her closing message in Müller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that [...] "Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust", writing: [...] "Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they <b>did</b> <b>because</b> the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E
500|$|Pickett's {{official}} {{report to}} Taylor was signed [...] "G.E. Pickett, Major-Gen., Commd'g." [...] This is the April 11 report mentioned by Freeman above. Thus in Pickett's official report to Taylor {{he speaks of}} commanding his men and interacting with his superior officer {{right up until the}} surrender at Appomattox. Taylor attempted to explain the apparent contradiction by telling Fitzhugh Lee that he addressed his request in the manner he <b>did</b> <b>because</b> Pickett was not dismissed from the Army, and for the period in question, Pickett was initially in command. This explanation, however, leaves unanswered the question of how Taylor expected Pickett to answer for the period of time Pickett purportedly was not in command. The explanation does not explain Pickett's report which covered the entire period, nor the fact that Pickett signed the report as the acting commander, nor did it explain Longstreet's interactions with Pickett over this period of time. Furthermore, there is no record of Taylor requesting reports from any other officers dismissed from the service on the movements of their former troops, nor of his referring to such officers in a manner which would connote active command.|$|E

The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us <b>did</b> <b>because</b> we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
