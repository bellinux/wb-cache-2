[...] Nilsson explained [...] "once I got the take down, I knew what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> later. He didn't." [...] Newman said of his experience that he [...] "was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs." [...] Newman continued, [...] "he {{was such a great}} singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do—like hold a note." ...|$|E
500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E

[...] "It was his job", Pihl said after the war, [...] "and he didn't have the faintest idea what the hell he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Horne had had no previous experience with logistics, and he tended to go by the old Navy tradition that you didn't get involved in {{what was happening in}} the engine room unless something went wrong, and then you brought a person up and bawled him out for it." ...|$|E

They gave up worrying Ministers and Parliament and took to worrying their own sympathisers and supporters—for funds. The ballot-box was temporarily forgotten in the cult of the collecting-box. The daughters of the horseleech were not more persistent in their demands, the financiers of the tottering ancien régime were not more desperate in their expedients for raising money than the Suffragist workers of all sections at this juncture, and in one way and another, by fair means and normal, they really got together a very useful sum. What they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> no one seemed to know, not even those who were most active in collecting work. The secret on this occasion had been well kept. Certain transactions that leaked out from time to time only added to the mystery of the situation.|$|E

Tolstoy (my {{favourite}} author, by the way) would have answered: [...] "Yes, certainly it would have been better for you--better for your soul." [...] Nevertheless, I still ask myself: [...] "Would it?" [...] and if this incident should come before me half a second before my final disappearance from earth, I should still be in doubt.|$|E

60|$|So it {{was that}} Honolulu watched his {{wonderful}} family grow up into a perplexing problem and secretly sympathized with him, for it was beyond any of them to imagine what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> But Ah Chun saw the problem more clearly than they. No one knew as he knew {{the extent to which}} he was an alien in his family. His own family did not guess it. He saw that there was no place for him amongst this marvellous seed of his loins, and he looked forward to his declining years and knew that he would grow more and more alien. He did not understand his children. Their conversation was of things that did not interest him and about which he knew nothing. The culture of the West had passed him by. He was Asiatic to the last fibre, which meant that he was heathen. Their Christianity was to him so much nonsense. But all this he would have ignored as extraneous and irrelevant, could he have but understood the young people themselves. When Maud, for instance, told him that the housekeeping bills for the month were thirty thousand--that he understood, as he understood Albert's request for five thousand with which to buy the schooner yacht Muriel and {{become a member of the}} Hawaiian Yacht Club. But it was their remoter, complicated desires and mental processes that obfuscated him. He was not slow in learning that the mind of each son and daughter was a secret labyrinth which he could never hope to tread. Always he came upon the wall that divides East from West. Their souls were inaccessible to him, and by the same token he knew that his soul was inaccessible to them.|$|E
6000|$|I courted my {{wife from}} the {{footboard}} of the cart. I did indeed. She was a Suffolk young woman, {{and it was}} in Ipswich market-place right opposite the corn-chandler's shop. I had noticed her up at a window last Saturday that was, appreciating highly. I had took to her, and I had said to myself, [...] "If not already disposed of, I'll have that lot." [...] Next Saturday that come, I pitched the cart on the same pitch, and I was in very high feather indeed, keeping 'em laughing the whole of the time, and getting off the goods briskly. At last I took out of my waistcoat-pocket a small lot wrapped in soft paper, and I put it this way (looking up at the window where she was). [...] "Now here, my blooming English maidens, is an article, the last article of the present evening's sale, which I offer to only you, the lovely Suffolk Dumplings biling over with beauty, and I won't take a bid of a thousand pounds for from any man alive. Now what is it? Why, I'll tell you what it is. It's made of fine gold, and it's not broke, though there's a hole in the middle of it, and it's stronger than any fetter that ever was forged, though it's smaller than any finger in my set of ten. Why ten? Because, when my parents made over my property to me, I tell you true, there was twelve sheets, twelve towels, twelve table-cloths, twelve knives, twelve forks, twelve tablespoons, and twelve teaspoons, but my set of fingers was two short of a dozen, and could never since be matched. Now what else is it? Come, I'll tell you. It's a hoop of solid gold, wrapped in a silver curl-paper, that I myself took off the shining locks of the ever beautiful old lady in Threadneedle Street, London city; I wouldn't tell you so if I hadn't the paper to show, or you mightn't believe it even of me. Now what else is it? It's a man-trap and a handcuff, the parish stocks and a leg-lock, all in gold and all in one. Now what else is it? It's a wedding-ring. Now I'll tell you what I'm a <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I'm not a going to offer this lot for money; but I mean to give it to the next of you beauties that laughs, and I'll pay her a visit to-morrow morning at exactly half after nine o'clock as the chimes go, and I'll take her out for a walk to put up the banns." [...] She laughed, and got the ring handed up to her. When I called in the morning, she says, [...] "O dear! It's never you, and you never mean it?" [...] "It's ever me," [...] says I, [...] "and I am ever yours, and I ever mean it." [...] So we got married, after being put up three times--which, by the bye, is quite in the Cheap Jack way again, and shows once more how the Cheap Jack customs pervade society.|$|E
