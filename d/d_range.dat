40|$|Abstract — The use of 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> sensors {{for human}} {{position}} tracking {{has grown in}} recent years, especially for augmenting robotic sensing for human-robot interaction. However, extrinsic calibration of the relative positions of 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> sensors is difficult, due to their limited range, narrow field of view, and distortion at large distances. 2 D laser range finders have also been used for pedestrian tracking, providing greater accuracy and coverage {{at the cost of}} being more expensive and susceptible to occlusion. In this work, we present two novel techniques for calibrating the positions of 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> sensors based on shared observations of pedestrians. The first technique uses 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> sensors alone, and the second technique uses 2 D and 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> sensors together, using the high precision and long range of the 2 D sensors to complement the short-range but richer sensing of 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> sensors. We evaluate the accuracy of both automatic calibration techniques, and we furthermore show that the combination of 2 D and 3 D sensors gives more robust and accurate calibration than when using 3 D sensors alone.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel and efficient algorithm for the 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> to 2 D image registration problem in urban scene settings. Our input {{is a set}} of unregistered 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> scans and a set of unregistered and uncalibrated 2 D images of the scene. The 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> scans and 2 D images capture real scenes in extremely high detail. A new automated algorithm calibrates each 2 D image and computes an optimized transformation between the 2 D images and 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> scans. This transformation is based on a match of 3 D with 2 D features that maximizes an overlap criterion. Our algorithm attacks the hard 3 <b>D</b> <b>range</b> to 2 D image registration problem in a systematic, efficient, and automatic way.

40|$|Background. This review {{aimed to}} address the {{question}} of whether cognitive impairment should be considered a core feature of depression that may be a valuable target for treatment. Method. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive function, assessed with a single neuropsychological test battery, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in patients with depression during symptomatic and remitted states. Inclusion of studies comparing patients remitted from depression and controls enabled us to investigate whether cognitive impairment persists beyond episodes of low mood in depression. Results. Our meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory and attention in patients with depression relative to controls (Cohen's <b>d</b> effect sizes <b>ranging</b> from - 0. 34 to - 0. 65). Significant moderate deficits in executive function and attention (Cohen's <b>d</b> <b>ranging</b> from - 0. 52 to - 0. 61) and non-significant small/moderate deficits in memory (Cohen's <b>d</b> <b>ranging</b> from - 0. 22 to - 0. 54) were found to persist in patients whose depressive symptoms had remitted, indicating that cognitive impairment occurs separately from episodes of low mood in depression. Conclusions. Both low mood and cognitive impairment are associated with poor psychosocial functioning. Therefore, we argue that remediation of cognitive impairment and alleviation of depressive symptoms each {{play an important role in}} improving outcome for patients with depression. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that cognitive impairment represents a core feature of depression that cannot be considered an epiphenomenon that is entirely secondary to symptoms of low mood and that may be a valuable target for future interventions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{effectiveness}} of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders {{in children with}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was examined, and compared with children without ASD. Method: Children with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 79, 58 boys; Mage = 11. 76) and children with anxiety disorders (n = 95, 46 boys; Mage = 12. 85), and their parents, participated. All families were referred to 1 of 7 mental health care centers and received the same CBT. Anxiety, quality of life, ASD-like behaviors, and emotional-behavioral problems were measured at waitlist (ASD-group only, n = 17), pretest, posttest, and 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after CBT. Results: CBT was more effective than waitlist for treating anxiety disorders (d = − 1. 45) and anxiety symptoms (d = − 0. 48) in children with ASD. At 2 years follow-up, 61 % of the children with and 64 % without ASD were free of their primary anxiety disorder (percentages not significantly different). The decrease in severity of anxiety disorders after CBT (<b>d</b> values <b>ranging</b> between − 1. 05 and − 1. 46) was not different for children with and without ASD.

40|$|Background Stagnation syndrome, a {{diagnostic}} entity in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), {{is characterized by}} mind-body obstruction-like symptoms. Although TCM has long-established symptom-relief treatments, a comprehensive mind-body intervention was called for. Purpose The study evaluated the efficacy of a six-session body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy for persons with stagnation syndrome. Method A 2 -arm randomized controlled trial design was adopted. The control group received a parallel general TCM instruction course. Both groups completed a pretest, posttest, and 2 -month follow-up assessment. The measures included self-report scales on stagnation, depression, anxiety, physical distress, daily functioning, and positive and negative affect; the other measure was of salivary cortisol, a biological marker of stress. Results Data on 111 adults with stagnation syndrome {{were included in the}} analysis. Completion rates were high (over 87 %) for both the intervention and control groups. Regarding within-group effects, the intervention group showed significant improvements from baseline in all 11 measures in both the posttest and 2 -month follow-up assessment (Cohen’s <b>d</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 78 to 0. 90 for stagnation). The control group showed significant improvements in two measures in the posttest and in eight measures in the 2 -month follow-up assessment (Cohen’s <b>d</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 19 to 0. 40 for stagnation). In interaction time x group effects, the intervention group showed significant improvements in nine measures in the posttest and in three measures in the 2 -month follow-up assessment (eta-squared = 0. 12 and 0. 02, respectively, for stagnation).
