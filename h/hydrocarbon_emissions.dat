40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of the tests of catalytic reduction of carbon oxide and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>emission</b> during the self-ignition engine start-up. The tests were performed at the station in the climate chamber at lowered ambient temperatures: – 7,- 15 and – 20 oC. A heated three-function platinum-palladium catalytic reactor with a metal monolith was used in the tests. The test methodology included a measurement of toxic fume concentraction upstream and downstream the catalytic reactor at simultaneous measurement of the start-up parameters and measurement of temperatures in selected engine and catalytic reactor locations. A period of the cold engine start-up is characterized by a relatively high carbon oxide and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>emission.</b> The level of that emissions increases as the ambient temperature gets lower. As a result of the tests the influence of heating up the reactor on its operation during the self-ignition engine start-up was identified. Carbon oxide and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>emission</b> during the start-up period can be reduced by initial heating up the catalytic reactor before the start-up by means of an electric heater.

40|$|We present medium-resolution 3 µm {{spectroscopy}} of the carbon-rich proto-planetary nebula IRAS 22272 + 5435. Spectroscopy {{with the}} Subaru Telescope adaptive optics system revealed a spatial variation of hydrocarbon molecules and dust surrounding the star. The ro-vibrational bands of acetylene (C 2 H 2) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) at 3. 0 µm {{are evident in}} the central star spectra. The molecules are concentrated in the compact region near the center. The 3. 3 and 3. 4 µm emission of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons is detected at 600 – 1300 AU from the central star. The separation of spatial distribution between gas and dust suggests that the small hydrocarbon molecules are indeed the source of solid material, and that the gas leftover from the grain formation is being observed near the central star. The intensity of aliphatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>emission</b> relative to the aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>emission</b> decreases with distance from the central star. The spectral variation is well matched to that of a laboratory analog thermally annealed with different temperatures.

40|$|The {{geomorphology}} of {{the western}} sector of the Mid-Channel Anticline (MCA), Santa Barbara, southern California suggests the actively growing fold is laterally propagating to the west. The presence of fold scarps and cross faults that segment the structure suggests that buried faults that are producing the folding are present at shallow depths. The summit area of the anticline at the Last Glacial Maximum (22 to 19 ka) was probably a small late Pleistocene island. Evidence for presence of the island includes {{what appears to be}} terrestrial erosion and is supported by assumption of sea level change and rates of uplift and subsidence. Pockmarks and domes ranging in diameter from ∼ 10 to 100 m, and several meters deep are present along the crest and flanks of the MCA.
