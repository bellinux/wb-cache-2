40|$|In this study, the {{fermentation}} of Chitinibacter tainanensis {{was carried}} out to produce chitinase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAGase) and to evaluate their effects on the antagonistic effect against plant pathogens. It was found that when using yeast extract as the nitrogen sources and calsium carbonate as the buffer salt, the cell mass would reach at 2. 54 g/L. Meanwhile, by using chitin as the carbon source, the chitinase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase would reach 13. 2 mU/mL and 558. 3 mU/mL in the supernatant of the <b>harvested</b> <b>broth,</b> respectively. It was observed that the cell precipitate of the broth still reserved chitinase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activities. Accordingly, 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7. 4) was used to wash out the residual enzymes activities from the cells. The result showed that 7. 17 mU/ml of chitinase and 558. 3 mU/ml of NAGase can be obtained under a 10 -min sonication. It was found that Na 2 (SO) 4 increased the chitinase and NAGase activity for 193. 80 % and 137. 22 % respectively, but Cu 2 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Zn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 + and Mg 2 + inhibited NAGase activity. To test {{the effect of these}} collected solutions to the antagonistic effects against plant pathogens, various microorganisms were used in the tests. It was found that the supernatant displayed a significant inhibitive effect on Scherotium rolfsii. Whereas, the washing-out buffer containing enzymes showed no antagonistic effect. This result proved that the antagonistic effect of the broth was due to some unknown chemicals and not from chitinase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. Further investigations should be performed to reveal the compounds and mechanisms about this antagonistic effect of the fermentation broth. The supernatant obtained at 48 hour had inhibition ratio of 78 %, and that obtained at 24 hour gave an 83 % inhibition ratio. 本研究以幾丁質為碳源，使用Chitinibacter tainanensis菌種生產幾丁質酵素與N-乙醯葡萄糖胺酶，將幾丁質分解為幾丁寡醣以及N-乙醯葡萄糖胺。培養基篩選時，以yeast extract為氮源時，菌體濃度可達到 1. 88 g/L。因培養過程中pH下降會造成菌體停止生長或死亡，藉由添加碳酸鈣 4 g/L當做緩衝，將醱酵液pH維持於 5 以上，菌量可達 2. 45 g/L。使用修飾後含幾丁質之培養基可生產幾丁質酵素 13. 2 mU/mL、N-乙醯葡萄糖胺酶 558. 3 mU/mL，醱酵液中幾丁質分解N-乙醯葡萄糖胺量為 16 g/L。 將醱酵液離心所得菌體，經由 50 mM Tris-HCl，pH 7. 4 ，於超音波震盪 10 min ，並去除菌體後，所得上清液中含幾丁質酵素 7. 17 mU/ml與N-乙醯葡萄糖胺酶 558. 3 mU/ml，證明菌體沈澱物中帶有幾丁質酵素與N-乙醯葡萄糖胺酶，添加金屬離子嘗試改變酵素活性的表現，結果顯示N-乙醯葡萄醣胺酶活性受到 5 mM二價金屬離子，如Cu 2 +、Ca 2 +、Mg 2 +、Zn 2 +、Co 2 +、Ni 2 +及 Mg 2 +抑制N-乙醯葡萄糖胺酶，幾丁質酵素受金屬離子抑制影響較小，Na 2 SO 4 則有助於幾丁質酵素與N-乙醯葡醣胺酶的活性表現，比較控制組幾丁質酵素與N-乙醯葡萄醣胺酶活性，為原來酵素活性之 193. 80 %和 137. 22 %。另外，於EDTA 存在下，酵素活性也提升。 將Chitinibacter tainanensis醱酵培養之上清液，用於農作物拮抗病原菌，發現醱酵液對水稻秧苗立枯病(Sclerotium rolfsii) 有明顯之抑菌能力，其效率達 78 %。經由進一步方法證實，醱酵液中所含之幾丁質酵素、N-乙醯葡萄醣胺酶和糖度皆非產生拮抗之物質。推測應該有其他分子量小於 1 kDa的物質為其抑菌之主要成分，且此物質經由高溫高壓之操作條件，仍可保有其抑菌活性。中文摘要	I Abstract	II 目次	III 表目次	VI 圖目次	VII 第一章 緒論	 1 (一) 前 言	 1 (二) 研究動機	 2 第二章 文獻回顧	 3 (一) 生物農藥	 3 1. 生物農藥簡介	 3 2. 生物農藥作用機制	 4 3. 抗生物質定義	 5 4. 抗生物質的種類	 5 5. 生物防治的應用	 8 (二) 幾丁質與幾丁寡糖簡介	 10 1. 幾丁質與幾丁聚醣介紹	 10 2. 幾丁質之製備	 14 3. 幾丁質的應用	 14 4.

40|$|As a {{first step}} in formulating an {{improved}} plague vaccine, we developed a simple purification strategy that produced high yields of pure cell-associated and culture supernatant-derived fraction 1 capsular antigen (F 1) from both avirulent Yersinia pestis C 092 (Pgm- Lcr-) and an Escherichia coli F 1 -producing recombinant strain. Cell-associated F 1 was partially purified by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitations of a sodium chloride extract of acetone-dried bacteria <b>harvested</b> from <b>broth</b> cultures. Cell-free F 1 was precipitated directly from culture supernatants with a single application of 30 % ammonium sulfate. By exploiting the aggregative property of F 1, large quantities of purified high-molecular-weight F 1 species from both cell extracts and supernatants were isolated in the void volume of a preparative gel filtration column. Highly purified, endotoxin-free F 1, combined with two different adjuvants, induced very high F 1 titers in mice and protected them against either subcutaneous (70 to 100 % survival) or aerosol (65 to 84 % survival) challenge with virulent organisms. This protection was independent of the source of the antigen and the adjuvant used. F 1 -induced protection against both subcutaneous and aerosol challenge was also significantly better than that conferred by immunization with the licensed killed whole-cell vaccine. Our results indicate that F 1 antigen represents a major protective component of previously studied crude capsule preparations, and immunity to F 1 antigen provides a primary means for the host to overcome plague infection by either the subcutaneous or respiratory route...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} using fluorescence spectroscopy {{was developed}} to measure the concentration of phospholipid biosurfactant produced by Corynebacterium alkanolyticum. Synchronous cultures of this organism were grown in a self-cycling fermentor (SCF). Application of a standard cycling scheme to the fermentor allowed for production of between 0. 82 and 1. 10 g/L of biosurfactant, depending on the rate of aeration to the system. Asynchronous cultures grown under the same operating conditions produced only 0. 75 g/L of phospholipid. Extension of isolated fermentor cycles allowed for further increases in biosurfactant production by the synchronous culture. Extending a cycle for ninety minutes increased the phospholipid concentration to 1. 44 g/L, without requiring additional hydrocarbon substrate. Placing <b>broth</b> <b>harvested</b> from standard SCF cycles in separate vessels and allowing the fermentation to continue allowed concentrations to rise to 1. 89 g/L without additional hydrocarbon addition, and to 2. 92 g/L with extra hexadecane substrate. Continual addition of hexadecane to the SCF caused biosurfactant production to cease, suggesting that the microorganism does not produce biosurfactant to increase the availabilty of insoluble hydrocarbon substrates...|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{methods for}} {{production}} of R-HAs include chemical synthesis, biocatalysis, chemical or enzymatic degradation of biologically synthesized Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), in vivo depolymerization of PHAs, and biotechnological production by metabolic pathway engineering (Chen and Wu [2005]; Ren et al. [2010]). Direct chemical synthesis of R-HAs has many limitations {{such as the}} requirement of pure substrate and expensive catalysts (Ren et al. [2005]; Ren et al. [2010]). Using microorganisms as biocatalysts for R-HA production often gives low yields and enantiomeric excesses (Ren et al. [2005]). In vivo depolymerization of PHAs is disadvantageous due to the low efficiency (de Roo et al. [2002]; Kawata et al. [2012]). In vivo depolymerization of PHA requires the biomass with PHA accumulated to be <b>harvested</b> from fermentation <b>broth</b> first, and then PHA degradation is enhanced by modifying the pH or temperature (Lee et al. [1999]; Ren et al. [2005]). Metabolic pathway engineering has been employed to produce R-HAs by over-expression of depolymerase and/or under-expression of synthase or dehydrogenase, {{but it is still}} at a stage in need of practical use (Chung et al. [2009]; Park et al. [2004]; Romano et al. [2005]; Sandoval et al. [2005]).|$|R
40|$|Background: Aspergillus {{species are}} {{occasionally}} associated with human infections.

Aspergilli were primarily identified using morphological methods {{in the level of}} species. Aspergillus mycelia were <b>harvested</b> from sabouraud <b>broth</b> media and the used for the DNA extraction by Glass beads-Phenol Chloroform method.

Exponentially growing cells (~[*] 1 [*]×[*] 106 cells/ml) were <b>harvested</b> by centrifuging <b>broth</b> culture at 4000  rpm/ 15  min/ 4  °C.

Pellets were resuspended in 40  ml PBS, and absorbance of cell suspension was measured at 600  nm using an Eppendorf bio photometer 8.5  mm light center. A plate count of each isolate cell suspension was conducted in nutrient agar at 30  °C for 48  h with serial dilutions of cell suspension. All measures were performed in triplicate, and the mean values were used to measure colony-forming units that correspond to absorption at 600  nm. Bacterial concentrations used in bioassays were expressed as colony-forming units per milliliter.|$|R
40|$|The {{virulence}} of 36 {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by intravenous injection into mice; the strains {{were found to}} fall into three broad groups, of high, medium and low virulence. This difference could not be related to any biochemical property studied, pyocine type nor antibiotic sensitivity pattern. It was found that 24 of the 30 strains of the high and medium virulence group produced large colonies on agar while 5 of the 6 strains of the low virulence group produced small colonies when plated under similar conditions. To test this observation a further series was collected and the strains were allocated to the high or low virulence category on colonial appearance. Mouse challenge with these fresh strains showed that the pre-diction was accurate. The large colony type had a faster growth rate on agar and in broth than the small. When a strain was grown in agar it {{was found to be}} more virulent than when <b>harvested</b> from <b>broth</b> (P = 0. 02 - 0. 01). Chromatography studies on slime derived from all three categories showed that they were apparently chemically similar. The amount of slime produced by a standard number of bacteria was measured for agar and broth grown cultures. The yields for the two media were approximately the same with large-colony forms. Small-colony forms produced similar amounts to the large forms on plates, but up to 15 times as much when grown in broth. The ability to kill mice was derived in part from early toxic death; the remainder died of renal disease. Study of the initiation of kidney infection showed that large-colony types were more successful in maintaining their numbers in the kidneys over the first 5 hr. Strains grown on nutrient agar did not give higher counts in the kidney than those from broth in the first 5 hr but after 24 hr they grew faster, infected more kidneys and killed more mice...|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{accurate}} identification of carriers of resistant microorganisms {{is an important}} aspect of efficient infection control in hospitals. Traditional identification methods of antibiotic-resistant bacteria usually take at least 3 to 4 days after sampling. A duplex real-time PCR assay was developed for rapid detection of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ARE). Primers and probes that are used in this assay specifically detected the d-Ala-d-Ala ligase gene of E. faecium and the modified penicillin-binding protein 5 gene (pbp 5) carrying the Glu-to-Val substitution at position 629 (Val- 629) in a set of 129 tested E. faecium strains with known pbp 5 sequence. Presence of the Val- 629 in the strain set from 11 different countries was highly correlated with ampicillin resistance. In a screening of hospitalized patients, the real-time PCR assay yielded a sensitivity and a specificity for the detection of ARE colonization of 95 % and 100 %, respectively. The results were obtained 4 h after samples were <b>harvested</b> from overnight <b>broth</b> of rectal swab samples, identifying both species and the resistance marker mutation in pbp 5. This novel assay reliably identifies ARE 2 to 3 days more quickly than traditional culture methods, thereby increasing laboratory throughput, making it useful for rectal screening of ARE. The assay demonstrates the advantages of real-time PCR for detection of nosocomial pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was defined by a poorly characterised filtration train employed to clarify culture broth containing monoclonal antibodies secreted by GS-NSO cells: the filtration train blinded unpredictably and the ability of the positively charged filters to adsorb DNA from process material was unknown. To direct the development of an assay to quantify the ability of depth filters to adsorb DNA, the molecular weight of DNA from a large-scale, fed-batch, mammalian cell culture vessel was evaluated as process material passed through the initial stages of the purification scheme. High molecular weight DNA was substantially cleared from the broth after passage through a disc stack centrifuge and the remaining low molecular weight DNA was largely unaffected by passage through a series of depth filters and a sterilising grade membrane. Removal of high molecular weight DNA was shown to be coupled with clarification of the process stream. The DNA from cell culture supernatant showed a pattern of internucleosomal cleavage of chromatin when fractionated by electrophoresis but the presence of both necrotic and apoptotic cells throughout the fermentation meant that the origin of the fragmented DNA could not be unequivocally determined. An intercalating fluorochrome, PicoGreen, was elected for development of a suitable DNA assay because of its ability to respond to low molecular weight DNA. It was assessed for its ability to determine the concentration of DNA in clarified mammalian cell culture broths containing pertinent monoclonal antibodies. Fluorescent signal suppression was ameliorated by sample dilution or by performing the assay above the pI of secreted IgG. The source of fluorescence in clarified culture broth was validated by incubation with RNase A and DNase I. At least 89. 0 % of fluorescence was attributable to nucleic acid and pre-digestion with RNase A was shown to be a requirement for successful quantification of DNA in such samples. Application of the fluorescence based assay resulted in characterisation of the physical parameters governing adsorption of DNA by various positively charged depth filters and membranes in test solutions and the DNA adsorption profile of the manufacturing scale filtration train. Buffers that reduced or neutralised the depth filter or membrane charge, and those that impeded hydrophobic interactions were shown to affect their operational capacity, demonstrating that DNA was adsorbed by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Production-scale centrifugation of <b>harvest</b> <b>broth</b> containing therapeutic protein resulted in the reduction of total DNA in the process stream from 79. 8 μg m 1 - 1 to 9. 3 μg m 1 - 1 whereas the concentration of DNA in the supernatant of pre-and post-filtration samples had only marginally reduced DNA content: from 6. 3 to 6. 0 μg m 1 - 1 respectively. Hence the filtration train was shown to ineffective in DNA removal. Historically, blinding of the depth filters had been unpredictable with data such as numbers of viable cells, non-viable cells, product titre, or process shape (batch, fed-batch, or draw and fill) failing to inform on the durability of depth filters in the harvest step. To investigate this, key fouling contaminants were identified by challenging depth filters with the same mass of one of the following: viable healthy cells, cells that had died by the process of apoptosis, and cells that had died through the process of necrosis. The pressure increase across a Cuno Zeta Plus 10 SP depth filter was 2. 8 and 16. 5 times more sensitive to debris from apoptotic and necrotic cells respectively, when compared to viable cells. The condition of DNA released into the culture broth was assessed. Necrotic cells released predominantly high molecular weight DNA in contrast to apoptotic cells which released chiefly low molecular weight DNA. The blinding of the filters was found to be largely unaffected by variations in the particle size distribution of material in, and viscosity of, solutions with which they were challenged. The exceptional response of the depth filters to necrotic cells may suggest the cause of previously noted unpredictable filter blinding whereby a number of necrotic cells have a more significant impact on the life of a depth filter than a similar number of viable or apoptotic cells. In a final set of experiments the pressure drop caused by non-viable necrotic culture broths which had been treated with DNase I or benzonase was found to be smaller when compared to untreated broths: the abilities of the enzyme treated cultures to foul the depth filter were reduced by 70. 4 % and 75. 4 % respectively indicating the importance of DNA in the blinding of the depth filter studied...|$|R

The lytic activity of supernatant fluids from 19 soil suspensions was testes on 47 previously isolated S. ureae strains and the recently isolated strain. One lytic suspension was propagated and purified by three successive transfers. Broth suspensions from individual plaques were spot inoculated onto 18 - 67 hour old S. ureae cultures in 0. 7 % agar overlaid on tryptic soy yeast extract (TSY) agar at pH 7. 2 or 8. 5.

Viral activity and host specificity were tested against the 47 stock strains, recent isolates, and strains ATCC 6473 and ATCC 13881. Consistent plaque production, influenced by host culture age, resulted from virus spot inoculated onto 18 - 45 hour-old cultures but not from virus spot inoculated onto or combined with S. ureae freshly inoculated into agar overlay. Plaques developed better at pH 7. 2 than 8. 5, and more consistently on the recently isolated strain of S. ureae than on the stock or ATCC host strains.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the IgG {{response}} of different animal species to Streptococcus suis serotype 2 proteins and to evaluate the immunogenic potential of these proteins in the mouse experimental model of infection. The protein profiles of ten different S. suis capsular type 2 isolates were compared by Western blotting using antisera produced in mice, rabbits and pigs against the reference strain. Strains were grown overnight in Todd-Hewitt <b>broth,</b> <b>harvested</b> by centrifugation, processed in a French press cell and digested with lysozyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was then performed and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose. The rabbit antiserum recognized seventeen common immunoreactive proteins, of which, proteins of 33, 44, 96, 122 kDa were present in all strains. Two, 128 and 136 kDa proteins were recognized by swine serum in many strains. An additional protein of 30 kDa was recognized by the mouse antiserum. These seven proteins, originating from the reference strain, were excised directly from polyacrylamide gels, mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant and given to groups of five mice on days 0 and 10. Immunoglobulin G response to each protein was monitored on day 20 using Western blots. Mice were then experimentally infected on day 21. Results indicated that vaccination with proteins of 33, 44, 128 and 136 kDa resulted in an IgG response and protection against the challenge with the reference strain, but gave only a partial protection against another virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain...|$|R
40|$|An {{extremely}} {{wide range}} of radiation sensi-tivities is displayed by various bacterial genera; for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has an LD 502 of about 1000 r (Goldblith et al., 1955), whereas Sarcina rubens has an LD,o in excess of 500, 000 r (Kilburn, Bellamy, and Terni, 1958). It would seem that any explanation of the {{wide range of}} radiosensitivities should take into ac-count the structural and physiological differences in the various types of organisms. The role of cell physiology in radiation sensitivity can be appreciated from experiments with a single species, Escherichia coli. Hollaender, Stapleton, and Martin (1951) reported that addition of glucose to a nutrient broth culture during growth of E. coli strain B/r affected the lethal response of the cell population to X rays. Cells <b>harvested</b> from nutrient <b>broth</b> cultures to which glucose had been added were more resistant than cells cultured on nutrient broth without this energy source. Anaerobiosis seemed to accentuate the effect of glucose on sensitivity to X-ray inactiva-tion. These investigators also demonstrated that the desensitizing effect of cultural conditions was dissociated from the well-established modifying effect of gaseous environment during irradiation. Howard-Flanders and Alper (1957) confirmed the earlier findings and suggested that the sigmoid survival curves for the more resistant cells might be accounted for by structural changes in the cells (e. g., multicellular or multinuclear). Sargent (1958) also found that cultural conditions alter the sensitivity of E. coli and stressed the necessity for anaerobiosis during growth in development of radioresistance. Structural ab-normalities were used to explain the difference in shapes of X-ray inactivation curves...|$|R
40|$|Enterobacter sakazakii {{causes a}} severe form of {{neonatal}} meningitis that occurs as sporadic cases {{as well as}} outbreaks. The disease has been epidemiologically associated with consumption of reconstituted, dried infant formulas. Very little information is available regarding pathogenicity of the organism and production of virulence factors. Clinical and environmental strains were screened for production of factors which have activity against Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in tissue culture. Polymyxin B lysate and sonicate preparations but not culture supernatants from the strains caused “rounding” of CHO cells. Subsequent studies showed that the CHO cell-rounding factor is a proteolytic enzyme that has activity against azocasein. The cell-bound protease was isolated by {{using a combination of}} polymyxin B lysis, followed by sonication of cells <b>harvested</b> from tryptone <b>broth.</b> The protease was purified to homogeneity by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography with Sephadex G- 100, hydrophobic interaction chromatography with phenyl-Sepharose CL- 4 B, and a second gel filtration with Sephadex G- 100. In addition to activity against azocasein, the purified protease also exhibits activity against azocoll and insoluble casein but not elastin. The protease has a molecular weight of 38, 000 and an isoelectric point of 4. 4. It is heat labile and for maximal activity against azocasein has an optimum temperature of 37 °C and a pH range of 5 to 7. Proteolytic activity is inhibited by ortho-phenanthroline and Zincov but is not affected by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, and trypsin inhibitors, which demonstrates that the protease is a zinc-containing metalloprotease. The metalloprotease does not hemagglutinate chicken or sheep erythrocytes. Twenty-three to 27 of the first 42 N-terminal amino acid residues of the metalloprotease are identical to proteases produced by Serratia proteamaculans, Pectobacterium carotovorum, and Anabaena sp. PCR analysis using primers designed from a consensus nucleotide sequence showed that 135 E. sakazakii strains possessed the metalloprotease gene, zpx, and 25 non-E. sakazakii strains did not. The cloned zpx gene of strain 29544 consists of 1, 026 nucleotides, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the metalloprotease has 341 amino acid residues, which corresponds to a theoretical protein size of 37, 782 with a theoretical pI of 5. 23. The sequence possesses three well-characterized zinc-binding and active-site motifs present in other bacterial zinc metalloproteases...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: D-tagatose is {{a natural}} low-calorie bulk {{sweetener}} (1. 5 kcal/g) showing 92 % of the sweetness of sucrose. It is low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and has prebiotic properties. Besides this wide range of healthy benefits, D-tagatose can also be applied as flavour enhancer and flavour creator in many applications. Tagatose significantly reduces the lingering sweetness and the bitter and metallic off-flavour of high intensity sweeteners. The natural occurrence of D-tagatose is however too limited for the increasing interest in this alternative sweetener. Chemical production of D-tagatose from D-galactose is economically not feasible due to byproduct formation and complex waste water treatment steps. A biocatalysed process using an immobilised L-arabinose isomerase enzyme for galactose isomerisation is therefore part of this study. Materials and methods: A wild type L-arabinose isomerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus is used as enzyme source for bioconversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose with Escherichia coli (BL 21) strain as expression host. Cells are <b>harvested</b> from culture <b>broth</b> by centrifugation and are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) or ringer solution. Different biomass concentrations are immobilised with 5 % v/v alginate in a 1 / 1 biomass/alginate volumetric ratio. Biomass concentration is varied between 1. 3 and 6. 5 %. Batch conversion experiments are performed in a thermostatic shaking bath at 60 °C. Bead concentration is varied between 10 and 30 %. A galactose solution of 360 g/l is used as substrate, containing 1 mM MnCl 2 as co-factor at pH 7. Samples are analysed by HPLC with refractive index detection. Results and discussion: Tagatose production increases with a higher biomass concentration immobilised in alginate. By varying the biomass concentration from 1. 3 to 6. 5 % at a bead concentration of 20 %, the tagatose concentration obtained after 24 hours increases from 27 to 65 g/l. The increase in tagatose production is however not linearly correlated to the biomass concentration. A similar conclusion can be drawn for {{the influence of the}} bead concentration. At a biomass concentration of 3. 3 % w/v, tagatose concentration increases from 29 to 56 g/l for an increase in bead concentration of 10 to 30 %. No significant influence of the diluent of the biomass is noticed on tagatose production. What’s innovative: An enzymatic bioprocess is developed and optimised for production of D-tagatose from D-galactose. Besides the unique benefits of tagatose for many food applications (low caloric value, low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and prebiotic properties, less lingering artificial sweetener aftertaste), the application of an L-arabinose isomerase for production of D-tagatose results in a highly selective and environmentally friendly production process, which is not yet available on the current industrial market. As sugar substitute, tagatose will help to control weight, tooth decay and will be a major help in comfort of diabetics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} influenza vaccines {{could lead to}} a bottleneck in supply in the near future. To satisfy the demand, process development of animal cell culture derived influenza vaccines is of growing importance. In this work a downstream processing scheme for the harvesting of cell-culture derived human influenza virus is presented. Preliminary investigations on the ideal time-point of harvest were carried out. The scheme for harvesting comprises centrifugal clarification for separation of cell debris, reduction of the impurity DNA by precipitation and removal of precipitates by microfiltration. For investigations on the ideal time-point of harvest, human influenza A virus A/PR/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) was propagated in roller bottles with serum-containing medium using MDCK cells as host. Independently of the multiplicity of infection, release of impurities (DNA and protein) followed the release of product with a time lag of approximately 7 hours. The time point of achieving maximum product concentration (based on HA and NA activity) was predominantly dependent on the inoculum lot. The ideal time-point of harvest was defined as the earliest time-point of maximum product concentration. Separation of cell debris was carried out in lab centrifuges. Independently of cell culture media (serum-free and serum-containing) or cultivation system (roller bottle or microcarrier cultivation) the maximum clarification efficiency achieved was 97 %, at a separator capacity of 1 • 10 - 8 m s- 1. Maximal centrifugal clarification achieved was comparable to clarification by mircofiltration (0, 45 µm). Dependent on cultivation media product recovery was 100 % on average for serum-containing and 82 % for serum-free media. Scale-up based on sigma-theory to a volume of 200 mL was possible. However, centrifugation needs to be carried out in conical vessels, since clarification efficiency was dependent on the vessel geometry. Aging of cultivation broth up to thirteen days did not show a strong impact on clarification performance. Furthermore, different cationic reagents (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, protamine sulphate, polyethylene­imine) were evaluated with respect to their selectivity of precipitating DNA from clarified cell culture supernatant. No selective DNA-removal could be achieved with polyvalent metal ions such as calcium and magnesium. Protamine sulphate-induced precipitation resulted in efficient clearance of DNA, but selectivity of product seemed to be strongly dependent on the initial concentration of virus. DNA was reduced to 3 % of the initial amount on average with a product recovery of 73 % (data of three batches from roller bottle cultivations). A polyethylenimine (PEI) concentration of 1 • 10 - 2 g (mg DNA) - 1 reduced the amount of DNA to 0, 24 µg mL- 1, independently of the initial amount of DNA (data of four batches from microcarrier cultivations). Addition of polyethylenimine also led to reversible co-precipitation of product (based on NA activity) with virus being re-solubized at high PEI-concentrations (> 10 - 2 g PEI (µmol min- 1) - 1). Recovery of resolubized product seemed to be dependent on the initial amount and reached from 68 … 100 % (data of four batches from microcarrier cultivations). PEI precipitation was also carried out successfully with serum-free cultivation broth containing virus strains influenza A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005 (H 3 N 2) and influenza B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004. The results of this work show, that <b>harvesting</b> of culture <b>broth</b> can be carried out at an optimal time-point. It can be concluded that centrifugal clarification in lab centrifuges is well suited for separating cell debris at different scales. DNA-precipitation using PEI was most promising, because selectivity was independent of the initial DNA concentration, virus strain and cultivation media. However, to ensure optimal precipitation conditions the influence of pH, ionic strength, temperature and molecular weight of the polymer need to be investigated...|$|R

Para se avaliar a influÃncia dos sistemas de exploraÃÃo agrÃcola (SE) â orgÃnico (SO) e convencional (SC) â em cana-de-aÃÃcar, foi conduzida, na Unidade Agroindustrial da YpiÃca, localizada no municÃpio de Pindoretama-CE, uma pesquisa de campo utilizando-se as variedades (V) CB 38 - 22 (CB), RB 72454 (RB) e SP 71 - 6949 (SP). Os tratamentos constaram da combinaÃÃo de trÃs V com trÃs SE: orgÃnica acrescida do coquetel de sementes (OCS); orgÃnica acrescida do plantio de feijÃo-de-corda (cv. Epace 10) entre as linhas (OE 10) e plantio convencional (SC). O delineamento experimental foi o inteiramente casualizado com quatro repetiÃÃes. As avaliaÃÃes agronÃmica e industrial foram feitas em marÃo de 2005, na primeira soca. Foram determinados os valores da Ãrea foliar (AF), do Ãndice de Ãrea foliar (IAF) e do diÃmetro (DC), nÃmero (NC), comprimento (CC) e produtividade de colmos (RC). Para a anÃlise de Brix, POL e Pureza, foram colhidos dez colmos de cada parcela e extraÃdo o caldo para anÃlise em laboratÃrio. Os SE diferiram estatisticamente entre si para as variÃveis: AF, IAF e NC. Os maiores valores de AF e IAF foram obtidos nos SO (OCS e OE 10). JÃ o maior NC foi obtido no tratamento OCS. Com relaÃÃo Ãs V, apenas as variÃveis AF e IAF nÃo diferiram estatisticamente. NÃo se observaram diferenÃas estatÃsticas para as interaÃÃes entre V e SE nas diversas variÃveis estudadas. Os melhores rendimentos de colmos foram obtidos nas V RB (41, 1 t/ha) e SP (38, 2 t/ha), contra 29, 0 t/ha na CB. A variÃvel DC foi a que mais contribuiu para o RC das V. Constatou-se, tambÃm, uma relaÃÃo positiva entre CC e DC. Com relaÃÃo Ãs variÃveis industriais, observaram-se diferenÃas estatÃsticas para POL e Pureza entre os SE e POL entre V. JÃ o Brix nÃo sofreu quaisquer influÃncias de V e SE. Assim como para as variÃveis agronÃmicas, tambÃm nÃo se verificaram interaÃÃes estatisticamente significativas entre SE e V para as industriais. O SC apresentou o maior POL (14, 21 %) e, entre V, o maior valor de POL foi obtido na RB. Os maiores valores de Pureza, 71, 52 e 69, 14 %, foram obtidos nos sistemas SC e OCS, respectivamente. There {{are some}} forms of cultivating the soil and {{the choice of a}} determined form depends on the environment conditions and on the aim of the exploration. To evaluate the influence of the agricultural exploration systems (EA) â ornanic systems (OS) e conventional systems (CS) â in sugar cane crop, it was lead, in the YpiÃca Agro-industry, in the city of Pindoretama - CE, a field research by using varieties (V) CB 38 - 22 (CB), RB 72454 (RB) and SP 71 - 6949 (SP). The treatments consisted of the combination of three V with three EA: organic increased of seed cocktail (OSC); organic increased of the cowpea plantation (cv. Epace 10) between the lines (OE 10) and conventional plantation (CS). The experimental delineation was completely randomized with four repetitions. Agronomic and industrial evaluations were made in March of 2005, in the first beat. Foliar area values (FA), foliar area index (FAI) and diameter (DC), number (NC), length (CC), and productivity of stalks (RC) were determined. For Brix, POL, and Purity analysis, ten stalks of each parcel were <b>harvested</b> and the <b>broth</b> extracted to be examined in laboratory. EA differed statistically one from another for the variables: AF, IAF and NC. The biggest FA and FAI values were gotten from OS (OSC e OE 10). The biggest NC was gotten in the treatment OSC. Relating to V, only variables FA and FAI did not differ statistically. Statistical differences were not observed for interaction between V and EA. The best stalk profits were gotten from V RB (41, t/ha) and SP (38, 2 t/ha), against 29, 0 t/ha in the CB. The variable DC was the one that most contributed to the RC of the V. It was also evidenced a positive relation between CC and DC. Concerning the industrial variable, statistical differences for POL and purity between EA and POL between V were observed. On the other hand, the Brix did not suffer any influences from V and EA. For the agronomic variables it were not verified any statistically significant interactions between EA and V, {{as well as for the}} industrial variables.
