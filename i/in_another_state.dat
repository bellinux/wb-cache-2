When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.|$|E

He sat the exam and came third in Australia, but failed to secure an appointment as there were no vacancies in Western Australia.

5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize same-sex marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After a Maryland House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage to voters and invalidated same-sex marriages performed <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>state</b> or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine same-sex couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning specialist at Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. The plaintiffs had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the state's statutory ban on same-sex marriage violated constitutional protections of due process, equality, and prohibitions against sex discrimination in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E
50|$|On {{the first}} {{question}} regarding the condition of prior lawful residence <b>in</b> <b>another</b> member <b>state,</b> the Court noted {{in the first place}} that no provision of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 makes its application conditional on prior residence in a member state. Indeed, some of its provisions suggest that it is applicable to family members not already lawfully resident <b>in</b> <b>another</b> member <b>state.</b> Thus Article 5(2) allows entry without a residence card while Article 10(2) is an exhaustive list of documents that may need presenting, which nevertheless does not include any documents demonstrating prior lawful residence <b>in</b> <b>another</b> member <b>state.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} Metock is much {{enhanced}} by Eind and Singh, which confirmed that returning migrants continue {{to enjoy the}} family reunification rights they enjoyed while residing <b>in</b> <b>another</b> member <b>state.</b> This {{has led to the}} so-called [...] whereby a national of a member state circumvents national restrictions on family reunification by taking up residence <b>in</b> <b>another</b> member <b>state,</b> thus exercising his right of free movement and subsequently relying on his right to family reunification under the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 on his return. A number of member states have claimed this amounts to an abuse of free movement, but in Akrich the Court ruled that taking up residence <b>in</b> <b>another</b> member <b>state</b> expressly to gain Community rights is not an abuse.|$|R

25|$|Barr took a lead in {{legislative}} debate concerning same-sex marriage.

25|$|In cases {{involving}} alleged immorality or injustice, that rule has been criticised as susceptible to abuse, as a court could characterise almost any statute or rule as being offensive {{to the public}} policy of their state.

25|$|Burns v. Hickenlooper is a {{same-sex}} marriage case filed on July 1, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.

In each case, Becker and Stephenson state that official documents attest to the fact that Gacy was <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>state</b> at the time the youths in question disappeared. In one case, that of 18-year-old Robert Gilroy, investigators found that on September 12, 1977—three days before Gilroy's disappearance—Gacy had flown to Pittsburgh and did not return to Chicago until the day after the youth had disappeared.|$|E
25|$|In {{another case}} in which the {{defendant}} was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own voir dire of the expert in question before he testified.
