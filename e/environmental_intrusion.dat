50|$|Concurrent {{numbering}} {{can become}} {{very common in}} countries that allow it. Where multiple routes must pass through a single mountain crossing, or through a major city, it is often economically and practically advantageous for them all to be accommodated on a single physical road. In some countries, however, concurrent numbering is avoided by posting only one route number on road signs; these routes disappear {{at the start of}} the concurrency and reappear when it ends. Criticism of concurrencies include <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusion,</b> as well as being considered a factor in road accidents.|$|E
50|$|The SMAW system (launcher, {{ammunition}} and logistics support) was fielded in 1984 as a United States Marine Corps-unique system. The Mod 0 demonstrated several shortcomings, {{resulting in a}} series of modifications in the mid-2000s. These modifications included a re-sleeving process for bubbled launch tubes, rewriting/drafting operator and technical manuals, and a kit to reduce <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusion</b> into the trigger mechanism. This also includes an optical sight modification to allow the new HEAA rocket to be used effectively against moving armor targets. The U.S. military recently fielded new boresight bracket kits which, when installed, correct the loss of accurate boresight issues between the launch tube and spotting rifle. During Operation Desert Storm, 150 launchers and 5,000 rockets were deployed by the United States Army. Initially the Army showed interest in the system, but ultimately returned the launchers and any unused rockets to the Marine Corps. Later, the U.S. Army developed the SMAW-D ("Disposable"), designated by the Army as the M141 Bunker Defeat Munition.|$|E

Sometimes however,their wide scale deployment has to face potential negative environmental implications. These potential problems seem to be a strong barrier for a further dissemination of these systems in some consumers. To cope with these problems this paper presents an overview of an Environmental Impact Assessment. We assess the potential <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusions</b> in order to ameliorate them with new technological innovations and good practices in the future power systems.

40|$|A {{data base}} for the {{comparison}} of advanced energy conversion systems for utility applications using coal or coal-derived fuels was developed. Estimates of power plant performance (efficiency), capital cost, cost of electricity, natural resource requirements, and <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusion</b> characteristics were made for ten advanced conversion systems. Emphasis was on the energy conversion system {{in the context of}} a base loaded utility power plant. All power plant concepts were premised on meeting emission standard requirements. A steam power plant (3500 psig, 1000 F) with a conventional coal-burning furnace-boiler was analyzed as a basis for comparison. Combined cycle gas/steam turbine system results indicated competitive efficiency and a lower cost of electricity compared to the reference steam plant. The Open-Cycle MHD system results indicated the potential for significantly higher efficiency than the reference steam plant but with a higher cost of electricity...|$|E

Only {{one of the five}} (Malott) is fully supportive of Drash and Tudor's analysis of autism as a completely contingency-shaped disorder. The other four authors recognize the importance of environmental variables in the development and maintenance of autistic behavior, but caution against the neglect of genetic and other variables such as <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusion,</b> and insist that a complete behavioral theory of the etiology of autism must involve all three variables.

40|$|Abstract — A {{retrofitted}} MHD {{power plant}} is particularly attractive for older plants {{that have to}} be reconditioned since these may increase the generating capacity of the existing plants and at the same time, reduce the emission of pollutants and cooling water requirements. This would extend the life of an existing power plant and improve its <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusion.</b> The purpose of the paper is to study the feasibility of retrofitted MHD power plants if would have been adopted in the existing plants of Bangladesh. Many of the thermal power plants commissioned in Bangladesh are 30 - 40 years old. Retrofitted MHD power plants may be an option to increase the performance of these plants as there remains a large coal reserve in Bangladesh where the gas reserve is approaching towards its end. The feasibility studies of MHD plants demonstrated that combined cycles using both open and closed cycle MHD processes should be economically competitive. The technology has reached the stage where the feasibility of retrofit demonstration plant is considered by several countrie...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the relationships between}} hormones, neurocognition and altered sleep, both in duration and in quality. Sleep is a relatively underexplored process, but in recent times research is providing us insight into {{the purpose of the}} subconscious state that passively fills a third of our lives. It seems intuitive that it must be important for us, as indeed for all mammals, but much is still to be determined about the resting state and its relationship with other physiological and pathological processes. 	Firstly, the metabolic and neurobehavioural effects of ‘catch-up’ sleep are assessed in a cohort of men who choose to restrict their sleep during the working week and ‘catch-up’ at the weekends, a population as yet not studied. Insulin sensitivity and other markers of glucose homeostasis were better following ‘catch-up’ sleep compared to sustained sleep restriction, along with some markers of performance. 	Sleep fragmentation can also occur through disease and <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusions.</b> The thesis explores both these possibilities by examining the effects of acoustic stimuli during sleep on metabolic and neurobehavioural outcomes. The effect of testosterone on the control of breathing is assessed in the context of sleep disordered breathing, finding a relationship between the male hormone, which is known to be important for metabolic health, and a marker of ventilatory control.

30|$|Recent {{advances}} in sensor technology, such as smart/intelligent nodes with cognitive abilities, on-board sensors, and wireless networking capabilities have triggered {{the use of}} wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in monitoring various physical phenomena [12 – 14]. Though sensor nodes are capable of {{a limited amount of}} local processing and wireless communication, when a large number of sensors communicate and share information among themselves, they can measure a desired phenomenon-of-interest in great detail. Also with the developments of unmanned autonomous vehicles, WSNs are gaining popularity due to their potential to be useful {{for a wide range of}} applications including <b>environmental</b> monitoring, <b>intrusion</b> detection, and various military and civilian applications [12, 15, 16]. Due to advanced microelectromechanical systems, many of the state-of-the-art sensors are now more accurate, robust against noise, and energy efficient [17, 18]. These new cutting-edge sensors can withstand severe unfavorable conditions in hazardous areas where human deployment is impossible. All these useful and exciting features in recently developed sensors make them suitable candidates for the set of applications involving monitoring of diffusion phenomena that we are interested in.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} of west Pacific tropical cyclone Nuri (2008) was observed over four days from easterly wave to typhoon stage by aircraft using scanning Doppler radar and dropsonde data. This disturbance developed rapidly in a significantly sheared environment. In {{spite of the}} shear, over-lapping closed circulations existed {{in the frame of}} reference of the storm in the planetary boundary layer and at 5 km ele-vation, providing a deep region protected from environmen-tal influences. The rapid spinup of Nuri {{can be attributed to the}} strong increase with height at low levels of the vertical mass flux during and after the tropical depression stage, and the correspondingly strong vorticity convergence in the plan-etary boundary layer. As Nuri developed, convective regions of boundary layer vortex stretching became fewer but more intense, culminating in a single nascent eyewall at the trop-ical storm stage. A non-developing tropical wave case was also analyzed. This system started with much weaker circu-lations in the boundary layer and aloft, leaving it unprotected against <b>environmental</b> <b>intrusion.</b> This may explain its failure to develop. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{can offer}} {{vast amounts of}} {{real-time}} data about environments. These real-time data streams are an important resource for the ever-increasing number of autonomous agents. Robots can use WSN information to effectively extend their senses and gather data about regions that are not visible or immediately accessible. Additionally, software agents can aggregate WSN data for monitoring purposes such as <b>environmental</b> monitoring and <b>intrusion</b> detection. Despite advances {{in the field of}} WSNs, the development of most applications currently requires sensor-specific programming techniques. The research community, as well as industry, needs an efficient, convenient method for accessing WSN data through existing infrastructure such as intranets and the internet. This research project presents TRI, the TinyOS Robot Integration server. TRI is a multithreaded server that provides developers with WSN data management and agent-agent communication channels through a TCP/IP connection and a human-readable message protocol. The TRI server hides the details of retrieving data from and managing a WSN. Thus, developers with standard TCP/IP socket experience can incorporate WSNs into their projects. This research also presents TRI applications executing on a Sony AIBO that responds to its environment by its onboard sensors and the extra sensory data from a WSN.

40|$|Low power radios enable {{ubiquitous}} sensor {{networks that}} can be used for a variety of applications, such as biomedical monitoring, <b>environmental</b> sensing and <b>intrusion</b> detection. However, existing transceivers have been unable to demonstrate low enough power consumption to fully realize these applications. Low duty cycle impulse radio can offer significant power savings by allowing the transceiver to be turned off between bits. Ensuring that two nodes are sufficiently synchronized to duty-cycle in this fashion is a significant challenge. To solve this problem we used pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) scheme of Mirollo and Strogatz. We performed extensive simulation of the PCO network under a realistic radio parameter space and found synchronization to be robust. We then implemented a low power, aggressively duty-cycled dual-band IR-UWB transceiver in an IBM 90 nm CMOS process based on this synchronization mechanism. The transceiver features an energy-detecting front-end, a relaxation oscillator based PCO and a precise edge locking PLL for time bin generation. The time-bins provide our system with 123 unique channels {{that can be}} used for multiple access [...] We constructed a FPGA based test and measurement setup and implemented a synchronization management finite-state-machine on microprocessor. The PCO network is shown to synchronize nodes robustly with experiments confirming the results of our simulations. We found that the synchronization management scheme allows a four-node system to remain synchronized with duration-of-synchronization iii on the order of one second when using 30 ns RF-on time windows in a 7. 2 frame. As a result of this aggressive-duty cycle of 0. 8 %, the total transceiver power consumption is reduced to 119 uW while actively communicating. We were able to demonstrate functional radio links transmitting packets of upto 1200 bit length over a meter range, proving the viability of the concept. Finally we perform an analysis of a simplified theoretical model of the system which provides fundamental limits to the size of the network that can be supported and the data throughput that can be achieved. The analysis shows that the scheme offers significant power savings benefits for up-to ten nodes if bit-error-rate can be sufficiently controlled. i...|$|R
