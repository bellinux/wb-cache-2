I'd throw them away if I hadn't spent so much money on them," [...] said Ethel, turning over the {{tarnished}} filigree, mock pearl, and <b>imitation</b> <b>coral</b> necklaces, bracelets, and brooches that were tumbling out of the frail boxes in which they came.|$|E
60|$|Saxon {{smiled with}} appreciation, pointed out her foot, velvet-slippered with high Cuban heels, and {{slightly}} lifted the tight black skirt, exposing a trim ankle and delicate swell of calf, the white flesh gleaming through the thinnest and flimsiest of fifty-cent black silk stockings. She was slender, not tall, yet the due round lines of womanhood were hers. On her white shirtwaist was a pleated jabot of cheap lace, caught {{with a large}} novelty pin of <b>imitation</b> <b>coral.</b> Over the shirtwaist was a natty jacket, elbow-sleeved, and to the elbows she wore gloves of imitation suede. The one essentially natural touch about her appearance was the few curls, strangers to curling-irons, that escaped from under the little naughty hat of black velvet pulled low over the eyes.|$|E
50|$|The Dolphin Cove {{habitat is}} one of the largest dolphin pools in existence, where the visitor can {{interact}} with the dolphins. It features 2 ft waves, a sandy beach and an <b>imitation</b> <b>coral</b> reef. The organisation Ric O'Barry Dolphin Project tries to raise awareness of this attraction.|$|E

5000|$|Alabaster is a porous {{stone and}} can be [...] "dyed" [...] into any colour or shade, a {{technique}} used for centuries. For this the stone needs to be fully immersed in various pigmentary solutions and heated to a specific temperature. The technique {{can be used to}} disguise alabaster. In this way a very misleading <b>imitation</b> of <b>coral</b> that is called [...] "alabaster coral" [...] is produced.|$|R
50|$|Three {{remarkable}} bridges {{lead to the}} village. The Dragon Bridge, {{so named}} after four zinc figures of winged dragons, and the Large Chinese Bridge, noted for pink granite vases and <b>imitation</b> <b>coral</b> branches, were completed in 1785. The Cross-Shaped Bridge had been constructed by the Neyelov Brothers six years earlier (illustrated, to the right).|$|E
5000|$|The Battersea Shield is made {{of several}} {{different}} pieces, held together by rivets concealed under the decorative elements. It is decorated with repoussé decoration, engraving, and enamel. The decoration is in the typically Celtic La Tène style, consisting of circles and spirals. There are 27 small round compartments in raised bronze with red cloisonné enamel; the bronze within the compartment forms a sort of swastika, {{thought to have been}} associated with good luck and also [...] "solar energy". [...] Enamel was a Celtic speciality, and reflects the use of red Mediterranean coral inlays in other British Celtic artefacts, such as the Witham Shield, and here may perhaps be considered as an <b>imitation</b> of imported <b>coral,</b> though the use of enamel allows a more elaborate design. Some scholars have read a reversible human face into the decoration at the points where the smaller circles link to the larger one.|$|R
5000|$|Enamel {{was first}} used on small pieces of jewellery, and has often {{disintegrated}} in ancient pieces that have been buried. Consistent and frequent use of champlevé technique is first seen in the La Tène style of early Celtic art in Europe, from the 3rd or 2nd century BC, where the predominant colour was a red, possibly intended as an <b>imitation</b> of red <b>coral</b> (as used on the Witham Shield), and the base was usually bronze. The [...] "Insular Celts" [...] of the British Isles made especially common use of the technique, seen as highlights on the relief decoration of the Battersea Shield and other pieces. However this was technically not true enamel in the usual sense of the word, as the glass was only heated until it became a soft paste before being pushed into place. This is sometimes informally known as [...] "sealing-wax" [...] enamelling, and may be described as [...] "glass inlay" [...] or similar terms. True enamelling technique, where glass paste is put into place and fired until it liquifies, was learnt from the Romans. [...] The earliest literary description of enamel is from the Greek sophist Philostratus III, who wrote in his Icones (Bk I, 28), describing polychrome horse-harness: [...] "It is said that the barbarians in the Ocean pour these colours on heated bronze and that they adhere, become as hard as stone and preserve the designs that are made on them".|$|R
