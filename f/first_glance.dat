5|$|At <b>first</b> <b>glance,</b> all the Buddha statues appear similar, {{but there}} is a subtle {{difference}} between them in the mudras, or the position of the hands. There are five groups of mudra: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The first four balustrades have the first four mudras: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding mudra. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same mudra: Zenith. Each mudra represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.|$|E
5|$|At <b>first</b> <b>glance,</b> dazzle {{seems an}} {{unlikely}} form of camouflage, {{drawing attention to}} the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he {{believed to be the}} applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining the goal was to confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship's outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by the patterns on a series of land animals, the giraffe, zebra and jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which at <b>first</b> <b>glance</b> {{appears as a}} parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E

5|$|On August 1, 2017, at the 135th annual Supreme Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson {{announced}} a new uniform of the Fourth Degree to include a blue blazer with the emblem as a patch and on the buttons, a white shirt, a Fourth Degree tie, dark gray slacks and a beret with the emblem. According to some Catholic news sources, the new uniform is considered controversial by some of its members, drawing criticism for its attempt to make its members appear (at <b>first</b> <b>glance)</b> to be military veterans {{as opposed to a}} fraternal religious group.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at <b>first</b> <b>glance</b> surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Scholar William Luis observes {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} between {{the structure of}} Julia Alvarez’s How the García Girls Lost Their Accents and Alejo Carpentier's Viaje a la Semilla as both employ the tactic of backwards narration and consequently lay claim to two beginnings and two endings. Alvarez has also been said to follow the stylistic traditions established by novels such as Pedro Juan Labarthe's The Son of Two Nations: The Private Life of a Columbia Student (1931), Marcio Veloz Maggiolo's El prófugo (1962), Humberto Cintrón's Frankie Cristo (1972), and Richard Ruiz's The Hungry American (1978). Despite the overtly North American stylistic qualities the book appears to boast at <b>first</b> <b>glance,</b> each of the aforementioned authors are of Hispanic descent.|$|E

50|$|One of Leitch's <b>first</b> <b>glances</b> with fame {{came when}} he {{appeared}} {{on one of the}} early episodes of Win Ben Stein's Money. In an excerpt from Life as a Loser, published on Blacktable.com, Leitch describes the experience of taping this episode within hours of being dumped by his fiancée (a fact that co-host Jimmy Kimmel included in Leitch's introduction).|$|R

5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at <b>first</b> <b>glance</b> the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{then was}} carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things {{he could do to}} improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At <b>first</b> <b>glance,</b> Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.|$|E
5|$|Well {{established}} in the imperial capital, Honório Hermeto campaigned in 1829 to become a general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national lower house) as a representative for his native Minas Gerais. He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his policies. As a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an unobtrusive role for the first couple of years, having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at <b>first</b> <b>glance.</b> Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had self-confidence and a powerful charisma, and was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E

60|$|Their <b>first</b> <b>glances</b> at {{her were}} full of the same anxiety for her health and strength, as they heartily shook hands, and {{accompanied}} her into the drawing-room, she explaining that Mr. Parsons {{was to have the}} study all to himself, and never be disturbed there; then inquiring after the three children, two daughters, who were married, and a son lately ordained.|$|R

The Editor himself, on <b>first</b> <b>glancing</b> over that singular passage, was inclined to exclaim: What, have we got not only a Sansculottist, but an enemy to Clothes in the abstract? A new Adamite, in this century, which flatters itself that it is the Nineteenth, and destructive both to Superstition and Enthusiasm? ...|$|R
6000|$|The scout and {{his companions}} listened to this simple {{explanation}} with the interest of men who imbibe new ideas, {{at the same time}} that they get rid of old ones, which had proved disagreeable inmates. The two latter uttered their usual and expressive exclamation, [...] "Hugh!" [...] as the truth <b>first</b> <b>glanced</b> upon their minds, while the former, after a short musing pause, took upon himself to reply.|$|R

25|$|Although at <b>first</b> <b>glance,</b> {{they may}} seem similar, {{there are many}} {{differences}} {{in the way the}} different languages use the alphabets. For example, similar words are written differently in Persian and Arabic, as they are used differently.|$|E
25|$|At <b>first</b> <b>glance,</b> Schloss Eggenberg {{presents}} {{itself as a}} uniform, new construction of the 17th century. Nevertheless, large portions of the building {{date back to the}} Late Middle Ages and construction continued throughout the early modern era.|$|E
25|$|Although Shusterman’s project may at <b>first</b> <b>glance</b> seem utterly {{innovatory}} {{and even}} iconoclastic, its various elements, as Shusterman himself admits, {{can be traced}} to many respected traditions: ancient Greek philosophy and the later Western philosophies (Michel de Montaigne, John Dewey, Michel Foucault), but also East-Asian wisdom such as Confucianism.|$|E
60|$|A consummate spirit his eye lighted on. There stood May Dacre. He gasped for breath. He turned pale. It {{was only}} for a moment, and his emotion was unperceived. There she stood, {{beautiful}} as when she <b>first</b> <b>glanced</b> before him; there she stood, with all her imperial graces; and all surrounding splendour seemed to fade away before her dazzling presence, like mournful spirits of a lower world before a radiant creature of the sky.|$|R
60|$|Martin {{could hardly}} be a mortal man, and not express in his face {{something}} of the anger and disdain with which Mr Pecksniff inspired him. But beyond this he evinced no knowledge whatever of that gentleman's presence or existence.

25|$|Jardine {{called this}} {{modified}} {{form of the}} tactic fast leg theory. On the 1932-33 English tour of Australia, Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen. It {{turned out to be}} extremely dangerous, and most Australian players sustained injuries from being hit by the ball. Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield's skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had <b>first</b> <b>glanced</b> off the bat and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.|$|R
25|$|Not {{only the}} rocky {{walls of the}} ravines but also the granite {{outcrops}} of the Pampa de Achala, at <b>first</b> <b>glance</b> sites deprived of vegetation and of fauna, represent highly diverse habitats, capable of sustaining in their cracks and fissures a flora and fauna of significant scientific interest.|$|E
25|$|Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths {{state in}} their book Anti-Americanism that they would at <b>first</b> <b>glance</b> think that Canadians seem as likely as others to embrace {{characteristics}} that are characterised as anti-American. O'Conner and Griffiths include such actions as criticising Americans as a people, or the U.S. as a country as being anti-American often demonising, denigrating and resorting to stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter of}} 1945, the First Bulgarian Army {{is engaged in}} the battles for the liberation of Hungary from the Nazis during the Second World War. Three men are sent to join the army.
