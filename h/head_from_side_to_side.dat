5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, {{and less on}} smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited {{by most of the}} organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E
5|$|Female {{macaroni}} penguins {{can begin}} breeding at around {{five years of}} age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed {{at a younger age}} because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.|$|E

5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The {{silky shark}} {{is one of}} the three most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most {{numerous}} large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther out in the truly open ocean. The silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b> However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.|$|E
25|$|The alcephine bovids (wildebeests, hartebeests, hirola, bontebok, blesbok, {{and several}} similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex {{mixtures}} of chemical compounds. The preorbital glands of the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygarus) are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at {{the borders of}} their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes. In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) is a semi-gregarious species, while the hirola (Beatragus hunteri) is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fennec fox}} is an omnivore. Food sources include plants, rodents, insects, birds, eggs, and rabbits. An {{individual}} can jump up to [...] high and [...] forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators. When hunting, large eared foxes {{such as the}} fennec, or the bat-eared fox, can seem {{to stare at the}} ground while they rotate their <b>heads</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.

25|$|The {{smooth green snake}} {{relies on}} an {{environment}} matching its green scales for camouflage to protect itself from predators. If threatened, a smooth green snake will usually flee. It is a docile snake, seldom biting and usually allowing humans to come close. If provoked, it can secrete a substance from its anal gland, causing a foul smell. When handled by humans, it usually shows excited behavior and calms down after wrapping itself around a finger. When it hunts, it turns its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> finding prey with its tongue and an organ {{on the roof of}} its mouth that interprets chemical signals. It has no ears, relying on vibrations to figure out its surroundings. Its sight is relatively strong over short distances. Due to stretchy ligaments in its jaw, it can swallow prey whole, even those that are larger than its own body diameter. It can shed its skin as often as every four to five weeks, allowing for growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position {{for an hour or}} more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E

5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their <b>heads</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> as if {{in an effort to}} be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|R
2500|$|Biographers, such as Shirl Kasper, repeat Oakley's {{own story}} about her very first {{shot at the}} age of eight. [...] "I saw a {{squirrel}} run down over the grass in front of the house, through the orchard and stop on a fence to get a hickory nut." [...] Taking a rifle from the house, she fired at the squirrel, writing later that, [...] "It was a wonderful shot, going right through the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side".|$|R
500|$|Cheetahs {{kill their}} prey by {{tripping}} {{it during the}} chase; the cheetah can use its strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance. To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it to death. A bite {{on the back of}} the neck or the snout is enough to kill smaller prey. The prey is then taken to a shaded place; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for nearly five to 55 minutes. Groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully, though minor growling may be observed. Cheetahs not involved in hunting will immediately start eating. Cheetah can consume large quantities of food. In a study at the Etosha National Park (Namibia), the cheetah consumed as much as [...] within two hours and stayed close to the remains for 11hours. Cheetah move their <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> so that the sharp carnassial teeth effectively tear the flesh, which can then be swallowed without chewing. They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating.|$|E
500|$|The caracal is {{typically}} nocturnal (active at night), though some activity may be observed {{during the day}} as well. However, the cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that its activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed. A study in South Africa showed that caracals are most active when air temperature drops below activity typically ceases at higher temperatures. A solitary cat, the caracal mainly occurs alone or in pairs; the only group seen is of mothers with their offspring. Females in oestrus will temporarily pair with males. A territorial animal, the caracal marks rocks and vegetation in its territory with urine and probably with dung, which is not covered with soil. Claw scratching is prominent, and dung middens are typically not formed. In Israel, males are found to have territories averaging , while that of females averaged [...] The male territories vary from [...] in Saudi Arabia. In Mountain Zebra National Park (South Africa), the female territories vary between [...] These territories overlap extensively. The conspicuous ear tufts and the facial markings often serve {{as a method of}} visual communication; caracals have been observed interacting with each other by moving the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> so that the tufts flicker rapidly. Like other cats, the caracal meows, growls, hisses, spits and purrs.|$|E
500|$|Nearly 20 {{visual effects}} studios worked on Captain America: Civil War {{including}} Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Dneg, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others. Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr. {{in a scene}} that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, [...] "In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age {{that we wanted to}} target, which was {{around the time of the}} film Less Than Zero [...]" [...] He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision. The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:We visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters. Method Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climatic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-Löbe-Haus, where the Bundestag meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climatic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more [...] "classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look" [...] that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20 minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, [...] "We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them." [...] Luma Pictures, who also worked on Winter Soldier, was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid nanotechnology armor, which was an homage to the character's Bleeding Edge armor from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.|$|E
