40|$|Upgrading {{employee}} {{skill levels}} can generally {{be achieved by}} job training. This article examines the decision makng problem about the firm's selection of job training, and investigate the factor which have influence for the firm to select an appropriate training program. For this examination, this paper classifies job training into two typeson-the-job training and <b>futher</b> training. <b>Futher</b> training comprises off-the-job training in order to upgrade the competency of the incumbent employee, while in-the-job training comprises formal induction training for the new employee and informal training through a system of learning-by-doing. This study suggests the following results. First, once the firm take the investment {{it is clear that}} the firm has incentive to provide in-the-job training for new employees and further training for more senior employees. Second, once the firm has incentive to provide <b>futher</b> training the decision to actually carry out the training will ultimately depend upon such factors asa gap of wage between new employees and senior employees, a difference of training costs between on-the-job training and further training, the discount rate related with training investment. The firm has incentive to provide further training to more new employees, when a wage gap is high, a difference of training costs is low, and the discount rate is low. Thus three factors become important elements of government policy to encourage job training by the firm...|$|E

40|$|The Nb(V) {{reduction}} in acetonitrile, containing up to 10 mM residual water, was investigated {{as a function}} of chloride and Nb(V) concentrations. The effect caused by hydrogen chloride and a proton donor was also examined. Before any electron transfer occurs NbCl 5 initially hydrolyzes resulting in HCl and hydroxy-species, all being in equilibrium. Nb(IV) formed after a monoelectronic reduction can either hydrolyze, yielding an electroinactive species, or, depending on experimental conditions used, dimerize (in TEAP) or disproportionate (in TEACl). <b>Futher</b> reduction of Nb(IV) is possible in tile presence of chloride, which acts as a stabilizing agent. Nb(IV) hydrolysis yields HCl whose reduction wave overlaps with the peaks from <b>futher</b> Nb(IV) reduction. Nb(IV) does not hydrolyze if adequate amounts of HCl and/or TEACl are present in solution. A comparison is made between simulation of the proposed electrode mechanism and experimental data...|$|E
