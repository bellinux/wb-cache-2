Nakano is noted for his ambient style and for using percussion, timbre, and rhythm in his compositions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>electronic</b> <b>organ</b> {{developed}} {{throughout the}} 20th century. Some pipe organs {{were replaced by}} digital organs because of their lower purchase price, smaller physical size, and minimal maintenance requirements. In the early 1970s, Rodgers Instruments pioneered the hybrid organ, an electronic instrument that incorporates real pipes; other builders such as Allen Organs and Johannus Orgelbouw have since built hybrid organs.|$|E
5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space to improvise against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from the rhythm sectionâ€”drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying <b>electronic</b> <b>organ.</b> The evolving {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread misunderstanding {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of the musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>organs,</b> the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than <b>electronic</b> <b>organs,</b> because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|R

50|$|Johannus Orgelbouw is a Dutch {{builder of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> for home and church use, located in Ede, Netherlands. The organ {{manufacturer}} {{was founded in}} 1968 by Johannes (Hans) Versteegt (1928-2011), who had previously designed <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> for Eminent and Viscount. The Johannus prototypes were developed in the facility at Prins Hendriklaan in Ede.|$|R
5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the attic, have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an <b>electronic</b> <b>organ,</b> a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E
5|$|Many soundtracks and {{arranged}} albums of Uematsu's game scores have been released. Pieces from his video game works {{have been performed}} in various Final Fantasy concerts, where he has worked with Grammy Award-winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of these performances. From 2002 to 2010, {{he was in a}} hard rock band with Square Enix colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito called The Black Mages, in which he played <b>electronic</b> <b>organ</b> and other keyboards. The band played various arranged rock versions of Uematsu's Final Fantasy compositions. He has since performed with Earthbound Papas, which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Junya Nakano {{was born}} in Kyoto, Japan. His parents {{introduced}} him to music when he was three years old, offering him lessons in the <b>electronic</b> <b>organ</b> through the Yamaha Music Foundation; they also encouraged him to join some brass bands. After playing the 1979 arcade game Lunar Rescue, he developed an interest in video games and subsequently began to enjoy chiptune music. By frequently listening to the radio, he started composing MIDI music using the NEC PC-9801 in 1985. In 1987, he attended a vocational school to study composition and arrangement in hopes of entering the gaming industry. After graduation, he joined the Kobe branch of Konami in 1991, where he contributed music to eight arcade games with several collaborators over a three-year period. Deciding he wanted to create more original music and {{have a chance to}} receive individual recognition, Nakano left Konami after completing the score for Golfing Greats 2 in 1994.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>organs</b> {{are still}} {{made for the}} home market, {{but they have been}} largely {{replaced}} by the digital keyboard or synthesizer, which is not only smaller and cheaper than typical <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> or traditional pianos, but also far more capable than the most-advanced <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> of earlier years. Modern digital organs, by the same token, are far more advanced in design and capabilities than their ancestors. Today's digital organs have reached a degree of sophistication and complexity surpassed only by the pipe organ itself, and often offer features not found in pipe organs, such as orchestral and percussion sounds, a choice of historical pitch standards and temperaments, and advanced console aids.|$|R

The company went on to produce other products for musical tuning, <b>electronic</b> <b>organs,</b> home security, and keyboards, and later developed and produced electronic and electro-mechanical equipment used in pipe organs.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike later <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> with {{conventional}} tab stops, early Thomas <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> utilized a dial control for their stops, presumably {{to add a}} certain familiarity to its users since the dials worked much like those on a radio or television.

He later started taking lessons with an organist from a Polish church in Rome, New York, where he learned almost exclusively baroque music. Later in high school he learned to play other instruments, including bass clarinet and piano.|$|E
25|$|Jordan {{began his}} career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s, but he became famous {{as one of the}} leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of jump blues, a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically {{performed}} by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan's band also pioneered the use of the <b>electronic</b> <b>organ.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kondo {{was born}} in Nagoya, Japan, on August 13, 1961. He began taking lessons in the <b>electronic</b> <b>organ</b> {{from the age of}} five. He {{improved}} his skills in the instrument in a cover band that played jazz and rock music. Kondo studied at the Art Planning Department of Osaka University of Arts, but was never classically trained or particularly dedicated to music. However, he gained some experience in composing and arranging pieces, using both the piano and a computer to assist him. During his senior year, Nintendo sent a recruitment message to his university stating that they were interested in hiring people dedicated to composition and sound programming. An LCD and arcade gamer, Kondo successfully applied for the job in 1984 without requiring any demo tapes.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Lincoln {{was playing}} bass {{regularly}} for Hammond organist and club owner Djalma Ferreira at the popular Drink Club in Rio de Janeiro. After Ferreira was wounded by a gunshot to the belly (delivered by business rivals), Lincoln {{was taken to}} the club at 5 o'clock in the evening on Friday and directed to learn to play the organ by 9 o'clock when the club opened. Previously, Lincoln had not been allowed to touch the instrument, but he proceeded to teach himself enough of its idiosyncrasies {{that he was able to}} successfully lead Conjunto Drink through a busy evening. Lincoln soon discovered that the Hammond organ allowed him to use his skill at the piano keyboard while bringing the supporting knowledge of his bass line experience to the organ's foot pedals. The <b>electronic</b> <b>organ</b> also provided a new array of synthetic tonalities he could experiment with.|$|E
25|$|An organ was {{installed}} between 1809 and 1811 by George Pike England for {{a cost of}} Â£672. Between 1868 and 1871 the local architects Paley and Austin restored the chancel, and added a new organ chamber and vestry. In 1872 the old organ {{had been replaced by}} a new one in the north aisle. In 1887 a peal of eight new bells, donated by James Williamson, was rung {{for the first time and}} in 1894 a clergy vestry was built adjacent to the choir vestry. A south porch designed by Austin and Paley was added in 1903 and in the same year an outer north aisle with a polygonal apse was built. This aisle forms the memorial chapel to the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment. In 1922 the organ was rebuilt by Harrison & Harrison of Durham. In 1972 the bells were overhauled and re-hung. The pipe organ was replaced in 1982 by an <b>electronic</b> <b>organ</b> made by J.and J.Makin, and in the same year the choir and clergy vestries were converted into a refectory. In 2012 a pipe organ {{was installed}} by David Wells Organ Builder of Liverpool. It restored to use two redundant instruments, now linked into one scheme played from a single detached console. The organ in the west gallery was built originally by Henry Willis for St John's Church, Blackpool in 1915, while the organ in the North Choir Aisle was built by Harrison and Harrison in 1908 for Blackburn Girlsâ€™ School.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} availability of lightweight <b>electronic</b> clonewheel <b>organs</b> in the 1980s and 1990s that emulate {{the sound of}} a heavy, electromechanical Hammond organ, many cities had organ stores which sold large electric and <b>electronic</b> theatre <b>organs</b> and spinet organs made by Hammond, Lowrey and other manufacturers. These organs were sold for use in private homes and in churches; electric and <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> were popular for churches, because they cost significantly less than a pipe organ.|$|R
50|$|Digital organs {{have also}} become a viable {{alternative}} for churches that {{may have had a}} pipe organ and {{can no longer afford to}} maintain it, or for those situations where a pipe organ is not financially possible. Some proponents of pipe organs maintain that digital organs should be regarded as no more than multi-note hi-fi systems, only as durable as standard electronic equipment; while pipe organs, on the other hand, might still be playing without major rebuilding for many decades. Indeed, many fine pipe organs in Europe are centuries old; few <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> anywhere are still in service after 50 years, which is not surprising given most <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> are less than 50 years old. The high initial cost of pipe organs has limited their production, and all-digital and pipe/digital hybrid organs now significantly outsell pipe organs. An additional factor in the popularity of <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> is the small number of pipe organ dealers. Many churches are hundreds of miles from dealers capable of selling, installing and servicing pipe <b>organs.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>organs</b> are simple and inexpensive compared to pipe organs and a professional electrician can easily install and connect the components.|$|R
