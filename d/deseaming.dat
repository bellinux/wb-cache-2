The paper {{provides}} {{the results of}} experimental study of how the technological characteristics (amount of spatter, stability of the welding process) of {{manual metal arc welding}} (MMA) depend upon power supplies providing various kinds of energetic impact upon the electrode metal (inverter power supply, diode rectifier). It was established that inverter power supplies (as they reduce peak loading) provide better quality of welds (more stable process, lower amount of spatter) and this reduces the fabrication cost due to the reduction of <b>deseaming</b> operations, lower welding material consumption as well as improving the service reliability of the welding constructions...|$|E
