40|$|The {{resolution}} {{of problems with}} lease renewals in Fiji, particularly in the sugarcane districts, has ramifications for private investment and growth in the entire economy. The impending withdrawal of subsidies to sugar as world trade is liberalised has increased the urgency of finding solutions to these problems. This paper draws on game theory to characterise the problems facing the Fiji sugar industry. The incentives for land and ethnic politics are identified. Separate proposals are put forward to facilitate secure access to land and to minimise adjustment costs from the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> under the Sugar Protocol. The rationalisation forced upon the sugar industry, if managed well, could induce land reforms that could improve the investment climate and the prospects for growth, whilst minimising pains of adjustment. ...|$|E

Trade preferences for agricultural goods which are granted under these agreements as well as under former arrangements are analyzed by calculating the value of preference margins at several stages {{in the evolution of}} preferences. The total value of preference margins for all countries covered was about â‚¬ 130 million under the agreements in the midseventies and increased by 48 per cent until 1995. It was eroded by about 14 per cent until 2000 due to the reduction of EU MFN tariffs. The extended preferences under the new agreements more than compensate for this <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> and result in a total value of preference margins of â‚¬ 226 million once all agreements have entered into force. preferential trade, preference margin, mediterranean countries, Euro-Mediterranean Agreements, preference erosion, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

Very little is the relevance for Jordanian tomatoes and cucumbers and Moroccan courgettes, cucumbers and artichokes. In the cases of oranges from Egypt, Morocco, Israel and Jordan, preferential EP has not meant potential monetary transfers to these preference-receiver countries.

40|$|The <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> due to {{multilateral}} {{tariff reductions}} is a long-standing concern for many developing countries. This paper {{focuses on the}} erosion of the preferences granted by the EU in the rice industry. Since 2004 there has been a sharp decrease in border protection for the EU rice industry. Because the EU grants trade preferences to a considerable number of rice exporting developing countries, the reform implied preference erosion as well. By addressing the impact of preference erosion on developing countries rice exports to the EU, this paper contributes two original insights to the literature: first, by proposing a new empirical approach to compute the preference margin when tariff rate quotas are in force which {{is based on the assumption}} of the existence of fixed costs and economies of scale in international trade; second, by estimating the trade elasticities of preferences by means of a dynamic panel gravity equation to deal with the issues of endogeneity of preferences and persistency in bilateral trade flows.

40|$|After WTO {{negotiations}} on agriculture were deadlocked for months, a joint European Commission and United States {{proposal for a}} modalities framework galvanised the process. In response, joint proposals by groups of countries and a draft Cancun Ministerial Text prepared by the WTO were circulated. The EC-US compromise and the alternative proposals are analysed with the Agricultural Trade Policy Simulation Model, a static, multi-commodity, multi-region, partial equilibrium trade model. The EC-US compromise market access formula, also adopted in the draft Cancun text, is a rather conservative approach {{more in line with}} the EC’s position. The estimated annual global welfare gains are smaller in the more recent draft Cancun text simulation than in the earlier Harbinson proposal. Producers in developing and least-developed countries would be better off with a more ambitious liberalisation agreement. However, producers in highly protected developed countries stand to lose more from more ambitious scenarios. Since negotiators ’ positions suggest that governments attach a higher weight to producer than to consumer benefits, a possible solution to the impasse lies in switching support in developed countries from border measures to less-trade distorting measures such as direct income support.

40|$|A new {{agreement}} on agriculture in now being negotiated in the WTO and is a key for a successful completion of the Doha Round. Trading with agriculture goods is of great importance to African countries where these products quite often {{account for more than}} 50 per cent of all exports. Since African’s poorest people depend disproportionately high on food products, on the income side {{as well as on the}} expenditure side, negotiations on agriculture are strongly related to poverty and development. Hence, negotiations on agriculture have the highest priority for African negotiators. Analysis of the various proposals using the UNCTAD/FAO Agricultural Trade Policy Simulation Model (ATPSM) shows that most of the benefits from liberalisation accrue to developed countries, which currently have the highest levels of intervention. The group of developing countries, which include both exporters and imports of agricultural products, gain from liberalisation, but those gains are small and unevenly distributed. In fact, net-food importing developing countries and many African countries tend to lose in terms of welfare because of higher world prices. Within developing countries, producers tend to gain from higher world prices at the expense of consumers. Whether the elimination of export subsidies is favourable for African countries depends on the specific product and whether a development policy should more support consumers or producers. Providing compensation to current beneficiaries of European Union support in ACP countries for the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> would be helpful for many African countries.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{especially}} on the positions that the developing countries should take in their own interests {{on the issues of}} manufactures liberalization and administered protection. A series of recommendations are set forth with supporting argument: (1 - 2) for market access, both developed and developing countries should commit to reducing their most restrictive trade barriers, using a formula approach with limited exceptions; (3) negotiated tariff reductions should be phased in over a period of ten years in equal incremental installments; (4) adjustment assistance should be provided by a system of wage insurance and subsidized by transfers from developed countries; (5) the rules for safeguards, countervailing duties, and anti-dumping should be redrafted to focus their use on cases of legitimate economic justification and to discourage their use as protectionist devices; (6) the U. S. and EU should devise and implement a program of comprehensive but declining import restrictions on imports from China consistent with Chinas terms of WTO accession and eliminated by 2008; (7) WTO rules governing Preferential Trading Arrangements should be revised to insure that they contribute to the liberalization and simplification of the multilateral trading system; (8) preference granting countries should provide assistance to countries experiencing the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> due to multilateral liberalization; (9) the WTO system of dispute resolution should remain in place; and (10) special and differential assistance, if granted, should not exempt countries from the provisions for their own market liberalization. Developing countries should participate actively and constructively in the negotiations to further their own interests. Developing countries may be at a disadvantage in the negotiating process, due to their resource limitations and inexperience in negotiations. Offsetting such disadvantages, however, are their large numbers and the compelling case for meeting their needs. What is needed is leadership and cooperation as for example with the Group of 20 and other coalitions together with a willingness to listen and be flexible on the part of their developed country counterparts.

40|$|Some {{developing}} countries may experience important trade losses if tariffs are liberalized on a general most-favored-nation (MFN) basis. Sub-Saharan Africa {{appears to be}} especially vulnerable to this problem. African countries receive important Lome Convention preferences in the European Economic Community (EEC), under which duty-free treatment, or tariffs below MFN and generalized system <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> (GSP) rates, are applied to their exports. Other OECD countries normally apply GSP duties, or even more advantageous"least developed"country preferences to African exports. The proposed Uruguay Round reductions in MFN tariffs will erode those tariff preference margins and cause some African exports to be displaced by other suppliers. The author documents the importance of African countries <b>of</b> existing OECD <b>preference,</b> particularly those <b>of</b> the EEC. More than 95 percent of all African-tariff-line products shipped to the EEC receive duty-free treatment, while other exporters of the same products face tariffs as much as 20 percentage points higher. Similar favorable terms of preferential access also exist in Japan and the United States, although the preference margins are smaller than in the EEC. Using a trade projection model developed by the World Bank and the UNCTAD, the author estimates that eliminating EEC, Japanese, and U. S. MFN tariffs would cause African export losses of about $ 4 billion (estimated present value). The countries {{that seem to be}} most vulnerable to these adverse trade effects are Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. What about the possibility that the losses African countries could experience from <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> tariff <b>preferences</b> could be offset by the liberalization of nontariff measures? The author discounts this likelihood. In general, few important OECD nontariff measures are applied to African products [...] most African textile and clothing exports are even excluded from Multifibre Arrangement restrictions. And those that are applied (such as eco-labeling or licensing requirements) do not restrict trade very much. The author's observations accent the need for action to offset the impact of Africa's loss <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round. What offsetting actions are possible and appropriate? Aggressive reform of the African countries'own trade regimes appears to be the most effective way to counter the effects <b>of</b> the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> OECD <b>preferences.</b> Trade Policy,Economic Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,TF 054105 -DONOR FUNDED OPERATION ADMINISTRATION FEE INCOME AND EXPENSE ACCOUNT,Export Competitiveness...|$|R

40|$|An applied general {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} {{used to assess the}} impact of multilateral trade liberalisation in agriculture, with particular emphasis on developing countries. We use original data, and the model includes some specific features such as a dual labour market. Applied tariffs, including those under preferential regimes and regional agreements, are taken into account at the detailed product level, together with the corresponding bound tariffs on which countries negotiate. The various types of farm support are detailed, and several groups of developing countries are distinguished. Simulations give a contrasted picture of the benefits developing countries would draw from the Doha development round. The results suggest that previous studies have neglected preferential agreements and the binding overhang (in tariffs as well as domestic support), and have treated developing countries with a high level of aggregation and been excessively optimistic about the actual benefits of multilateral trade liberalisation.

40|$|The European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States (US) have {{recently}} announced initiatives to improve market access for the poorest countries. The authors {{assess the impact}} on Sub-Saharan Africa of these initiatives, and others that might be taken. They find that fully unrestricted {{access to all the}} Quad countries (Canada, The EU, Japan, and the US) would produce substantial gains for Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to a fourteen percent increase in non-oil exports ($ 2. 5 billion), and boosting real incomes by about one percent ($ 1. 8 billion). Most of these gains would come from preferential access to the highly protected Japanese, and European agricultural markets, especially the heavily protected Japanese market for meat, and certain cereal grains. The smallness of Sub-Saharan Africa's trade ensures that the costs of trade diversion for the Quad, other developing countries, and the world, would be on the whole, negligible. One concern, however, is that preferential access to protected markets might lead Sub-Saharan Africa to produce goods in which it does not have a global comparative advantage, and the future <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> these <b>preferences</b> might lead to adjustment costs.

The paper concludes that: i) South-South regional RIAs should further reduce their external trade barriers; ii) the trade component of the Cotonou Agreement is likely to harm the ACP countries, and these should liberalize their trade regime in order to reduce the size of transfers from the ACP countries to the EU; iii) small states should sign FTAs with the rest of the OECD and pursue multilateral liberalization; iv) small states and other developing countries should intensify SouthSouth regional cooperation in the area of regional public goods; and v) the EU and other OECD countries should provide country-specific technical assistance for behind the border reforms in small statessomething specified in the Cotonou Agreement for ACP countries [...] as well as assistance in implementing their WTO commitments.

40|$|Exports in the Middle Eastern {{countries}} should increase from $ 800 million to $ 900 million {{as a result}} of the tariff cuts agreed on in the Uruguay Round, according to the author. This represents an annual expansion of less than 1 percent. Projected gains are small because the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> tariff <b>preferences</b> that Middle Eastern countries received in OECD markets offset the positive effects of reduced most-favored-nation tariffs on nonpreference-receiving products. And petroleum, the main Middle Eastern export [...] which generally faces zero or low tariffs [...] is unaffected by the Uruguay Round reductions. Egypt's projected gains (about $ 20 million, or under 0. 5 percent of total exports) are concentrated largely in agricultural exports to the European Union and manufactures in the United States. Israel should experience net trade losses because <b>of</b> the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> its free trade preferences in the European Union and the United States. The Uruguay Round made major progress in removing nontariff barriers that Middle Eastern exports face, especially in agriculture, textiles, and clothing. But with the removal of the Multifibre Arrangement, international trade in textiles and clothing will become much more competitive. Middle Eastern countries must adopt measures to cut costs and increase efficiency to remain viable exporters. As a result of what was achieved in the Uruguay Round, the average OECD nontariff barrier coverage ration for Middle Eastern exports should fall from a current 10 percent to between 1 and 2 percent. Net food importing countries could be adversely affected by the higher international food prices expected to result from the Uruguay Round agreement. There is a clear priority for net food importers to adopt reforms stimulating domestic production. Prospects for increased trade in the Middle East are constrained by the similar comparative advantages and export profiles of many Middle Eastern countries. The most favorable prospects for intraregional trade appear to be between countries such as Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon, and Turkey [...] net energy importers [...] and the rest of the region.

40|$|Increased {{market access}} from Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) promised by policy makers is often diluted by {{preferential}} {{rules of origin}} (ROO). This paper discusses two policy options one direct, and one indirect [...] with regard to limiting the impact of NAFTA ROO on trade, and illustrates the impact on GDP and welfare of these options using a computable general equilibrium methodology. The first (direct) option, moving toward a North American Customs Union (CU) instead of the current NAFTA, would basically {{eliminate the need for}} preferential ROO among members of the CU. The second (indirect) policy option is to pursue multilateral trade negotiations and reduce MFN tariffs towards zero. In this context, NAFTA ROO would lack both relevance and impact, even if they remained on the books, because tariff preference utilization among NAFTA members would virtually disappear. The current stalemate at the WTO Doha round suggests that a North American CU remains a serious policy option. However, the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA tariff <b>preferences</b> since the phase-in of the Uruguay round has also reduced the distortionary impacts of NAFTA ROO, somewhat limiting the gains that a CU could bring.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic effects <b>of</b> the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>preferences,</b> {{with a focus}} on the export of Caribbean bananas to Europe. Estimates are made of the magnitude of implicit assistance provided over a period of three decades to eastern Caribbean countries through banana trade <b>preferences.</b> The value <b>of</b> such assistance rose until the early 1990 s, and has declined precipitously since then. Using vector autoregressive analysis, the paper finds that changes in the level of implicit assistance have had a considerable macroeconomic impact, especially on Caribbean real GDP growth.
