5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the prefect of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian. In an act of clementia <b>denoted</b> <b>by</b> the epitomator Aurelius Victor as unusual, Diocletian did not kill or depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian prefect and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later gave him the proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban prefect for 295. The other figures who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.|$|E
5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, <b>denoted</b> <b>by</b> dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E

5|$|The wave-like {{nature of}} the {{electron}} allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as {{would be the case}} for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly <b>denoted</b> <b>by</b> the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E

Deaths in parentheses will be additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still related to that storm. Damage and deaths will include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low, and all of the damage figures are in 1987 USD.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} coursed on open land, the Irish form is {{run in a}} secure {{enclosure}} over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase the hare. After the coursing event, the hares are transported {{back to where they}} were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run with dogs winning points for their running and turning of the hare, the Republic of Ireland form is run on the basis that the first dog to turn the hare wins. This is <b>denoted</b> <b>by</b> either a red flag or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.|$|E
