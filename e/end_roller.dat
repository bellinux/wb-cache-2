50|$|The Kelvin Hall, {{which is}} named after Lord Kelvin, stands {{on the banks of}} the River Kelvin {{opposite}} the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in the West End of Glasgow. It was designed to complement the municipal display of Kelvingrove Park, in particular the nearby Gallery and Museum.Fronted in red-sandstone with a palatial entrance piazza the immense steel-framed building dates from 1927. Its predecessor on part of the site, also known as the Kelvin Hall, was constructed on the cinder-based football areas of the Bunhouse Grounds, owned by the Incorporation of Bakers of Glasgow, as a temporary hall using brick, wood and iron, and was opened in August 1918 to house the second British Industries Fair in the city. The new structure was designed by Robert James Walker, the leading architect of the Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry of 1911 held in Kelvingrove Park. The hall was then taken over by the military authorities as a clothing store. As soon as it was released in 1919 the Corporation of Glasgow bought it and the adjacent government building, formerly the indoor West <b>End</b> <b>Roller</b> Skating Rink which also housed flower shows and community exhibitions, used from 1914 for the manufacture of munitions on the remainder of the Bunhouse Grounds, all upon the site of the timber-constructed Machinery Exhibition Hall of the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901 centred on Kelvingrove Park. From 1918 and 1919 until the Hall was destroyed by fire in 1925, British Industry Fairs and various exhibitions, were held, also flower shows, circuses and carnivals, with the surpluses being paid into the Common Good.The new Kelvin Hall covers 6 acres and was designed to house large-scale exhibitions and events. It was built for Glasgow Corporation in 1926-1927 and was designed by Thomas Somers Glasgow's Master of Work and City Engineer, assisted by Thomas Gilchrist Gilmour. Thomas Somers also designed the new bridge over the Clyde at Oswald Street, known as the King George V Bridge, which was also declared open by King George V on the same day, 12 July 1927.|$|E

If a bar is used, it is assumed to have a uniform cross-section, but not {{necessarily}} rectangular, {{as long as there}} are no overhanging contours, i.e. positive draft. Such bars are often formed by extrusion. The material to be shaped is suspended between the <b>rollers.</b> The <b>end</b> <b>rollers</b> support the bottomside of the bar and have a matching contour (inverse shape) to it in order to maintain the cross-sectional shape. Likewise, the middle roller is forced against the topside of the bar and has a matching contour to it.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: There is an {{abundance}} of quantitative and medical research promoting the benefits of exercise for people with epilepsy. However, the psychosocial barriers and benefits of exercising for the sportsperson/people with epilepsy (SWE) are absent. This research aims to present the narratives of SWE over time and as a result, develop further understanding of the psychosocial impact of exercising with epilepsy. Method: A holistic-content and structural narrative analysis were used to explore the exercise experiences of three SWE {{over the course of}} one year. A creative non-fictional technique was used to present first person narratives, therefore providing the SWE's voice for the reader. Results: Narratives of ‘vicious cycle’ and ‘roller coaster’ presented complex and multi-thematic storied forms, with time and the hidden nature of epilepsy having a strong impact on narrative formation. Vicious cycle presented the cycle of desiring to exercise, but prevented from exercising because of uncontrolled seizures. This resulted in frustration and feelings of a lack of control, which subsequently increased the desire to exercise and created a cycle with no clear <b>end.</b> <b>Roller</b> coaster presented the constant psychosocial and physical undulations that epilepsy can create for a SWE over time. Conclusion: These narratives reveal that exercising with epilepsy has a constant and on-going positive and negative impact on the life of SWE. However, these narratives also show that it may be through the process of acceptance of their body's limitations that a healthier mental and physical state may result for the SWE...|$|E

40|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>ends</b> forced-contact and overmuch roll {{consumption}} are {{the widespread}} problems in temper rolling process of thin strip for two-stand UCM temper mill. Fully thinking {{the equipment and}} technology characteristics of UCM temper mill, we took the newly-built 1220 UCM temper mill of Baosteel as the research object in this paper. A model of <b>roller</b> <b>ends</b> forced-contact and a calculation model of flatness for UCM temper mill are established after {{a great deal of}} site tracing and theoretical researches. On this basis, an optimal mathematical model of roll shape which is suited for UCM temper mill is developed. Working roll curve is the combination of cosine curve and high order curve. The cosine subentry is used to control edge wave, the high order curve subentry is used to control <b>roller</b> <b>ends</b> forced-contact. Furthermore, the chamfering curve of middle <b>roller</b> <b>end</b> is optimized. Those are the innovations. Through the above-mentioned technology, pressure distribution between rollers caused by the shift of middle roll becomes more homogeneous, pressure peak disappeared, working life of roll is improved effectively as well. Relevant technologies have been used to the practice of 1220 UCM temper mill of Baosteel and have achieved good use effects, which is of further extending application value [1]...|$|R
50|$|Neglecting {{clearance}} {{and assuming}} perfect accuracy, the engagement of bearing gears {{is aimed at}} maximum rolling with minimum sliding friction of conjugated profiles in movement. <b>End</b> <b>rollers</b> limit the gears radial shift at their contact points {{so that when the}} gears are engaged, slip-free rolling motion of their conjugated pairs is achieved. Adjacent end faces of teeth and rollers limit the axial shift of conjugated bearing gears in plane-parallel motion. In such a way, using bearing gears as sun, ring and more than two satellites uniformly distributed among them the entire gear bearing is arranged, and carrier may be used instead of ring or sun gearwheels, or it may act as a frame unit and transfer rotation from the satellites, whereas limitation of carrier degrees of freedom would form redundant constraints or serve as an additional basis for force distribution in the mechanism. In case less than three bearing satellite gearwheels are involved, at least axles of movable sun and/or of ring bearing gearwheels should be fixed relative to housing parts.|$|R
50|$|Spherical roller {{bearings}} have an outer ring with an internal spherical shape. The rollers are thicker {{in the middle}} and thinner at the <b>ends.</b> Spherical <b>roller</b> bearings can thus accommodate both static and dynamic misalignment. However, spherical rollers are difficult to produce and thus expensive, and the bearings have higher friction than an ideal cylindrical or tapered roller bearing since there will be a certain amount of sliding between rolling elements and rings.|$|R

50|$|The Racer is an out {{and back}} roller coaster design {{featuring}} two identical tracks that run parallel to each other. The design allows for two trains to race {{in similar fashion}} from start to finish. A unique design element that wasn't prevalent in 1972 was the splitting apart of both tracks into separate, standalone structures that rejoin again near the <b>end.</b> Previously, racing <b>roller</b> coasters were typically designed with both tracks remaining side-by-side throughout the entire course of the ride.|$|R
50|$|Needle roller {{bearings}} use {{very long and}} thin cylinders. Often the <b>ends</b> of the <b>rollers</b> taper to points, and these are used to keep the rollers captive, {{or they may be}} hemispherical and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since the rollers are thin, the outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, the small-diameter rollers must bend sharply where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.|$|R
40|$|Based on lots {{of field}} {{experiments}} and theoretical research, fully thinking {{the equipment and}} production craft characters of four high cold mill, a new cambering scheme for four high cold mill is advanced in this paper. This scheme considered the need of production of multi-specification products, {{as well as the}} control of <b>roller</b> <b>ends</b> contact. The most homogeneous transverse distribution of front tension is the control target and the homogeneous pressure distribution between rollers is the constraint condition. In this technology, working roll curve adapt the combination of cosine curve and high order curve, backup roll adapt the combination of cosine curve, straight line and high order curve. The cosine subentry of working roll and the high order curve subentry are used to control edge wave, the high order curve subentry of working roll is used to control the roll contact, the cosine subentry of backup roll is used to reduce the center wave. That’s the features of this technology. On-site testing shows that the new cambering and combination can not only manage the complex waves of normal four high cold mill effectively, but also will reduce the contact between <b>roller</b> <b>ends</b> and minish roll consumption. This technology has created economic benefits for enterprises...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an autonomous robot for painting the interior walls of buildings. The robot consists of a painting arm with an <b>end</b> effector <b>roller</b> that scans the walls vertically and a mobile platform to give horizontal feed to paint the whole area of the wall. The painting arm has a planar twolink mechanism with two joints. Joints are driven from a stepping motor through a ball screw-nut mechanism. Four ultrasonic sensors are attached to the mobile platform and used to maintain a certain distance from the facing wall and to avoid collision with side walls. When settled on adjusted distance from the wall, the controller starts the painting process autonomously. Simplicity, relatively low weight and short painting time were considered in our design. Different modules constituting the robot have been separately tested then integrated. Experiments have shown successfulness of the robot in its intended tasks.

Moreover, the application of constant current for a speed interval around the critical speed enables a smooth run-up or run-down without crossing any resonance. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Free undamped {{in-plane}} vibrations of shear undeformable beams {{around their}} highly buckled configurations are investigated neglecting rotary inertia effects. The beams are inertially nonuniform since a lumped mass is rigidly clamped along the span. Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} boundary conditions in the post-buckling phases. First, the beam is considered inextensible because it is hinged {{at one end and}} is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other <b>end,</b> a <b>roller</b> support, both in the buckling and post-buckling phases. In the second model, the beam is extensible in the post-buckling phase because the roller support boundary is changed into a fixed hinged end. Free undamped vibrations are governed, in the first case, by a homogeneous integral-partial-differential equation and, in the second case. by two coupled partial-differential equations with variable coefficients. The solutions of the associated eigenvalue problems are found employing two approaches: a semi-analytical method based on Galerkin discretization and a finite element method. A close agreement in the outcomes is found. The leading differences relating to the natural frequencies and linear normal modes of the two pre-stressed Curved beam models are discussed; in particular, the occurrence of the veering phenomenon and the crossovers are Outlined...|$|R
