Samples used in this study are 71 manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange during years 2010 - 2012. Methods of statistical analysis used multiple regresion using the program SPSS 16.

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, {{we do not}} know the {{functional}} significance of most sex <b>differences</b> in the brain.

Nevertheless, there are still considerable <b>differences.</b> Small municipalities have higher TFRs than large cities. This article aims to answer the question whether these <b>differences</b> will decline further until <b>differences</b> between large and small cities disappear. For that purpose we develop a regression model of regional <b>differences</b> in the TFR including demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural variables. Using the estimation results we decompose <b>differences</b> in fertility between large and small cities into the contribution of <b>differences</b> in levels of the determinants versus <b>differences</b> in the relationships between the determinants and fertility. The results show that <b>differences</b> in cultural variables have a larger effect on <b>differences</b> in the TFR than the demographic and socioeconomic variables. As cultural <b>differences</b> do not tend to change quickly, they will not lead to quick changes in regional <b>differences</b> in the TFR. Demographic <b>differences</b> are not expected to lead to strong changes either, as the two demographic variables (household structure and ethnic structure) have opposite effects. As the effect of the socioeconomic variable is caused by <b>differences</b> in the magnitude of the regression coefficient rather than by <b>differences</b> in the value of this variable, even if <b>differences</b> in this variable disappeared, this would still not lead to convergence of the TFR. Thus the article concludes that <b>differences</b> in the TFR between large and small cities are not likely to diminish quickly. ...|$|R
