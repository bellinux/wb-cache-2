40|$|By {{spreading}} phases on {{the unit}} circle, desynchronization algorithm is a powerful tool to achieve round-robin scheduling, which is crucial in applications as diverse as media access control of communication networks, realization of analog-to-digital converters, and scheduling of traffic flows in intersections. Driven by the increased application of pulse-coupled oscillators in achieving synchronization, desynchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators is also receiving more attention. In this paper, we propose a phase desynchronization algorithm by rigorously analyzing the dynamics of pulse-coupled oscillators and carefully designing the pulse based interaction function. A systematic proof for convergence to phase desynchronization is also given. Different from many existing results which can only achieve <b>equal</b> <b>separation</b> of firing time instants, the proposed approach can achieve <b>equal</b> <b>separation</b> of phases, which {{is more difficult to}} achieve due to phase jumps in pulse-coupled oscillators. Furthermore, the new strategy can guarantee achievement of desynchronization even when some nodes have identical initial phases, a situation which fails most existing desynchronization approaches. Numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. Comment: 8 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

Depending {{on the length of}} the strips and separation between them, the HEE exhibits first order “geometric ” phase transitions between bulk minimal surfaces with different topologies. We study these different phases and display various phase diagrams. For confining geometries with m strips, we find new classes of “disconnected ” bulk minimal surfaces, and the resulting phase diagrams have a rich structure. We also study the “entanglement plateau ” transition, where we consider the BTZ black hole in global coordinates with 2 strips. It is found that there are 4 bulk minimal surfaces, and the resulting phase diagram is displayed. We perform a general perturbative analysis of the m-strip system: including perturbing the CFT and perturbing the length or separation of the strips. ar X i...|$|R

40|$|The {{property}} of desynchronization in an all-to-all network of homogeneous impulse-coupled oscillators is studied. Each impulse-coupled oscillator is modeled as a hybrid {{system with a}} single timer state that self-resets to zero when it reaches a threshold, at which event all other impulse-coupled oscillators adjust their timers following a common reset law. In this setting, desynchronization is considered as each impulse-coupled oscillator's timer having <b>equal</b> <b>separation</b> between successive resets. We show that, for the considered model, desynchronization is an asymptotically stable property. For this purpose, we recast desynchronization as a set stabilization problem and employ Lyapunov stability tools for hybrid systems. Furthermore, several perturbations are considered showing that desynchronization is a robust property. Perturbations on both the continuous and discrete dynamics are considered. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the main contributions.

Eleven {{of them have been}} clarified predominantly due to the excited state, and six of them are concluded to be nearly exclusively resulting from the ground-state wave-packet motion.

40|$|As {{development}} of CubeSat based architectures increase, methods of deploying constellations of CubeSats {{are required to}} increase functionality of future systems. Given their low cost and quickly increasing launch opportunities, large numbers of CubeSats can easily be developed and deployed in orbit. However, as secondary payloads, CubeSats are severely limited in their options for deployment into appropriate constellation geometries. This thesis examines the current methods for deploying cubes and proposes new and efficient geometries using secondary launch opportunities. Due to the current deployment hardware architecture, only the use of different launch opportunities, deployment direction, and deployment timing for individual cubes in a single launch are explored. The deployed constellations are examined for <b>equal</b> <b>separation</b> of Cubes in a single plane and effectiveness of ground coverage of two regions. The regions examined are a large near-equatorial zone and a medium sized high latitude, high population density zone. Results indicate that simple deployment strategies can be utilized to provide significant CubeSat dispersion to create efficient constellation geometries. The same deployment strategies {{can be used to}} develop a multitude of differently dispersed constellations. Different launch opportunities can be utilized to tailor a constellation for a specific region or mission objective. Constellations can also be augmented using multiple launch opportunities to optimize a constellation towards a specific mission or region.

It is believed {{that the number of}} axons, their size and shape are essential in understanding the normal or abnormal, the developing or aging, as well as the injured or diseased brains. Therefore, a quantitative knowledge of the number of axons, as well as their size and shape, is essential in understanding the rain. A method that automates the analysis of axon imagesis presented. The heart of our system relies on a segmentation scheme called the active contour model (snake). Though the framework of snake has already been established, a number of unresolved issues remains for practical applications. Specifically, we have addressed three problems associated with the analysis of the axon images : (1) initialization of snakes; (2) energy functional formulation and (3) elimination of false alarms. A transform approach, based on a piecewise elliptical contour approximation to the axon boundaries, is proposed to locate an interior point for each axon, thereby serving as a clue for snake initialization. An energy functional favoring <b>equal</b> <b>separation</b> between the inner and outer boundaries is formulated to facilitate the detection of outer boundaries. False alarms are eliminated by means of a conflict resolution scheme which is reduced to an optimization problem implemented as O-l integer programming.
