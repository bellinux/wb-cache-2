50|$|Commercial photo quality {{printing}} uses a web or {{sheet fed}} press that may consist of multiple units. The file to be printed is imaged directly onto a drum {{on the press}} or onto photographic printing plates. The drum or plates transfer ink to the paper.Photo quality printing on a <b>desktop</b> <b>printer</b> usually uses some type of inkjet or laser printer. The inkjet printer has ink cartridges that place the ink directly on the paper. These are self-contained units connected to a computer through cables.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} the price {{penetration}} strategy is the bait and hook model (also called the razor and blades business model). A starter product is sold at a very low price but requires more expensive replacements (such as refills) which are sold at a higher price. It is an almost universal tactic in the <b>desktop</b> <b>printer</b> business, with printers selling in the US {{for as little as}} $100 including two ink cartridges (often half-full), which themselves cost around $30 each to replace. Thus, the company makes more money from the cartridges than it does for the printer itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} cricut machine had cutting mats of 6 × 12 inches, {{the larger}} Cricut Expression only allows mats of 12 × 12 and 12 × 24. The largest machine will produce letters from {{a half inch}} to 23 inches high. Both the Cricut and Cricut Expression require mats and blades which can be adjusted to cut through various types of paper, vinyl and other sheet products. The Cricut personal paper cutter operates as a paper cutter based upon cutting parameters programmed into the machine, and resembles a <b>desktop</b> <b>printer.</b> Cricut Cake produces stylized edible fondants cut into various shapes from fondant sheets, and is used by chefs in the preparation and ornamentation of cakes.|$|E
50|$|Today printed {{pages are}} usually {{produced}} by outputting an electronic file to a printing device, {{such as a}} <b>desktop</b> <b>printer</b> or a modern printing press. These electronic files may for example be Microsoft Word, PDF or QXD files. They will usually already incorporate the instructions for pagination, among other formatting instructions. Pagination encompasses rules and algorithms for deciding where page breaks will fall, which depend partly on cultural considerations about which content belongs on the same page: for example one may try to avoid widows and orphans. Some systems are more sophisticated than others in this respect. Before the rise of information technology (IT), pagination was a manual process: all pagination was decided by a human. Today, most pagination is performed by machines, although humans often override particular decisions (e.g. by inserting a hard page break).|$|E
50|$|A card printer is an {{electronic}} <b>desktop</b> <b>printer</b> with single card feeders which print and personalize plastic cards. In this respect they differ from, for example, label printers {{which have a}} continuous supply feed. Card dimensions are usually 85.60 × 53.98 mm, standardized under ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1. This format is also used in EC-cards, telephone cards, European Union driver's licenses and health insurance cards. This {{is commonly known as}} the bank card format. Card printers are controlled by corresponding printer drivers or by means of a specific programming language. Generally card printers are designed with laminating, striping, and punching functions, and use desktop or web-based software. The hardware features of a card printer differentiate a card printer from the more traditional printers, as ID cards are usually made of PVC plastic and require laminating and punching. Different card printers can accept different card thickness and dimensions.|$|E

50|$|Advances {{in the art}} of {{facsimile}} {{are closely}} related to advances in printmaking. Maps, for instance, were the focus of early explorations in making facsimiles, although these examples often lack the rigidity to the original source that is now expected. An early example is the Abraham Ortelius map (1598). Innovations during the 18th century, especially in the realms of lithography and aquatint, facilitated an explosion in the number of facsimiles of old master drawings that could be studied from afar. In the past, a technique such as the photostat, hectograph, or lithograph was usually used to create facsimiles. More recently, facsimiles have been made by the use of some form of photographic technique. For documents, a facsimile most often refers to document reproduction by a photocopy machine. In the digital age, an image scanner, a personal computer, and a <b>desktop</b> <b>printer</b> {{can be used to make}} a facsimile.|$|E
30|$|If 3 D {{printing}} technology is seriously {{adopted in the}} fashion industry, the complex steps during the conventional process of clothing production, i.e.,—designing,—patterning,—sewing,—sampling,—modification,—production,—and—sales,—can be reduced and simplified to designing,—modeling,—printing,—and—sales. This will {{increase the number of}} individual designers and entrepreneurs who design and sell independently. This study has examined the problems which arise during the process of designing and manufacturing by individuals who use the most accessible 3 D printer in terms of price and size, i.e., the FDM type <b>desktop</b> <b>printer,</b> to make their items, after which several suggestions to improve those problems were proposed.|$|E
40|$|Poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene) -alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) hybrid {{polymers}} (PPE-PPV) are {{a special}} class of materials of organic electronics. Due {{to the presence}} of triple bonds in the chemical polyvinylene system they yield both a high electron affinity and a high photoluminescence quantum yield. PPE-PPV copolymers are thus considered suitable candidates for both photovoltaic and optoelectronic (lighting) applications. This paper concentrates on an isomeric pair of PPE-PPV co-polymers (P 8 - 18 and P 18 - 8) which were put to a formulation inkjet-printable with a Dimatix DMP- 2831 multi-nozzle <b>desktop</b> <b>printer.</b> For the isomeric pair, the photophysical properties {{and the quality of the}} printed layers were studied by confocal epifluorescence microscopy.

40|$|In this paper, the {{feedforward}} controller design {{problem for}} high-precision electromechanical servo systems that execute finite time tasks is addressed. The presented procedure combines {{the selection of}} the fixed structure of the feedforward controller and the optimization of the controller parameters by iterative trials. A linear parametrization of the feedforward controller in a two-degree-of-freedom control architecture is chosen, which results in a feedforward controller that is applicable to a class of motion profiles as well as in a convex optimization problem, with the objective function being a quadratic function of the tracking error. Optimization by iterative trials avoids the need for detailed knowledge of the plant, achieves the controller parameter values that are optimal with respect to the actual plant, and allows for the adaptation to possible variations that occur in the plant dynamics. Experimental results on a high-precision wafer stage and a <b>desktop</b> <b>printer</b> illustrate the procedure...|$|E
3000|$|... 3 D {{printing}} {{technology has been}} developing rapidly and is now widely used in various fields. However, the utilization of this technology in fashion products has been relatively slow. Therefore, in this study, we attempt to determine {{the limitations of the}} 3 D printed clothing production process and suggest complementary measures to offset those limitations. To attain these goals, we created actual clothes using a FDM type 3 D <b>desktop</b> <b>printer,</b> which is a commonly used type. Three different types of 3 D printed clothes were produced based on certain geometric shapes using TPU or ABS as printing materials. The limitations of the materials, the modeling programs and the printing, manufacturing and wearing processes were examined, and several suggestions to overcome each of the limitations were presented. Based on this research, it is expected that more diverse and active attempts to utilize 3 D technology will be pursued by those who develop various fashion products.|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{polyaniline}} (PANI) nanodispersions doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) were synthesized {{and successfully}} inkjet-printed using a piezoelectric <b>desktop</b> <b>printer.</b> This paper examines the optimization and {{characterization of the}} nanoparticulate formulation for optimal film electrochemistry and stability. PANI nanoparticle synthesis was optimized {{in terms of the}} ratio of monomer (aniline) to oxidant (ammonium persulphate, APS) and dopant (DBSA). Particle size, UV&# 8722;vis spectroscopy, electrochemical, and conductivity analyses were performed on all materials. Optimal synthesis conditions were found to be at a molar ratio of 1. 0 : 0. 5 : 1. 2 aniline/APS/DBSA. This resulting nanodispersion showed a uniform particle size distribution of &# 8764; 82 nm, and UV&# 8722;vis analysis indicated a high doping level. These synthetic conditions resulted in the highest conductivity, and the electrochemistry of the resulting films was well-defined and stable. Surface tension analysis and rheological studies demonstrated that the aqueous nanodispersions were suitable for inkjet printing. Successful inkjet printing of these polyaniline nanoparticulate formulations is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Endeavoring to {{push the}} {{boundaries}} of microfabrication with shrinkable polymers, we have developed a sequential shrink photolithography process. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by rapidly fabricating plastic microlens arrays. First, we create a mask out of the children's toy Shrinky Dinks by simply printing dots using a standard <b>desktop</b> <b>printer.</b> Upon retraction of this pre-stressed thermoplastic sheet, the dots shrink to a fraction of their original size, which we then lithographically transfer onto photoresist-coated commodity shrink wrap film. This shrink film reduces in area by 95 % when briefly heated, creating smooth convex photoresist bumps down to 30 μm. Taken together, this sequential shrink process provides a complete process to create microlenses, with an almost 99 % reduction in area from the original pattern size. Finally, with a lithography molding step, we emboss these bumps into optical grade plastics such as cyclic olefin copolymer for functional microlens arrays. © 2011 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} is {{a viable}} method for rapid and low-cost manufacturing of flexible sensors. In this paper, we study a technique for inkjet printing of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) strips. A low-cost inkjet <b>desktop</b> <b>printer</b> {{is used for the}} fabrication of PEDOT: PSS resistive strips on polyimide substrates. Accounting for several geometries of printed PEDOT: PSS strips, we assess the variability of the fabrication process. Owing to the printing process, we can easily choose the width, length, and thickness. We found that printed strips on polyimide foils show a conductivity equal to 115 S/cm, which linearly increases with the strip thickness. The maximum variability is lower than 13 %. The frequency analysis shows a purely resistive impedance in the frequency range investigated (100 Hz- 100 kHz). Moreover, the strips folded up to 1000 times shows a resistance variation lower than 6 %. The study demonstrates that inkjet printing {{is a viable}} method for the simple, fast, reliable, and low-cost fabrication of PEDOT:PSS-based sensors on plastic substrates and circuit interconnections...|$|E
30|$|This {{design as}} {{research}} was limited {{because of the}} shortcomings of the MakerBot Replicator 2 3 D <b>Desktop</b> <b>printer.</b> The research was further limited {{by the size of}} build plate and type of filament used in addition to the challenges of learning the engineering-based CAD software Rhinoceros 5. Kwon et al. (2017) also reported difficulties in quickly learning Rhinoceros. Because the MakerBot prints with only PLA or ABS filaments, consideration of other durable (washable) and sustainable materials is necessary for future research. Future researchers could also explore other research variables including layer height, printing speed and quality, infill, number of shells, and extruder temperature, or other printers and materials. These may affect zero-waste achievements. Other sustainability issues related to 3 D printing include emission of toxic gases and use of electric power and heat generation, issues that are {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. Such research could help this technology to storm the fashion world. Finally, although the authors were able to explore and design notions and jewelry, exploration of other available technologies and materials will facilitate further research in the area of producing sustainable, zero-waste 3 D fashion items.|$|E
