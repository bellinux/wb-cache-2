5|$|Oil sands in Alberta have {{a proven}} reserve of , {{the second largest}} proven {{reserves}} of crude oil in the world. They have become the largest source of oil imported into the United States. With significant economic development and investment into the oil sands, the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> been enjoying strong support by both the province's government and the federal government. However, the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} bitumen exploitation. While the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe parametrically {{estimate}} total-factor {{energy efficiency}} (TFEE) scores for 10 industries in 14 developed countries {{for the period}} 1995 - 2005 using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) technique. The model includes four inputs (labor, capital stock, energy, and non-energy intermediate inputs) and one output (value added). Unlike previous studies that use data envelopment analysis (DEA), our method can take into account statistical noises. The results show that More {{than half of the}} <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> insignificant changes in the inefficiency trend. However, construction, paper, and textile <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> significantly increasing inefficiency (decreasing efficiency). The metal industry is the only <b>industry</b> which <b>has</b> decreasing inefficiency (increasing efficiency). As a result, most of the OECD <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> much room in improving their total-factor energy efficiency.

Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories.
