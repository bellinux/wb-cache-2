5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member}} of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E
500|$|In May 1903, Trueblood {{became the}} subject of {{national}} media attention {{as a result of a}} newspaper article written by a 17-year-old freshman student claiming Trueblood was teaching a new [...] "course in lovemaking." [...] The student, Jam Handy, was a campus correspondent for the Chicago Tribune. In the class, Trueblood taught [...] "the delivery of short extracts from masterpieces of oratory." [...] One such extract involved a scene from a play in which a man kneels in front of a woman pleading for <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> 1893 textbook Practical Elements of Elocution, Trueblood used the scene to illustrate the [...] "aspirate explosive" [...] form of speech.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cover story}} of the January 15, 2015, issue, titled What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women proved controversial, due to both its illustration, {{described}} as [...] "the cartoon of a faceless female in spiky red heels, having her dress lifted up by a cursor arrow," [...] and its content, described as [...] "a 5,000-word article on the creepy, sexist culture of the tech industry." [...] Among those offended by the cover were Today Show co-host Tamron Hall, who commented [...] "I think it’s obscene and just despicable, honestly." [...] Newsweek editor in chief James Impoco explained [...] "We {{came up with an}} image that we felt represented what that story said about Silicon Valley ... If people get angry, they should be angry." [...] The article's author, Nina Burleigh, asked, [...] "Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Babson College's Diana Report {{found that}} the number of women {{partners}} in VC firms decreased from 10% in 1999 to 6% in 2014. The report also found that 97% of VC-funded businesses had male chief executives, and that businesses with all-male teams were more than four times as likely to receive VC funding compared to teams with at least one woman. More than 75% of VC firms in the US did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed. It was found that a greater fraction of VC firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies. For comparison, a UC Davis study focusing on large public companies in California found 49.5% with at least one female board seat. When the latter results were published, some San Jose Mercury News readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause. In a follow-up Newsweek article, Nina Burleigh asked [...] "Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?" ...|$|E
