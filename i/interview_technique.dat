25|$|In late 2008, New Labour {{replaced}} Incapacity Benefit with Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for new {{claims and}} yet another eligibility test was introduced: the Work Capability Assessment. At the same time, capacity was boosted by bringing in nurses {{to carry out the}} bulk of the medical assessments using a new semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>technique,</b> with the findings recorded in digital format. This meant that from 2008, most new claims were scrutinised by a healthcare professional; those whose claims reached the threshold for eligibility were granted ESA - either shortly after the initial assessment, following an internal review of the initial decision, or after an external appeal.|$|E

2500|$|McDonald {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the satirical [...] "ambush" [...] <b>interview</b> <b>technique,</b> which was founded on his {{considerable}} improvisational acting skills and precise comic timing. The [...] "Gunston Method" [...] relied on the fact that, especially {{in the early days of}} the series, the Norman persona was still relatively unknown in his home country, and completely unknown outside Australia. Thus, he was successfully able to hide behind the guise of a fully rounded and highly plausible character who appears to be stupid in order to throw his otherwise media-savvy quarry off their guard. This caused various results, from hilarity (Sally Struthers and Cheech and Chong), to clever play-alongs like Muhammad Ali ("I'm punchy – what's your excuse?") to bewilderment (Warren Beatty), to complete outrage (Rudolf Nureyev, Michael Cole).|$|E
