50|$|Biodegradable {{technology}} is especially utilized by the bio-medical community. Biodegradable polymers are classified into three groups:medical, ecological, and <b>dual</b> <b>application,</b> while {{in terms of}} origin they are divided into two groups: natural and synthetic. The Clean Technology Group is exploiting the use of supercritical carbon dioxide, which under high pressure at room temperature is a solvent that can use biodegradable plastics to make polymer drug coatings. The polymer (meaning a material composed of molecules with repeating structural units that form a long chain) is used to encapsulate a drug prior to injection {{in the body and}} is based on lactic acid, a compound normally produced in the body, and is thus able to be excreted naturally. The coating is designed for controlled release over a period of time, reducing the number of injections required and maximizing the therapeutic benefit. Professor Steve Howdle states that biodegradable polymers are particularly attractive for use in drug delivery, as once introduced into the body they require no retrieval or further manipulation and are degraded into soluble, non-toxic by-products. Different polymers degrade at different rates within the body and therefore polymer selection can be tailored to achieve desired release rates.|$|E

30|$|As for {{the effect}} of sludge compost on the {{nutrient}} content of wheat grain, {{this study showed that}} either sludge or compost increased the nutrient content of grain. Such effect resulted from the higher nutrient content of most elements of sludge and compost and their ability to improve the availability of nutrients (Vacai Rocio et al. 2011). The <b>dual</b> <b>application</b> of sludge or compost with either azotobacter or yeast increased most nutrient uptake of wheat grains. Such effect resulted from the ability of biofertilizer to increase protein, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, ferric, and zinc (Alaleh Mottaghian et al. 2008 and Khattab et al. 2015).

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the <b>dual</b> <b>application</b> effects of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and polyamines on growth and nutrient uptake of trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings. The seedlings were colonized by Glomus versiforme and irrigated with 320 mL 100 mg/L putrescine, spermidine and spermine, respectively. Two months after exogenous polyamines treatments, both putrescine and spermine applications significantly increased the mycorrhizal colonization, whereas spermidine supplement did not alter the colonization rate. The sole AMF inoculation significantly increased total dry weight, leaf P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu and Mn contents and root P, K, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn contents of the seedlings, compared to the non-AMF control. Compared to the sole AMF inoculation, additional putrescine and spermine markedly increased total dry weight, and elevated leaf P and K contents and root P, Mg, Fe and Zn contents. These increases were more significantly in the mycorrhizal seedlings supplied with putrescine than in the mycorrhizal seedlings supplied with spermine. All these polyamines applications did not affect root Cu and Mn contents, but enhanced leaf Mn uptake and root Ca uptake. Spermidine treatment had almost no effects on nutrient uptake and growth of the seedlings.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common malignancies worldwide and is associated with a low cure rate. Currently liver transplantation represents the best results concerning the recurrence rate and the post operative survival. A lifelong immunosuppression is required with calcineurin inhibitors (CRI) and/or antimetabolites such as sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). For sirolimus and MMF an antiproliferative effect is proven with various tumor celllines. Methodology: The aim of this study was to detect the mono and dual therapeutic inhibition of proliferation by sirolimus and MMF on the HCC cell lines HEP 3 B and SKHEP 1. The effect of these drugs on the cell lines was tested in vitro by the XTT proliferation assay. Results: The strongest inhibition of proliferation was achieved by sirolimus on SKHEP 1 with a cell viability of 9, 7 % (p = 0, 004). The viability of the HEP 3 B-cell line was reduced to 26, 4 % (p = 0, 004) with a <b>dual</b> <b>application</b> of the drugs.
