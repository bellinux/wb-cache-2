40|$|Methods and {{apparatus}} {{are provided}} for a torque driver including a laterally displaceable <b>gear</b> <b>support</b> member to carry an output spur gear. A biasing assembly biases the output spur gear into engagement with a pinion to which is applied an input torque greater than a desired output torque limit for a threaded fastener {{such as a}} nut or screw. A coiled output linkage connects the output spur gear with a fastener adaptor which may be a socket for a nut. A gear tooth profile provides a separation force that overcomes the bias to limit torque at the desired torque limit. Multiple fasteners may be rotated simultaneously to a desired torque limit if additional output spur gears are provided. A gauged selector mechanism is provided to laterally displace multiple driven members for fasteners arranged in differing configurations. The torque limit is selectably adjustable and may be different for fasteners within the same fastener configuration...|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{design of}} compact spur gear {{reductions}} includes {{the selection of}} bearing and shaft proportions in addition to gear mesh parameters. Designs for single mesh spur gear reductions are based on optimization of system life, system volume, and system weight including <b>gears,</b> <b>support</b> shafts, and the four bearings. The overall optimization allows component properties to interact, yielding the best composite design. A modified feasible directions search algorithm directs the optimization through a continuous design space. Interpolated polynomials expand the discrete bearing properties and proportions into continuous variables for optimization. After finding the continuous optimum, the designer can analyze near optimal designs for comparison and selection.

40|$|The OH- 58 main {{transmission}} gearbox was run at varying output torques, speeds, and {{oil cooling}} rates. The gearbox was subsequently run to destruction by draining the {{oil from the}} gearbox while operating at a speed of 6200 revs per minute and 36, 000 inch-pounds output torque. Primary cause of gearbox failure was overheating and melting of the planet bearing aluminum cages. Complete failure of the gearbox occurred in 28 1 / 2 minutes after the oil pressure dropped to zero.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of edge contact on the gear tooth surfaces caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by deflections of <b>gear</b> <b>supporting</b> shafts. As {{a result of an}} edge contact, a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the gear tooth surfaces in order to avoid edge contact. An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by shaft deflections, (2) compensation of predicted shaft deflections during generation of spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a spur gear drive that comprises pinion and <b>gear</b> <b>supporting</b> shafts is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle of meshing. Compensation of misalignments caused by shaft deflections in gear generation is then accomplished by modification of pinion tooth surfaces whereas the gear tooth surfaces are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of pinion tooth surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect of several misalignment compensations in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.
