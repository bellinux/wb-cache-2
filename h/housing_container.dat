40|$|Biomass {{potential}} {{available for}} biogas plants varies greatly, having different composition at different biogas plants {{and in different}} seasons of the year. Thus, establishment and optimization of biogas plants need experiments representing real operation conditions to determine optimal technological parameters and recipes. These need a scaled-up equipment system, which approaches real plant operation conditions better than present laboratory equipment, being able to perform representative comparative experiments {{on the site of}} a biogas plant, using biomass available on site. In the first year, the consortium endeavouring the development have finished situation analysis, determined technical requirements and, after analyses of more variants, developed the master plan. The main parts of the mobile bioreactor that is under construction, are: the reactors, the control system and the system <b>housing</b> (<b>container)</b> ...|$|E

50|$|When {{objects are}} held within a collection, either in storage or {{on display in}} an exhibit, the primary concern {{should be on the}} {{continued}} safety of the collection. To accomplish this, the collector or holding-institution must take into consideration proper <b>housing</b> <b>containers,</b> as well as environmental conditions necessary to prevent damages. The collections management policy for the collection should contain sections in which display and storage housing needs for the objects are addressed in full. Consultation with a conservator-restorer may be necessary to fully address these topics.|$|R

50|$|<b>Container</b> <b>Housing</b> {{units are}} related to the site and land {{occupied}} during {{a certain amount of time}} by the need of water supply and excavation, electricity, telecommunications, etc. Plug-in city is a concept that is developing as more units capable of moving by intermodal means are brought up to the market.

40|$|House-to-house {{surveys of}} larval {{population}} of Aedes aegypti {{were conducted to}} determine the importance of house index for each habitat in Jeddah governorate. In this study, we aimed to survey and monitor mosquito population and potential breeding sites by using <b>House</b> index (HI), <b>Container</b> index (CI), and Breteau index (BI).

5000|$|The {{government}} {{response in}} terms of emergency assistance was marginal. Temporary shelter was provided mainly by <b>container</b> <b>houses.</b> Approximately 20,000 <b>containers</b> {{were sent to the}} earthquake zone. The main problem with this was supplying so many containers in such a short time. Approximately four months after the Van earthquake, the container cities were settled. As a result of this the victims could only be accommodated in container cities after March 2012. Until March 2012 most of the victims set up their own tents for shelter. Many people preferred nylon based materials for economic reasons. Nylon has low ignition temperature and during winter many tent fires occurred. 12 people are dead and more than 160 people are injured because of tent fires ...|$|R
