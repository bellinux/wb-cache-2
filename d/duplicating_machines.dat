The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies.

2500|$|Chester Carlson, the {{inventor}} of photocopying, was originally a patent attorney and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in New York City required {{him to make a}} large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was arthritic, found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with photoconductivity. Carlson experimented with [...] "electrophotography" [...] in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first [...] "photocopy" [...] using a zinc plate covered with sulfur. The words [...] "10-22-38 Astoria" [...] were written on a microscope slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or <b>duplicating</b> <b>machines</b> and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including IBM and GE, neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.|$|E

50|$|The first {{signature}} <b>duplicating</b> <b>machines</b> {{were developed}} by an Englishman named John Isaac Hawkins. Hawkins received a United States patent for his device in 1803. In 1804, Thomas Jefferson began using the device extensively. This early device was known {{at the time as}} a polygraph (an abstracted version of the pantograph) and bears little resemblance to today's autopens in design or operation. The autopen called the Robot Pen was developed in the 1930s, and became commercially available in 1937 (used as a storage unit device, similar in principle to how vinyl records store information) to record a signer's signature. A small segment of the record could be removed and stored elsewhere to prevent misuse. The machine would then be able to mass-produce a template signature when needed.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of digital printing technology, production of small numbers of publications had many limitations. Large print jobs were not a problem, but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine. These produced printed pages of inferior quality to a book, cheaply and reasonably fast. By about 1950, electrostatic copiers were available to make paper master plates for offset <b>duplicating</b> <b>machines.</b> From about 1960 copying onto plain paper became possible for photocopy machines to make multiple good-quality copies of a monochrome original. As technology advanced it became possible to store text in digital form—- paper tape, punched cards readable by digital computer, magnetic mass storage, etc.—- and to print on a teletypewriter, line printer or other computer printer, but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable.|$|E
5000|$|AMPC was {{initially}} founded in Washington D.C to build low-production experimental and custom propellers {{under the name}} Paragon. In 1912 the company moved to Baltimore, Maryland. Initial propellers were built with Mahogany wood, followed by Oak with sprucewood cores, and by 1915 APMC converted to solid oak construction. With the onset of World War I, AMPC became the largest manufacturer of wooden aircraft propellers in America by 1918. Four manufacturing plants operated in Baltimore to meet World War I production contracts [...] The 95,000 sq foot plant number four was constructed in 1918 specifically for propeller production with a capacity of 300-500 propellers per day. An additional 90 propellers a day were produced at the other three plants. The plants used 158,000 sqft of dry kilns to process wood and custom <b>duplicating</b> <b>machines</b> that {{reduce the number of}} lathes required for the construction process. Over 25,000 propellers were produced in World War I with 8000 delivered to the Royal Flying Corps Canada.|$|E
50|$|Helping {{people learn}} {{in ways that}} are easier, faster, surer, or less {{expensive}} {{can be traced back to}} the emergence of very early tools, such as paintings on cave walls. Various types of abacus have been used. Writing slates and blackboards have been used for at least a millennium. From their introduction, books and pamphlets have held a prominent role in education. From the early twentieth century, <b>duplicating</b> <b>machines</b> such as the mimeograph and Gestetner stencil devices were used to produce short copy runs (typically 10-50 copies) for classroom or home use. The use of media for instructional purposes is generally traced back to the first decade of the 20th century with the introduction of educational films (1900s) and Sidney Pressey's mechanical teaching machines (1920s). The first all multiple choice, large-scale assessment was the Army Alpha, used to assess the intelligence and more specifically the aptitudes of World War I military recruits. Further large-scale use of technologies was employed in training soldiers during and after WWII using films and other mediated materials, such as overhead projectors. The concept of hypertext is traced to the description of memex by Vannevar Bush in 1945.|$|E
