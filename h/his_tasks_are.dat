6000|$|... 157. The best {{examples}} {{of the results of}} wise normal evidence in Art will be found in whatever evidence remains respecting the lives of great Italian painters, though, unhappily, in eras of progress, but just in proportion to the admirableness and efficiency of the life, will be usually the scantiness of its history. The individualities and liberties which are causes of destruction may be recorded; but the loyal conditions of daily breath are never told. Because Leonardo made models of machines, dug canals, built fortifications, and dissipated half his art-power in capricious ingenuities, we have many anecdotes of him;--but no picture of importance on canvas, and only a few withered stains of one upon a wall. But because his pupil, or reputed pupil, Luini, labored in constant and successful simplicity, we have no anecdotes of him;--only hundreds of noble works. Luini is, perhaps, the best central type of the highly-trained Italian painter. He is the only man who entirely united the religious temper which was the spirit-life of art, with the physical power which was its bodily life. He joins the purity and passion of Angelico to the strength of Veronese: the two elements, poised in perfect balance, are so calmed and restrained, each by the other, that most of us lose the sense of both. The artist does not see the strength, by reason of the chastened spirit in which it is used: and the religious visionary does not recognize the passion, by reason of the frank human truth with which it is rendered. He is a man ten times greater than Leonardo;--a mighty colorist, while Leonardo was only a fine draughtsman in black, staining the chiaroscuro drawing, like a colored print: he perceived and rendered the delicatest types of human beauty that have been painted {{since the days of the}} Greeks, while Leonardo depraved his finer instincts by caricature, and remained to the end of his days the slave of an archaic smile: and he is a designer as frank, instinctive, and exhaustless as Tintoret, while Leonardo's design is only an agony of science, admired chiefly because it is painful, and capable of analysis in its best accomplishment. Luini has left nothing behind him that is not lovely; but of his life I believe hardly anything is known beyond remnants of tradition which murmur about Lugano and Saronno, and which remain ungleaned. This only is certain, that he was born in the loveliest district of North Italy, where hills, and streams, and air meet in softest harmonies. Child of the Alps, and of their divinest lake, he is taught, without doubt or dismay, a lofty religious creed, and a sufficient law of life, and of its mechanical arts. Whether lessoned by Leonardo himself, or merely one of many disciplined in the system of the Milanese school, he learns unerringly to draw, unerringly and enduringly to paint. <b>His</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> set him without question day by day, by men who are justly satisfied with his work, and who accept it without any harmful praise, or senseless blame. Place, scale, and subject are determined for him on the cloister wall or the church dome; as he is required, and for sufficient daily bread, and little more, he paints what he has been taught to design wisely, and has passion to realize gloriously: every touch he lays is eternal, every thought he conceives is beautiful and pure: his hand moves always in radiance of blessing; from day to day his life enlarges in power and peace; it passes away cloudlessly, the starry twilight remaining arched far against the night.|$|E

50|$|Otello Celletti (Alberto Sordi) is an {{unemployed}} ex-soldier {{from a small}} town in Latium. Since the end of the war, he has been living with his family and father at the expense of his brother-in-law, Nando. One day he receives a letter that says he has been given a job as carrier in the town's markets, despite his request to join the local police. Unwilling to accept the new job, he manages to meet the town's Mayor (Vittorio De Sica) and get the position he sought for. As a policeman, Otello can finally take revenge on all who had been teasing him during the post-war period when he was a jobless man, but soon starts having trouble with his duties. Uncapable of directing the traffic properly at a rather busy crossing, he is moved to a peripheral area where <b>his</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> much easier and gets here the occasion he has always been waiting for: one day he is told by a man passing by that a car got stuck not far from there and that the car is no less than Sylva Koscina's (in the role of herself). He hurries to the spot and makes friends with the actress, managing to invite her for a coffee at a near bar, and after repairing her car (he actually only makes the situation worse and is then forced to call his little son who is a mechanic) asks Sylva to greet him on television at that night's broadcasting of the program Il Musichiere (the Italian version of Name That Tune). Although the woman is missing her driving license and car documents, he lets her go, looking forward to the moment when she will make his name in front of 18 million viewers.At Il Musichiere, that night, Sylva greets Otello publicly and dedicates to him her performance of Adriano Celentano's Il tuo bacio è come un rock, but can't help saying whom Otello is and why she knows him, revealing also how he let her go when he should have fined or even arrested her. Otello is eventually called up by the Mayor and told how grave what he has done is, and that he is at risk of losing his job if he fails to fulfill his duties again: as a policeman, in fact, he must act according to law and make no distinctions. Some time after, Otello is in the workplace when a car passes by exceeding the 50 km/h speed limit in the area by 15 km/h. Driving the car is no less than the Mayor himself. Remembering what he had been told the day before and believing he is merely being tested by the Mayor, he gives him a speeding ticket and, as the Mayor drives away, follows him. He thus finds out the Mayor has a secret love story, despite being married. However, when he inspects the house where he thinks he will catch the man he is told by a woman (the Mayor's secret partner) that he is wrong and that there is no Mayor in there. The day after, despite being advised by his superiors not to proceed and fine the Mayor, he does so, confident of being in the right, revealing also about the possible skeletons in the Mayor's closet.The Mayor decides therefore to punish Otello, who soon gets fired, and chooses to go on trial rather than paying the fine.The town is, however, close to elections, and the disappointed policeman, unemployed again, is made the candidate of the Monarchist National Party, which opposes the current Mayor and uses Otello's case as an evidence that the current government does not operate justly. Certain to have the whip hand, he threatens the Mayor, declaring he will cause his government to fall and get elected himself, to which the Mayor replies by showing Otello secret information about him that he and his party have collected.The information concerns his family, specifically his sister, who was thought to be a masseuse living in Milan and is instead a prostitute, his marriage, which is not a legal one for his wife's ex-husband is still alive, and his father, who shot the King during the war, an action that would be considered an outrage by the monarchists.Fearing for the consequences this information might cause if revealed to the public, Otello decides to finally give up, and on the next day's trial he admits, pretending, that he was wrong in fining the Mayor, a mistake that was caused by a broken Odometer, and that such a man as the Mayor himself can't but be always right.The final scene goes to show how common people are unable to compete with the powerful, and must, in the end, submit.|$|E
40|$|With the {{appearance}} {{and expansion of}} mobile devices, ubiquitous computing is becoming more popular nowadays and the user and <b>his</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> becoming the focus of application development. One area of ubiquitous computing is composed by the context-aware systems, systems where applications are designed {{to react to the}} constant changes in the environment. The heterogeneity of the different domains where context is a key parameter has generated different approaches for context acquisition and modeling. Thus, a number of platforms have been developed in order to alleviate the process of application development and to set a common practice for building applications and services. 	This thesis studies the different platforms, focusing on the Context Toolkit. It examines the design principles, context representation, context acquiring methods and context handling. By developing services for a smart home, it explores the mechanisms applied in the framework and evaluates it. Furthermore, proposals for improving the Context Toolkit s functionality and the application s performance are given, by introducing the concept of quality of context and several enhancements regarding the resource discovery mechanism. Consequently, after gaining hands-on experience with developing a sample context-aware application and analyzing the Context Toolkit, a context-aware platform design is proposed which offers a complete solution defining all the necessary components and their interactions. </p...|$|E
40|$|In the {{bachelor}} thesis "Proposal of school programme {{of environmental education}} on secondary agricultural school and its testing in practice" there are briefly described the national and international legislative and other framework documents {{in the context of}} historical development, which are related to environmental education in the Czech Republic. The work clarifies the system of environmental education which is currently used in secondary agricultural schools. Attention is also paid onto basic documents of environmental education, which are related to secondary education, i. e. the framework educational programmes, school educational programmes and school educational programmes of environmental education. The coordinator of environmental education in secondary agricultural schools and <b>his</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> also mentioned. The aim is to propose the school educational programme of environmental education designed for secondary school of agriculture. Concretely, it is a proposal to organize the school conference focused on the cross-curricular theme "Man and Environment". Current international and local issues, which are suitable for processing by students, are outlined. Possible ways to organize and realize conferences are described in variant solutions with different both organizational and time consuming options. When processing, the opinions of a sample of students from a particular school of agriculture were taken into account. Use of the results of this thesis presents the application of project teaching in the educational process with the main benefits of acquiring knowledge, appropriate attitudes and competencies of graduates in the relationship between man and his environment...|$|E

40|$|In my Master’s Degree I {{have tried}} to answer a {{question}} about what kind of a teacher the pupils wish for and what are their expectations about him. In my opinion the pupils are quite modest about it but despite that we do not listen to their opinions or even turn to advantage our own potentials because we, ourselves, are not aware of them. The teacher’s personal characteristics and actions strongly influence the child’s attitude towards the school, the topics, their motivation, their learning and its success etc. I have collected and compared the findings and opinions of different authors who deal with the qualities a teacher should have in comparison to a model of a teacher the pupils like. Furthermore I have explored the definitions of the teacher’s tasks according to different authors and curricular documents. I have presented the teacher’s influence on the climate and interpersonal relations in a class, and how content the pupils are with their relationships and the way the class is managed. In the empiric part of my work I have researched the opinions the pupils hold when beginning their schooling: what makes a good teacher, how he should act and what <b>his</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>are.</b> I have compared their answers with the teachers’ opinions on what, according to them, are the young learners expectations and whether they find them important and why. Both results were compared to society’s goals and competences. The descriptive method has been used for the research and it was done on a sample of two classes of the first-year pupils and 100 class-teachers. The results of the interviews with the children and the analysis of their drawings have shown what qualities they expect in a teacher: kindness, fairness, being funny, goodness, playfulness, help etc. The teacher is expected to listen to them, understand them, make them feel safe and encourage their feeling of responsibility. What the pupils find important are the moral and ethical qualities and the behaviour of a person. Their description includes the realistic, non-idealized figure of a teacher who is sometimes angry. It is important that all these qualities are intertwined in equilibrium and founded by a competent response of the teacher. The teacher can correct his less appreciated behaviour and qualities but he has to be ready to encounter criticism, accept it and incorporate it in his personal and professional development. In my estimation the pupils are not too demanding in their expectations. The expectations are in accordance with the curricular documents concerning the education of the teachers and their expected competences. The results of the research show that the teachers, under the pressure of society, get the feeling that the pupils’ ideas about the teacher’s tasks are unrealistic because they expect him to be universal and perfect. At the same time they see pupils as the ones emphasizing their rights and ignoring their duties what is, of course, unfounded. I have learnt on the basis of my research that the pupils prefer those teachers who can manage the class well (help, lead, encourage responsibility) and along the way get to know and take into account the children’s opinions. The research shows {{how important it is to}} study the teacher’s qualities, his behaviour and the influence he has on the pupils’ contentment. ...|$|E
40|$|V magistrskem delu sem skušala odgovoriti na vprašanje, kakšnega učitelja si želijo prvošolci oziroma kakšna so njihova pričakovanja do učitelja. Menim, da učenci v svojih željah niso pretirano zahtevni, vendar jim pogosto premalo prisluhnemo oziroma učitelji ne znamo izkoristiti vseh svojih potencialov, ki se jih velikokrat niti ne zavedamo. Učitelj s svojimi lastnostmi in dejanji, še zlasti na začetku šolanja, pomembno vpliva na otrokov odnos do šole, snovi, motivacije, učenja, učni uspeh itd. Zbrala in primerjala sem stališča in ugotovitve različnih avtorjev, ki opredeljujejo, kakšen naj bi bil učitelj, s katerim so učenci zadovoljni. Zanimalo me je tudi, kako različni avtorji in kurikularni dokumenti definirajo naloge učitelja. Predstavila sem učiteljev vpliv na klimo in medosebne odnose v razredu ter kako so z medosebnimi odnosi in načinom vodenja razreda zadovoljni učenci. V empiričnem delu sem raziskala mnenja učencev na začetku šolanja: kako opredeljujejo dobrega učitelja, njegovo želeno vedenje in njegove naloge. Dobljene rezultate sem primerjala z mnenjem učiteljev o tem, kakšna so po njihovem pričakovanja prvošolcev, ali se jim zdijo ta pomembna in zakaj. Oboje sem primerjala tudi z družbeno zastavljenimi cilji in kompetencami. Raziskava je zasnovana na deskriptivni metodi in je potekala na vzorcu otrok dveh prvih razredov in na vzorcu stotih učiteljev razrednega pouka. Rezultati intervjujev z otroki in analize risb so pokazali, da si otroci pri učiteljih želijo naslednje osebne lastnosti: prijaznost, pravičnost, zabavnost, dobroto, pomoč, igrivost idr. Pričakovano učiteljevo vedenje je, da učencem prisluhne, je razumevajoč, učencem nudi občutek varnosti in spodbuja njihovo odgovornost. Učenci so torej izpostavili moralno-etične kvalitete in vedenja človeka. Opisu pa so dodali tudi realno, neidealizirano podobo učitelja, da se včasih jezi. Pomembni sta izraženost oz. uravnoteženost prepleta lastnosti ter ustrezna vedenjska odzivnost učitelja. Manj zaželene lastnosti in vedenja lahko učitelj korigira, vendar mora biti pripravljeni na kritiko, jo sprejeti in upoštevati pri nadaljnjem osebnostnem in profesionalnem razvoju. Po moji oceni učenci v svojih pričakovanjih niso prezahtevni. Njihova pričakovanja se ujemajo s kurikularnimi dokumenti o izobraževanju učiteljev in pričakovanimi kompetencami. Učitelji pa pod vplivi družbenih pritiskov, kot je razvidno tudi iz rezultatov raziskave, dobijo občutek, da imajo učenci nestvarne predstave o njihovih nalogah, da od njih pričakujejo vsestranskost in popolnost. Hkrati pa na učence gledajo kot na tiste, ki vidijo samo svoje pravice in ne dolžnosti, kar seveda ne drži. Na podlagi raziskave ugotavljam, da so učenci bolj zadovoljni s tistimi učitelji, ki dobro vodijo razred (pomagajo, vodijo, spodbujajo, odgovornost) in ob tem poznajo ter upoštevajo mnenja otrok. Raziskava opozarja na pomembnost proučevanja učiteljevih lastnosti in vedenja ter njihovega vpliva na zadovoljstvo učencev.
