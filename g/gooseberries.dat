5|$|Fruit in the {{traditional}} cottage garden would have included an apple and a pear, for cider and perry, <b>gooseberries</b> and raspberries. The modern cottage garden includes many varieties of ornamental fruit and nut trees, such as crabapple and hazel, along with non-traditional trees like dogwood.|$|E
25|$|Pears, apples, guavas, quince, plums, <b>gooseberries,</b> {{and oranges}} and other citrus fruits contain {{large amounts of}} pectin, while soft fruits like cherries, grapes, and {{strawberries}} contain small amounts of pectin.|$|E
25|$|Recipes without added pectin use {{the natural}} pectin in the fruit to set. Tart apples, sour blackberries, cranberries, currants, <b>gooseberries,</b> Concord grapes, soft plums, and quinces {{work well in}} recipes without added pectin.|$|E

25|$|Corncobs were block {{ships that}} crossed the English Channel either {{under their own}} steam or that were towed and then scuttled to create {{sheltered}} water at the five landing beaches. Once in position the Corncobs created the sheltered waters known as <b>Gooseberries.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (<b>Gooseberries)</b> and 146 concrete caissons (Phoenixes).|$|E
25|$|Today native wild {{currants}} {{are relatively}} rare plants in New England, and planting wild currants or wild <b>gooseberries</b> is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions.

Some of 63/20th LAA Bty's crews were washed off their <b>Gooseberries</b> during the storm of 19/20 June, and they were sent to reinforce 73rd and 114th LAA Rgts.|$|E
25|$|Plants rich in {{anthocyanins}} are Vaccinium species, such as blueberry, cranberry, and bilberry; Rubus berries, including black raspberry, red raspberry, and blackberry; blackcurrant, cherry, eggplant (aubergine) peel, black rice, Concord grape, muscadine grape, red cabbage, {{and violet}} petals. Red-fleshed peaches and apples contain anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are less abundant in banana, asparagus, pea, fennel, pear, and potato, {{and may be}} totally absent in certain cultivars of green <b>gooseberries.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} plant food {{used by the}} Lipan was agave (mescal). Another important plant was sotol. Other plants utilized by the Lipan include: agarita, blackberries, cattails, devil's claw, elderberries, <b>gooseberries,</b> hackberries, hawthorn, juniper, Lamb's-quarters, locust, mesquite, mulberries, oak, palmetto, pecan, pinyon, prickly pears, raspberries, screwbeans, seed grasses, strawberries, sumac, sunflowers, Texas persimmons, walnuts, western yellow pine, wild cherries, wild grapes, wild onions, wild plums, wild potatoes, wild roses, yucca flowers, and yucca fruit.

25|$|Apples, plums, and pears, which grow well in Lithuania, are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fruit. Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas, and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews (kompots). <b>Gooseberries</b> (agrastai) and currants (serbentai) are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts.|$|E
25|$|Wine expert Tom Stevenson {{describes}} the classic profile of Sancerre blanc as bone dry, highly aromatic with intense flavors of peaches and <b>gooseberries.</b> He describes Sancerre rouge as being light to medium bodied with floral aromas and delicate flavors. The Pinot noir based rosés {{are described as}} dry and light bodied with raspberry and strawberry notes. Other wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson note {{that in recent years}} overproduction has introduced a lot of variable quality with some Sancerre blancs producing flavor profiles that are not that much different from generic Sauvignon de Touraine from the Middle Loire, though this varies depending on the producer and overall quality of the vintage.|$|E
25|$|The {{abundant}} agave (mescal) {{was also}} important to the Mescalero, who gathered the crowns in late spring after reddish flower stalks appeared. The smaller sotol crowns were also important. Both crowns of both plants were baked and dried. Other plants include: acorns, agarita berries, amole stalks (roasted and peeled), aspen inner bark (used as a sweetener), bear grass stalks (roasted and peeled), box elder inner bark (used as a sweetener), banana yucca fruit, banana yucca flowers, box elder sap (used as a sweetener), cactus fruits (of various varieties), cattail rootstocks, chokecherries, currants, dropseed grass seeds (used for flatbread), elderberries, <b>gooseberries</b> (Ribes leptanthum and R. pinetorum), grapes, hackberries, hawthorne fruit, and hops (used as condiment).|$|E

25|$|As the {{build-up}} in the Normandy beachhead grew during June and July 1944, 80th AA Bde was {{tasked with}} protecting Juno and Sword beaches, the small port of Ouistreham, and the River Orne and Caen Canal bridges. 114th LAA Rgt established RHQ at Courseulles, {{with part of}} the regiment astride the Orne and the canal. On 16 June it was ordered to send a Troop to Douvres to catch aircraft attempting to drop supplies to the German troops holding out in the strongpoint there (the Battle of Douvres Radar Station), and on 20 June it was ordered to deploy a roving Troop to protect an important ammunition ship unloading at Ouistreham. When some of the parties of 6/20 LAA Bty were washed off their <b>Gooseberries</b> during the great storm of June, they were distributed to 114th LAA Rgt to ease manning problems.|$|E
25|$|Often {{the making}} of conserves can be trickier than making a {{standard}} jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for {{just enough time to}} allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the setting point. As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins. Currants and <b>gooseberries,</b> and a number of plums are among these fruits.|$|E
25|$|As the {{build-up}} in the Normandy beachhead grew during June and July 1944, 80 AA Bde was {{tasked with}} protecting Juno and Sword, the small port of Ouistreham, and the River Orne and Caen Canal bridges. 73rd LAA Regiment was deployed round Sword, which remained under German shellfire and night bombing. Some of 63/20 LAA Bty's crews were washed off their <b>Gooseberries</b> and the blockship Courbet during {{the storm of}} 19/20 June, and they were sent to reinforce 73rd LAA Rgt. Other AA batteries arriving from the UK were temporarily attached to RHQ until their own regiments arrived. 322 Bty of 93rd LAA Rgt, with its Crusader-mounted triple 20mm guns remained with 73rd LAA Rgt guarding the Orne and Caen Canal bridges until mid-July. The rest of 296th Bty finally arrived on 20 July and went to thicken up the defences of Sword. By 13 August, the LAA beach defences could be reduced and the whole of 73rd LAA Rgt redeployed to the Caen Canal, with Lt-Col Armstrong appointed AADC Canal Zone.|$|E

500|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across the Channel on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by British forces, the other at Omaha by American forces. A severe storm on 19 June destroyed the Omaha harbour. The Arromanches harbour was repaired and remained in use {{for the next ten}} months, with a maximum capacity of [...] of stores per day. Of the British supplies landed in Normandy by the end of August, [...] via the Mulberry harbour and [...] in via the small harbours at Port-en-Bessin and Courseulles-sur-Mer. Most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July. The most important use of the Mulberry harbour was the unloading of heavy machinery that could not be brought across the beaches. Artificial breakwaters (<b>Gooseberries)</b> sheltered hundreds of ships during the storm of 17–23 June, and provided shelter for craft unloading stores at Juno and Sword. A joint Anglo-American oil depot was constructed at Port-en-Bessin, fed via buoyed pipes known as [...] "Tombola" [...] from oil tankers moored offshore. Using this method, [...] of petrol (half for the Second Army) was delivered by the end of August, by which time the underwater pipelines constructed in Operation Pluto were ready.|$|E
