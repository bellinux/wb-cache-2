5|$|The capriole: a jump {{in place}} where the {{stallion}} leaps into the air, tucking his forelegs under himself, and kicks out with <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> {{at the top of}} the jump.|$|E
5|$|The croupade and {{ballotade}} are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, {{the horse}} jumps with both fore and hind legs remaining tucked under {{the body and}} he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Further Flight was {{retired in}} 1998. As a gelding, {{he had no}} stud career but had an active {{retirement}} {{at the home of}} his former jockey Michael Hills. He died after suffering a paddock injury to <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> in July 2001.|$|R
50|$|Jumbo - ジャンボ: (Bulldog) Jumbo is Kosuke's dog and {{traveling}} partner. He {{is a good}} friend of Yamato. When he and Ryō got lost in the mountains, they got attacked by Black Satan's pack. During this fight, Jumbo lost both ears, an eye, and <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg.</b> When Jumbo first met Yamato, he thought he was a female and wanted to marry Yamato.|$|R
5|$|Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males {{mate with}} the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female {{fertility}} by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step {{process known as}} the flehmen response. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E

5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E

25|$|Faugheen is a bay gelding {{with a white}} blaze {{and white}} socks on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> bred in Ireland by Dr John Waldron. He was sired by Germany, an American-bred, German-trained horse who won the Grosser Preis von Baden and the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen in 1995. As a {{breeding}} stallion he sired several good National Hunt horses including Captain Cee Bee whose win have included the Supreme Novices' Hurdle and the Ryanair Novice Chase.|$|E
25|$|A male Patagonian mara, {{a type of}} rodent, {{will stand}} on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and urinate on a female's rump, to which the female may respond by {{spraying}} a jet of urine backwards {{into the face of}} the male. The male's urination is meant to repel other males from his partner while the female's urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive. Both anal digging and urination are more frequent during the breeding season and are more commonly done by males.|$|E
500|$|Many other diverse {{forms of}} parental care {{are seen in}} frogs. The tiny male Colostethus subpunctatus stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, he {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself {{in the water and}} one or more tadpoles drop off. He then moves on to another pool. The male common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) carries the eggs around with him attached to <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> He keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond, and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters. After three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. The foam is made from proteins and lectins, and seems to have antimicrobial properties. Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. The eggs are laid in the centre, followed by [...] alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.|$|E

50|$|During the expedition, around May 14, 1805, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, {{performed}} {{surgery on}} one of Seaman's arteries in <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg,</b> that had been severed by a beaver bite. In early 1806, as the expedition was beginning the return journey, Seaman was stolen by Indians and Lewis threatened to send three armed men to kill the Indian tribe. Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery ate over 200 dogs while traveling the Lewis and Clark Trail, but Lewis' Newfoundland dog Seaman was spared.|$|R

500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Trakr {{suffered}} from degenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, and lost use of <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> [...] Some experts attributed the condition to inhaling smoke at the World Trade Center site. [...] Symington took Trakr to Pawspice, a California end-of-life organization {{that serves as}} the equivalent of a hospice for pets and an animal oncology consultation service. [...] Pawspice outfitted Trakr with a cart so that he could power himself with his front legs.|$|E
2500|$|The strip {{underwent}} stylistic changes, evolving {{from the}} realistic {{style of the}} 1978–83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield's design, which underwent a [...] "Darwinian evolution" [...] in which he began walking on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> [...] "slimmed down", and [...] "stopped looking [...] through squinty little eyes". His evolution, according to Davis, was {{to make it easier}} to [...] "push Odie off the table" [...] or [...] "reach for a piece of pie". Jon also underwent physiological changes. He now looks older than in the 1990 strips - he is taller and he has larger features.|$|E

50|$|In July 2014, Bal a Bali {{was sold}} for $1.5 million to Fox Hill Farm, owned by Rick Porter, and Siena Farm. He was shipped to a {{quarantine}} facility in Miami and {{arrived with a}} scrape on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg.</b> A veterinarian was called in and detected signs of impending laminitis, a hoof condition that causes serious pain and is {{a leading cause of}} death in horses. The horse was quickly moved to Palm Beach Equine Clinic, where early and aggressive action proved to be the key to the horse's survival.|$|R
2500|$|Brian is a white-furred {{anthropomorphic}} dog. He can talk, generally {{walks on}} <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> (using his front legs as arms), has opposable thumbs, drives a Toyota Prius, and often acts more rationally {{than the other}} characters in the series. He is the pet dog and close friend of the Griffin family, and, although anthropomorphic animals are not a regular element of the show, Brian's human attributes receive little acknowledgment and no explanation; he is largely treated as a human character. Brian has a particularly close friendship with Stewie, {{and many of the}} show's sub-plots center around them. They are occasionally {{at the center of the}} plot, for instance in the [...] "Road to..." [...] episodes. Brian and Stewie have shown affection to each other several times, and in the episode Brian and Stewie, they admitted that they loved each other, not as lovers, but as close friends, though Stewie has shown signs of romantic and sexual interest in Brian in other episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{to other}} dwarf antelopes, Kirk's dik-diks exist in monogamous pairs on territories. Territories are marked with dung and urine that are {{deposited}} in a ritual that is performed to help helps maintain pair bonds. During the ritual, the female will excrete, {{followed by the}} male, which samples the female's urine stream to check her reproductive capacity. He paws over and then marks his dung and urine over her deposit. Finally, the pair marks nearby twigs with secretions from their pre-orbital glands. Kingon 1982 states that, [...] "The male courts the female by running up behind her with his head and neck stretched and his muzzle pointing out in front. Copulation begins with the male standing on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> behind the female and waving his forelegs at an acute angle to his own body in the air over her back". Copulation typically occurs anywhere between three and five times within a 9-hour period.|$|E
