5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the sway of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|Cassidy {{administered}} {{an overdose}} of ether, which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue out of <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> a pair of forceps, {{and at the same}} time forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.|$|E

25|$|Compressor diving is {{a method}} of surface-supplied diving used in some {{tropical}} sea areas including the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask covering the eyes-and-nose and (often home-made) fins and are supplied air from the boat by plastic hoses from an industrial low-pressure air compressor of the type commonly used to supply jackhammers. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> no demand valve or mouthpiece. Excess air spills out through the lips.|$|E
25|$|Maddux {{established}} himself as the Cubs' ace in 1989, winning 19 games, including a September game at Montreal's Olympic Stadium that clinched the Cubs' second-ever National League Eastern Division championship. Manager Don Zimmer tabbed him to start Game One of the National League Championship Series against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed eight runs and was relieved after surrendering Will Clark's grand slam home run with two outs in the fourth. Maddux believed that just before the grand slam, Clark was able to read his lips during a conference at the mound between Maddux and Zimmer, and so knew what pitch to expect. After that incident, Maddux always covered <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> his glove during conversations on the mound. Maddux took a no-decision in Game Four; the Cubs ended up losing the NLCS four-games-to-one.|$|E

According to the translation by Paul Deussen, {{a professor and}} German Indologist, Yajnavalkya answers that [...] "this very thing is sacred thread, namely the Atman". A renouncer [...] or Parivrajaka (another term for renouncer) performs a sacrifice to the Atman whenever he feeds himself or rinses <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> water. Feeding and dressing his Prana (life force) is the only duty of the renouncer.|$|E

500|$|In {{the main}} event, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield faced The Undertaker for the WWE Championship in a Last Ride Match. At the beginning, the Undertaker {{performed}} Old School, a Chokeslam {{and a leg}} drop on the ring apron. JBL hit Undertaker with the steel steps and {{tried to put the}} Undertaker in the hearse but the Undertaker fought back. JBL executed a diving shoulder block but The Undertaker applied a triangle choke hold on JBL, leading JBL to submit to no effect. The Undertaker backdropped out of a piledriver attempt on the steel steps and executed a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel steps, causing JBL to bleed. The Undertaker chokeslammed JBL through a broadcast table. The Undertaker carried JBL to the hearse but Jon Heidenreich came out of the hearse and covered <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> a soaked rag filled with chloroform. Heidenreich placed the Undertaker into the hearse and drove off. Inside the hearse, The [...] Undertaker jumped out and attacked Heidenreich. JBL executed a Clothesline from Hell and helped Heidenreich place the Undertaker back into the hearse. Backstage, Paul Heyman drove the hearse to the parking lot, where Heidenreich drove a car into it, causing an inexplicable explosion, meaning JBL retained the title.|$|E
2500|$|Called a “St. Francis of the wilderness,” [...] Sheffey was {{renowned for}} his {{concern about the}} welfare of animals. [...] He once {{dismounted}} to collect tadpoles in his handkerchief {{so that he could}} transfer them to a stream from a small pool where they were certain to die. [...] Others he tried to save by bringing water to their mud hole. [...] Sheffey regularly stopped to right beetles and dropped out of funeral processions to lift insects {{out of the way of}} wagon wheels. [...] He gave his lunch to hungry dogs and tried (unsuccessfully) to “relieve” flies caught on sticky paper. [...] Once when his brother-in-law cut a wasp in two with a pair of scissors, Sheffey went out to the yard and starting praying. [...] When the brother-in-law asked why, he replied, “I am praying for the Lord to make another wasp to take the place of the one you killed.” [...] Sheffey was especially solicitous of his horse. [...] He specifically instructed hosts how to water and feed his horse, and he often dismounted rather than make the horse carry him up a steep grade. Sheffey had a sweet tooth and would often fill <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> sugar, honey, or maple syrup. [...] He regularly prayed, “Lord, bless the little honeybees for they make sweet honey. Like sweet Jesus.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I'll listen to his whimpering cries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the sixth}} season, Raj {{remained}} silent when Penny was present. Penny occasionally taunted him about this, saying such things as [...] "Yo, Raj, talk to me". Raj sometimes whispered what he wanted to say to Howard or Leonard, who then repeated his words or responded to his question out loud. However, Howard sometimes used the situation to amuse himself—for example, when he [...] "confessed" [...] on Raj's behalf that Raj had stalked Penny with binoculars, or when Sheldon called Penny over to their table to silence Raj; Howard then refused to act as a mouthpiece and told Raj, [...] "No no no, he won; Suck it up." [...] In [...] "The Dumpling Paradox", Leonard jokingly suggests cutting Raj in half so the group can play video games without Howard while Penny is in the room: Raj turns to Leonard (facing away from Penny) and responds, [...] "Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from." [...] Later, in [...] "The Bat Jar Conjecture", Raj accidentally utters a few words ("good story"), much to the surprise of his friends, but he immediately realizes Penny is there and covers <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> both hands. A recurring gag was for Raj to find himself left alone when his friends, in the company of Penny or another woman, make plans to go somewhere and Raj's mutism prevents him from speaking up to join in.|$|E
