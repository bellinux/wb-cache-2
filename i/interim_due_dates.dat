First, we analyze effects of dispatching rules, which relate to <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> slack time, operation time and modified process <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> on a part makespan and a ratio (the makespan/the maximum total operation time of part in a die), and present the optimum rule which minimizes the makespan.

40|$|Managers of {{construction}} projects, maintenance activities, auditing contracts, software shops, etc. are frequently {{faced with the}} task of establishing a new project's <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> which must compete with other projects already in progress or expected (forecasted) to start in the future. The study reported here addresses the problem of establishing <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> for projects which require limited resources, in an environment where new projects arrive continuously and randomly over time. A set of procedures is developed which set each project's <b>due</b> <b>date</b> when it arrives using information about the new project, current projects, and available resources. The <b>due</b> <b>date</b> setting procedures are tested via simulation with four activity scheduling heuristics that control the assignment of resources to specific activities of available projects. A second test demonstrates the performance of the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> procedures, where a portion of arriving projects have their <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> established by external forces beyond management's control. Performance measures of project mean completion time, project mean lateness, project standard deviation of lateness, and total tardiness (sum of all projects' tardy time) were collected for evaluation. This study presents a number of important results for managers interested in scheduling projects and setting <b>due</b> <b>dates.</b> First, using more information concerning the current work in progress, available resources, and activity precedent relationships provides a better <b>due</b> <b>date</b> estimate for a new project. Second, a finite scheduling procedure (called SFT) consistently gives better <b>due</b> <b>date</b> estimates than simpler aggregate procedures. Third, when some project <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> are set externally, <b>due</b> <b>date</b> performance deteriorates. However, when SFT is combined with a <b>due</b> <b>date</b> oriented activity scheduling rule, due dale performance deterioration is less. Fourth, the effort, measured by CPU time, for SFT to estimate a good <b>due</b> <b>date</b> depends upon the ratio of activity resources required to total resources available, rather than the number of activities across all projects.

40|$|Abstract <b>Due</b> <b>date</b> {{assignment}} {{is an important}} task in shop floor control, affecting both timely delivery and customer sat-isfaction. <b>Due</b> <b>date</b> related performances are impacted {{by the quality of}} the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment methods. Among the sim-ple and easy to implement <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment methods, the total work content (TWK) method achieves the best perform-ance for tardiness related performance criteria and is most widely used in practice and in study. The performance of the TWK method can be improved if the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> allowance factor k could render a more precise and accurate flowtime estimation of each individual job. In this study, in order to improve the performance of the TWK method, we have presented a model that incorporated a data mining tool – Decision Tree – for min-ing the knowledge of job scheduling about <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assign-ment in a dynamic job shop environment, which is represented by IF-THEN rules and is able to adjust an appropriate factor k according to the condition of the shop at the instant of job arrival, thereby reducing the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> prediction errors of the TWK method.
