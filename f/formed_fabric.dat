40|$|Reducing {{vehicle weight}} to reduce energy {{consumption}} and engine emissions {{is one of}} the major objectives of the automotive industry. The novel molding technology, presented in this paper, is suited to meet this demand. In this process, a thermoformed fiber-reinforced thermoplastic sheet is inserted into the mold and a long-fiber reinforced thermoplastic is injected to form a rib structure. Short cycle times make the technique an economic option for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance composites. This special integrative injection molding method optimizes efficiencies and thus energy consumption. A basic concept was realized to show the manufacture procedure. The mechanism of adhesion bonding between the long fiber thermoplastic material and the <b>formed</b> <b>fabric</b> and the influence of the main injection molding process parameters on the adhesion quality was experimentally investigated according to the Design of Experiments method. Then experimental tests were used to measure the structural properties of hybrid composites...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of soil samples of uniform density {{is a fundamental}} problem in laboratory and physical experiments. A novel technique that relies on a systematic increase of density induced by thermal cycling is presented here. The principle is simple; when the sample is heated the grains and their container undergo thermal expansion and {{this leads to the}} settling of the material due to the differential thermal expansion between the grains and the container and the metastable nature of the granular assembly. This change in fabric is not reversible upon cooling down of the sample, so the newly <b>formed</b> <b>fabric</b> can be used for experimental testing. Moreover, the soil fabric can be incrementally enhanced using successive thermal cycles of heating-cooling. In this paper, the change of void ratio is investigated in two carbonate sands, a silica sand and glass ballotini. The effect of particle morphology and initial density on the thermal-induced mechanisms of grain rearrangement is discussed. On the basis of experimental results we hypothesise that thermal cycling enables laboratory samples to be produced with enhanced densities and better soil–boundary interfaces, which is critical to help interpretation of data in experimental and numerical tests...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} an overview of the paper machine with focus on the forming section. The forming section is the first part in the paper machine where the paper pulp is injected through a head box. The paper pulp contains about 99. 5 % of water and 0. 5 % fiber. The water as content is reduced by vacuum and gravity. The problem to be studied in this project is related to external rewetting. This is water going back to the paper web from the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> after the dewatering zone. The dewatering is based on vacuum slots under the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric.</b> The vacuum slots absorb water from the soaked paper pulp through the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric.</b> External rewetting causes problem, hence the paper will have a higher dry content when leaving the forming section. The paper should have as low dry content as possible in the end of the forming section. Three different <b>forming</b> <b>fabrics</b> from Albany International were chosen for the project. The structures of the <b>forming</b> <b>fabrics</b> were two different double layers and one plain weave. The performance of the fabrics was studied by 4 different methods. The methods used were 2 different wicking tests, a vacuum dewatering trial and one foulard test. Also micro tomography was done to understand the structure of each design. The main test was a foulard test where the aim was to see in what way the rewetting got affected by different pores sizes. The results showed higher water content for the paper that was on top of the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> with the larger pores...|$|R

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the forming section of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through <b>forming</b> <b>fabrics.</b> More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the forming section allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high vacuum suction boxes? How does the structure of the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> affect dewatering at the forming section? Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for <b>forming</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high vacuum suction boxes were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the suction boxes. The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the suction boxes closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric.</b> The structure of the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of vacuum dewatering, and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the forming section.   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric.</b> Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the forming section, and thereby the entire papermaking process. The <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high vacuum suction boxes occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} corroborated that rewetting occurs after suction boxes and couch rolls. A certain amount of water is left in the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> after the suction zone, resulting in external rewetting which decreases the dry content of the web with 3 - 5 % - units. In the present work different super absorbents with high absorption capacity were used with the intension to absorb the water left in the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> after a suction pulse before it flowed back into the web. First the possibility of reducing rewetting was investigated in laboratory scale. A super absorbent was placed underneath the <b>forming</b> <b>fabric</b> and the web in a laboratory suction box during a suction pulse. A number of different absorbents were tested and several of them did significantly reduce the rewetting of the web. In some trials the reached dry content did not decrease at all after the suction pulse. Second the idea was verified in pilot scale. The rewetting was unfortunately not reduced in the same extent in the pilot trials as in the laboratory trials. But with the proposed justifications of the method it could be proved to work in also pilot scale. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
