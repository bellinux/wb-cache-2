40|$|Polyostotic sclerosing histiocytosis, {{also known}} as Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), is a rare form of non-Langerhans histiocytosis. ECD has wide {{clinical}} spectrums which mainly affect skeletal, neurological, <b>dermatological,</b> retroperitoneal, cardiac, <b>and</b> <b>pulmonary</b> manifestations. Here we describe a case of ECD in a 45 -year-old female who presented initially with bilateral knee pain and homonymous superior quadrantanopia progressed to ophthalmoplegia and complete visual loss of the left eye {{over a period of}} one year. Plain X-ray of both knees showed bilateral patchy sclerosis of the distal femur and upper parts of the tibiae. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral enhancing masses in the temporal lobes anterior to the temporal horns, thickening of the pituitary stalk, partially empty sella, and involvement of the left cavernous sinus one year later. Our case is a peculiar case of ECD initially presented with unilateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia due to involvement of the visual apparatus in the mesial temporal lobe which progressed to unilateral ophthalmoplegia and total visual loss secondary to involvement of the cavernous sinus. Thus, the diagnosis of ECD should be kept in mind in the presence of bilateral bone sclerotic lesions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the differences in the prevalence of somatic diseases among combat veterans and their contemporaries who were not exposed to the traumatic experience at the battlefield, and to determine whether socio-demographic factors, exposure to war-time trauma and/or injury might predict individual somatic diseases. The study included 1, 558 subjects living in south Croatia: 501 male combat veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the corresponding control group of 825 men who were not exposed to combat experience. Veterans with PTSD, regardless of the length of time spent in war, suffered more often from cardiovascular, <b>dermatological,</b> musculoskeletal, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>and</b> metabolic diseases than corresponding control subjects who were not exposed to combat experience. The predictors of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and malignant diseases in veterans were age, length of time spent in combat, having been wounded. A longer period in the combat zone was associated with arrhythmias in veterans with PTSD complicated with other psychiatric comorbidities. PTSD as a result of exposure to war trauma increases the possibility of developing somatic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophils are leukocytes {{that are}} {{released}} into the peripheral blood in a phenotypically mature state and are capable of being recruited into tissues in response to appropriate stimuli. Eosinophils, traditionally considered cytotoxic effector cells, are leukocytes recruited into the airways of asthma patients where they are believed {{to contribute to the}} development of many features of the disease. This perception, however, has been challenged by recent findings suggesting that eosinophils have also immunomodulatory functions and may be involved in tissue homeostasis and wound healing. Here we describe a transcriptome-based approach-in a limited number of patients and controls-to investigate the activation state of circulating human eosinophils isolated by flow cytometry. We provide an overview of the global expression pattern in eosinophils in various relevant conditions, e. g., eosinophilic asthma, hypereosinophilic <b>dermatological</b> diseases, parasitosis <b>and</b> <b>pulmonary</b> aspergillosis. Compared to healthy subjects, circulating eosinophils isolated from asthma patients differed in their gene expression profile which is marked by downregulation of transcripts involved in antigen presentation, pathogen recognition and mucosal innate immunity, whereas up-regulated genes were involved in response to non-specific stimulation, wounding and maintenance of homeostasis. Eosinophils from other hypereosinophilic disorders displayed a very similar transcriptional profile. Taken together, these observations seem to indicate that eosinophils exhibit non-specific immunomodulatory functions important for tissue repair and homeostasis and suggest new roles for these cells in asthma immunobiology...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze quality of {{investigation}} and treatment in the specialized services – <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital and private health care institution “Medidermas”. Methods. Study population – patients with <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases. Randomly selected patients were interviewed in 2004 September-October. Totally 157 patients from state and 62 from private institution were investigated. MS Office Exel and EpiInfo 6. 0 packages were used in the statistical analysis. Results. Mean age of the investigated was 42. 5 ± 1. 1 yrs. One quarter of the investigated chose health care institution, recommended by familiar or friend, only 24 % applied to specialized departments with referrals. The majority of respondents (85. 5 %) of the private institution “Medidermas” were accepted after few days of registration, 38. 2 % (p< 0. 001) of the <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital were accepted after one or two weeks. 45. 2 % of the investigated in the private service were registered in the interval of 10 minutes, 43. 5 % - 15 minutes. In the state institution only 17. 8 % (p 0. 001) were registered during 10 minutes and half – 15 minutes. The respondents of “Medidermas” had a longer waiting time before acceptance to a medical doctor as compared to the state health care service (in 10 minutes 41. 9 % and 17. 3 %, p< 0. 001, respectively). 4 / 5 of the respondents of “Medidermas” had a visit to the doctor lasting 10 - 30 minutes, while 2 / 5 of patients of the state institution the visit to the doctor lasted only 10 - 15 minutes. 	The respondents in the private health care service institution were more satisfied with the interior order and keeping privacy as compared to the state health care institution. Female respondents of “Medidermas” were more satisfied with the competency of medical doctor, while male respondents were more satisfied in the state institution. Women with <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases in private institution preferred to accept positively the administered medication and their health status as compared to men and the respondents of the state health care institution.

40|$|Lapatinib is a {{new drug}} used in {{treatment}} of breast cancer, in which the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER- 2) from the HER family is upregulated and activated. Lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER- 1 and HER- 2 and these receptors {{are involved in the}} control of apoptosis, cellular proliferation and differentiation. Treatment with Lapatinib has shown improved forecasts compared to previous medication. However different side effects have often been observed, such as skin rash and diarrhea. Identification of the cellular mechanisms underlying these side effects is important for optimizing treatment. Based on a literature study different causal relationships are presented, these may underlie the development of various side effects such as skin rash and diarrhea. These causal relationships are presented in 15 hypotheses, which include eight hypotheses for <b>dermatological</b> side effects <b>and</b> seven hypotheses for intestinal side effects. The 15 hypotheses include inhibition of HER, inhibition of other tyrosine kinases and metabolism of Lapatinib. It is deduced that there is a causal relationship between inhibition of HER- 1 and HER- 2 by Lapatinib in breast cancer and the often observed <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> intestinal side effects. Less supported is the possibility that Lapatinibs metabolism and Lapatinibs potential inhibition of other tyrosine kinases may affect the development of <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> intestinal side effects...|$|R
