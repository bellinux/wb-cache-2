25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a {{patentable}} invention in principle because {{the system as a}} whole was new in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a patentable invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and involved an <b>inventive</b> <b>step</b> were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.|$|E

Indeed, the criteria completely determine a simple but inefficient algorithm for drawing a tree, which can be transformed into an efficient algorithm using just standard techniques and a small number of <b>inventive</b> <b>steps.</b> The algorithm consists of an upwards accumulation followed by a downwards accumulation on the tree, and is further evidence of the utility of these two higher-order tree operations...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} quality in patent examination process {{from the perspective of}} patent offices' behavior and organization. After documenting original stylized facts, the paper presents a model in which patent offices set patent fees and the quality level of their examination process. A higher effort in the examination process enhances the patent holders' protection in the judicial system and strengthens the screening of innovations with small <b>inventive</b> <b>steps.</b> We compare the quality of the examination process for various objectives of patent offices. Patent examination quality is the highest in an office maximizing incentives to innovate and the lowest in that maximizing the number of granted patents.

The aim of this review is to summarise the most recent patents in ODT formulations and highlight their motivations, <b>inventive</b> <b>steps</b> and significances in the development of ODT formulations. Five major techniques have been applied in manufacturing of ODTs, namely conventional tablet press, moulding, freeze drying, tablet loading and pulverization, with majority of the patents dedicated to the use of conventional tablet pressing. The patents have addressed various issues concerning the manufacturing of robust and practical ODT formulations by disclosing new manufacturing techniques, advantageous materials, and innovative formulation steps.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} one of {{the innovative}} wave energy converters under development by the Lancaster University Renewable Energy Group. An offshore point-absorber wave energy converter, PS Frog Mk 5 consists of a large buoyant paddle with an integral ballasted ‘handle’ hanging below it. The waves act on the blade of the paddle and the ballast beneath provides the necessary reaction. When the WEC is pitching, power is extracted by partially resisting the sliding of a power-take-off mass, which moves in guides above sea level. Totally enclosed in a steel hull, with no external moving parts, PS Frog Mk. 5 {{is at least as}} robust as a ship and the survivability of the device is currently under investigation, though such work {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper. Such a device could be very economic in terms of power output per unit of capital cost. New <b>inventive</b> <b>steps</b> with experimental results and computer studies have led to promising improvements to the hull shape. The WEC is maintained in a resonant state by the use of special means to maintain a high dynamic magnifier in irregular seas. A robust feedback control system has been developed to ensure stability and maintain efficient power take-off. Some of these developments are described and illustrated with the results of computer simulations that show power outputs and device motion over a range of conditions. It is shown that useful advances have been made, with the power capture bordering on 2 MW in an increasing proportion of sea states...|$|R

40|$|Radical {{innovations}} prompt significant subsequent {{technological development}} and exhibit novelty and "architectural" innovation, i. e. rearranging the way design elements are {{put together in}} a system. Thus, radical innovations often serve {{as the foundation for}} new technological systems, industries or domains and are seen to involve significant conceptual breakthroughs, through either luck or genius. The much more common incremental innovations are perceived as mere improvements to existing technologies. Decreasing returns from incremental innovation are understood to motivate a search for a new radical innovation to provide a platform for more incremental innovation. However, deeper study shows that the conceptual "distance" a radical breakthrough travels is far shorter than would initially appear. On closer inspection, several innovations with undoubtedly radical effects comprise several small <b>inventive</b> <b>steps</b> that appear self-evident, even logical, to the developers. This conundrum appears to stem from conflating a radical effect with a radical development. What's more, this view of radical innovation views inventions as isolated from the broader currents of technological development. An alternative view sees innovations as embedded in a co-evolutionary socio-technical landscape, where inventions develop in a technological environment and become building blocks for further inventions. Although only inventions adopted for use can be called innovations, "inactive" inventions can also serve as building blocks. In this view, (almost) all steps to innovation are incremental, but the system's self-organized criticality (SOC) allows spontaneous radical effects. This work explores the importance of an evolutionary and SOC view of invention and innovation through agent based models. We develop a simple model capable of simulating the build-out of technologies in a series of simulation experiments. Although all inventions develop incrementally, the model behaviour is expected to exhibit SOC so that some inventions trigger much higher rates of subsequent development than others. Thus, the results are expected to support an evolutionary view of technological development where a radical effect is a consequence of the entire interdependent landscape rather than of the radical development of a specific innovation. The model should be of interest to several research streams concerned with simulating and studying R&D activities. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{are in the}} era of {{wearable}} technologies, biometrics and multi-factor authentication, where one's face {{is increasingly}} becoming a digital identifier for access control and authentication.

As the devices that incorporate FR are evolving into miniaturization, {{there is a need to}} develop more robust algorithms that are computationally less expensive. Hence, in an effort to provide a computationally effective FR methodology, we extend the cost-effective GIST descriptor that was designed primarily for object recognition, to be commensurate with FR. This paper proposes a double filtered GIST based descriptor for FR that embodies certain <b>inventive</b> preprocessing <b>steps</b> such as edge detection via Prewitt descriptor, DCT and IDCT transformation to reduce noise prior to feature description with GIST. We will demonstrate by performing extensive experimentations on the ORL and IIT-K face databases that the proposed methodology is capable of effectively performing FR, even in the presence of sharp variations in a number of crucial FR parameters among the faces being compared...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I am {{undertaking}} {{the analysis}} of the effects of increasing intellectual property rights on the reallocation of different kinds of research and development within an endogenous growth framework. This thesis’ approach considers the innovation process as sequential and cumulative in nature and studies the effects of different property rights regimes on a country’s innovative performance. In particular, by explicitly modelling basic and applied research and development (R&D) within a general equilibrium framework, I try to overtake the existing growth theory, which usually aggregates all sources of R&D and innovation, neglecting intermediate <b>inventive</b> <b>steps.</b> My approach is certainly inspired by the current Schumpeterian growth theory (see Aghion and Howitt, 1998 and 2009), which envisages new products and processes arising from Poisson processes, whose arrival rates depend on private and public R&D. However, unlike the previous Schumpeterian models, in most of the chapters of this thesis, creative destruction itself is modelled as a two-stage processes, or more precisely, as a sequence of investment decisions in R&D, whose result is a probability to invent (basic research) or to innovate (applied research). Hence, the first step, "basic research", creates a research tool which is by itself not profitable, but has the potential to become the basis for the second step innovation. The second step is a marketable product which increases consumers' utility and, through the grant of a patent, generates the monopolistic rent for the second step innovator, i. e. the manufacturer of the new product. This is a natural and simple way to explicitly model basic and applied research, yet it entails non-trivial technical complications in the models along with strong policy implications. Chapter 2 tries to answer the following research question: in order to foster innovation and growth should basic research be publicly or privately funded? This chapter studies the impact of the shift in the U. S. patent system towards the patentability and commercialization of the basic R&D undertaken by universities. Such a shift rendered the U. S. universities more responsive to "market" forces. Prior to 1980, universities undertook research employing researchers motivated by "curiosity. " After 1980, universities patent their research and behave as private firms. This move, in a context of two-stage inventions (basic and applied research) has an a priori ambiguous effect on innovation and welfare. Chapter 2 builds a Schumpeterian model and matches it to the data to evaluate this important turning point. iii Chapter 3 extends the model presented by Chapter 2 by introducing Kremer’s (1998) mechanism for inducing innovation by means of auctions for new patents. Such patent buy-outs are run by the public sector in order to reward innovators and freely disseminate most of the new basic research findings. My work is the first attempt to use Kremer’s idea {{to address the issue of}} the patentability of basic research and the financing of early innovation. The same Chapter 3 also quantitatively analyses the impact of the so called “research exemption” of patented basic knowledge. Under the research exemption doctrine, if the second innovator is successful in developing a saleable product or process, then he or she can patent it and yet infringe another patent. The key question that modern economies' innovation systems have been facing in the past few decades is: how should basic research be funded in view of maximizing the efficiency of the innovation system as a whole? In other words, is it possible to conceive the privatization of a country's basic knowledge and an efficient system of incentives to basic research? The study presented by Chapter 4 provides a quantitative assessment on the effects of the US patent reforms that, at the beginning of the Eighties, brought to the patentability of research tools, often invented by the university-led research activity. In particular, Chapter 4 re-examines the policy scenarios and the comparisons presented throughout Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 in order to try to provide these two with a robust empirical support. In the first scenario, only the public sector institutions undertake basic research, rendering all results publicly available for firms, racing to find patentable applications. In the second scenario, important for assessing the post- 1980 reforms in the US system of innovation, basic research itself is privatized, and hence patented by private firms. The most important question for the political economy of basic research is which system is most conducive to innovation and growth. The public system permits more idea dissemination, but may not give basic researchers enough incentives to focus their research on the directions most needed by the private developers downstream. The private system optimally channels basic research, but, by allowing the patentability of ideas upstream, precludes free entry into applied R&D. This generates conflicting effects, and the policy conclusions depend on the value of all the relevant parameters in the economy. In Chapter 4, I estimated the most important of these parameters with the US data immediately preceding the major reorganization of university and basic research in the 80 s, and I simulated the two scenarios. The resulting simulations show that public R&D system, prevailing at that time, was indeed outperforming every privatized alternative scenario. iv Since the incentives to conduct basic or applied research play a central role for economic growth, Chapter 5 tries to answer the following research question: how does increasing early innovation appropriability affect basic research, applied research, education, and wage inequality? Chapter 5 analyses the macroeconomic effects of patent protection by incorporating a two-stage cumulative innovation structure into a quality-ladder growth model with skill acquisition. It focuses on two issues (a) the over-protection vs. the under-protection of intellectual property rights in basic research; (b) the evolution of jurisprudence shaping the bargaining power of the upstream innovators. It shows that the dynamic general equilibrium interactions may seriously mislead the empirical assessment of the growth effects of IPR policy: stronger protection of upstream innovation always looks bad in the short- and possibly medium-run. In a common law system an explicit dynamic macroeconomic analysis is appropriate; hence I have incorporated the mathematical modelling of the evolution of the common law into the rational expectations of the agents. This major modification allows me to schematically replicate the evolution of the skill premium, education, and strengthening of intellectual property rights (IPR) happened in the US during the Eighties and Nineties of the XX century. Chapter 5 also provides a simple "rule of thumb" indicator of the basic researcher bargaining power and 5 shows that IPR evolution can be introduced into a fully rational expectation framework. This helps explaining the well-known dynamics of the skill premium and education in the US, that motivated well-known theories of skill biased technical change and directed technical change (see Acemoglu 2008). Chapter 6, finally, draws inspiration from an important recent empirical literature on competition and productivity in the service sectors (see Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2003; Alesina et al., 2005; Griffith et al., 2006; Aghion et al., 2006) to build a theoretical framework to predict whether innovation is hampered by the lack of completion in the non-manufacturing sectors. In this final chapter, I have built a simple model of process innovation where the provision of essential services (intermediate inputs, for example financial services or transports) for the production of the final good is subject to sectorial regulation, which shapes the market structure of the intermediate sector as a non-competitive one. The structure adopted in this chapter allows examining the effects on the economy of the presence of two different monopolized tasks: the intermediate service provision and the use of the innovation. The ultimate purpose is to show how the lack of competition in an intermediate essential sector, like the service sector, is actually able to depress productivity growth in the final sector...|$|R
