D. Title of {{a diploma}} work: The impact of {{selected}} <b>isoflavonoids</b> {{on the effectiveness}} of anticancer therapy in MDA-MB- 231 cell line. Breast cancer is the most common cancer disease in women. There is an extensive amount of therapeutic regimens for the treatment of this disease, but it is often limited by lack of efficiency or serious side effects. <b>Isoflavonoids</b> genistein (GEN), daidzein (DAID) and formononetin (FORM) belong among the natural substances with bioprotective effects on the human body. Some epidemiological studies have confirmed the protective effect of <b>isoflavonoids</b> against certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. The aim of this work was to study the effect of <b>isoflavonoids</b> on cancer cells and assess their ability to support the effect of cytostatics, namely anthracycline antineoplastic agents doxorubicin (Dox). For the experiments was chosen the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB- 231. To study the effect of <b>isoflavonoids</b> on tumor cells we chose concentrations of 1 and 10 µM which is according to the bioavailability of <b>isoflavonoids.</b> We have shown that <b>isoflavonoids</b> [...] ...|$|R
