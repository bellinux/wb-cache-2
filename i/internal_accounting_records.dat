The simulation, workable with a database query tool or audit software, is ap-propriate for students with querying proficiency and audit procedure design capability.

Due Diligence on Fast-Fashion Inventory Through Data Querying Abstract: In this audit simulation of a due diligence engagement for a fast-fashion retailer’s inventory account, learners (1) design audit procedures to test management assertions about inventory, (2) implement audit procedures through querying data files, and (3) communicate procedures, results, findings, unresolved conditions, and lessons learned. The learning objectives represent essential skills for audit expertise in situations where auditors are expected to analyze data electronically to verify the <b>internal</b> consistency of <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> and to detect conditions warranting further investigation. Because the necessary artifacts can exist in digital form, working a simulation is a feasible approach for developing analytical and querying skills through situation model building. Unlike most existing audit cases, this simulation has data volumes large enough to channel learners to manipulating the data with software rather than manually. Completing the simulation requires learners to wrestle with ambiguities embedded in a realistic audit setting as they make the inferences necessary to develop an approach to performin...|$|R

"industrial accounting ", to satisfy the changing internal information requirements of business owners/managers. Recent research into the <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> of a number of iron companies covering this period has suggested that, despite the paucity of the contemporary British literature on industrial accounting, new accounting techniques and new ideas concerning the potentialities of accounting were developed. Building on these advances, this paper employs the notion of "change agents" to explore the mechanism through which new techniques and ideas were disseminated within the basic metal mining and smelting industries of Wales. Within this context, particular attention is given to the type of person responsible for carrying out the <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> function...|$|R

While both budgets and internal reports are widely used, empirical evidence concerning their influence on the prediction of future performance is extremely limited. Consistent with the availability of formal accounting information improving predictive performance, we observe that <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> report preparation significantly improves forecast accuracy. However, partitioning firms by forecasting difficulty reveals that the accuracy benefits from internal reports preparation are only observed for firms with high uncertainty. Further, the results provide limited support for linkages between budget preparation and forecast accuracy. While we observe {{that the use of}} budget preparation and <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> report preparation is a function of firms’ structural and environmental characteristics, firms do not appear to adopt these activities as a function of forecasting difficulty, but rather as a function of predicted changes in future growth...|$|R

40|$|A cost {{transfer}} is an accounting entry that transfers costs between accounts to correct an accounting or clerical {{error in the}} original entry. A proper system of <b>internal</b> financial <b>accounting</b> control with respect to cost transfers dictates that such accounting entries be properly documented, explained and appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, Federal regulations and Cost Accounting Standards require that such transfers be treated consistently across all University funding sources. II. Scope This guideline establishes the requirements for recording cost transfers on the financial <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> of the University in accordance with a proper system of <b>internal</b> financial <b>accounting</b> control and Federal regulations. The guideline also establishes {{the responsibility of the}} Principal Investigator (PI) to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the cost transfers made to or from their sponsored project accounts. In addition, the Departmental Administrator is responsible to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the cost transfers made to or from departmental funds. The University’s cost transfer guideline applies to all faculty and staff who record cost transfers on the <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> of the University. It also applies to all sources of University funding including unrestricted, restricted, endowment, and plant funds. III. Guideline An appropriate cost {{transfer is}} made when the charge qualifies as a bona fide cost of the sponsored project or indirect activity being charged. Typically, cost transfers are appropriate when their purpose is to: • correct an accounting or clerical error in the original charge • reallocate resources between accounts for reasons other than covering an over or under expenditure of budgeted costs • transfer pre-award costs in the limited circumstances under which some sponsors will accept such costs according to the provisions o...|$|R

40|$|In the {{management}} accounting literature, many reasons are cited to explain changes in <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> measurements. These include variations of institutional factors, modifications of the organisational or cultural profiles of single firms, reasons which vary from firm to firm {{and changes in}} the context in which firms operate. The main objective {{of this study was to}} better understand if hanges in accounting requirements from external parties, when invested with considerable managerial content, might play a similar role. The Italian banking sector served as our point of reference. We not only analysed changes observed in the sector and in the accounting regulations for the market and the supervisory authority, but also interviewed representatives of several Italian banks. Our analysis shows that the sector is developing in terms of greater market orientation and that major changes in <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> measurements have taken place in the banks we interviewed. The past decade has also witnessed the transformation of external accounting requirements, with more importance being assigned to managerial aspects. However, our observation has revealed that such management-oriented accounting requirements play a secondary role in modifying the <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> measurements utilised in Italian banks. This paper was intended to serve as an initial attempt to better understand a sector accountants have traditionally paid little attention to. Banking culture and rhetoric, both in Italy and beyond, is moving toward a wider acceptance and use of formal <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> measurements. We believe that more needs to be known about the motivations, peculiarities, effects and national distinctions behind this process...|$|R
