5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{inherent}} risks of operating at {{or close to}} VMCa with asymmetric thrust, {{and the desire to}} simulate and practise these manoeuvres in pilot training and certification VSSE may be defined. VSSE safe single-engine speed is the minimum speed to intentionally render the critical <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative,</b> established and designated by the manufacturer as the safe, intentional, one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> speed. This speed is selected to reduce the accident potential from loss of control due to simulated engine failures at inordinately slow airspeed.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> and flight crews are trained to fly with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative,</b> the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E

25|$|Most {{test pilot}} schools use multiple, more {{specific}} minimum control speeds, as VMC will change {{depending on the}} stage of flight. Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (VMCL).

500|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{revealed to the}} general public on 3 August 1947 at a flypast at Moscow's Tushino Airfield and the aircraft began its state acceptance trials three days later. Flight testing was completed by 25 May 1948 after 136 flights had been completed. It demonstrated a top speed of [...] at an altitude of [...] and an endurance of one hour and 44 minutes. It had very docile handling qualities with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative.</b> The {{aircraft was}} recommended for production, but it was significantly slower than the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 and Yakovlev Yak-15. The government declined to do so and the program was terminated.|$|E
500|$|Some {{employees}} of ANA speculated that approximately ten minutes after take-off {{the crew of}} Amana {{were aware of the}} seriousness of rough running on number 4 engine so decided to shut it down. Company procedures specified that if an operational problem occurred prior to reaching Kalgoorlie, [...] east of Perth, the aircraft was to return to Perth; but if a problem occurred after reaching Kalgoorlie the flight could continue to Adelaide. The Douglas DC-4 was capable of flying from Perth to Adelaide with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative.</b> The crew of Amana on the fatal flight might have decided to wait until past Kalgoorlie before making a radio call to report one engine had been shut down, and then continue to Adelaide. To manage fuel usage and balance the weight of fuel across the wing, the crew might have selected some of the operating engines to draw fuel from number 4 tank. The DC-4 had a complex fuel selection system and, either deliberately or inadvertently, all operating engines might have been connected to number 4 tank. If the drain cock in the cross-feed pipe was still open to the atmosphere, air would be drawn into the pipe, causing an interruption of fuel supply to the engines, all engines to stop operating and their propellers to move to fine pitch. When the crew realised engines 1, 2 and 3 had all suddenly failed and that cross-feeding of fuel was the source of the problem they would have changed the fuel selections and restored fuel to the engines, causing the sudden screaming noise heard by witnesses as the engines burst back into life with their propellers in fine pitch. Amana had been flying at lower altitude than usual so there was inadequate height for the crew to arrest the high rate of descent before the aircraft struck high ground on the Inkpen family property. (At the Air Court of Inquiry, George Pape, representing ANA, described as [...] "fantastic" [...] any suggestion that the crew of the Amana would be cross-feeding fuel from one wing to the engines on the other wing at such an early stage of the flight.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Skymaster handles {{differently}} from a conventional twin-engine aircraft, primarily in {{that if an}} engine fails, the plane will not yaw toward that engine. Without the issue of differential thrust inherent to conventional (engine-on-wing) twins, engine failure on takeoff will not produce yaw from the runway heading. [...] With no one-engine-out minimum controllable speed (Vmc), in-flight control at any flying speed with an <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> is not as critical {{as it is with}} engines on the wing with the associated leverage; however, performance in speed and, particularly, rate of climb are affected. Flying a Skymaster requires a pilot to hold a multiengine rating, although many countries issue a special [...] "centerline thrust rating" [...] for the Skymaster and other similarly configured aircraft.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 April 1944, Short Stirling Mk3 LK552 JF-C {{manufactured}} by the Austin Motor Company from No. 1654 Heavy Conversion Unit RAF Wigsley in Nottinghamshire {{took part in a}} night navigational exercise. The pilot was Pilot Officer Lee from No. 65 Course. At 11,000 feet and 0105 hours, nearing the end of the exercise, the port inner engine failed but the port outer engine was inadvertently shut down. With both port <b>engines</b> <b>inoperative</b> the pilot was unable to control the aircraft. All the crew baled out near the Cheese House in West Burton.|$|R
50|$|With engines {{rotating}} in {{the same}} direction the P-factor will affect VMC's, the minimum control speeds of the aircraft in asymmetric powered flight. The published VMC's are determined while the critical <b>engine</b> is <b>inoperative.</b> The actual VMC's after failure of any other engine is lower, safer, provided the pilot is aware of the limitations that apply with minimum control speeds.|$|R
25|$|When two {{opposing}} engines of aircraft with {{four or more}} <b>engines</b> are <b>inoperative,</b> there is no thrust asymmetry, hence there is no rudder requirement for maintaining steady straight flight; VMCAs play no role. There may be less power available to maintain flight overall, but the minimum safe control speeds remain {{the same as they}} would be for an aircraft being flown at 50% thrust on all four engines.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} that is flying across the Ocean for example, {{would be required}} to calculate ETPs for one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative,</b> depressurization, and a normal ETP; all of which could actually be different points along the route. For example, in one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> and depressurization situations the aircraft would be forced to lower operational altitudes, which would affect its fuel consumption, cruise speed and ground speed. Each situation therefore would have a different ETP.|$|E

50|$|Aviation {{regulations}} (such as FAR and EASA) define {{several different}} VMCs and require design engineers to size the vertical tail and the aerodynamic flight controls {{of the aircraft}} to comply with these regulations. The minimum control speed in the air (VMCA) {{is the most important}} minimum control speed of a multi-engine aircraft, which is why VMCA is simply listed as VMC in many aviation regulations and aircraft flight manuals. On the airspeed indicator of a twin-engine aircraft of less than 2722 kg, the VMCA is indicated by a red radial line, as standardised by FAR 23. Most test pilot schools use multiple, more specific minimum control speeds, as VMC will change depending on the stage of flight. Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (VMCL). In addition, with aircraft with four or more engines, VMCs exist for cases with either one or two <b>engines</b> <b>inoperative</b> on the same wing. Figure 1 illustrates the VMCs that are defined in the relevant civil aviation regulations and in military specifications.|$|R
25|$|Loss {{of engine}} power of wing mount {{propellor}} aircraft and blown lift aircraft affects the lift distribution over the wing, causing a roll toward the <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine.</b> In some aircraft roll authority is more limiting than rudder authority in determining VMCs.|$|R
2500|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the first Boeing 307 Stratoliner (not a prototype, as it was planned to be {{delivered}} to Pan Am following testing and certification), registration NX 19901 took place from Boeing Field, Seattle on December 31, 1938. It crashed on March 18, 1939, while its performance with two <b>engines</b> <b>inoperative</b> on one wing was being demonstrated to representatives of KLM. When the engines were shut down, the pilot moved the rudder to maximum deflection to counter the resulting yaw. The Stratoliner then experienced rudder lock, where the control loads prevented the rudder from being re-centered. As a result, the 307 went into a spin and crashed. The ten people aboard, including KLM test pilot Albert von Baumhauer, Boeing test pilot Julius Barr, Boeing Chief Aerodynamicist Ralph Cram, Boeing Chief Engineer Earl Ferguson, and a TWA representative were killed. Subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of an extended dorsal fin ahead of and attached to the vertical tail prevented rudder lock. This was incorporated into the 307's rudder redesign, while also being incorporated in Boeing's rear fuselage redesign for their models [...] "E" [...] through [...] "G" [...] B-17 bomber.|$|R

40|$|Artemis is a {{reusable}} excursion {{vehicle for}} lunar landing missions. It {{is intended to}} transport a notional CEV vehicle from low lunar orbit (LLO) to the lunar surface. It can be reused by refueling the vehicle in LLO. Artemis is nominally sized to carry a 10 MT payload to the lunar surface and then return it to LLO. Artemis is powered by four liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fueled RL- 10 engines. These RL- 10 engines provide the necessary thrust and allow the Artemis lander to complete its nominal mission with two <b>engines</b> <b>inoperative.</b> The Artemis lander has volume margin built into its propellant tanks. This volume margin combined with an innovative cross-feed system allows Artemis to complete its ascent from the lunar surface with a propellant tank failure. This cross-feed system also allows Artemis to adjust {{the center of gravity}} (cg) of the vehicle by transferring propellant among the propellant tanks. Artemis lands on the moon with six articulating legs. This provides redundancy against a leg failure on landing and provides Artemis with the ability to land on uneven terrain. This vehicle is designed to be launched by a heavy-lift evolved expendable launch vehicle (EELV). This design constraint results in the distinct shape of the lander. Artemis i...|$|R
25|$|Heavier {{aircraft}} are more stable and {{more resistant to}} yawing moments, and therefore have lower VMCAs. The longitudinal centre of gravity affects the VMCA as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder {{will be able to}} provide a larger yawing moment, and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust. The lateral centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine</b> it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine,</b> the aircraft's VMCA will increase. The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the VMCA will be lower. The bank angle also influences the minimum control speed. A small bank angle away from the <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine</b> is required for smallest possible sideslip and therefore lower VMCA. Finally, if the P-factor of the working engine increases, then its yawing moment increases, and the aircraft's VMCA increases as a result.|$|R
50|$|Later in 1969 the ship's homeport {{was again}} changed. She arrived at her new station at Tongue Point Coast Guard Base in Astoria, OR in 1970. In 1971 Cactus wrecked on the {{submerged}} portion of South Jetty at Grays Harbor, WA. Both cargo holds were ruptured and tidal; her engine room was holed and taking on water. Her main <b>engines</b> were <b>inoperative</b> because of shaft misalignment and a damaged screw. Cactus was severely damaged and in peril of capsizing. She was successfully re-floated using air and towed to Seattle, WA by MS Salvage Chief, (Captain Reino Mattila, homeport Astoria, OR) She was decommissioned in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Although the EMB 120, {{like all}} transport-category multi-engine airplanes, is {{designed}} to fly with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative,</b> the distortion of the engine resulted in excessive drag and loss of lift {{on the left side}} of the aircraft, causing it to rapidly lose altitude.|$|E
50|$|ETOPS {{applies to}} twins on routes with {{diversion}} time more than 60 minutes at one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> speed. For rules that also cover {{more than two}} engines, {{as in the case}} of the FAA, ETOPS applies on routes with diversion time more than 180 minutes for airplanes with more than two engines.|$|E
50|$|In September 1997, a {{range of}} {{improvements}} were introduced, including PW206E turboshafts with higher single <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative</b> ratings, revised engine air inlets, improved NOTAR inlet design and a more powerful stabiliser control system. Benefits include improved range and endurance and an increased maximum takeoff weight. This enhanced Explorer was unofficially designated the MD 902.|$|E
50|$|When one <b>engine</b> becomes <b>inoperative,</b> a {{yawing moment}} develops, the {{magnitude}} of which {{is equal to the}} lateral distance of the thrust vector of the operative engine to the center of gravity (C.G.), also called moment arm, multiplied by the thrust of the engine. In addition, a rolling moment might develop due to asymmetrical propulsive lift generated by the wing section behind the operative propeller. These moments yaw and/ or roll the aircraft towards the <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine,</b> a tendency which must be counteracted by the pilot's use of the flight controls: rudder and ailerons. Due to P-factor, a clockwise rotating right-hand propeller on the right wing typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater lateral distance from the aircraft's C.G. than the clockwise rotating left-hand propeller (Figure 1). The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger remaining yawing moment by the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice versa. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a larger yawing moment, the pilot will need to use larger control deflections in order to maintain aircraft control, or a higher speed. Thus, the failure of the left-hand engine is less desirable than failure of the right-hand engine, and the left-hand engine is called critical.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, the sawmill was modernized. Electric motors were {{mounted on}} the saws and the planer.

2500|$|The {{crew were}} trying to manage the {{situation}} they were facing. The Captain then asked the First Officer {{if one of the}} ground crews had tampered with the panel near the plane's rear door, and subsequently stated that [...] "the guy" [...] had problems and was pissed at them. The flight continued to Lagos and the crew continued to discuss the problem they were facing. They noticed that there were differences on the EPR value on the engines. The crew also noticed that there was no response from the left engine when they advanced the throttle lever, thus concluded that the left <b>engine</b> was <b>inoperative.</b> The crew decided to start their descent towards Lagos. As a failure on the left engine occurred, the crew should have looked at their Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and followed procedures accordingly, but failed to do so.|$|R

50|$|President Aquino {{revealed}} {{details of}} the accident investigation and its findings during a media briefing on November 13, 2012. The investigation found that improper maintenance led to the right engine suffering an internal failure, which likely would have caused misfiring and intermittent operation of the fuel pump. The failure was gradual and the aircraft developed engine problems 23 minutes after take off. However, instead of turning back to Cebu, the pilot decided to continue the flight, until the engine failed completely 37 minutes later and the aircraft crashed during the subsequent attempt to land at Masbate. The investigation determined that the pilot didn't use the correct procedure for trying to land a Piper Seneca with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative,</b> in that he lowered the undercarriage and flaps too soon; and that during his last flight proficiency test {{he had not been}} tested with respect to flying with one <b>engine</b> <b>inoperative.</b>|$|E

In those days 100 miles was about 60 minute flying time in many aircraft if an <b>engine</b> was <b>inoperative.</b> The [...] "60-minute rule" [...] was established in 1953, recognising the engine reliability of piston power plants that were available at that time.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of commercial operation twin-engine airplanes are limited to flying in a distance equivalent to 60 minutes, with one <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine,</b> from an airport. This limitation restricted for years the twin-engine operation on very important route such as the North Atlantic route, between United States and Europe. Based on requests from operator and aircraft manufactures during the 1980 s the American aviation authority - FAA - issued an extension allowing the operation beyond the 60 -minute rule. This extension was called ETOPS. With this extension the commercial operator of a twin-engine airplane should fly distances higher than the old one correspondent to 60 minutes distance, with one <b>inoperative</b> <b>engine.</b> Following FAA decision, several aviation authorities issued an extension for the 60 -minute rule and ETOPS operation has been working {{as an extension of}} a regulation for more than 20 years. Because of this particularity, in 2000, FAA created a workgroup to discuss ETOPS operation and include its requirements within the official regulation (14 CFR), including the parts for product certification and operation, allowing that the airplane should be optionally certified for ETOPS operation, and its operation depending only on the operator certification. This dissertation details the FAA ETOPS rule and, at the end, demonstrate the EMBRAER airplane ERJ 190 - 100 capability for its operation...|$|R
