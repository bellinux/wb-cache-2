A Hagiography of the Taoist saint Zhang Daoling states <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> seven feet tall.|$|E

5|$|After {{his earlier}} crash Downie retired {{on the third}} lap with a broken wheel, while Thornycroft, who had also had first lap trouble, was forced to stop with a broken rear axle. Over the final two laps a number of cars ran out of fuel, and of the 42 {{starters}} only 18 completed the race. The first car to finish was the Rolls Royce of Percy Northey. He had started twenty minutes ahead of Napier's Arrol-Johnston so Napier had to finish within twenty minutes of Northey in order to win. He did so, passing the finish line eighteen minutes later, having run the fastest lap of the race at the end to win by just over two minutes. Napier's time was 6 hours 9 minutes 14.6 seconds, followed by Northey in 6:11:23 and Norman Littlejohn in a French Vinot-Deguingand, in 6:14:32.4. The three drivers had been consistently the quickest throughout the race and were separated by just over five minutes. The next quickest driver was E. J. C. Roberts in {{the second of the}} Arrol-Johnstons, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 25 minutes behind his victorious team-mate.|$|E

25|$|Lindwall's drag of {{his right}} foot has often brought him under the fire of those who claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> the line before he {{released}} the ball...As {{a matter of fact}} Ray's right foot is well behind the crease when he starts to bring his arm over, but he releases the ball later in his swing than any other bowler I have seen.|$|E

25|$|Mansell quickly passed Berger {{and then}} Barrichello {{to get up}} to fourth. During the stops, Hill messed up and the team, afraid that he would lose the lead, sent him back out too quickly without giving him enough fuel. Schumacher however was already ahead and Hill had to stop again for fuel. When he rejoined, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 20 seconds behind. Mansell too was slow and Barrichello was ahead of him. Mansell tried to pass him and there was contact. Both had to pit, with Mansell {{dropping}} to seventh and Barrichello going well down.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} No.13, Soane {{set about}} treating {{the building as}} an architectural laboratory, continually remodelling the interiors. In 1823, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 70, he purchased a third house, No. 14, which he rebuilt in 1823–24. This project allowed him to construct a picture gallery, linked to No.13, on the former stable block of No. 14. The front main part of this third house {{was treated as a}} separate dwelling and let as an investment; it was not internally connected to the other buildings. When he died No. 14 was bequeathed to his family and passed out of the museum's ownership.|$|E
25|$|Garrincha {{was already}} married and a parent {{when he signed}} for Botafogo in 1953. Team {{officials}} were ecstatic to learn that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 18 and able {{to be treated as}} a professional. In his first training session, he demonstrated his extraordinary skills by dribbling the ball through the legs of Nílton Santos, a Brazilian international defender and defensive midfielder with 16 international caps, who then requested himself for Garrincha to be hired for Brazil. He played in a 5–0 win for Botafogo's reserves and then scored a hat trick on his first-team début against Bonsucesso on July 19, 1953.|$|E

25|$|Small was a playing {{member of}} Hambledon during its years of greatness {{and it was}} largely because of him that Hambledon was such a famous club. He was {{definitely}} playing for Hambledon in 1764 and his name {{is found in the}} club's scorecards right up to 1798 when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 60. Knowledge of the early years of his career are sketchy {{due to the lack of}} detailed records before scorecards became common from 1772, but it is believed he began playing in top-class cricket during the 1750s and may well have taken part in the earliest known Hambledon matches, a tri-series against Dartford in 1756.|$|E
25|$|When Banda {{returned}} to Nyasaland, {{which he had}} left in 1915, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 60. Chipembere and Chiume and most other leading Congress activists were in their late 20s or early 30s. As well as the age difference there was, from the start, a disagreement about Banda's role: the activists saw him as a figurehead, but he saw himself {{as the leader of}} Congress and expected their obedience. Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise more moderate in his speeches that the younger Congress members. Both Chipembere and Chiume avoided social contact with Europeans and, in their speeches, they frequently denounced Europeans as a group, in contrast to Banda's relatively cordial relations with individual Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Medici {{attempted}} {{to promote the}} candidacy of others in his party, but none could gain wide support. Wolsey received eight votes, but his young age deterred other cardinals from supporting him (the English ambassador tried to convince the College <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> fifty). Medici addressed the conclave on January 9 and suggested they {{turn their attention to}} candidates not present in the conclave, expressing his willingness to elect Adrian of Utrecht. In the following scrutiny Adrian received fifteen votes, including all those controlled by Medici. Colonna, the main opponent of Medici and those in his party then declared his support for Adrian, netting him thirteen more votes by accessus, exactly two-thirds. As Adrian was not present, his candidacy did not require two-thirds plus one.|$|E

25|$|Holger Meins (26 October 1941 – 9 November 1974) was {{a leftist}} {{cinematography}} student in West Germany and {{was tired of}} being harassed by police over his political views.

In 1971 he was arrested alongside Jan-Carl Raspe and Andreas Baader during a shoot-out with the police in Frankfurt. In prison the Baader-Meinhof gang called for a hunger strike, as they felt they were being treated unfairly by the government. Meins died on 11 November 1974 {{as a result of}} the hunger strike.
