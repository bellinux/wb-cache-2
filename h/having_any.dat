5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to {{pledge not to}} represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from <b>having</b> <b>any</b> occupation outside the Authority or <b>having</b> <b>any</b> business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E

5|$|Bormann and Himmler shared {{responsibility}} for the Volkssturm (people's militia), which drafted all remaining able-bodied men aged 16 to 60 into a last-ditch militia founded on 18 October 1944.

5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not <b>having</b> <b>any</b> rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} sexual orientation, no Supreme Court justice has {{identified}} {{himself or herself}} {{as anything other than}} heterosexual, and no incontrovertible evidence of a justice <b>having</b> <b>any</b> other sexual orientation has ever been uncovered. However, the personal lives of several justices and nominees have attracted speculation.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without <b>having</b> <b>any</b> meaningful values of their own.|$|E

5|$|A related {{experiment}} {{which also}} had Teller's endorsement {{was a plan}} to extract oil from the tar sands in northern Alberta with nuclear explosions, titled Project Oilsands. The plan actually received {{the endorsement of the}} Alberta government, but was rejected by the Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to <b>having</b> <b>any</b> nuclear weapons in Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to have nuclear weapons, from a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall <b>having</b> <b>any</b> reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|At the Red Electoral Alliance's city {{convention}} Folkvord {{was elected}} their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, {{were the only}} representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards the idea of <b>having</b> <b>any</b> representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything {{in their power to}} stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.|$|E

5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a pot, the son {{closes the door}} on every person who asks for his help. Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from <b>having</b> <b>any</b> peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were <b>having</b> <b>any</b> effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to <b>having</b> <b>any</b> strictly convex combination of both.|$|E

5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his <b>having</b> <b>any</b> motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to play a game of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed <b>having</b> <b>any</b> business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E

The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them <b>having</b> <b>any</b> chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain <b>having</b> <b>any</b> say in the matter.|$|E
5|$|Timetoget started {{negotiations}} with the Swedish company BK Tåg to try to establish a cooperation that would allow Swedish engineers to be used. At the same time, the minority shareholders, who owned 11% of the company, demanded that they could take over NSB's shares without compensation, and that all debt to NSB be deleted. Arne Wam responded by stating that NSB wanted to liquidate the company. NSB therefore offered to purchase all shares in the company at par value, despite the company not <b>having</b> <b>any</b> net assets.|$|E
