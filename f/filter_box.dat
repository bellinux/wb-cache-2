40|$|Abstract. Gaussian {{convolution}} is {{of fundamental}} importance in linear scale-space theory and in numerous applications. We introduce iterated extended <b>box</b> <b>filtering</b> as an efficient and highly accurate way to compute Gaussian convolution. Extended <b>box</b> <b>filtering</b> approximates a continuous <b>box</b> <b>filter</b> of arbitrary non-integer standard deviation. It provides {{a much better}} approximation to Gaussian convolution than conventional iterated <b>box</b> <b>filtering.</b> Moreover, it retains the efficiency benefits of iterated <b>box</b> <b>filtering</b> where the runtime is a linear function of the image size and {{does not depend on}} the standard deviation of the Gaussian. In a detailed mathematical analysis, we establish the fundamental properties of our approach and deduce its error bounds. An experimental evaluation shows the advantages of our method over classical implementations of Gaussian convolution in the spatial and the Fourier domain...|$|R

40|$|A robust hash, or {{content-based}} fingerprint, is a succinct {{representation of}} the perceptually most relevant parts of a multimedia object. A key requirement of fingerprinting is that elements with perceptually similar content should map to the same fingerprint, even if their bit-level representations are different. In this work we propose BAMBOO (Binary descriptor based on AsymMetric pairwise BOOsting), a binary local descriptor that exploits a combination of content-based fingerprinting techniques and computationally efficient <b>filters</b> (<b>box</b> <b>filters,</b> Haar-like features, etc.) applied to image patches. In particular, we define a possibly large set of filters and iteratively select the most discriminative ones resorting to an asymmetric pair-wise boosting technique. The output values of the filtering process are quantized to one bit, leading to a very compact binary descriptor. Results show that such descriptor leads to compelling results, significantly outperforming binary descriptors having comparable complexity (e. g., BRISK), and approaching the discriminative power of state-of-the-art descriptors which are significantly more complex (e. g., SIFT and BinBoost) ...|$|R

Because of the equivalence between M-smoother and local-histogram-based filters (such as median filter and mode filter), the proposed framework enables fast approximation of histogram filters via a number of <b>box</b> <b>filtering</b> or Gaussian filtering. In addition, high-quality piecewise-constant smoothing can be achieved via a number of bilateral filtering or guided filtering integrated in the proposed framework.

This motivated us to develop a new intravascular system that can perform MR imaging, radiofrequncy (RF) heating, and MR temperature monitoring simultaneously in an MR scanner. To validate this concept, a series of mathematical simulations of RF power loss along a 0. 032 -inch MRIG and RF energy spatial distribution were performed to determine the optimum RF heating frequency. Then, an RF generator/amplifier and a <b>filter</b> <b>box</b> were built. The possibility for simultaneous RF heating and MR thermal mapping of the system was confirmed in vitro using a phantom, and the obtained thermal mapping profile was compared with the simulated RF power distribution. Subsequently, the feasibility of simultaneous RF heating and temperature monitoring was successfully validated in vivo in the aorta of living rabbits.

40|$|In a {{conventional}} single-exposure photograph, moving objects or moving cameras cause motion blur. The exposure time defines a temporal <b>box</b> <b>filter</b> that smears the moving object across the image by convolution. This <b>box</b> <b>filter</b> destroys important high-frequency spatial details so that deblurring via deconvolution becomes an illposed problem. Rather than leaving the shutter {{open for the}} entire exposure duration, we ¨flutter¨the camera´s shutter open and closed during the chosen exposure time with a binary pseudo-random sequence.

40|$|Heavy metals from an acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) site were precipitated on {{the surface}} of juniper fiber. The modified fiber was tested in labscaled batch and column tests and in the field. Elemental analysis showed that soluble iron species deposited on the fiber act as an inorganic adsorbent for anions.

A pseudo second order kinetic model fitted well for sorption of phosphorus onto the modified filter medium. The kinetic constant was 8. 09 × 10 - 2 g/mg/min at 10 ppm of phosphorus concentration.

Modifications to the component design were made to make the component suitable for the HPDC process. Development of the die design through simulation modelling is described. The wrought alloy was replaced by near-eutectic Al-Si die casting alloy that was found to give better temperature stability performance. Apart from the economic benefits, HPDC was found to give lower filter efficiency losses through better surface finish. The effects of HPDC process variables, such as intensification pressure and injection piston velocity, on component quality, particularly porosity levels, were investigated. The pressure was analysed in terms of HPDC machine set pressure and the pressure measured in the die cavity by pressure sensors. Porosity was found to decrease with increased pressure and slightly increase with higher casting velocities...|$|E
