5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Defense is {{committed}} to the integrity of the ongoing court martial proceedings of Major Nadal Hasan and for that reason will not further characterize, at this time, the incident that occurred at Fort Hood on November 5, 2009. Major Hassan has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder, and 32 counts of attempted murder. As with all pending UCMJ matters, the accused is <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proven guilty.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{individuals}} {{accused of}} any crime are considered <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proven guilty, although the defendant may {{be held in}} detention. Unless the accused opts for a fast-track trial, murder cases are heard by a corte d'assise (English translation: court of assizes). A guilty verdict is not regarded as a definitive conviction until the accused has exhausted the appeals process, irrespective {{of the number of}} times the defendant has been put on trial.|$|E

25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proved guilty. According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E
25|$|Article 87 of the Basic Law and Article 11 of the Bill of Rights {{provides}} that anyone {{charged with a}} criminal offence shall {{have the right to}} be presumed <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proven guilty according to law. This presumption is well established under the common law; the much-celebrated case of Woolmington v DPP laid down the basic criminal law principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt subject to the defence of insanity and statutory exceptions. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant committed the criminal offence in question, the prosecution has not made out the case and the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.|$|E
25|$|On 8 June 2012 the General Elections Committee (GEC) {{refused to}} {{register}} Enkhbayar {{as a candidate}} for 2012 parliamentary elections in MPRP party list listed as number one. It stated that the official documents sent from the Prosecutor's Office and Sukhbaatar District Court of Ulaanbaatar required the rejection of Enkhbayar's application pending the case. However, Enkhbayar and his lawyers argue that the incumbent president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, who took office in 2009, engineered the corruption case to keep him from running in the coming elections. They claim that the court gave them insufficient time to review the prosecutors' evidence and witness statements. The election authorities' denial of Enkhbayar's candidacy on 6 June, they say, violates his constitutional right to be considered <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proven guilty. According to a US-based independent trial observer, the five charges levelled against Enkhbayar seem overblown and unsubstantiated. One accuses him of misappropriating TV equipment that was intended for a Buddhist monastery. Another alleges that he illegally shipped eight copies of his autobiography to South Korea on a government plane.|$|E
5000|$|Arriving at a {{decision}} was difficult, according to jurist Angie Thomas. A picture of Brisenia presented during the trial was {{a significant factor in}} reaching the decision, she said. [...] "A little girl, with bright red fingernails; she's wearing a white T-shirt and turquoise-colored pajama bottoms. She's on a love seat.

In retaliation, Livia knocks out Pointpoirot with a hammer, then accidentally killing one of her unsuspecting relatives with the same weapon.|$|R

[...] In his History, Defoe records that Bess was [...] "a main lodestone in attracting of him up to this Eminence of Guilt." [...] Such, Sheppard claimed, was the source of his later ruin. Peter Linebaugh offers a different view: that Sheppard's sudden transformation was a liberation from the dull drudgery of indentured labour and that he progressed from pious servitude to self-confident rebellion and Levelling.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the duties}} of scholar-officials was hearing {{judicial}} cases in court. However, the county magistrate and prefects of the Song period were expected to know {{more than just the}} written laws. They were expected to promote morality in society, to punish the wicked, and carefully recognize in their sentences which party in a court case was truly at fault. It was often the most serious cases that came before the court; most people desired to settle legal quarrels privately, since court preparations were expensive. In ancient China, the accused in court were not viewed as fully <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proven otherwise, while even the accuser was viewed with suspicion by the judge. The accused were immediately put in filthy jails and nourished only by the efforts of friends and relatives. Yet the accuser also had to pay a price: in order to have their case heard, Gernet states that they had to provide an offering to the judge as [...] "a matter of decorum." ...|$|E
500|$|Sir William Garrow [...] (13 April 1760 – 24 September 1840) was an English barrister, {{politician}} and judge {{known for his}} indirect reform of the advocacy system, which helped usher in the adversarial court system used in most common law nations today. He introduced the phrase [...] "presumed <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> proven guilty", insisting that defendants' accusers and their evidence be thoroughly tested in court. Born to a priest and his wife in Monken Hadley, then in Middlesex, Garrow was educated at his father's school in the village before being apprenticed to Thomas Southouse, an attorney in Cheapside, which preceded a pupillage with Mr. Crompton, a special pleader. A dedicated student of the law, Garrow frequently observed cases at the Old Bailey; as a result Crompton recommended that he become a solicitor or barrister. Garrow joined Lincoln's Inn in November 1778, and was called to the Bar on 27 November 1783. He quickly {{established himself as a}} criminal defence counsel, and in February 1793 was made a King's Counsel by HM Government to prosecute cases involving treason and felonies.|$|E
