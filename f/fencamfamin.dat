50|$|In a {{study on}} slices of rat corpus {{striatum}} and substantia nigra <b>fencamfamin</b> acted as an indirect dopamine agonist. It released dopamine by a similar mechanism to amphetamines, but was ten times less potent than dexamphetamine at producing this effect. The main mechanism of action was instead inhibition of dopamine reuptake. Also unlike amphetamines, <b>fencamfamin</b> does not inhibit the action of monoamine oxidase enzymes. It was concluded that, {{at least in the}} models employed, the in vitro profile of <b>fencamfamin</b> is more similar to that of nomifensine, a reportedly pure uptake inhibitor, than to d-amphetamine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fencamfamin</b> is well tolerated {{and causes}} minimal circulatory effects. Extended use {{may result in}} a dryness of the mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fencamfamin</b> (INN), {{also known}} as fencamfamine or by the brand names Glucoenergan and Reactivan, is a {{stimulant}} which was developed by Merck in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fencamfamin</b> {{is still}} used, though rarely, for {{treating}} depressive day-time fatigue, lack of concentration and lethargy, particularly in {{individuals who have}} chronic medical conditions, as its favourable safety profile makes it the most suitable drug in some cases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fencamfamin</b> may be {{synthesized}} in {{a straightforward}} fashion via the Diels-Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and β-nitrostyrene (1-nitro-2-phenyl-ethene). The C=C double bond and the nitro-group in the resulting norcamphene derivative are then reduced {{to give the}} saturated norcamphane derivative. Finally, the amino-group is ethylated.|$|E
50|$|In animal {{experiments}} on place preference <b>fencamfamin</b> produced a significant place preference {{only at the}} dose of 3.5 mg/kg. The experiments suggested a relation to dopamine D1 receptors, and also to opioid receptors in the reinforcement produced by <b>fencamfamin,</b> as place preference was blocked by the selective dopamine D1 antagonist SCH 23390 and by the opioid antagonist naloxone. A similar place preference, which was blocked by naloxone and by SCH 23390 and by raclopride, has been seen in a study on rats with drinking water. Animals treated with naloxone before the conditioning sessions showed a place aversion instead of the place preference found in saline-treated animals. Naloxone also reduced drinking. It was proposed that naloxone induced a state of frustrative nonreward. It was suggested that both dopamine and (endogenous) opioids are important for water-induced reinforcement. Possible interactions between these two neurotransmitter systems were discussed.|$|E
50|$|The stereochemical {{consequences}} of the steps involved in the reaction sequence outlined above have been studied. Thus, the Diels-Alder cycloaddition leads to a product in which the nitro- and phenyl- groups are in a trans- relationship to each other. This product is actually a mixture of stereoisomers, in which the pair of enantiomers having the nitro- group in the endo- position and the phenyl- group in the exo- position predominates over the enantiomeric pair with exo-nitro and endo-phenyl groups. Although the isomeric composition of the Diels-Alder adduct itself {{does not seem to}} have been determined, Poos et al. reported a ratio of ~3:1 for the saturated un-ethylated amine derived from it. Novakov and co-workers, citing a thesis study, report that the corresponding ratio of endo-N-ethyl/exo-Φ : exo-N-ethyl/endo-Φ enantiomeric pairs is ~9:1 in <b>fencamfamin</b> itself.|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with the narcoleptic syndrome were treated separately with dexamphetamine sulphate tablets 10 and 30 mg, Dexedrine Spansules 10 mg, mazindol 4 mg, and <b>fencamfamin</b> hydrochloride 60 mg daily. Each drug was given for four weeks and the effects compared. In these dosages the reported frequency of attacks of narcolepsy was roughly halved with each treatment, dexamphetamine 30 mg daily being only slightly more potent than 10 mg. The subjective effects of Dexedrine tablets and Spansules could not be distinguished by most patients. Effects on mood, alertness, and sympathomimetic side effects were largely inseparable with all these drugs, but a decrease in appetite was not reported by {{patients with}} narcolepsy...|$|E
