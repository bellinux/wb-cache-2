500|$|Simpson {{looked to}} herself for {{inspiration}} when writing [...] "Little Miss Obsessive", which chronicles the [...] "ostensibly aural dance" [...] {{of a couple}} [...] "who break up to make up – and like it". Of the song's concept, Simpson commented: [...] "It's what we can all become in a relationship sometimes. We put our foot in our mouths and we wish we didn't — 'No, I didn't mean to say it. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> back. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation. You put your foot in your mouth and you go, 'Wait, why did I do that?' We're on our phones writing and texting too much!" ...|$|E

Alana stated, [...] "When people call us a girl band, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as an insult – being {{a girl in a}} band shouldn’t be a thing.” All three sisters are proficient on more than one instrument: Este plays both guitar and bass, Danielle plays guitar and drums, and Alana plays guitar, keyboards and percussion. For live performances, Este plays bass, Danielle plays lead guitar and sings lead vocals, and Alana plays rhythm guitar along with keyboards and percussion. All three sisters contribute three part vocal harmony.|$|E

500|$|Writing in Variety, {{the sister}} of Parker's alleged victim {{discussed}} the immense pain that Parker's The Birth of a Nation brought to her and her family, [...] "As her sister, the thing that pains me most of all is that in retelling {{the story of the}} Nat Turner slave revolt, they invented a rape scene. The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape. [...] Given what happened to my sister, and how no one was held accountable for it, I find this invention self-serving and sinister, and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music {{publishing}} company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. This deal {{gave him the}} rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Tokyo, where he said: [...] "I've been {{in the entertainment industry}} since I was 6 years old, and as Charles Dickens would say, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' But I would not change my career ... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> in stride because I have a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me." [...] That month, Jackson visited a U.S. Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 U.S. troops and their families. The hosts presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation.|$|E
500|$|On 26 May 2012, it was {{reported}} that Cheryl would perform [...] "Call My Name" [...] with live vocals on The Voice UK, following allegedly pre-recorded performances that occurred the previous year on The X Factor UK. It was also reported that The Voice executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would [...] "provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast." [...] As the performance began, Cheryl swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly ellaborated routine. Following the broadcast, Cheryl received mixed comments from viewers, with a few who accused the singer of lip synching, while others, including pop singers Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, Cheryl addressed the negative comments, and said that [...] "if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as a compliment." [...] She performed the track again on The Graham Norton Show on 8 June 2012, and was also accused of lip synching. Cheryl also performed [...] "Call My Name" [...] at Capital FM Summertime Ball on 9 June 2012 in front of 80,000 fans at the Wembley Stadium, she was a surprise artist. During the energetic performance, the singer sported an outfit designed by Pam Hogg, and was accompanied by 12 backing dancers. Colette Fahy of the Daily Mail accused Cheryl of lip synching and stated that [...] "it was evident to the crowd that [...] was miming." [...] Cheryl performed [...] "Call My Name" [...] at Stand Up to Cancer. However, the performance was also subject of controversy after technical errors with her microphone occurred, meaning that viewers could only hear her voice faintly singing along to a musical backing track. Cheryl also performed the track on a T4 special, at The Voice Denmark, and at the 2012 Jingle Bell Ball. [...] "Call My Name" [...] was also performed on Cheryl's debut headlining solo concert tour, named A Million Lights Tour, in October 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cycle of}} {{structuration}} {{is not a}} defined sequence; it is rarely a direct succession of causal events. Structures and agents are {{both internal and external}} to each other, mingling, interrupting, and continually changing each other as feedbacks and feedforwards occur.

2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out of my mouth once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out of my mouth occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E

The black moose is (by all that have hitherto writ of it) accounted a very large creature....

[...] The plaintiff could not recover the thing bailed, because it was destroyed. [...] This was the first known case in which the words, [...] "converted to his own use" [...] (Latin: [...] "convert a son oeps") were used.

[...] Olivia allowed Dorothy to write a thank-you note when Pound's Canzoni were published—that he dedicated to Olivia and Dorothy—the only instance when she let Dorothy contact him directly. John Harwood, Olivia Sharkespear biographer, [...] writes that Dorothy's lack of resistance seems extreme, even by Edwardian standards; however, he speculates that Olivia's motives were to keep Dorothy's behaviour controlled, whereas Pound's behaviour was ignored.|$|E

2500|$|Shantel VanSanten portrays Quinn James, Haley's free {{spirited}} older sister. Fans were unreceptive to {{the character}} at first, but eventually warmed to her. [...] "It's funny.

[...] "And {{there was no way}} that I could ever change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and happy. You know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|E
2500|$|She always {{claimed that}} she could not bestow {{creativity}} onto her students and {{that she could}} only help them to become intelligent musicians who understood the craft of composition. [...] "I can't provide anyone with inventiveness, nor can <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> away; I can simply provide the liberty to read, to listen, to see, to understand." [...] Only inspiration could make the difference between a well-made piece and an artistic one. She believed that the desire to learn, to become better, was all that was required to achieve – always provided the right amount of work was put in. She would quote the examples of Rameau (who wrote his first opera at fifty), Wojtowicz (who became a concert pianist at thirty-one), and Roussel (who had no professional access to music till he was twenty-five), as counter-arguments to the idea that great artists always develop out of gifted children.|$|E
