5|$|Argon {{is used in}} {{the poultry}} {{industry}} to asphyxiate birds, either for mass culling following <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{ecosystem}} biological diversity, {{evolution of}} parasites, and invasion by exotic species all frequently result in <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> such as cholera which emerged in 1992 in India. The frequency of AIDS/HIV is increasing. In 1996, about 46,000 Indians out of 2.8million (1.6% of the population) tested {{were found to}} be infected with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle studied locusts {{and their}} {{breeding}} habits and Livy recorded a devastating plague in Capua in 203 BC. He mentioned human epidemics following locust plagues which he {{associated with the}} stench from the putrifying corpses; the linking of human <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> to locust plagues was widespread. A pestilence in China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, {{and may have been}} caused by an increase in numbers of rats (and their fleas) that devoured the locust carcases.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} farm to wholesale prices spreads {{to measure the}} impact of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak</b> on the Canadian beef industry. The study uses structure break tests developed by Gregory and Hansen (1996) and Hansen (1992) examine possible breaks within cointegrating relationships. The study finds evidence that the industry began a realignment {{as a result of the}} UK BSE <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak,</b> and the Canadian BSE <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak</b> was simply the largest realignment of the process beginning with the UK <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak.</b> However, the only statistically significant break was the BSE <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak</b> itself in May 2003. Stability was not restored until the border was reopened in 2005. Specific results indicated that the processing sector exploited the border closure in May 2003 to enhance its market power and that the system returned to a competitive one after the border re-opened in July 2005.

5|$|Following {{the passage}} of Mitch, <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> {{occurred}} throughout Central America, including cholera, leptospirosis, and dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34people. Guatemala was most affected by the bacterium, {{where most of the}} deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.|$|E
5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and embryo transfer are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers â€“ freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product. On the other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> among other risks.|$|E
5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also Highland cattle in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian Highland Cattle Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred cattle in Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (mad cow <b>disease)</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in the United Kingdom. Today, Highland cattle are mainly found in eastern Canada. The population of Highland cattle for Canada and the United States of America combined is estimated at 11,000.|$|E

5|$|In Belize, a {{hurricane}} warning was issued about 23hours before Iris moved ashore. A state of national emergency was declared on October8 as Hurricane Iris neared landfall. All emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts. A mandatory evacuation was issued for Stann Creek and Toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands. The main hospital in Belize City was evacuated {{as a precaution}} and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order. Overall, 11,380people evacuated their homes in Belize, including many in Belize City. These evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll. Hurricane Keith had struck the nation a year prior, preparing some citizens for what to expect. Disaster response teams arrived the day after Iris was projected to make landfall. Pan American Health Organization staff were on standby in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August23, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{deployed}} 717 personnel, {{mainly from}} the disaster response team, to the affected regions in the United States. The following day, 564 National Guard troops were deployed in the state. In the days following the storm, many mosquitoes and other insects laid eggs in areas of standing water, causing a large increase in their numbers. Authorities sprayed insecticide to minimize the potential for <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> By August25, all shelters opened prior to Bret were closed as residents were allowed to return home. On August26, President Bill Clinton added the counties of Brooks, Duval, Jim Wells and Webb to the major disaster declaration area. This allowed residents in those counties to receive federal funding.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E

5|$|About {{the same}} time as his gubernatorial {{campaign}} began, Blackburn appeared before the Kentucky General Assembly to advocate measures to protect the state against <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> including the creation of a state board of health and the construction of quarantine centers in the state's border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state board of health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state's doctors did not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the Jackson Purchase region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.|$|E
5|$|Chennai {{was officially}} {{declared}} a disaster {{area on the}} evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class pincodes. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings. After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.|$|E
