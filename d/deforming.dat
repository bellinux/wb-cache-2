Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at him, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, <b>deforming</b> Palpatine's {{face into the}} gray, wizened visage seen in the original trilogy. Just as Windu is about to dispatch Palpatine, Anakin appears and intervenes on the Sith lord's behalf, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu with another blast of lightning. Anakin then pledges himself {{to the dark side}} as Palpatine's new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, <b>deforming</b> {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen {{surrounding}} the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.|$|E

On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E

40|$|A <b>deformed</b> {{exponential}} {{family is}} a generalization of exponential families. Since the useful classes of power law tailed distributions are described by the <b>deformed</b> exponential families, they are important objects {{in the theory of}} complex systems. Though the <b>deformed</b> exponential families are defined by <b>deformed</b> exponential functions, these functions do not satisfy the law of exponents in general. The <b>deformed</b> algebras have been introduced based on the <b>deformed</b> exponential functions. In this paper, after summarizing such <b>deformed</b> algebraic structures, it is clarified how <b>deformed</b> algebras work on <b>deformed</b> exponential families. In fact, <b>deformed</b> algebras cause generalization of expectations. The three kinds of expectations for random variables are introduced in this paper, and it is discussed why these generalized expectations are natural from the viewpoint of information geometry. In addition, <b>deformed</b> algebras cause generalization of independences. Whereas it is difficult to check the well-definedness of <b>deformed</b> independence in general, the κ-independence is always well-defined on κ-exponential families. This is one of advantages of κ-exponential families in complex systems. Consequently, we can well generalize the maximum likelihood method for the κ-exponential family from the viewpoint of information geometry...|$|R
5|$|LocoRoco {{is divided}} into 5 worlds each {{consisting}} of 8 levels. In each level, {{the goal is to}} reach the end point of the level, with the player scored on the number of LocoRoco found, the time to complete the level, and other factors. There are six varieties of LocoRoco in the game, identified by their color, appearance, and musical voice, but outside of the first yellow one (Kulche), the rest are unlocked as the player completes the levels. The player can then opt which LocoRoco they want to use for a level, however, this selection has no fundamental gameplay effects and only changes the songs used. LocoRoco act as blobs of gelatin, <b>deforming</b> from their normally round shape when demanded by the environment. Certain beings in the world can change the default shape of the LocoRoco into other forms, such as squares or triangles, which lasts until they wash off in water or they encounter another similar being.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent <b>deforming,</b> the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or <b>deforming</b> the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties of the shadow produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{studied the}} {{microstructure}} of near-surface <b>deformed</b> layers and their evolution from the transfer slab {{to the cold}} rolled final gauge sheet of an AA 3104 aluminium alloy. Electron microscopy of ultramicrotomed cross-sections revealed two types of near-surface <b>deformed</b> layers, i. e. type A and type B, both with different microstructures to the underlying bulk alloy. A typical feature of the <b>deformed</b> layers is the nano-sized ultrafine grains, with diameters ≤ 200 nm for the type A and ≤ 500 nm for the type B <b>deformed</b> layer. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) indicated that oxide particles are present along grain boundaries within the type A <b>deformed</b> layer, while the type B <b>deformed</b> layer is free of oxide particles. The type A <b>deformed</b> layer is mainly generated at elevated temperatures {{during the early stages}} of hot rolling. Its thickness is non-uniform across the surface, with a maximum of ~ 4 µm on the transfer slab, ~ 1 µm on the re-roll gauge sheet and ~ 0. 8 µm on the final gauge sheet.
