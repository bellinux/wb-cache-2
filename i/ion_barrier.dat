40|$|Internal Transport Barriers (ITB's) in tokamak plasmas are a {{promising}} {{way to achieve}} steady-state plasmas with good confinement properties in a fusion reactor. Despite a large activity in this field, the formation and self-sustainment of barriers are still not well understood. The physics of ITB's in JET has been investigated with various techniques, namely micro-stability analysis, profile modelling and turbulence simulations. The calculation of linear growth rates show that the magnetic shear {{plays an important role}} in the formation of the ITB. The Shafranov shift, ratio of the ion to electron temperature, and impurity content further improve the stability. However the ExB velocity shear is important for the sustainment and the motion of the barrier. This picture is consistent with profile modelling and global fluid simulations of electrostatic drift waves. Turbulence simulations also show that the formation mechanisms are different for electron and <b>ion</b> <b>barriers.</b> <b>Ion</b> <b>barriers</b> are mainly due to the formation of a gap in the density of low wavenumber resonant surfaces whereas electron barriers are rather due to a reversal of the precession drift of trapped electrons...|$|R

Strong (R/L Te = 25 T e (0) = 20 keV) transport barriers in the electron heat channel are generated with counter electron cyclotron current drive in low density plasmas n e = 1 - 2. 5 x 10 19 m - 3. <b>Ion</b> <b>barriers</b> are generated using neutral beam heating in the current ramp up.

Pre-heating with ECRH delays the barrier formation, which forms at the same radial position. Broader barriers can be generated with more NBI power. A study of the barrier position with respect to the q-profile reveals that the foot of the barrier is not well correlated with the minimum q position. Also turbulent fluctuations are reduced at the barrier foot, but not completely suppressed. The new scenario often does not show any external kink activity and can reach β n values of 3. 2.

40|$|The {{impact of}} oxygen ion {{transport}} at the electrolyte-electrode interface of a micro-solid oxide fuel cell using different fuels is investigated. Model validation is performed {{to verify the}} results versus the reported values. Furthermore, as the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio decreases, the diffusivity of the oxygen ion increases. This increase in diffusivity is observed {{because the number of}} hydrogen atoms available as the reacting species increases in fuels with lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios. The oxygen ion conductivity and output power density decrease as the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the fuels decreases. The reason behind this impact is the formation of a gas-induced <b>ion</b> <b>barrier</b> at the electrode-electrolyte interface by the CO 2 molecules formed during the reaction at the interface, thus blocking the flow of oxygen ions. As the oxygen ions become blocked, the output current contribution from the reaction also decreases and thereby affects the overall performance of the micro-solid oxide fuel cell. The experimental verification confirms this because of a significant decrease in the output power density. Furthermore, as per the application in portable devices, the appropriate choice of fuel can be chosen so that the micro-solid oxide fuel cell operates at the maximum power density.

Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) –mutagenesis has been a valuable approach for generating new animal models of deafness and discovering previously unrecognized gene functions. Here we report on the characterization of a new ENU–induced mouse mutant (nmf 329) that exhibits recessively inherited deafness. We found a widespread loss of sensory hair cells in the hearing organs of nmf 329 mice after the second week of life. Positional cloning revealed that the nmf 329 strain carries a missense mutation in the claudin- 9 gene, which encodes a tight junction protein with unknown biological function. In an epithelial cell line, heterologous expression of wild-type claudin- 9 reduced the paracellular permeability to Na + and K +, and the nmf 329 mutation eliminated this <b>ion</b> <b>barrier</b> function without affecting the plasma membrane localization of claudin- 9. In the nmf 329 mouse line, the perilymphatic K + concentration was found to be elevated, suggesting that the cochlear tight junctions were dysfunctional.

40|$|Abstract—A flexible, smooth, and {{low profile}} {{conformal}} coat-ing {{was developed to}} accomplish the encapsulation of a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) device that will be applied to sense the static pressure on aircraft during real flight testing. The encapsulant {{should be able to}} protect the MEMS device and the multichip module (MCM) from adverse environmental conditions, i. e., mechanical shock, temperature fluctuation, engine fuel and oil contamination, and moisture/mobile ion permeation. Presently, conventional packaging schemes for electronics cannot satisfy this specific outdoor application, and a new encapsulation combination has been designed in accord with the requirement of reliability without hermeticity (RWOH). A bi-layer structure was selected because of property limitations of a single material. Pliable elastomeric silicones, are typically flexible, water repel-lant, and abrasion resistant. The silicone encapsulant will be first applied to planarize the MEMS surface and function as durable dielectric insulation, stress-relief, and shock/vibration absorbers over a wide humidity/temperature range. To compensate for the deficiency of silicone on engine fuel/oil contamination, Parylene C is to be deposited afterward. This bi-layer coating can achieve excellent bulk properties, such as moisture and mobile <b>ion</b> <b>barrier</b> resistance, chemical compatibility, and electrical insulation char-acteristics. However, the poor adhesion of Parylene C to silicone greatly restricts its application. To address this problem, silane coupling agents were used as an adhesion promoter. Significant adhesion im provement was achieved by placing an interlayer silane coupling agent to provide interfacial bonding to the silicone elastomeric surface and the Parylene C film. Furthermore, a pos-sible mechanism of adhesion enhancement will also be presented in this study.

40|$|Cellular energy {{transduction}} processes are often driven by transmembrane ion gradients, {{and a number}} of artificial membrane systems have been developed that allow for chemically or light-induced transport of ions across lipid bilayers. These liposomal architectures, however, are not readily interfaced to a solid-state transducer. A significant step toward this goal is described here by assessing the possibility of coupling a lipid bilayer directly to a transducer to form a stable uniform film using hybrid bilayer membranes (HBMs). Although the surface attachment of self-assembled monolayer increases the robustness of the lipid assembly, HBMs cannot maintain film uniformity under harsher conditions due to the absence of strong lipid-lipid interactions. Therefore, HBMs were prepared and characterized using a cross-linking polymerizable lipid, bis-SorbPC. Several parameters relating to lipid deposition and film stabilization through polymerization were examined. Film characterization strongly suggests that polymerization of bis-SorbPC stabilizes the HBM such that its structure is largely preserved even after the dehydration process. This work suggests that network formation in the upper monolayer is not enough to prevent oligomer desorption, intermonolayer covalent linking is also a prerequisite in making uniform, defect-free planar supported lipid assemblies. Some of the challenges associated with the application of lipids involve the creation of supported bilayers that are stable to chemical and physical disruptions, yet retain their <b>ion</b> <b>barrier</b> properties, and allow transmembrane ion transport by lipid-soluble shuttles. Polymerized lipid films provide the stability required for these structures, but permeability properties of cations across poly(lipid) membranes are not known. Therefore, convenient liposome-based proton and calcium permeability assays were developed. These assays were applied to various poly(lipid) compositions. In addition, three novel sorbyl-substituted head group polymerizable lipids, which have been synthesized based on a strategy that head group polymerization would minimally perturb the characteristic ion impermeability of the membrane, were evaluated for their lipid characteristics and ability to form polymers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explored {{ion transport}} in conjugated polymers. Study in this dissertation focused on following subjects: 1. Driving mechanisms (migration and diffusion) for ion transport. 2. Correlation among ions, charge, and volume change. 3. Effects of experimental situations (voltage, swelling of polymers, film thickness, <b>ion</b> <b>barrier</b> thickness, electrolyte, and temperature) on ion transport. 4. Developing a physics-based model and conducting numerical simulations for ion transport in conjugated polymers. The research {{results of this}} dissertation were summarized mainly in 3 articles and presented in Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 respectively. Chapter 3 reported preliminary experimental and modeling results of cation ingress in PPy(DBS). Cation ingress in the polymer was displayed through phase front propagations that were formed by electrochromism. Migration was found to dominate ion ingress evidenced by a linear relationship between phase front velocity and reduction potentials. Chapter 4 is a full-scale experimental study of ion transport in PPy(DBS). Besides phase front propagation velocity and broadening, current data and actuation strains of PPy(DBS) were also collected. Comparisons among these data gave more insights of cation transport in PPy(DBS). Diffusion of ions in PPy(DBS) {{was found to be}} non-Fickian diffusion, which has not been included in models in the literature. Cation egress was found to be independent with applied potentials, suggesting a diffusion controlled process, while cation ingress was found to be dominated by migration. This difference between cation ingress and cation egress has not been realized before this dissertation. The effect of polymer swelling on cation ingress was characterized for the first time, which suggested an exponential relationship between ion mobility and ion concentration. Chapter 5 reported more advanced theoretical modeling and simulation results. Nernst-Planck-Poisson's equations were used to model hole transport, ion transport, and potential profiles in conjugated polymers. The model was able to explore ion transport with various experimental situations including changing of voltage, ion diffusivity, hole mobility, Einstein relation, electrolyte concentration, and film geometry. The model successfully predicted both ion ingress and ion egress features for PPy(DBS). Predictions of anion transport conjugated polymers such as PPy(ClO 4) were also reported...|$|E

40|$|Excellent {{two-dimensional}} electrode {{materials can}} be used to design high-performance alkali-metal-ion batteries. Here, we propose ReN_ 2 monolayer as a superior two-dimensional material for sodium-ion batteries. Total-energy optimization results in a buckled tetragonal structure for ReN_ 2 monolayer, and our phonon spectrum and elastic moduli prove its dynamical and mechanical stability. Further investigation shows that it is metallic and still keep metallic feature after the adsorption of Na or K atoms, its lattice parameter changes by only 3. 2 % or 3. 8 % after absorption of Na or K atoms. Our study shows that its maximum capacity reaches 751 mA h/g for Na-ion batteries or 250 mA h/g for K-ion batteries, and its diffusion barrier is only 0. 027 eV for Na atom or 0. 127 eV for K atom. The small lattice change, high storage capacity, metallic feature, and extremely low <b>ion</b> diffusion <b>barriers</b> make the ReN_ 2 monolayer become superior electrode materials for Na-ion rechargeable batteries with ultrafast charging/discharging processes.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} (limit of detection) of high-resolution Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (HRBS) {{is mainly}} {{determined by the}} background noise of the spectrometer. There are two major origins of the background noise in HRBS, one is the stray ions scattered from the inner wall of the vacuum chamber of the spectrometer {{and the other is}} the dark noise of the microchannel plate (MCP) detector which is commonly used as a focal plane detector of the spectrometer in HRBS. In order to reject the stray <b>ions,</b> several <b>barriers</b> are installed inside the spectrometer and a thin Mylar foil is mounted in front of the detector. The dark noise of the MCP detector is rejected by the coincidence measurement with the secondary electrons emitted from the Mylar foil upon the ion passage. After these improvements, the background noise is reduced by a factor of 200 at a maximum. The detection limit can be improved down to 10 ppm for As in Si at a measurement time of 1 h under ideal conditions...|$|R
