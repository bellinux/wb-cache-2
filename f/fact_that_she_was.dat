5|$|In 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin {{received}} the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award {{for their contributions}} to mathematics. The prize carried a monetary reward of 500Reichsmarks and {{was seen as a}} long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not elected to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor (full professor).|$|E
5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't think there was a single moment where either of them felt they were working. Paz, however, was {{definitely}} conscious of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> interpreting a role.|$|E
5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E

50|$|Miss Clavel: Madeline's {{teacher and}} minder. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly}} {{believed to be}} a Catholic nun, due to her general appearance, but her attire in Bemelmans' illustrations is actually that of a nurse (the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a nun is also evidenced by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not called Sister or Mother). <b>She</b> <b>is</b> always trying to keep Madeline out of trouble. Voiced by Stevie Vallance.|$|R

5|$|Repair work on Gneisenau was {{completed}} by 26 February 1942, and she was scheduled to deploy to Norway on 6 March. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> still in dry dock, her ammunition stores had been restocked and she was prepared for a short round of trials before her departure. On the night of 26–27 February, however, the British launched a heavy air raid on the ship. The ship {{was hit by a}} single bomb in her forecastle that penetrated the armored deck and exploded. Red-hot bomb fragments ignited propellant charges in the forward turret and caused a tremendous explosion. The turret was thrown off its mount and the entire bow section was burned out. The crew partially flooded the magazine to prevent a more catastrophic explosion. The blast killed 112 men and wounded 21 others.|$|E
5|$|The revolting nobility had thus chosen Uroš {{as their}} {{candidate}} for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a {{war for the}} throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced {{to give up the}} crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš quickly captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav's wife, Beloslava. Beloslava spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the organizer of the resistance against Uroš is known from an edict dated to the summer of 1243, in which the Ragusans swore to King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava's resistance work. Since Vladislav is not mentioned anywhere, it means that he was likely imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{returned}} to Britain to become senior lecturer and {{acting director of}} research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With {{the help of a}} Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled {{the rest of the family}} out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.|$|E

5|$|She was a costumed crime-fighter like Batman, yet in {{many ways}} not an exact counterpart. For example, the {{contents}} of her utility purse were actually weapons disguised as stereotypical feminine products such as lipstick, cosmetic compacts, charm bracelets, and hair nets. Batwoman appeared regularly {{in the pages of}} Batman and Detective Comics through the early 1960s. Although letters from fans indicated Batwoman had become popular with readers, editor Julius Schwartz considered the heroine, as well as other Batman-related characters, to be inappropriate for the new direction he planned to take the Batman universe. Following the revamp to Detective Comics in 1964, Batwoman was removed from the series. The 'new' Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, not only replaced Batwoman as Batman's female counterpart, she surpassed the original heroine in popularity. Batgirl also proved to be more appropriate for her time period and the realistic approach DC Comics began taking with its characters. Unlike Batwoman, Gordon's Batgirl used a utility belt and various gadgets similar to Batman's, {{in addition to being a}} skilled martial artist and possessing a doctorate in her civilian identity. Despite requests from readers to revive Batwoman, DC's editorial staff initially declined to bring the character out of retirement, considering the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> specifically created to be a love interest for Batman.|$|E
25|$|Beth Doe (known officially as Incident No. N3-27244) is {{the name}} given to an {{unidentified}} young European-American woman who was found murdered on December 20, 1976, in White Haven, Pennsylvania. The brutality of the crime, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pregnant when she was killed {{and the length of}} time that she has remained unidentified created national attention.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Van Hollen's election, {{incumbent}} Connie Morella had {{won eight}} {{elections in the}} district, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a Republican in a district that had swung heavily Democratic. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively liberal voting record, including support for abortion rights, gay rights, gun control and increased environmental protections.|$|E

25|$|Williams and {{her mother}} Helen co-authored a memoir {{entitled}} You Have No Idea, published in April 2012. In the book, Williams discusses her childhood, rise to fame, and personal struggles (including life with type 1 diabetes), including the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sexually molested by a woman when she was 10 years old. She also spoke candidly about having an abortion {{while she was in}} high school.|$|E
25|$|By 1918, the U.S. Army Medical Corps {{realized}} there was a shortage of medical anesthesiologists, a low-salary specialty required in military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. One of the first civilian doctors contracted by the Army was a Puerto Rican woman, who despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not {{an active member of}} the military, contributed with her professional skills to the war effort.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} election, Layton stated {{he was in}} favour of Green Party leader Elizabeth May speaking at the leaders debates, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> once again being discouraged by the Canadian media networks. The NDP also embarked upon the largest advertising campaign in its history, focusing on the Harper Government's health care record. He also dedicated the federal election campaign to former Saskatchewan Premier Allan Blakeney, who died about halfway through the campaign.|$|E

25|$|Next day Subtile {{captured}} Roebuck, {{firing on}} her despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> flying American colours and hence was a neutral vessel. The French plundered Roebuck, transferring both that plunder and Highland Chiefs guns {{and some other}} items to Subtile. After about 30 hours Pineau dispatched Highland Chief to Mauritius. He put all his prisoners aboard Roebuck, put some extra water and provisions aboard her, and sent her on to India. She arrived at Vizagaptam around 5 March.|$|E
25|$|Mindy Cohn, in the E! True Hollywood Story, {{stated that}} the {{situation}} was the opposite for her. She had been losing weight during this period due to an interest in dancing, and the producers asked her to stop because much of her character's identity hinged on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> overweight. Cohn said the producers compromised with her regarding her weight by dressing her in baggy clothing to make her appear heavier than she was.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Dolores Piñero, U.S. Army Medical CorpsPiñero, who {{despite the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not {{an active member}} of the military, was the first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under {{contract}} during World War I. At first she was turned down, however after writing a letter to the Army Surgeon General in Washington, D.C. she was ordered her to report to Camp Las Casas in Santurce, Puerto Rico. On October 1918, She signed her contract with the Army.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of her anxieties {{about her husband}} and her son put her under a great deal of strain, which was increased by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pregnant at the time with her youngest child, Abena, who was extremely ill for much of her infancy. Nevertheless, she continued to maintain a stable home for her children and to work quietly for her husband's release, with the assistance of her mother, Lady Cripps, who was able to visit her son-in-law at Ussher Fort in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Canterbury {{attended}} the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of Crete in May 1991. During that deployment, Canterbury became the last {{ship in the}} Royal New Zealand Navy to ever wear the distinctive white funnel stripe denoting the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the senior ship within the 11th Frigate Squadron when Captain Alasdair Clayton-Greene departed the ship in Lumut, Malaysia in April 1991. It was determined that only when a Captain commanded a frigate (as the senior office afloat) would this insignia be displayed - which never occurred again in the Royal New Zealand Navy.|$|E
25|$|This trend only {{lasted for}} a couple months, however, when support for Congresswoman Michele Bachmann began to increase, {{due in large part}} to the support she was able to garner through the Tea Party movement, of which she is a {{founding}} member of the Tea Party Caucus in the United States House of Representatives. Bachmann also strongly played up the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> born in Waterloo, Iowa, where she also officially kicked off her candidacy, before eventually moving to Minnesota with her family when she became a teenager.|$|E
