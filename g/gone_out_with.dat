25|$|In 1990, Senna took a {{commanding}} {{lead in the}} championship with six wins, two second places, and three thirds. With Prost gone to Ferrari, {{he also had a}} new teammate in Austrian driver Gerhard Berger. Among his victories were the opening round in Phoenix, in which he diced for the lead for several laps with a then-unknown Jean Alesi before coming out on top, and in Germany, where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. As the season reached its final quarter, however, Alain Prost in his Ferrari rose to the challenge with five wins, including a crucial victory in Spain where he and teammate Nigel Mansell finished 1–2 for the Scuderia. Senna had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost was now reduced to 9 points with two races remaining.|$|E
500|$|Rigby said Hannah {{had married}} Darren {{to try to}} fit in and impress people. She added that Hannah would never have <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Darren willingly, [...] "not even under the influence". She felt Hannah stayed married to Darren to annoy her parents and to get attention. Darren begins scheming with Cindy to scam The Dog. Darren decides to stay married {{to try to get}} The Dog back, so proposes that they do not get their {{marriage}} annulled to Hannah. Dawson said, regarding his plan to scam Hannah, that [...] "Hannah wants an annulment and so does Darren … at first. The cogs begin to turn in his twisted mind after Cindy points out that being married to Hannah could get him The Dog back. He plans to pretend he's falling in love with her and, motivated by money, tries to make her fall in love with him".|$|E

She was interviewed by Alan Yentob during the BBC's Imagine documentary Spiderwoman about Louise Bourgeois, aired in the UK on 13 November 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} in Curve, O'Connor commented, [...] "I'm a dyke… although I haven’t been very open {{about that and}} throughout {{most of my life}} I've <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> blokes because I haven't necessarily been terribly comfortable about being a big lesbian mule. But I actually am a dyke." [...] However, soon after in an {{interview in}} The Independent, she stated, [...] "I believe it was overcompensating of me to declare myself a lesbian. It was not a publicity stunt. I was trying to make someone else feel better. And have subsequently caused pain for myself. I am not in a box of any description." [...] In a magazine article and in a programme on RTÉ (Ryan Confidential, broadcast on RTÉ on 29 May 2003), she stated that while most of her sexual relationships had been with men, she has had three relationships with women.|$|E
2500|$|Loveless' second single, [...] "I Did", was {{released}} in April 1986. The song had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> releases from four other MCA singers, {{all of whom had}} album contracts. Shortly after its release, Roger Bowen asked Loveless to come into his office where he explained to her that he wanted to pull the song from radio because it was succeeding too well. [...] "I have to be fair to the other artists". In return, he would give Loveless an album deal and she could release [...] "I Did" [...] as a single from her first album. This produced the self-titled Patty Loveless album, being initially released on October 1, 1986 in a promotional form, with a full release on February 21, 1987. The singles, [...] "Wicked Ways" [...] and [...] "After All", were released from that album, which again, did not do well on the charts but garnered sufficient airplay that Tony Brown decided to sign Loveless to a long-term recording contract.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chief of}} these were On Apostasy (1676), a sad account of {{religion}} under the Restoration; On the Holy Spirit (1677-1678) and The Doctrine of Justification (1677). In 1680, however, Stillingfleet having on 11 May preached his sermon on [...] "The Mischief of Separation," [...] Owen defended the Nonconformists from the charge of schism in his Brief Vindication. Baxter and Howe also answered Stillingfleet, who replied in The Unreasonableness of Separation. Owen again answered this, and then left the controversy to a swarm of eager combatants. From this time to his death he was occupied with continual writing, disturbed only by suffering from kidney stones and asthma, and by the absurd charge of being concerned in the Rye House Plot. His most important work was his Treatise on Evangelical Churches, in which were contained his latest views regarding church government. He died at Ealing, just twenty-one years after he had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> so many others on St Bartholomew's day in 1662, and was buried on 4 September 1683 in Bunhill Fields.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{focus on}} her lack of {{relationships}} is {{generally considered to be}} the driving force for her depression; her mother later summarized [...] "her suicide was simply because her personal life was not enough." [...] She lamented to co-workers that her 30th birthday was approaching and she was still a virgin who had never been on more than two dates with a man. Her brother Greg later recalled several times she had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a man before moving to Sarasota, but agreed she had trouble connecting socially in the beach resort town. He believed her constant self-deprecation for being [...] "dateless" [...] contributed to her ongoing depression. In a later interview, Greg stated that Christine had been in two serious relationships: the first had been when she was a teenager and was with a man in his twenties who had subsequently died in a car accident, and the second had been as an adult, but she had broken it off under pressure from her antisemitic father because the boyfriend was Jewish.|$|E
