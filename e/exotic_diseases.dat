40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{discusses the}} place of <b>exotic</b> <b>disease</b> theory in relation to Indigenous depopulation and epistemology in the pedagogy of western education. The author suggests there are significant concerns about <b>exotic</b> <b>disease</b> theory which could manifest in less than satisfactory teaching of Indigenous content, particularly when the educator is explaining Indigenous depopulation. Another important consideration is the potential defamatory nature of <b>exotic</b> <b>disease</b> theory, and its derogative portrayal of Indigenous people as immune deficient. It is suggested {{that the use of}} <b>exotic</b> <b>disease</b> theory in teaching pedagogy is in need of ongoing awareness and refinement.

However, there has been limited research undertaken to understand how farmers think about and carry out <b>exotic</b> <b>disease</b> control practices within the social sciences. Drawing on aspects of Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorisation Theory, this paper explores how the ‘good farmer’ identity concept influences farmers’ <b>exotic</b> livestock <b>disease</b> control practices. Using findings from an in-depth, large-scale qualitative study with animal keepers and veterinarians, the paper identifies three context specific and at times conflicting ‘good farmer’ identities. Additionally, a defensive component is noted whereby farmers suggest an inability to carry out their role as a ‘good farmer’ due to government failings, poor practice undertaken by ‘bad farmers’, as well as the uncontrollable nature of <b>exotic</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{national}} standstill {{was decided}} by the National Committee for Exotic Animal Disease to begin at 1pm on Saturday 25 August. Each state and territory was responsible for enacting the legal instrument within their borders. All horse movements were halted within New South Wales on 25 August, initially for 72 hours. The Control Order was made under the <b>Exotic</b> <b>Diseases</b> of Animals Act 1991 making it illegal to move horses. The Australian Capital Territory, contained wholly within New South Wales, was also declared a quarantine zone with no horse movements permitted across the border. The whole of Victoria was declared a Control Area on 25 August; shortly after, movement bans within Victoria were lifted, but bans on the import of horses and equine gear into Victoria remained until 15 January 2008. Western Australia imposed a 72-hour standstill. [...] Queensland Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries Tim Mulherin declared the entire state an Equine Standstill Zone from 25 August.|$|E

The 2002 – 2003 <b>Exotic</b> Newcastle <b>Disease</b> (END) {{outbreak}} in Southern California poultry pro-vided {{an opportunity to}} evaluate environmental air sampling as an efficient and cost-effective means of sampling flocks for detection of a circulating virus. <b>Exotic</b> Newcastle <b>Disease</b> virus was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR from air samples collected using a wetted-wall cyclone-style air sampler placed within 2 m of birds in 2 commercial flocks suspected of being naturally exposed to END virus during the outbreak. <b>Exotic</b> Newcastle <b>Disease</b> virus was detected after 2 hours of air sampling the poultry-house environments of the 2 naturally infected flocks.

In addition, the introduction of non-native wild ungulate species in areas occupied by the ibex (e.g. fallow deer and mouflon in the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park) increased the grazing pressure, as well as the risk of transmission of both native and <b>exotic</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E
