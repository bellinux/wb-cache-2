40|$|An {{automated}} {{colorimetric method}} for determination of ascorbic acid has been de-veloped. This method utilizes diazotized 4 -methoxy- 2 -nitroanaline and produces a stable color. It {{is suitable for}} direct measurement of ascorbic acid in serum and urine. NIlANY CLINICIANS have reported that ascorbic acid, when administered in large concentration, has some therapeutic value {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia (1). Other authors have reported finding specific meta-bolic abnormalities associated with ascorbic acid deficiencies (2). It is known that a biochemical abnormality involving ascorbic acid exists in schizophrenic patients, and this knowledge has increased the number of requests for its determination in serum and urine. There are many suitable methods for the detection of ascorbic acid in blood plasma, serum, and urine; however, {{for the most part they}} have not been automated. With an increasing demand for a greater number of chemical determinations and a decreasing supply of skilled personnel, continued automation for many more laboratory methods seems to be the answer to the problem. With this thought in mind, an attempt was made to develop a method suitable for determining ascorbic acid in serum and urine. The automated method as described by Nesset etal (3) involved the preparation of filtrates. With large volumes of determinations, the extra manipulation makes the procedure undesirable. Therefore, a di-rect color reaction taking place with serum or urine in the presence of proteins was sought. The method of Schmall et at. (4) using diazotized 4 -methoxy- 2 -nitroaniline was selected for modification and adaptation to the AutoAnalyzer.

Displacement of the cultured cells on the plane was expressed as a sequential change of a <b>pen</b> <b>recorder</b> and in this sys tem, the displacement of 1. 5 μm corresponded to a change of 100 mV of the potential level.

One of the morphological characteristics in movement of the cultured brain tumor cells was ruffling membrane formation at the periphery of the cytoplasm, the same as that observed in other mammalian cells. Direction and speed of the cell displacement were closely correlated with the site of formation and activity of ruffling. The glioblastoma and meningioma cells showed conspicuous ruffling activity.

40|$|Serotonin or 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), is a monoamine {{neurotransmitter}} synthesised from L-tryptophan in serotonergic neurons and enterochromaffin {{cells of}} the gastrointestinal tract. This neurotransmitter is widely distributed in the animal and plant kingdom and regulates some central and peripheral functions through several types of specific serotonergic (5 -HT) receptors. Since {{it is known that}} the effect of serotonin, especially in pathological conditions, is very important, we believe that determining the types of receptors for this substance would make it possible to use their agonist or antagonists, which would undoubtedly enhance the pharmacotherapy of functional disruption of the small intestine in broilers. Investigations were carried out on isolated smooth muscle strips of the circular and longitudinal layer of the broiler small intestine (strip dimension 3 - 4 mm x 2 cm).

Using the obtained results, it can be concluded that 5 HT 1 A type receptors are present in smooth muscles of the broiler small intestine, duodenum and ileum, especially in the longitudinal smooth muscle layer which reacted with contractions even to low serotonin concentration (10 - 6), but not in the jejunum...|$|R

The effect of CCK- 8 was antagonized by dibutyryl cGMP (Bt 2 cGMP) (10 (- 3) M), the VIP-antagonist (N-Ac-Tyr 1, D-Phe 2) -growth hormone-releasing factor-(1 - 29) -NH 2, and abolished by tetrodotoxin. In contrast, VIP's relaxing action was tetrodotoxin insensitive. 10 (- 11) - 10 (- 7) M CCK- 8 stimulated dose-dependent release of VIP (0. 5 - 2. 2 fm/ml. mg tissue), which was not inhibited by atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine, but was antagonized by 10 (- 3) M Bt 2 cGMP and tetrodotoxin. In addition CCK- 8 and VIP generated dose-related (10 (- 10) - 10 (- 7) M) increases in sphincter of Oddi cAMP levels that were not affected by atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine. Furthermore, 10 (- 5) - 10 (- 2) M 8 -bromo-cAMP caused dose-dependent relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. In separate studies, a 2 -h incubation in physiological solution containing 12 parts/ 1, 000 of rabbit VIP antiserum antagonized sphincter relaxation caused by 4 nM CCK- 8 and 6 nM VIP. The antiserum also significantly decreased the sphincter of Oddi cAMP level stimulated by 4 nM CCK- 8 by 48 +/- 15 %.
