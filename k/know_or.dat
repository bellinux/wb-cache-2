5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then {{make decisions based on}} what they <b>know,</b> <b>or</b> do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not <b>know,</b> <b>or</b> chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E

A similar poll in May 2011 found that 55% supported legalization, 42% opposed it, and 5% didn't <b>know</b> <b>or</b> have no opinion. The June 2011 poll showed a 55%/50%/5% split.|$|E

25|$|Confidence limits can {{be found}} if the {{probability}} distribution of the parameters is <b>known,</b> <b>or</b> an asymptotic approximation is made, or assumed. Likewise statistical tests on the residuals can be made if the probability distribution of the residuals is <b>known</b> <b>or</b> assumed. The probability distribution of any linear combination of the dependent variables can be derived if the probability distribution of experimental errors is <b>known</b> <b>or</b> assumed. Inference is particularly straightforward if the errors are assumed to follow a normal distribution, which implies that the parameter estimates and residuals will also be normally distributed conditional on {{the values of the}} independent variables.|$|R

Patients: 120 participants with <b>known</b> <b>or</b> suspected locoregional pancreatic cancer.

His results, which include the possibility of 'Don't know / no answer' show a relatively stable, but structurally lower preference for the monarchy than TNS NIPO: on average, 70% backs the monarchy, 25% is in favour of a republic, and 6% doesn't <b>know</b> <b>or</b> gives no answer.|$|E
