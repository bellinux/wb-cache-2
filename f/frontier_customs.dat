His responsibilities were extended quickly: initially involving himself with the regions of Mewar, Kota, Sirohi and Bundi, he soon added Marwar to his portfolio and in 1821 was also given responsibility for Jaisalmer. These areas were considered a strategic buffer zone against Russian advances from the north which, it was feared, might result in a move into India via the Khyber Pass. Tod believed that to achieve cohesion it was necessary that the Rajput states should contain only Rajput people, with all others being expelled. This would assist in achieving stability in the areas, thus limiting {{the likelihood of the}} inhabitants being influenced by outside forces. According to Ramya Sreenivasan, a researcher of religion and caste in early modern Rajasthan and of colonialism, Tod's [...] "transfers of territory between various chiefs and princes helped to create territorially consolidated states and 'routinised' political hierarchies." [...] His successes were plentiful and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that Tod was [...] so successful in his efforts to restore peace and confidence that within less than a year some 300 deserted towns and villages were repeopled, trade revived, and, in spite of the abolition of transit duties and the reduction of <b>frontier</b> <b>customs,</b> the state revenue had reached an unprecedented amount. During the next five years Tod earned the respect of the chiefs and people, and was able to rescue more than one princely family, including that of the ranas of Udaipur, from the destitution to which they had been reduced by Maratha raiders.|$|E

The remote modules periodically read signals from sensors and send result to the controller board that display the received data on LCD Panel. In sensor networks a set of nodes randomly deployed communicate through wireless links and provide the information as on when required. Since these nodes run with little power mostly running with batteries the hardware and software must be designed appropriately. In this paper, TEA is implemented using Zigbee wireless link. The use of Zigbee Module and Microcontroller ensures a robust and secure communication between system modules with Low power consumption...|$|R

5000|$|A neutral {{territory}} {{was established}} between the British territory of Gibraltar and Spain {{after the end}} of the 1727 siege. A strip of land 600 toises (about 1.2 km) long, more than two cannon shots' distance between the British and Spanish guns, was called [...] "the neutral ground" [...] and shown as such on older maps. In 1908, the British built a fence in a portion claimed to be the British half of the neutral territory. Spain does not recognize British sovereignty over the isthmus (including the border), asserting it is Spanish soil. Although both the United Kingdom and Spain are part of the European Union, the border is now a de facto international <b>frontier</b> with <b>customs</b> and immigration checks; Spain does not formally recognize it as a [...] "frontier", referring to it as a [...] "fence". Whatever its name, Gibraltar opted out of the European Union Customs Union and is not part of the Schengen Area; the border is open 24 hours a day, with customs duties payable on designated goods entering Spain or Gibraltar.|$|R

Trier became seat of one these district administrations, the Regierungsbezirk Trier. Because of the new political situation and the new <b>customs</b> <b>frontiers</b> in the West, the economy of Trier began a steady decline that was to last until 1840.

40|$|That {{regional}} {{identities are}} constructed is now {{something of a}} truism in academic research. More recently regions have been conceptualized {{in the framework of}} Frontier and Border Studies, thus emphasizing their relationship to their neighbours in another state across a boundary line. In early modern <b>frontier</b> regions, <b>customs</b> and culture, law and languages, and social and administrative structures very often did not conform to national norms – cross-border ties, and acculturation were of the essence of frontier society. The essays of this volume reassess the role of politics in early modern border societies. Recent historiographical trends, so it is argued, have underplayed this, focusing on cultural exchange and transfer rather than on division and exclusion. The authors investigate whether the focus on communality and reciprocity put forward in recent scholarship has not overshadowed the importance of categories such as {{the rule of law and}} administrative and other institutional networks based on political power structures which were distinct on the two sides of the border. Difference was and is a common feature in Europe and its borders. Borders themselves provide normative patterns that regulate interaction both between states and border societies. This collection of essays on Frontier and Border Regions in Early Modern Europe addresses a range of problems faced by political authorities in a number of European states c. 1500 – 1800. Instruments of power such as confessional policy, military rule, or the writing of official histories are investigated in their interplay with a regional agenda...|$|R
60|$|A {{week later}} I was at Gex. At St. Claude I had parted from Leroux, and then hired a chaise {{to take me}} to my destination. It was a matter of fifteen {{kilometres}} by road over the <b>frontier</b> of the <b>customs</b> zone and through the most superb scenery I had ever seen in my life. We drove through narrow gorges, on each side of which the mountain heights rose rugged and precipitous to incalculable altitudes above. From time to time only did I get peeps of almost imperceptible tracks along the declivities, tracks on which it seemed as if goats alone could obtain a footing. Once--hundreds of feet above me--I spied a couple of mules descending what seemed like a sheer perpendicular path down the mountain side. The animals appeared to be heavily laden, and I marvelled what forbidden goods lay hidden within their packs and whether in the days that were to come I too should be called upon to risk my life on those declivities {{following in the footsteps of}} the reckless and desperate criminals whom it was my duty to pursue.|$|R

"These two roads," [...] he began, {{tracing the}} {{windings}} {{of a couple}} of thin red lines on the map with the point of his finger, [...] "are the only two made ones that lead {{in and out of the}} district.

But, besides those two roads, the frontier can, of course, be crossed by one or other of the innumerable mountain tracks which are only accessible to pedestrians or mules. That is where our customs officials are powerless, for the tracks are precipitous and offer unlimited cover to those who know every inch of the ground. Several of them lead directly into St. Claude, at some considerable distance from the customs stations, and it is these tracks which are being used by M. Aristide Fournier for the felonious purpose of trading with the enemy--on this I would stake my life. But I mean to be even with him, and if I get the help which I require from you, I am convinced that I can lay him by the heels." ...|$|R

This paper reviews {{economic activities}} {{in connection with}} the Drava River, particularly the milling industry and transportation, during the final period of the existence of the Hungarian-Croatian union. Due to lack of knowledge of the Croatian literature on these issues, the author is mainly restricted to the Hungarian aspect of the topic. By analyzing the transportation of goods on the Drava River by ferry boats, or over bridges, the following can be asserted: - compared to the former sporadic and low-volume shipments, traffic increased rapidly from 1868 to 1918; - ships allowed to ply once again as well as the ferry boats and bridges over the Drava River created conditions for trade; - the absence of <b>customs</b> <b>frontiers,</b> as a result of political decisions, caused an increase of contacts between the Hungarian and Croatian sides (although for this reason only few data are available for present-day analysts!); - the Drava Valley functioned as a unique economic territory and the inhabitants of both sides of the river were in everyday contact. The fact that many places on the Hungarian banks were inhabited by Croatian native speakers facilitated the maintenance of economic and human contacts; - the Drava did not separate but rather connected peasants, families and villages of the two banks...|$|R
40|$|This model, in {{comparison}} to Weber's classical theory is based on few and weak hypotheses {{but they can be}} easily and adequately tested. Neither location figures (Standortsfigur) are supposed nor transport area, transport costs proportional to weight and distance, uniform and equal in every place prices of inputs and outputs are postulated in the model. The places for offering the effectively utilized inputs and the places for marketing the effectively used up outputs are no longer data a priori, but they are determined by the model. The environment of the production unit is enriched because passing points and noteworthy places are taken into account. Geographical data are no longer considered to be a distortion of the perfect economic model, but they are formalized and integrated into the theoretical model. The number and location of multiple establishments are determined in the cases in with they should exist. The dimensions of the establishments and their productive capacity are also taken into consideration, but as dependent variables. Besides, the model admits various extensions by means of some extra complications. It is possible to introduce one or more monetary frontiers. To do so it is sufficient to partition the H and H' p-graphs suitably, according to the case, and utilize one or more multipliers equal to the coefficients of change. It is also possible to consider one or several <b>customs</b> <b>frontiers</b> provided that multipliers corresponding to the regulations in each partial subgroup of graphs are introduced. The same holds also in the case of taxes and subventions that would come into question. They will be considered in each partial subgroup, in the H p-graph or the H' p-graph, according to the financial properties represented by their institutions. According to all the rigours the elementary model evidently tolerates those complications provided that the hypothesis of perfect competition is intact, from which their economic neutrality results. The more realistic models issued from the elementary model are exempt from those restrictions. The model presented here, however, remains static. Its dynamization is a question for the future. It has been considered in the quoted case of a model extended to the situation of oligopoly. Lastly this model makes possible the inclusion of classical Weberian theories of location as particular cases because their integration would take for gnanted only a restricted interpretation of the hypotheses and of data as well as a passage from the topological graphs to the metric graphs.
