The dual wheels also allow two anchors on double rollers to be serviced. Vertical capstans, for their part, allow the machinery to be placed below decks, thus lowering the center of gravity (important on boats), and also allow a flexible angle of pull (which means rope or chain can be run out to different <b>fair</b> <b>leads).</b>|$|R

Dance constitutes a major element of the village fairs. The observation of the dancers at each <b>fair</b> <b>leads</b> unavoidably to the question: to which social group do they belong to.

Constrained approximation and <b>fairing</b> <b>lead</b> to a very smooth geometry especially suited for wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulation. A mounting unit with GC 1 fillets to the wing and a simplified half of a fuselage are computed, too. The geometries of those can be modified by changing only a few significant parameters...|$|R

40|$|Subdivision is a {{powerful}} paradigm for the generation of curves and surfaces. It is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and useful {{in a variety of}} applications because of its intimate connection with multiresolution analysis. An important task in computer graphics and geometric modeling is the construction of curves that interpolate a given set of points and minimize a fairness functional (variational design). In the context of subdivision, <b>fairing</b> <b>leads</b> to special schemes requiring the solution of a banded linear system at every subdivision step. We present several examples of such schemes including one that reproduces non-uniform interpolating cubic splines. Expressing the construction in terms of certain elementary operations we are able to embed variational subdivision in the lifting framework, {{a powerful}} technique to construct wavelet filter banks given a subdivision scheme. This allows us to extend the traditional lifting scheme for FIR filters to a certain class of IIR filters. Consequently we show how to build variationally optimal curves and associated, stable wavelets in a straightforward fashion. The algorithms to perform the corresponding decomposition and reconstruction transformations are easy to implement and efficient enough for interactive applications...|$|R

40|$|Strategic {{management}} and ethics impose contradictory pressures on managerial sensemaking. Using concepts from Paul Ricoeur’s philosophical {{work as a}} theoretical lens, this thesis analyzes a longitudinal data set, produced within strategy meetings and interviews in a multinational corporation undergoing a radical change process. It induces a model of ethical sensemaking in strategic management, founded on the processes of irony, compromise and conflict. The thesis demonstrates how the ethical can become possible and tangible in practice. It is an ethics that prompts reactions with on-going practicalities and acknowledges the unpredictable nature of change. Whereas normative business ethics literature has focused on how strategy is <b>fair,</b> <b>leads</b> to good deeds or is made by virtuous people, {{this study suggests that}} ethics is not something separate from the day-to-day, or moment-to-moment activity. It cannot be controlled from a distance. The study shows that business and ethics are not separate – it is about how we live with one another outside of being merely means for one another to gain. Through two interconnected analyses the thesis reveals how strategy work is riddled with tensions and how individuals rely on a number of tactics to navigate in order {{to live up to the}} demands of ethics...|$|R

40|$|Science {{teachers}} {{hope that}} their school science fair will improve participating students’ understandings of science but sometimes, {{as in the}} example of the author’s prior case-example (Nicolle, 2015 a), outcomes of the event fail to deliver the expected gains. Using a personalized mixed-methods approach, in this study the author holistically explores the question “What are the effects of the school science fair on participating students’ understandings of science?” as a means to understanding the (disappointing) outcomes in her own school science fair case-example. An empirical ‘bottoms-up’ process following the tenets of basic qualitative research (Ary, 2006) is used to collate and critically review recent scoped research literature in order to expose and categorize effects of the school science fair on participating students’ understandings of science. In parallel, via an interpretive methodology termed ‘bricolage’ (Kincheloe and Berry, 2004), knowledge from the same literature corpus is assessed ‘tops-down’ {{in the light of the}} author’s personal case example. Finally, aligning with twenty-first century pedagogy (for example, Dillon, 2009), it is discussed how reflections adopting a world-view beyond simplistic notions of success in school science <b>fairs</b> <b>leads</b> the author to new insights into the outcomes of the participant students’ understandings of science. By considering her own case example, the author suggests that a re-framing of expectations by participant teachers and students alike may lead to an enhanced appreciation of how their school science fair has been a valuable catalyst of students’ understandings of science. Further suggestions for research are made for academic stakeholders, school science teachers and their science fair students...|$|R

50|$|Procedural justice {{concerns}} the fairness and the transparency {{of the processes}} by which decisions are made, and may be contrasted with distributive justice (fairness {{in the distribution of}} rights or resources), and retributive justice (fairness in the punishment of wrongs). Hearing all parties before a decision is made is one step which would be considered appropriate to be taken in order that a process may then be characterised as procedurally fair. Some theories of procedural justice hold that <b>fair</b> procedure <b>leads</b> to equitable outcomes, even if the requirements of distributive or restorative justice are not met. It has been suggested that this is the outcome of the higher quality interpersonal interactions often found in the procedural justice process, which has shown to be stronger in affecting the perception of fairness during conflict resolution.|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{realized}} that the exigencies of systems programming require primitives that behave indeterminately.

These differences are based on simple monotonicity properties. In the present paper I review these results and discuss some related phenomena involving a fair stack. I then describe results about fair splitting. These results are based on topological properties rather than simple order-theoretic properties.
