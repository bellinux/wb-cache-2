He {{was very close}} to his uncle and aunt, and also to their daughter, Lal, who was later married to Hari Singh, the future Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. Her death during pregnancy in 1915 reputedly affected him so much that he retracted an earlier proposal to fight with the British Indian Army in Europe. Like his father, Lakhajirajsinhji attended the Rajkumar College in Rajkot. His younger brother, Karasinhji, also attended the school at the same time, and their close relationship, unusual among members of royal families, was noted by the college's principal. Regarded well by both his teachers and his peers, Lakhajirajsinhji was a keen participant in school sports, excelling at tennis, polo, athletics, and the <b>equestrian</b> <b>discipline</b> tent-pegging, for which he was awarded a prize by the Governor of Bombay, Lord Northcote. His preferred sport, however, was cricket, and he captained his school against several other similar Kathiawar institutions. In 1904, during his final season as a student at the college, he reputedly won several matches with his [...] "dashing" [...] bowling, with his highest score of 93 runs made against a Wadhwan high school.
