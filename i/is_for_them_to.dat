5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> block the ball with either their hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage. Sports {{involving}} quick reactions may be helpful, as these help the goalkeeper's reflexes which is a crucial skill.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} a book, as a topological space, was defined by C. A. Persinger and Gail Atneosen in the 1960s. As part of this work, Atneosen already {{considered}} embeddings of graphs in books. The embeddings he studied used the same definition as embeddings of graphs into any other topological space: vertices are represented by distinct points, edges are represented by curves, {{and the only way}} that two edges can intersect <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> meet at a common endpoint.|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, the more likely it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E

50|$|Kahneman and Tversky {{argued that}} this {{difference}} could not be attributed to disappointment, because both had expected to miss their flights. They believed instead that the true explanation was that the students utilized the simulation heuristic and so it <b>was</b> easier <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> imagine minor alterations that would have enabled the second man to arrive in time for his flight than it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> devise the same alterations for the first man.|$|R

5|$|Outside their tree house, Finn and Jake snooze, while BMO (Niki Yang) and N.E.P.T.R. (Andy Milonakis) {{play out}} a spoof of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham. The two break open Finn and Jake's {{treasure}} room, pouring their massive stash of gold {{out into the}} yard, {{as well as the}} Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant (Steve Agee). BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E

Munk's second wife, Zita (Else Jarlbak) has been {{having an affair with}} the vicious horse trainer, Willers (Jørn Jeppesen). When Munk discovers this, he sues for divorce, but Willers now owns outstanding notes on the farm. Ole arrives and meets Munk's daughter, Bente (Tove Maës). The daughter from Munk's first marriage, Bente is sweet woman with a slightly crippled leg from a horse riding accident. Ole quickly becomes taken with Bente. Willers is paid off by Ole and his father and told to disappear. Munk, on his death bed, tells Ole and Bente that his last wish <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> marry.|$|E

25|$|After the funeral, Kōichi, Shige and Keizō leave immediately, {{with only}} Noriko not returning. After they leave, Kyōko is angry {{with them and}} voices her {{complaints}} to Noriko about her siblings by deriding them over being selfish to their family. She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care {{how hard it was}} for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko not to be too harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand how hard it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have to take time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E

[...] The following week Wright proposed the idea to Martin Luther King Jr., who subsequently organized the Poor People's March on Washington. Around the same time CBS broadcast a major documentary, Hunger in America, which had been made on the suggestion of Kennedy to television executive Don Hewitt.|$|E

[...] The reviewer highlighted [...] "Hot to the Touch" [...] as an example of such an example, noting that Flame Princess represents [...] "an uncomplicated yet vastly pertinent metaphor for the hypothesis that the closer you cherish someone, the likelier they are to singe your soft exterior and the easier it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> affectionately melt your exposed heart." [...] Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode a [...] "B", noting that [...] "the season four premiere of this inspired 'toon about a boy and his precocious dog is as colorful, clever, and unpredictably funny as ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|The social {{reactivity}} theory {{alleges that}} all humans, whether {{they like it}} or not, are required to participate in social situations. Since extraverts prefer engaging in social interactions more than introverts, they also derive more positive affect from such situations than introverts do. The support for this theory comes from work of Brian R. Little, who popularized concept of [...] "restorative niches". Little claimed that life often requires people to participate in social situations, and since acting social is {{out of character for}} introverts, it was shown to harm their well-being. Therefore, one way to preserve introverts' well-being <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> recharge as often as possible in places where they can return to their true selves—places Little calls [...] "restorative niches".|$|E

This sets off {{a whole new set of}} fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on [...] "What women want" [...] from a man – evidently it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> [...] "listen, listen, listen".|$|E
2500|$|John Thelwall, {{a democrat}} and radical, was upset by his belief that Burke assumed that {{only a portion of}} the population, the {{informed}} individuals, should be understood as the public. Thelwall also opposed Burke's descriptions of British Jacobins and believed that Burke wanted to legalize their execution. James Mackintosh believed that Burke had a strong linguistic power and agreed that war could be necessary but not with France. To restore the French monarchy, to Mackintosh, would go against France's right as a nation and remove its independence. [...] The only way for the opponents of France to do what is right <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be objective and balanced. William Roscoe, a Unitarian liberal, believed that Burke misunderstood the French revolution and that the British were the aggressors in the situation.|$|E

2500|$|Fitzroy Maclean {{discussed}} Yugoslavia with Churchill in Cairo {{after the}} Tehran Conference. Maclean reported that [...] "…the Partisans, whether we helped them or not, {{would be the}} decisive political factor in Jugoslavia after the war and, secondly that Tito and the other leaders of the movement were openly and avowedly Communist and that the system which they would establish would inevitably be on Soviet lines and, in all probability, strongly oriented towards the Soviet Union." [...] Churchill said that as neither of them intended to live there after the war: [...] "… the less you and I worry about the form of Government they set up, the better. That <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> decide. What interests us is, which of them is doing most harm to the Germans." [...] However, Maclean had also noticed Tito's [...] "independence of mind" [...] and wondered whether Tito might evolve into {{something more than a}} Soviet puppet.|$|E
2500|$|Magneto {{appears in}} the [...] video game voiced by Maurice LaMarche. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver appear on Asteroid M in order to confront Magneto who {{mentions}} that the message they received <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> contain the Space Infinity Stone which had been shattered following an attack by Doombots. When Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver reassemble it, Doctor Doom arrives and reveals that his attack on Magneto was just a ploy {{so that he could}} get the Space Infinity Gem. When Doctor Doom ends up defeated, he tricks Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch into swiping the Space Infinity Gem. Doctor Doom's attacks on Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch cause Magneto to use his magnetic abilities on Doctor Doom who reveals that he had placed Asteroid M on self-destruct. Magneto sends Doctor Doom flying where the Space Infinity Gem transports Doctor Doom to a cage. Magneto then gives his children the Space Infinity Gem. After Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver leave, Magneto claps off the self-destruct sequence. In the DS Version, he is a playable character on the last level of Challenge Mode.|$|E

If information is skewed to paint a bleaker environmental picture than is justified by reality, as he claims, then we will in turn skew our limited resources {{in favor of the}} environment and away from other important causes. ... Then Lomborg proceeds to weigh the causes championed by the environmental movement against a deliberately circumscribed universe of other possible [...] "good causes." [...] It is up to us, he says, to make responsible decisions about whether to protect the environment or [...] "boost Medicaid, increase funding to the arts, or cut taxes. ... The worse they can make this state appear, the easier it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> convince us we need to spend more money on the environment rather on hospitals, kindergartens, etc." [...] A few pages later he again claims {{that the purpose of the}} Litany is to cause us to prioritize the environment over [...] "hospitals, child day care, etc." ... But who is really failing to consider how our money is spent? As Lomborg notes, [...] "We will never have enough money," [...] and therefore, [...] "Prioritization is absolutely essential." [...] Why, then, does he weigh the environment only against hospitals and childcare, rather than against, say, industry subsidies and defense spending?" ...|$|E
