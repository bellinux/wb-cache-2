Chabad texts tend to systematic characterisation and presentation compared to the more homiletical-faith aims of most Hasidic literature. Particular themes of focus emerge in the teachings of each subsequent leader according to the mystical and social circumstances of the times. In the last generation, the 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe, while <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> Maamar in Chabad to its cumulative conclusion, made its in-depth Kabbalistic exegetical method secondary to the newly emphasised Chabad format of informal analytical Likkutei Sichos talks, his central teachings, to enable greatest application of Hasidism to tangible spirituality and outreach. Chabad Maamarim are usually named after their opening quotation from Scripture, though are sometimes arranged as Kuntreisim studies or collected Sefarim books. From the 4th Rebbe onwards, Maamarim often comprise extended Hemsheichim series on a theme.|$|R

40|$|Difficulties {{controlling}} one's thoughts {{have been}} related to several psychopathological states and are core issues in clinical evaluation and treatment. For this reason, Luciano, Algarabel, Tomás, and Martínez (2005) <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Thought</b> Control Ability Questionnaire (TCAQ). The {{aim of this study}} was to propose a reliable, valid French version of this questionnaire. To do so, a two-step methodology was followed. In a first study, the 25 items of the TCAQ were translated into French, and data were collected from a sample of undergraduates. The results revealed that two items were problematic in terms of the questionnaire's face validity and internal consistency. In a second study, data were collected using the remaining 23 items with a new sample of undergraduates. This time, the results revealed that the 23 -item French TCAQ possesses good internal consistency and very high reliability, and fits with a unidimensional model of thought control ability. Convergent validity was found with measures of worry and obsessive symptoms. The usefulness of the TCAQ as a tool for clinicians and researchers in the field of self-regulation is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Many European {{football}} {{clubs have}} developed a more strategic and business-like thinking within their organizations {{that has resulted in}} partly altered business models and views on competition, sustainable competitive advantage and organization. In this thesis we investigate this development with a certain focus on Swedish football industry. The investigation is driven by the question of how Swedish football clubs strategically develop themselves and their competitive advantages in order to manage the various challenges they are currently facing. We apply both traditional strategic theories and a resource based view (RBV). Further, we also introduce the concept of organizational identity as a relevant strategic tool. In order to understand this we have conducted an in-depth interpretative study aimed at understanding how key people in the industry at large and in two football clubs make sense of and understand these challenges. The empirical material thus basically consists of case studies of two clubs that together with conceptions of football management and strategy constitutes the analytical framework of the thesis. Our practical contribution frames the problems with the strategic work of Swedish football clubs. Our theoretical contribution <b>develops</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper covers five {{complete}} Czech {{translations of}} Pushkin's Eugene Onegin by Václav Čeněk Bendl, Václav Alois Jung, Josef Hora, Olga Mašková and Milan Dvořák. Translation quality assessment {{is based on}} the question of how each rendering reflects semantic complexities of the original. Analysis of each translation involves the significant phonetic, imaginative, ideational and structural features of Pushkin's novel in verse. Often a particular rendering is contrasted with another one to demonstrate its style more clearly, including some of the incomplete renderings of Onegin, especially that by Jan Evangelista Purkyně. All the translations analysed are put into their historical context. It follows that most of them were created at some crucial point in the Czech history (1860, 1937 and 1966) and in some way reflect "the spirit of their time". Bendl changed the structure of the original by a shift in metre. He replaced iambic tetrameter by iambic pentameter. As a result, he was given more room to <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> and imagery of Pushkin's novel in verse. However, he often turned his translation into renarration and contaminated his rendering {{with a great deal of}} semantic shifts. [...] ...|$|R

He condemned secularism and liberalism [...] "as a sin and a poisonous sect for espousing 'the absolute sovereignty of the individual completely independent of God and of His authority; sovereignty of society absolutely independent of anything beyond itself; ...freedom of thought with no limitation whatsoever politically, morally, or religiously. ...condition that denied the need for divine revelation.' ...resulted in a state worse 'than being a blasphemer, thief, adulterer or murderer.'" [...] Salvany held that Liberalism was a grave sin that needed to be combated, <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of Pope Pius IX he wrote [...] "It must be said that liberalism in the idea is the absolute error, and in facts the absolute disorder.

40|$|What role does {{religious}} transcendence play {{in liberal}} democracies? In Jürgen Habermas’s early political {{theory of the}} bourgeois public sphere, religion was downplayed if not dismissed completely. In {{the past several years}} however, he has developed a greater interest in religion. Habermas seems to like the positive solidarity-forming effects religion can have on communities that mediate in a public sphere between private individuals and state authority. However, in light of continuing terrorist activity, he is deeply critical of any sort of other worldly transcendence that is too open to violent cooption. Nonetheless, Habermas relates his renewal of a critically engaged public sphere of debate to universalized rational procedures which he discusses in light of a philosophical notion of “detranscendentalization. ” However, if it is the case that the solidarity of communities is being eroded by the influences of mass media and free market globalization as Habermas claims, then a further reflection on the way religious communities form around shared transcendent beliefs is required. Are his detranscendentalized rational procedures of critical debate adequate in inspiring the critical power communities need to solidify themselves against state authority?
