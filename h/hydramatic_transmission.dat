25|$|The same {{assortment}} of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications {{in order to}} enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline {{as a result of}} a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the Turbo <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission</b> became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 Lacrosse {{features}} a new mild hybrid as its base model. Dubbed eAssist, the 2012 Lacrosse introduced GM's second generation Belt-Alternator-Starter system. The non-hybrid 4-cylinder {{is no longer}} offered. The system consists of a 115-volt lithium-ion battery pack, a 15kW electric motor capable of adding 15 horsepower of assist while accelerating, and the next generation 6T40 GM <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission</b> with reduced friction components over the previous generation. The eAssist LaCrosse delivers a class leading fuel economy of 25 mpg city and 36 mpg highway. In addition to providing additional power to the 182hp 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, the BAS-II system allows for engine start/stop operation when the vehicle isn't moving and allows for complete fuel cut off to the engine during deceleration.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, {{once again}} {{the top of the}} line Oldsmobile series was the 98. Standard {{equipment}} included Safety-vee steering wheel, turn signals, air scoop brakes, electric windshield wipers, safety-spectrum speedometer, carpets with rubber inserts, padded dash, courtesy lamps, wheel trim rings, Star-lite headliner, two-speed windshield wipers, chrome roof side moldings, Jetaway <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> power steering, power brakes, windshield washers, electric clock, and deep twist carpeting.

50|$|Although {{traditionally}} considered second gear, {{there are}} other names used. Chrysler models with a three-speed automatic since the late 1980s have called this gear 3 while using the traditional names for Drive and Low. Oldsmobile has called second gear as the 'Super' range — which was first used on their 4-speed <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> although {{the use of this}} term continued until the early 1980s when GM's Turbo <b>Hydramatic</b> automatic <b>transmissions</b> were standardized by all of their divisions years after the 4-speed Hydramatic was discontinued.|$|R
50|$|The early 1950s Cadillacs were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In 1953 the General Motors Hydramatic Plant {{burned to the}} ground, leaving Cadillac without a source of transmissions. Buick Dynaflow transmissions were hastily adapted to Cadillac mount points, and some 19,000 1953 Model 62 Cadillacs, and some 28,000 Cadillacs of all models, were equipped with Dynaflow transmissions.Several thousand 1953 Oldsmobiles were also equipped with Dynaflow.|$|R
50|$|Nacker {{was also}} part of the team of {{engineers}} that developed the General Motors <b>Hydramatic</b> automatic <b>transmission.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A major styling {{change was}} seen in 1958. The 98 series again had its own {{exclusive}} wheelbase of 126.5inches while sharing the more powerful Rocket V8 with the Super 88. Four body styles were available. Standard series equipment included four headlights, oil filter, turn signals, printed circuit instrument cluster, aluminum anodized grille, padded dash, foam rubber padded seat cushions, courtesy lights, parking brake light, special side moldings, chrome rocker panel moldings, Jetaway <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> power steering and brakes, dual exhaust, electric clock, color accented wheel discs, and chrome wheel frames. Interiors could be ordered {{in a variety of}} colored leathers, cloth, and Morocceen. Standard tires were [...] by [...] Air suspension was added as an option. Also new was a speed warning device, which could be set towards a certain speed and when the limit was reached, a buzzer would sound, alerting the driver of the vehicle to slow down.|$|E
2500|$|The 1972 Caprice {{received}} a facelift with a revised grille that was lower in height than the '71 model {{flanked by a}} new bumper with increased protection one year ahead of the Federal mandate. This was done by a bumper within bumper design. Heavy gauge beams reinforced the bumper which {{are attached to the}} frame. The rear bumper also featured this design and now had the triple taillights now mounted in the bumper. Engine offerings were carried over from 1971 with the switch to [...] "net" [...] horsepower ratings including [...] for the standard two-barrel [...] Turbo Fire V8, [...] ( [...] with optional dual exhaust) for the four-barrel Turbo Jet 400 big-block V8 and [...] for the four-barrel dual exhaust [...] Turbo Jet V8 (rated at [...] in wagons with single exhaust). Turbo <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes continued as standard equipment. New to the Caprice lineup was a pillared four-door sedan. All models also featured a revised [...] "Astro Ventilation" [...] system utilizing vents in the doorjambs that replaced the troublesome 1971 version that used vents in the trunklid and {{turned out to be a}} major source of complaints to Chevy (and other GM divisions) dealers from customers. 6-way power seats, 8-track tape players, and air conditioning were optional.|$|E
2500|$|For 1961 only, it {{was renamed}} Classic 98; nevertheless, most factory {{literature}} {{refers to the}} line as the Ninety-Eight. It offered five body styles. The sedan was now called the Town Sedan. The 4-door 4-window hardtop body style was now called the Sport Sedan instead of the Holiday Sedan. A new 4-door 6-window hardtop body style, previously exclusive to Cadillac and the Buick Electra was now offered and the Holiday Sedan name was transferred to it. This {{was the first time}} not all Oldsmobile hardtops were called Holidays. Overall sales plunged from 59,364 to 43,010, probably due to the introduction of the new Starfire series, the 98's low point following the production record set in 1955. Standard equipment included padded dash, Safety spectrum speedometer, floating propeller, air scoop brakes, two-speed windshield wipers, Safety-Vee steering wheel, parking brake lamp, courtesy lamps, oil filter, windshield washer, electric clock, Roto <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> power steering and power brakes. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14inches. With the [...] Rocket now standard equipment on the Oldsmobile 88 a higher compression version was made standard equipment on the 98 and Super 88 with horsepower rising to 325 in 1961 and 330 in 1962. It was dubbed the [...] "Skyrocket" [...] from 1961-63.|$|E
5000|$|... 1948 was {{the last}} year for the Torpedo, {{receiving}} a new grill. [...] The <b>Hydramatic</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> became optional. Base price was $1,500.|$|R
50|$|For 1987, GM {{changed the}} {{nomenclature}} of their Turbo <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> — the THM400 was renamed to the '3L80' (three forward speeds, longitudinal positioning, and an arbitrary 'strength' of 80, {{the second highest}} such rating assigned). The 3L80HD was introduced in 1987 as the HD unit used in passenger trucks. In 1991, a four-speed overdrive version, the 4L80-E, replaced the THM400 in Chevrolet/GMC pickups, vans, SUVs, and commercial vehicles. The 4L80E (and its successor 4L85E) was the first Hydramatic to incorporate electronic controls — {{almost all of the}} THM400/3L80/3L80HD's components are interchangeable.|$|R
50|$|This {{continued}} for 1953 except the Wing was dropped {{and replaced by}} the Aero-Falcon, which had the six-cylinder Lightning engine. All 1953s were available as two-door or four-door sedans except the Eagle, which was a two-door hardtop. One-piece windshields {{were given to the}} Aces and the Eagles, but the Lark and Falcon retained the split windshield. Rear windows remained the same. Export Larks were available with the four-cylinder F-head engine. Dual-range <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> were bought from GM and were optional in Aces and Eagles beginning in August 1953.|$|R
2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillight lenses were all red as the backup lights were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps {{in the center of the}} taillights. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional [...] Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the [...] 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission</b> that previously only available with the [...] and [...] V8s was now optional with the [...] Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.|$|E

5000|$|The Super Turbine 300 (Jetaway) was {{introduced}} for the 1964 model {{year as a}} replacement for the earlier Buick Dynaflow and Oldsmobile/Pontiac Roto <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b> It was the only automatic offered on GM A platform cars (Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Pontiac Tempest) through 1966, and was available on the full-sized Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile Jetstar 88/Delmont 88 as a less expensive alternative to the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic. If it was used with a V8 motor, the transmission had liquid lines which is cooled by the radiator whereas those coupled to the Chevrolet-sourced inline six was air cooled.|$|R
5000|$|The Roto Hydramatic was {{phased out}} after the 1964 model year {{in favor of the}} {{two-speed}} Super Turbine 300 and three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic. As with previous <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> auto safety experts criticized GM for the Hydramatic design which had a shift quadrant sequence of Park-Neutral-Drive-Second-Low-Reverse (P-N-D-S-L-R) due to the placement of reverse adjacent to a forward gear as opposed to the more common P-R-N-D-S-L sequence found in most other automatic transmissions at the time that placed [...] "reverse" [...] between [...] "park" [...] and [...] "neutral", which was also incorporated in the new Turbo Hydramatic design introduced on Buicks and Cadillacs in 1964, and then other GM divisions in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, a {{somewhat}} less complex, but also far less reliable three-speed Roto Hydramatic also dubbed the [...] "Slim Jim" [...] Hydramatic (in which the [...] "dump and fill" [...] shifting principle was retained) was adopted for all Oldsmobiles {{as well as}} Pontiac's full-sized Catalina, Ventura, and Grand Prix models, while all Cadillacs and Pontiac's Bonneville and Star Chief models retained the older four-speed [...] "Controlled Coupling HydraMatic" [...] unit. <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> were ultimately replaced by a new three-speed torque converter automatic transmission called Turbo-Hydramatic in 1964 and 1965, whose design was more similar in principle to the Chrysler TorqueFlite and the '51 Borg Warner designed Ford Cruise-O-Matic than the fluid coupling Hydra-Matic the [...] "Turbo" [...] replaced.|$|R
50|$|Both the {{monobloc}} Cadillac V-8 and <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{were used}} in the M5 version of the Stuart tank during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|The Fina-Sport was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1953 until 1954. The {{brainchild of}} Perry Fina, it used a [...] Cadillac V-8 engine and <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{mounted on a}} Ford chassis. Styling of both convertibles and hardtops was by Vignale.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission</b> was {{generally}} {{limited to the}} Special sedan (EK/225) and Special station sedan (EK/229); however, some examples of dealer orders for automatic transmissions exist with one known standard sedan (EK/215) Hydramatic (Snowcrest White, body no. 57, Sydney) with delivery paperwork to authenticate.|$|E
50|$|Sharing the Silver Streak name {{used for}} the {{flathead}} straight-8 that powered production cars, it was Pontiac's most powerful engine to date. Painted bright red and detailed in chrome in the show cars, it was coupled to a 4-speed <b>Hydramatic</b> automatic <b>transmission.</b>|$|R
50|$|Originally {{retaining}} the three-speed Turbo <b>Hydramatic</b> GM400 <b>transmission</b> from earlier Spirits/Spurs, a four-speed unit (the GM 4L80E) {{was introduced in}} the winter of 1991. The size of the petrol tank was also increased; now up to 107 L the car's range was now up to well over 500 km.|$|R
50|$|For the 1951 {{model year}} the 6 {{cylinder}} engine {{got a new}} block with thicker walls and other improvements to boost Horsepower by almost 18% and torque by 28.5% making Hudson a hot performer again. The GM-supplied 4 speed <b>Hydramatic</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> was now optional in Hornets and Commodore Custom 6s and 8s.|$|R
50|$|In November 1930 a car {{was shipped}} to Edsel Ford {{with the new}} Daimler transmission. It aroused so much {{interest}} Cadillac's chief engineer, Ernest Seaholm, came to the following Olympia show and bought another for technical investigation. It inspired Earl Thompson, who invented syncromesh, to develop the <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
50|$|Midway {{through the}} 1971 model year, Turbo <b>HydraMatic</b> <b>transmission</b> was made {{standard}} equipment on all full-sized station wagons, including Townsmans; this eliminated {{the need for}} customers to have to specifically specify an automatic transmission that virtually every wagon that had been built since the late 1960s was getting anyway.|$|E
5000|$|The 1939 Oldsmobiles were {{available}} with the [...] "Safety Automatic Transmission" [...] {{and not with}} the Hydramatic. The safety automatic transmission was semi-automatic, in that it still used a clutch to get the car going and then shifted automatically. The <b>Hydramatic</b> <b>Transmission,</b> a fully, clutchless automatic transmission debuted in the 1940 model year.|$|E
50|$|A new three-speed Roto <b>Hydramatic</b> {{automatic}} <b>transmission</b> {{replaced the}} previous four-speed unit for 1961. The new transmission is slimmer and {{lighter than the}} older four-speed Hydramatic, which was continued on the larger Star Chief and Bonneville models. Also new for 1961 was a four-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter, available on special order.|$|R
25|$|As {{it was the}} {{top-line}} Oldsmobile, {{the series}} had the most technologically advanced items available, such as the <b>Hydramatic</b> automatic <b>transmission,</b> the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, and Twilight Sentinel (a feature that automatically turned the headlights on and off via a timer, as controlled by the driver), and the highest-grade interior and exterior trim.|$|R
5000|$|Roto's {{downfall}} was the 2-3 range or 1-2 {{gear change}} {{because it is}} not only a huge ratio jump from 2-3 range or 1-2 shift from 2.93 to 1.56, but also there is no fluid slippage in the coupling because the coupling drains (4 tenths of a second) to engage or apply the front clutch and so the trans goes to full mechanical connection. The other downfall of Roto HydraMatic was the extreme oil pressures in the small 8" [...] fluid coupling which caused <b>transmission</b> leaks. All <b>HydraMatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> suffer some shift quality with today's ATF fluid as Type [...] "A" [...] fluid is not available. The main ingredient of Type [...] "A" [...] was banned years ago, however Japanese cars that have CVT automatic's still use that ingredient in their special CVT fluid. That CVT fluid can only bought at the dealer. The ingredient is Whale oil.|$|R
