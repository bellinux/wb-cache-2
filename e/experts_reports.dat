40|$|INTRODUCTION: Social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> {{from the}} German {{statutory}} pension insurance {{are essential for}} the German statutory pension regulatory authority {{to decide whether to}} grant services regarding participation as well as retirement pensions due to incapacity to work. The objective of this investigation is to determine whether the ICF Core Sets and other international approaches, such as the EUMASS Core Sets or ICF Core Set for vocational rehabilitation cover the content of the social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> as well as to propose an approach how the ICF can be economically used by the social medicine practitioner when writing a social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>report.</b> METHOD: A retrospective quantitative study design was used to translate a total of 294 social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> from patients with low back pain (LBP) or chronic widespread pain (CWP) into the language of the ICF (linking) by 2 independent health professionals and compare the results with the ICF Core Sets for specific health conditions and other international approaches. RESULTS: The content of social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> was largely reflected by the condition specific brief ICF Core Sets, brief ICF Core Sets for vocational rehabilitation and EUMASS Core Sets. The weighted Kappa statistic for the agreement between the 2 health professionals who translated the <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> were in CWP 0. 69 with a bootstrapped confidence interval of 0. 67 - 0. 71 and in LBP 0. 73 (0. 71 - 0. 74).

40|$|Abstract. During the {{investigations}} into political corruption in Italy, judges {{emerged in the}} eyes of the public as the ‘heroes ’ of a peaceful revolution against the ‘villainous ’ politicians. The established explanation for the active role of the judiciary against corruption stresses the unusual degree of independence of Italian judges. Without denying the importance of this institutional variable, analysis of the interactions between politicians and judges in the history of the Italian Republic allows one to discuss the role of other two important variables: the informal networking between politicians and judges, and the professional culture of the magistracy. The three sets of variables are in fact used to explain two different strategies adopted by Italian judges in their interaction with the political system: a strategy of ‘role substitution’, acccording to which some judges act as a surrogate power for the protection of the citizens against corrupt politicians, and a ‘collusive strategy’, consisting of various levels of hidden exchanges between judges and politicians. This article is based on an examination of judicial documents relating to 40 episodes of political corruption, in-depth interviews with <b>experts,</b> <b>reports</b> of relevant Parliamentary Inquiry Commissions, requests for indictment of Members of Parliament, official statistics and the daily and weekly press...|$|E

Five technologies were researched and separated into two categories, mechanical or electronic. The two electronic technologies are (1) magnetic guidance and (2) optical guidance. The three mechanical technologies are (1) the guide wheel, (2) the Kassel Kerb, and (3) the guide strip. A general overview and expected cost, performance, and general advantages and disadvantages of each technology is then given. After reviewing each technology, several supplemental technologies, primarily for use in conjunction with the mechanical technologies, are assessed for their use to help assist operators during precision docking. Finally, Appendix 2 addresses issues surrounding lug nut and fender flare protrusions and Appendix 3 presents system interoperability concerns, as both can cause of potential issues regardless of the technology utilized.

Yet, ex-ante estimation of the value-for-money, that they expect to derive from their purchases and choices, may be a costly exercise ? if only, time-wise ?, which most often they cannot afford. Rather than experimenting by themselves, on their own, by successive trials and errors, they tend to turn to cheaper efficiency indicators of products and services provided by advertisements or more neutral sources, such as <b>experts?</b> <b>reports</b> edited by consumers? unions. Reviewing a very simple case, we unfortunately demonstrate that this second ? allegedly more reliable ? type of information may not be more dependable than the first, {{mainly because of the}} complexity of multi-attribute evaluations but perhaps also {{because of a lack of}} means to guarantee the representativeness of their quality control measurements. While advertisers are challenged by their competitors and are thus forced to be extremely cautious in rationally justifying their superiority claims 2, consumers? organizations operate in a monopolistic environment enjoying, like the press because of their status of countervailing power, more degrees of freedom.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} how {{to establish}} respect for labour rights. It aims {{to inform the}} analysis of compliance problems and create a diagnostic approach to implementing labour rights. The {{ultimate goal is to}} provide insight into the interventions necessary to progressively implement labour rights as defined in international law. The project creates a conceptual framing of labour rights by joining two theoretical approaches: institutions theory and compliance theory. Drawing on institutions theory from political economy, the thesis reframes labour rights regulations, as holistic institutions comprised of rules, norms and actual behaviours, the so-called ‘rules of the game’ in employment. In this context, problems in implementing labour rights are understood as employment practices that are embedded in a web of formal and informal rules governing work within society. Once, reframed in institutional terms, employment practices that violate labour rights can then be analyzed and shortcomings identified using compliance theory. Compliance theory is well suited to institutional approaches because it, like institutions theory treats norms, rules and behaviours as critical components in achieving compliance. The thesis integrates the framework into a diagnostic methodology and tool for comparison of labour rights compliance among the countries that are parties to the Dominican Republic, Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). It applies the methodology to two cases. The first case examines obligatory overtime and trafficking and the second focuses on freedom of association. The analyses are based on publicly available documentary evidence from distinct perspectives such as the International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU), the United States State Department Human Rights Reports and ILO Committee of <b>Experts</b> <b>reports</b> and observations. The thesis concludes that the diagnostic methodology can help to uncover institutional patterns associated with labour rights compliance problems as well as problems with the international legal norms themselves...|$|E

40|$|The master thesis you {{are reading}} {{now is a}} {{qualitative}} research on meaning-making of experts in child custody cases. My goal was to get insight into these experts' reasoning and {{to figure out if}} there is a connection between the degree of reasoning complexity and quality of their evaluations. To answer this question, I chose document analysis as a method. The documents constitute four <b>experts</b> <b>reports</b> and one court decision. The documents were chosen randomly, and the source ofdata was the Internet. The analysis was conducted within frameworks built on adult consciousness/awareness developmental theories. Some coding criteria were predetermined, others derived from the models description. One of the important findings of the study is that experts show a striking consistency in their thinking. That is, they demonstrate a certain level of understanding complexity throughout many different domains. Further, they evaluate phenomena not from the standpoint of their expertise competency, but from their level of awareness. The stronger their awareness, the more understanding for complexity they show. This understanding of complexity displays itself in their elaboration on task complexity, context, others, self and different perspectives. Accordingly, this kind of elaboration results in better quality of their conclusions. Experts with stronger awareness issued evaluations that were humane with no damaging consequences for the children, and often their conclusions were win-win solutions. These findings show that there is a gap in experts’ competency today, and that this gap cannot be filled by providing more expertise. Another kind of education is needed, which should aim at developing experts understanding of complexity, importance of cautiousness and awareness of different processes and states that can influence both others and their own interpretation of facts. As I see it, these findings have a potential to transform the conventional view on experts role in the court system, as well as contribute to more effective quality assurance in child custody evaluations...|$|E
40|$|As {{early as}} 1887 the German Agriculture Society (Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft DLG) {{carried out the}} first {{examination}} of food with a competition. Since the DLG was refounded in 1954 it has continued to pursue its goal {{to improve the quality}} standard of German food. The stated objective of the voluntary quality competitions for meat products, ready-to-serve meals, frozen food and delicacies, to support manufacturing and sales of highquality products, is realized by a comparative sensory analysis. Up to now, participants of the DLG Quality Competitions receive standardized <b>expert?s</b> <b>reports</b> about the condition of the product tested and any imperfections noted, but give no indication in which way these could be improved. In order for food producers to take remedial action and to further improve the quality of meat products with more definitive advice, the German Agriculture Society together with the Institute of Food Hygiene at the "Freie Universität Berlin" has suggested the development of the programme summarised below. This body of work describes the experience gained in developing the programme and documents the final results. The "Information Programme for addressing imperfections in the production of sausages" has been developed to be a multimedia compendium of "sausage technology". For each of the approximately 160 imperfections listed in DLG?s examination regulations, suggestions to remedy any imperfections in the manufacturing process are offered. This multimedia textbook was conceived for the instruction at universities, universities for applied science, vocational schools, and technical training centres, but also as a practical help for the butcher?s trade and for the meat product?s industry. The following issues have been experienced during the creation of this programme: 1. As there are approximately 160 individually mentioned imperfections listed in DLG?s examination regulations for sausages, these were assigned individual chapters. The entire text contains approximately 150 printed pages. 2. Searching for and finding information has been laid out as simply and as userfriendly as possible by a page with search function and a clear indication of search results. 3. Associated errors in sausage production are listed in entirity and hyperlinked with each other, {{in such a way that}} you can read through them in sequence. 4. Technical terms are also integrated into the text with hyperlinks to their definition, and indeed a complete dictionary of all technical terms. This "Encyclopedia of Terms" amounts to 12 printed pages. 5. The examination regulations of DLG valid at present, which have been included in the textbook, give an insight into the process of the quality examinations of DLG. 6. In order to interest as wide a group of users as possible with and elicit a good response, and taking into account current development within the IT community, programming of this multimedia textbook has been performed in such a way (in HTML and JavaScript) to allow for both online and offline usage by Internet and CD-ROM. As the target group stretches from butcher?s apprentices, through students and food technologists to butchers, in the entire programme a simple, easily comprehensible language without acronyms and abbreviations has been used. Food technology terms, however, represent key knowledge to be imparted, and for this reason the appropriate nomenclature has been deliberately included...|$|E
