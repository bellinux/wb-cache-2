While {{he is an}} {{employee}} at the parks department, he cares little about his job, and is instead more focused on his entrepreneurial ambitions. He takes great pride in his appearance and regularly pursues women despite being married. During the season it is revealed that his marriage to his wife Wendy is a green card marriage, and he and Wendy go through a divorce after she obtains her citizenship. This affects Tom greater than he anticipated, as he realizes that <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> harbor feelings for Wendy.|$|E
5|$|Historical markers {{concerning}} Hines' exploits have occasionally included mistaken information. The historical marker {{placed by}} the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission in 1963 {{in the vicinity}} of Derby, Perry County, Indiana, to memorialize Hines' entry into Indiana states that Hines invaded Indiana in 1862, although <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> so in 1863. In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before he could go to the dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few hundred feet away.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hill led {{the rest}} of the battalion, {{approximately}} 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of Béja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived at approximately 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did,</b> Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time. A short time after the battalion entered Béja, German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties. The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be proBritish, and harass German forces. The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night. At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions. When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded, blocking the road, and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining antitank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to Béja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars. After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; Béja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.|$|E

Major General John Sedgwick, temporarily {{commanding the}} Army of the Potomac, protested that Lee had detached fewer men than Butler thought and that the local roads and weather were too poor for a winter attack.

Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief {{that he could not}} do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously. Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Harvick {{would spend}} the season concentrating on running the Cup Series and would only start four races in the Busch Series. He would only have one Top 10 in those four starts. Harvick began the 2002 season making his first Daytona 500 {{starting}} on the outside pole next to Jimmie Johnson, but his day ended after triggering an 18-car crash on lap 148, allowing him to finish 36th. Later in the season, he made a fine for a post-race incident with Greg Biffle at Bristol Motor Speedway. He was suspended for rough driving in a Truck race at Martinsville, in which he intentionally spun out driver Coy Gibbs, allowing NASCAR to immediately take {{him out of the}} race. Even though it was heard on the radio that <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did,</b> Harvick lied in a post-race interview saying that he didn't purposely wreck Gibbs. Harvick was banned from the Cup Series race the next day, which meant that Kenny Wallace would replace him. Harvick scored his first career Winston Cup pole position in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. Later in the season, he scored his third Winston Cup Victory at Chicagoland Speedway. He finished 21st in the 2002 points standings with one win, one pole, five Top 5's and eight Top 10's. Harvick became the 2002 IROC Champion in his first season in the Series, winning at California Speedway. In Trucks, Harvick began fielding his own No. 6 truck, driving himself in five races and winning at Phoenix.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that Beorhtwulf is the same person as the Beorhtwulf who witnessed a charter of Wiglaf's in 836. [...] If so, this is Beorhtwulf's first appearance in the historical record. [...] His accession to the throne of Mercia is usually thought to have occurred in about 840. [...] The date is not given directly {{in any of the}} primary sources, but it is known from regnal lists that he succeeded Wiglaf as king. [...] Historian D. P. Kirby suggests that Wiglaf's death occurred in 839, basing this date on the known chronology of the reigns of Beorhtwulf and Burgred, the next two Mercian kings. [...] It {{is possible}} that Wigmund, the son of Wiglaf, was king briefly between Wiglaf and Beorhtwulf. [...] The evidence for this possibility comes only from a later tradition concerning Wigmund's son, Wigstan, so it is uncertain whether <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> so.|$|E
500|$|Widely {{considered}} by music critics and listeners alike {{to be the}} most radio-friendly track on Graduation, West defines the studio album's third single [...] "Good Life" [...] as the song with the most [...] "blatant hit-recordness". The track features vocals from R singer T-Pain, who utilizes the voice audio processor technology of Auto-Tune. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals on the songs [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down". During his brief stay in Sweden, West sent through sixteen different mixes of [...] "Good Life" [...] over to their recording studio for the audio mastering process. West admitted that <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> not really care for the single, but he was pressured into releasing it by his record label Def Jam Recordings.

500|$|The Softwire is {{actually}} a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood. As a teenager, he worked at his parents' ceramic factory during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a kiln room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, {{there is a more}} prominent influence on the premise of The Softwire—that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did.</b> While there, living in New York, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Haarsma [...] witnessed immigrants struggling to get by. He tried to imagine what caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is this journey (and struggle) that is prevalent in The Softwire.|$|E
500|$|In late June 1867 Betances and {{at least}} 12 more {{potential}} [...] "revolutionaries" [...] were exiled from Puerto Rico by then governor Gen. José María Marchessi y Oleaga as a preventive measure, including Goyco and Ruiz. A battalion of local soldiers had revolted in San Juan earlier, protesting about their poor pay, {{compared to that of}} their Spanish counterparts living in Puerto Rico. Betances later stated that the revolt (called the [...] "Motín de Artilleros" [...] by historians) was unrelated to his revolutionary plans, and that <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> not mind the troops stationed in Puerto Rico that much, since they would have been ill-prepared for stopping a well-developed pro-independence revolt at the time anyway. Marchesi feared that the United States, which had made an offer to purchase what were then the Danish Virgin Islands, would rather instigate a revolt in Puerto Rico so as to later annex the island—which would make a better military base in the Caribbean—at a lesser economic cost. His fears were not without base, since the then American consul in the island, Alexander Jourdan, suggested precisely this to then Secretary of State William H. Seward, but only after the expulsions (September 1867).|$|E

He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. I love the way he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — I love what he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme.

500|$|Rumors of plots to {{overthrow}} Morton and Indiana's government continued during the summer. On July 8, 1863, when Confederate general John Hunt Morgan crossed the Ohio River with 2,400 troopers, Indiana {{went into a}} state of emergency. Only the day before, the citizens of Indianapolis were rejoicing over the Union victories at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The city's mood turned to panic when Morgan's troops appeared to be headed toward Indianapolis. Many Hoosiers feared Morgan would attack the city and attempt to free the Confederate prisoners at Camp Morton. The panic was increased as Morgan's telegrapher, [...] "Lightning" [...] Ellsworth, posing as various Union telegraphers, claimed Morgan had far more men than <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did.</b> Ellsworth also sent false information suggesting Morgan would attack Indianapolis, among other locations. Within forty-eight hours an estimated 65,000 Indiana volunteers had assembled to fight the Confederate raiders. Five regiments encamped {{on the grounds of the}} Indiana Statehouse were prepared to defend the state capital. Tension in the city ended on July 14, when it was confirmed that Morgan had left Indiana and entered Ohio. Morgan was captured on July 26. Volunteers who served in the temporary regiments at Indianapolis mustered out of service on July 17, once the threat from Morgan's troops was gone.
