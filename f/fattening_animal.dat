40|$|Selection for leaner {{types of}} pigs is {{associated}} with a more sustained daily lean tissue growth and consequently with an increase in the daily lysine requirement. Accordingly, the lysine / energy ratio should be constant for the whole fattening period between 35 and r 20 kg live weight. Similar final carcass characteristics, i. e. the same amount of deposited protein, at a given slaughter weight, may be obtained by distinct energy levels and lysine /energy ratios. For the limiting amino acid (lysine) the lysine /energy ratio was 2. o g /Mcal D. E. and, taking into account amino acid digestibility, 1. 8 g dig. lysine/Mcal D. ha. To optimize energy and protein (lysine) allowances for a given slaughter weight the energy level and profile should be adjusted to the final fattening weight. This is of great importance for producing heavy pigs as compared to lighter ones. Very high energy consumption in the fattening stage of 35 to 70 kg resulted in a decline of weight and protein deposition {{at the end of the}} fattening period from about go kg live weight onwards. It cannot be compensated for by a high protein supplementation. At a finishing weight of r 20 kg a too intensive nutrient level (more than 650 g gain /day) at the first fattening stage proved to be unfavourable. The resulting depression of protein deposition in the second fattening period accounts for an insufficient expression of the muscle growth potential. It is defined as the upper limit of protein deposition (and consequently lean meat production) in a <b>fattening</b> <b>animal</b> at a given final weight for minimizing both the fattening length and fat depo-sition. When producing heavy pigs, a reduction of energy supply during the second half of the fattening period is not advisable when using modern crossbred lean pigs. On the contrary, all efforts should be made so that the energy intake during the second half of the fattening period is not limiting for lean tissue growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Bonke Woreda of Gamo Gofa Zone, {{southern}} Ethiopia, with the objectives of assessment of fattening and marketing system, and effect of concentrate supplementation with locally available feeds on fattening performance of indigenous cattle. The study involved survey to assess cattle fattening and marketing practices, and action research to evaluate the effect of homemade concentrate from locally available feed resources on fattening performance and economic return of indigenous cattle. The survey part involved interviewing 120 households purposively selected from six kebeles in three agro ecologies. Focus group discussions and key informants have been employed to enrich the data. The feeding trial was conducted in Danible Ottora Kebele,with 18 (9 castrate and 9 non – castrate) indigenous cattle for 70 days excluding adaptation period of 15 days. Treatments included farmer’s practices alone (T 1); T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1 % of body weight (T 2); and T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight (T 3). Maize stover and stubble grazing was provided as a basic ration which was the farmers feeding practice. Experimental animals were blocked by farms/households and randomly assigned to three feeding treatments separately. Heart girth and body condition score were recorded while body weight was estimated from heart girth using regression equation developed for zebu cattle. The data were analyzed using the General Linear Model Procedure of statistical package for Social Science (SPSS 16). The result showed that the most dominant cattle breed used for fattening in the study area was indigenous. The major source of cattle for fattening was through purchasing from market (69. 1 %) followed by raising at home (24. 2 %). Almost all fatteners in highland (95 %) and mid-altitude (100 %) were engaged in fattening castrate. Concerning physiological stage of the fattening animals, most of the producers (83 %) use matured & old oxen. In highland, majority of the farmers fatten cattle once within a year (60 %), while it was three times per year for mid-altitude (42. 5 %) and two times per year for lowland (70 %) agro-ecologies. The majority (90 %) {{of the respondents indicated that}} the most common criteria used to decide fattening period was body condition of the animals. Majority of the respondents in the highland, mid altitude and lowland fatten cattle for six months, three months and five months, respectively. The major types of feed resources for the <b>fattening</b> <b>animal</b> were natural pasture, crop residues, stubble grazing, grass hay and feed supplements. The major criteria used while purchasing fattening cattle included frame size, heath, body condition, coat color and price of animals. The experience in cattle fattening, large cattle population, diverse & suitable agroecology, availability of crop residues, high irrigation potential, initiation of the introduction of improved forage species and cheap labor force reveals the potential of the area for improved cattle fattening. However, feed shortage, shortage of land, prevalence of disease, poor access for credit service and marketing information, and underdeveloped cattle marketing were the major constraints that hinder the performance of cattle fattening. The feeding trial showed that average daily gain were highest (p< 0. 05) for animals supplemented with T 3 followed by T 2 and T 1. Similarly, the net return was higher (P< 0. 05) for the supplemented group (T 2 & T 3) compared to non-supplemented group kept under farmers management (T 1). Among the supplemented groups, marginal rate of return was higher for animals supplemented with T 2 compared to T 3. Thus, it can be concluded that when resources are not meager smallholders producers could use supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight for higher return. However, when resources are limited producers are advised to supplement at 1 % of body weight for higher marginal rate of return. Detail research work on availability, nutrient composition and digestibility of the major feed resource are recommended for further work. Global Affairs Canad...|$|E

The mean daily body weight gain of the fattened sheep ranged from 52 to 110 grams. The partial budget analysis revealed that while farmers with good feeding management could earn an additional income in the range of ETB 55 – 161 per sheep, farmers with the lower rate of weight gain could lose up to ETB 58 per sheep unless purchase and sale prices remained constant.

Because the breeding of livestock is performed in order to deliver products for human consumption, it focuses particularly on consumer desires and market requirements. For decades an increased emphasis {{has been put on}} the animals’ productivity and, by using suitable breeding strategies, a continuous increase in the efficiency of production has been accomplished. Improved productivity can, however, {{have a negative impact on}} the animals’ health, particularly when this aim is pursued single-mindedly. Certain diseases and syndromes are consequences of high productivity. These negative side effects of selection for high production efficiency are commonly referred to as “production diseases” or “production related disorders”. They are often knowingly tolerated, although the German Animal Welfare Act has included a ban on so called Qualzüchtungen since 1986. As of this point of time, however, the corresponding article (§ 11 b TierSchG) has not been implemented in the field of livestock breeding. This thesis analyses diseases and syndromes that are linked to enhanced fattening performance. These diseases are accompanied by pain, suffering, or harm to the affected animals or their progeny and therefore have relevance according to § 11 b TierSchG. Professional literature on the following seven production diseases related to the <b>fattening</b> of <b>animals</b> is gathered and analyzed: double-muscling in beef cattle, stress syndrome and osteochondrosis in fattening pigs, ascites syndrome and sudden death syndrome in broilers, as well as tibial dyschondroplasia and deep pectoral myopathy in broilers and turkeys. The clinical signs, possible diagnostic tools and relevance of these diseases regarding animal welfare are documented. Moreover, recommendations for counteraction and prevention are also discussed. Based on the information gathered and its analysis, it becomes evident that unilateral genetic selection on fattening performance or increased muscle mass can bring about very similar negative side effects, regardless of species. In particular, the animals’ bones, joints, muscles and the cardiovascular system can be negatively affected due to the inability of the skeleton and the cardiovascular system to keep up with rapid muscle growth in high performance <b>fattened</b> <b>animals.</b> The responsibility for the prevention of production related diseases lies primarily with livestock breeders. Potential breeding animals should be examined for individual susceptibility to problematic diseases and syndromes and should be excluded from breeding when tendencies for such diseases are indicated. If a disease is caused by a genetic defect, the breeder may choose to selectively avoid this specific defect. However, for production related diseases for which the predisposing genes have not yet been discovered or for diseases that are caused by multiple genes with cumulative effects, the best recourse may be to simply reduce the animals’ productivity. On the existing legal basis of the § 11 b TierSchG, breeding associations should be held accountable for the consequences of their actions in these matters. In relation to this, several legal measures are also presented and discussed within this thesis...|$|R

Research limitations/implications: For wide applicability of measurement results on the living animals in all stages of growth it would be necessary in the equation for the calculation to include also the trunk size {{in the middle of the}} body and the size in the rear part. Practical implications: On small farms where the cost of purchase of the digital weighing device would be too great a burden, thus, measuring of the chest size at 3 cm behind the elbow joint, in the middle of the trunk (behind the last rib), and measuring of the size in the rear part of the body and the trunk length from the middle of the withers to the tail root are more appropriate. Originality/value: The animals which phenotypically feature cylindrical shape in the period of growth can be measured most simply in the front middle and rear part of the body and, then, their body mass can be determined very accurately on the basis of the data obtained...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationships of}} slaughter and carcass data with carcass composition, forty-eight (4 - 6 months old) entire male Sudan desert goats were purchased and moved to Kuku livestock <b>fattening</b> center. The <b>animals</b> were rested, ear-tagged, dewormed, supplemented with cotton seed cake and wheat bran and slaughtered after ten weeks. Slaughter weight, empty body weight, carcass weight and components of carcass weights were recorded.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Three {{different}} genetic {{groups were}} evaluated for growth up to slaughter and carcass quality for kill out, commercial cuts, non-carcass components, {{as well as}} carcass morphometric measurements. Pure Santa Ines (SI), Ile de France × Santa Ines (I × SI) and Texel × Santa Ines (T × SI) lambs were weighed weekly until they reached predetermined slaughter weight (30, 35, 40 and 45 kg). In both creep feeding and <b>fattening</b> the <b>animals</b> from crosses were superior to the Santa Ines hair sheep in terms of daily weight gain and weaned in less time. Crossbred animals also showed better performance than purebred Santa Ines in terms of commercial cuts and carcass weights. Correlations showed that fat depth and eye muscle area decreased {{with an increase in}} morphometric measures, indicating that larger animals are possibly later developing in terms of carcass finishing compared with smaller animals. The optimal slaughter weight is approximately 35 kg. Key Words: creep feeding, cross-breeding, fattening, lamb...|$|R
40|$|A {{program of}} {{fieldwork}} {{was conducted in}} Kupang District, East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia {{for a period of}} three months. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare two systems of cattle rearing: the Paron (intensive) and the non-Paron (extensive) systems. Six farmers from extensive and 38 farmers for paron systems were chosen as respondents. In addition, selected characteristics were measured of the 101 cattle from the paron (36 females and 65 males) and 199 cattle from the extensive systems (134 females and 65 males). The study showed that one hundred per cent of respondents engaged in agriculture enterprises. Mixed cropping was practised and the main food crops cultivated were maize, cassava, and beans. Livestock enterprises, mainly beef cattle, were an integral part of these farming systems. This study sought to establish the growth rates for cattle within these particular systems. The data collected gave strong correlations between girth and weight, and fairly strong correlations between weight and age, weight and value, and age and value. Under village conditions growth rates are quite slow, characterised by relatively fast growth in the early stages (0 - 9 months) and reducing thereafter (> 12 months). Both male and female paron cattle grew more quickly than those on the extensive system. A major significant input factor determining profitability is labour and, particularly, labour used to feed the cattle. The paron system required more labour to supply fodders but <b>fattened</b> <b>animals</b> for two years (from 200 to 300 kg), while the extensive system required at least five years to reach the preferred weight (150 to 300 kg). Financial analyses used Gross Margin analysis (Cash Gross Margin and Imputed Gross Margin) as proxies for profitability. Various constraints deter the productivity of the two systems: lack of fodders and water availability resulting from unpredictable rainfall, as well as total availability of labour. It is suggested that there is sufficient way available in the paron system to boost profitability, through increasing growth rate. Currently, this averages some 180 g per day over the fattening period. Improving this through better feeding management will increase profitability, depending upon the additional labour required. A series of limits to these changes is presented. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{livestock}} {{keeping in}} developing cities {{have an important}} role in food security and livelihoods but can also pose a significant threat to the environment and health of urban dwellers. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the different livestock systems in Nairobi, their supply chains, and their management and food safety risks. Seven focus group discussions with livestock production officers in charge of each major Nairobi sub-county were conducted. Data were collected on the type of systems existing for each livestock species and their supply chains, disease management, food safety risks, and general husbandry and gender factors. Supply chain flow diagrams and thematic analysis of the data was done. Results of the study show a large variability of livestock keeping in Nairobi. The majority were small scale with: < 5 dairy cows, 1 – 6 dairy goats, < 10 small ruminants, < 20 pigs, 200 – 500 broilers, 300 – 500 layers, < 10 indigenous chickens, or < 20 rabbits. Beef keeping was mainly described as a “by the way” system or done by traders to <b>fatten</b> <b>animals</b> for 3 [*]month. Supply chain analysis indicated that most dairy farmers sold milk directly to consumers due to “lack of trust” of these in traders. Broiler and pig farmers sold mainly to traders but are dependent on few large dominating companies for their replacement or distribution of products. Selling directly to retailers or consumers (including own consumption), with backyard slaughtering, were important chains for small-scale pig, sheep and goat, and indigenous chicken keepers. Important disease risk practices identified were associated with consumption of dead and sick animals, with underground network of brokers operating for ruminant products. Qualified trained health managers were used mainly by dairy farmers, and large commercial poultry and pig farmers, while use of unqualified health managers or no treatment were common in small-scale farming. Control of urban livestock keepers was reported difficult due to their “feeling of being outlaws,” “lack of trust” in government, “inaccessibility” in informal settlements, “lack of government funding,” or “understaffing. ” Findings are useful for designing policies to help to control urban livestock production and minimize its associated health and environment risks...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis was performance evaluation of Simmental breed cattle herd within the period of 2011 2013 on a private farm. The herd consisted of 39 purebred cows as well as crossbred cows. The average lenght of the calving interval was 379. 4 days and the age at the first calving was 27. 3 months. Herd of calves consisted of 85 pcs. Birth weight and weight at age of 120 and 210 days was studied within group of purebred calves (49 pcs). Herd of calves was categorized by year of birth, by birth order, by sex and by sire. Meat performance and carcass value basic data were obtained within group of <b>fattened</b> <b>animals.</b> Data were statistically processed in Microsoft Excel and evaluated in programme Statistica 12. Average birth weight of calves was 41. 69 kg; the average weight in 120 days was 207. 86 kg and 320. 6 kg {{in the age of}} 210 days. Calves reached average daily gain from birth to 120 days 1. 38 kg, from birth to 210 days 1. 33 kg and from 120 days to 210 days 1. 25 kg. When groups of calves were classified by years, statistical differences between birth weights according to year were found. Calves born in 2012 reached the best weights in 120 and 210 days of age (215. 80 kg and 327. 20 kg respectively). Significant differences were found especially within birth weights according to birth order; particularly within group of first-calf heifers. First born calves average birth weight was 38. 25 kg, second born 40. 57 kg, third born 43 kg, fourth born 41. 82 kg, fifth born 42. 10 kg and sixth born calves average birth weight was 47. 33 kg (significant differences were found between 1. and 2., 4. and 5., 4. and 6., 2. and 6. birth order). The average slaughter age of animals reached 561. 1 days, the average slaughter weight reached 502. 6 kg and the average carcass weight was 316. 21 kg. Slaughter weight of bulls reached 559. 20 kg and heifers 374. 09 kg, observed difference was statistically significant. Statistically significant difference was also found at carcass weight...|$|R
40|$|The study {{included}} 60 finishers of the F 1 crossbreds (Polish Large White x Polish Landrace), {{a half of}} gilts and barrows. Animals {{were divided into two}} groups of 30 individuals each. The control group (K) amounted to pigs fed with a complete mixtures, while the experimental group (D) - was fed a mixture with the participation of silage from steamed potatoes (26 % DM). The mixtures were prepared {{on the basis of their}} own cereal pellets and a concentrate. <b>Fattening</b> <b>animals</b> started at body weight of about 30 kg and continued to the average body weight of about 115 kg. The body weight of animals and the quantity of the consumed feed mixtures were recorded during the fattening period. Meatiness of carcasses was evaluated according to the current classification of the EUROP apparatus IM- 03. The analysis has been subjected to the following features: total weight gain, fattening period, average daily weight gain, slaughter age and consumption of feed during the fattening and slaughter features: warm carcass weight, slaughter efficiency, fat thickness, the depth of loin muscle and meat content in the carcass. The assessment also includes: the sales value of porker in accordance with the evaluation of their carcasses according to the EUROP and the cost of feeding porker during the whole period of fattening. It has been shown that the pigs in group K had a higher growth rate and earlier reached the slaughter weight than pigs from group D (P< 0. 01), whereas group D demonstrated a lower feed consumption. Group K was characterized by thinner backfat, higher loin muscle and higher meatiness than the carcasses of pigs from the group D (P< 0. 01). Carcasses of finishers from the group K were qualified to the most valuable classes S, E, U whereas group D to class E, U, R and O. Lower costs of porker production were shows in group D, whereas in the group K a higher value from the sale was attained. Nutrition with the participation of silage from steamed potatoes was less favorable because of the lower slaughter value of the carcass, than while feeding with the complete mixtures...|$|R

30|$|Transhumant {{pastoralism}} in the Chinese {{as well as}} in the Mongolian Altay-Dzungarian {{region is}} characterized by resembling a consistent sequence of seasonal pastures and comparable soil properties (Jordan et al. 2015). Besides similar geographic settings, the Chinese and Mongolian study region is also characterized by a similar sequence of seasonal pastures, spatially fixed for generations. The spring pastures in desert steppes or at mountain foothills are of major importance for the herds’ reproduction. In summer, the animals graze at the alpine meadows. At the summer pastures, higher precipitation amounts and soils richer in organic carbon and nutrients favour higher herbage yields and quality, which is of importance to <b>fatten</b> the <b>animals</b> and for dairy production. Decreasing temperatures in autumn force herds to move back to flood plains and desert steppes which play an important role for building up further body reserves for the winter. Winter pastures at the desert steppes feature relatively low biomass yields, but their accessibility is ensured due to relatively low snow cover; nevertheless, late winter and early spring are known as bottlenecks of animal nutrition.|$|R
