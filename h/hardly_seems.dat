500|$|The Everglades are {{dominated}} by sawgrass in water; this is the titular [...] "River of Grass" [...] popularized by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in 1947. This river contains {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal life. An early American environmentalist named Gifford Pinchot said of the Everglades, [...] "It is a region so different that it <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> to belong to the United States. It is full of the most vivid and most interesting life on land, in the air, and in the water. It is a land of strangeness, separate and apart from the common things we all know so well." ...|$|E
500|$|Slaton's {{narrative}} {{touched on}} {{other aspects of}} the evidence and testimony that suggested reasonable doubt. For example, he accepted the defense's argument that charges by Conley of perversion were based on someone coaching him that Jews were circumcised. He accepted the defense's interpretation of the timeline; [...] citing the evidence produced at trialincluding the possibility that Stover did not see Frank because she did not proceed further than the outer officehe wrote: [...] "Therefore, Monteen Stover must have arrived before Mary Phagan, and while Monteen Stover was in the room it <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> possible under the evidence, that Mary Phagan was at that time being murdered." [...] Slaton also said that Phagan's head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on the lathe, the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan's nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{focused on}} the lack of {{character}} depth or atmosphere. Jaime N. Christley, writing in Slant Magazine, commented, [...] "It goes in for the idea of texture, tics, and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity. ... It <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> interested in its characters or in any depiction of their work, settling instead for types of characters and kinds of scenes, correctly placed among the pendulum swings of Watney's dramatic journey." [...] In The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek stated that the actors [...] "are treated as accessories", and that the director is [...] "workmanlike in his approach to science, which always trumps magic in The Martian — that's the point. But if we can't feel a sense of wonder at the magnitude and mystery of space, why even bother?" [...] In Cinemixtape, J. Olson commented: [...] "Ridley Scott and company have concocted the most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science. Not only is The Martian not in the same class as Scott’s two masterpieces – Alien and Blade Runner – it’s not even on the same continent." ...|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{believed}} that secular government should peacefully coexist with religion, {{and he became}} a seminal figure in applying {{the separation of church}} and state. [...] Historian Thomas Bicknell, one of Clarke's most ardent supporters, wrote that at the time of the Puritan settlement of New England that [...] "nowhere on the face of the earth and among civilized men, did civil and soul-liberty exist. [...] Its first clear, full, deliberate, organized and permanent establishment in the world can now be distinctly traced to the Colony of Rhode Island, on the island of Aquidneck, in the Narragansett Bay, under the leadership and inspiration of Dr. [...] John Clarke, the true Founder". [...] Historian Louis Asher wrote, [...] "It <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> arguable that Dr. Clarke was the first one to bring democracy to the New World by means of Rhode Island." [...] Bicknell also asserted that Clarke was the [...] "recognized founder and father of the Aquidneck Plantations, the author of the Compact of Portsmouth and leading spirit in the organization and administration of the island towns. [...] Historian Edward Peterson wrote that Clarke was a man [...] "whose moral character has never been surpassed, and his piety never been questioned." [...] Asher made this final assessment of Clarke: [...] "As a man, Clarke lived for others. [...] Like many men of the past, he was selfless and uncomplaining. [...] Despite his sectarian religious views, he gave more for his fellow man than he received." ...|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times editor Ernesto Lecnher {{gave the}} album one-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars and claimed that Romances [...] "sinks under its own weight, {{delivering}} mostly bloated versions of timeless material". Fellow Los Angeles Times contributor Ed Morales disagreed with his review: [...] "Lechner needs to go into his music room, turn down the lights, snuggle up with his significant other and really listen to 'Romances.' I give his review * and 'Romances' ****" [...] Anne Valdespino of the Los Angeles Daily News praised the selection of songs and Miguel's performance, calling the performer a [...] "class act". The San Diego Union-Tribune music critic Ernesto Portillo Jr. rated Romances three-out-of four stars and claimed that Miguel's [...] "interpretations are first-rate and the music, with production help from famed composer Armando Manzanero, is executed with exquisite precision". However, he questioned {{the need for a}} third in the Romance series as he felt it [...] "diminishes the specialness" [...] of Romance and Segundo Romance noted that not all tracks in the album are [...] "true boleros". El Nuevo Herald editor Eliseo Cardona wrote a mostly positive review of the album. He complimented Miguel's vocals and the productions but stated that Migule's interpretation of [...] "La Gloria Eres Tu" [...] "pales" [...] compared to Lucho Gatica and José José's cover of the song. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News said Romances [...] "sparkles with the joy of visiting good friends" [...] and lauded its [...] "timeless music, beautiful orchestration" [...] and complimented Silvetti's arrangements. Burr commented while [...] "we've heard all these classics before, and seemingly a million times" [...] Miguel [...] "does it so well, it <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> to matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Characterizing {{him as a}} [...] "New Left {{historian}} {{before there}} was a New Left," [...] historian Michael D.

2500|$|Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying, [...] "This {{animated}} thing pretty near out-Pixars Pixar." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of four stars, saying, [...] "When compared with the ambition and achievement of recent animated films, such as Coraline and Toy Story 3, Despicable Me <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> to have been worth making, and it's barely worth watching." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to The Sunday Telegraph, [...] "anyone {{willing to}} be taken for a smooth ride could hardly find a more sumptuous vehicle, star-studded, gold-plated, shock-proof and {{probably}} critic-proof, too." [...] Time magazine called it an [...] "elegant, old-fashioned movie about roadside sex" [...] that [...] "looks worn at times," [...] but is [...] "always appropriately overprivileged in high-powered personalities and spectacular sets." [...] The New York Times called it a [...] "pretty slick vehicle, that is pleasing to the eye and occasionally amusing, but it <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> worthy of all the effort and the noted personalities involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} {{large-scale}} famines, {{the range of}} estimates is considerable. An official Soviet publication of the early 1920s concluded that about five million deaths occurred in 1921 from famine and related disease: this number is usually quoted in textbooks. More conservative figures counted not more than a million, while another assessment, based on the ARA's medical division, spoke of two million. On {{the other side of}} the scale, some sources spoke of ten million dead. According to Betrand M. Patenaude, [...] "such a number <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> extravagant after the many tens of millions of victims of war, famine, and terror in the twentieth century".|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, York {{formed the}} Alvin C. York Foundation {{with the mission}} of {{increasing}} educational opportunities in his region of Tennessee. Board members included the area's congressman, Cordell Hull, who later became Secretary of State under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo, and Tennessee Governor Albert Roberts. Plans called for a non-sectarian institution providing vocational training {{to be called the}} York Agricultural Institute. York concentrated on fund-raising, though he disappointed audiences who wanted to hear about the Argonne when he instead explained that [...] "I occupied one space in a fifty mile front. I saw so little it <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> worthwhile discussing it. I'm trying to forget the war {{in the interest of the}} mountain boys and girls that I grew up among." [...] He fought first to win financial support from the state and county, then battled local leaders about the school's location. Refusing to compromise, he resigned and developed plans for a rival York Industrial School. After a series of lawsuits he gained control of the original institution and was its president when it opened in December 1929. As the Great Depression deepened, the state government failed to provide promised funds, and York mortgaged his farm to fund bus transportation for students. Even after he was ousted as president in 1936 by political and bureaucratic rivals, he continued to donate money.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying the {{directors}} were skilled at [...] "springing surprises" [...] from the writers' [...] "ingenious" [...] screenplay. Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, [...] "Since villains so often steal the show in animation, Despicable Me smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru." [...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "The result is pleasant and diverting, if ultimately forgettable, and it's one of the rare instances in the recent history of 3-D's resurrection as The Savior of Cinema in which the technology doesn't dim the screen or distract the focus." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "The setup is pure Looney Tunes, and indeed, Despicable Me is at its best when trading in the anything-for-a-laugh prankery that was a specialty of the Termite Terrace crowd." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying, [...] "Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Neither as rich in story nor stunning in animation as Pixar offerings, Despicable Me instead settles for simply being goofy good fun, and it <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> like settling at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Catherine the Great (1762–96), {{children}} are at play in St. Petersburg's Summer Garden pretending to be soldiers. Two officers — Tsurin and Chekalinsky — enter, the former complaining about his bad luck at gambling. They remark that another officer, Herman, seems obsessed with the gaming table but never bets, being frugal and methodical. Herman appears with Tomsky, who remarks that his friend <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> like his old self: is anything bothering him? Herman admits he {{is in love with}} a girl above his station whose name he does not even know. When Prince Yeletsky, an officer, strolls into the park, Chekalinsky congratulates him on his recent engagement. Yeletsky declares his happiness while Herman, aside, curses him enviously. Yeletsky points out his fiancée, Liza, who has just appeared with her grandmother, the old Countess. Catching sight of Herman, the two women note they have seen him before, staring at them with frightening intensity. Herman realizes that Liza is his unknown beloved. When Yeletsky and the women leave, Herman is lost in thought as the other officers discuss the Countess: known as the Queen of Spades and formerly as the Muskovite Venus, due to her beauty, she succeeded at gambling in her youth by trading amorous favors for the winning formula of Count St. Germain in Paris. Tomsky says only two men, her husband and, later on, her young lover, ever learned her secret, because she was warned by an apparition to beware a [...] "third suitor" [...] who would try to force it from her. Musing on the winning sequence of three cards, the others lightly suggest that such a combination would solve Herman's problems. Threatened by approaching thunder, all leave except Herman, who vows to learn the Countess' secret.|$|E

2500|$|Bella has {{received}} a generally negative reception from critics. Publishers Weekly states that, after her transformation into a vampire, [...] "it's almost impossible to identify with her" [...] in Breaking Dawn. Lilah Lohr of the Chicago Tribune compares Bella's character {{to the story of}} the Quileute wolves and describes it as [...] "less satisfying." [...] During Twilight, Kirkus Reviews stated that [...] "Bella's appeal is based on magic rather than character", but that her and Edward's [...] "portrayal of dangerous lovers hits the spot". In the review of New Moon, Kirkus Reviews said that Bella's personality was [...] "flat and obsessive". Laura Miller of salon.com said, in regards to Edward and Bella, [...] "neither of them has much personality to speak of." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Reese, in her review of Breaking Dawn noted, in regard to Bella, [...] "You may wish she had loftier goals and a mind of her own, but these are fairy tales, and as a steadfast lover in the Disney Princess mold, Bella has a certain saccharine appeal", and that during Bella's pregnancy [...] "she is not only hard to identify with but positively horrifying, especially while guzzling human blood to nourish the infant." [...] Washington Post journalist Elizabeth Hand noted how Bella was often described as breakable and that [...] "Edward's habit of constantly pulling her onto his lap or having her ride on his back further emphasize her childlike qualities", continuing to write that [...] "the overall effect is a weird infantilization that has repellent overtones to an adult reader and <b>hardly</b> <b>seems</b> like an admirable model to foist upon our daughters (or sons)." [...] Gina Dalfonzo, in an article posted on the National Review website, calls Bella [...] "self-deprecating" [...] before her transformation into a vampire, and afterwards she is [...] "insufferably vain". Dalfonzo also states that Bella gets what she wants and discovers her worth [...] "by giving up her identity and throwing away nearly everything in life that matters." [...] Bella Swan was often compared to Katniss Everdeen on the publication of The Hunger Games.|$|E
