40|$|This paper {{argues that}} resurrecting {{copyright}} <b>formalities</b> is justified {{from a human}} rights perspective, especially {{in the context of}} Article 15 (1) (c) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Copyright <b>formalities</b> were abolished in the early twentieth century. Since then, the copyright system has operated without <b>formalities,</b> copyright protection existing from the moment an original artistic or literary work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression. The abolishment of <b>formalities</b> has created new problems of orphan works and difficulties in making licensing arrangements. As a result, calls have been made to reintroduce copyright <b>formalities.</b> However, natural rights theorists and human rights activists have opposed this proposal on the ground that it will breach the human rights of creators. This paper contends that reinstating copyright <b>formalities</b> will not have any such human rights implications. It discusses the types and functions of copyright <b>formalities</b> before arguing that copyright <b>formalities</b> must be reintroduced because they provide legal certainty, will cure the problem of orphan works in the future, facilitate the clearance of rights and enhance the flow of information by enlarging the public domain. From a human rights perspective, <b>formalities</b> should be revived because the human right of property is subjected to <b>formalities</b> and by analogy, the enjoyment of human rights of creators can also be conditioned on formalities; patentees are also protected by art 15 (1) (c) but patents are subjected to formalities; <b>formalities</b> will enhance the moral interests of authors and they will assist in achieving the balance in the fulfilment of competing human rights. However, if the new copyright <b>formalities</b> impose an unbearable economic burden on the authors and ignore the issue of unintentional non-compliance with <b>formalities,</b> the human rights of creators could be potentially breached. The paper concludes that copyright <b>formalities</b> should be brought back, albeit, in a revised and relaxed form so that they are human rights compliant...|$|R
40|$|Rejecting the {{conventional}} story that <b>formalities</b> in copyright law were abolished by the Berne Convention, this Article demonstrates that privately administered systems of <b>formalities</b> {{play a significant}} role in the administration of copyright law worldwide. Indeed, they must because copyright is designed to support a transaction structure which requires rightsholders who seek to attract licensing partners to go through some formal step to identify themselves and the works in which they have a legal or beneficial interest. Canvassing the landscape of mandatory and voluntary public and private systems of <b>formalities,</b> this article argues that: (1) national policymakers retain more policy authority under Berne to impose certain formal requirements on rightsholders than those with a formalist understanding of public <b>formalities</b> argue; (2) private systems of <b>formalities</b> are extensive, economically significant, but are not interoperable with each other in many cases and with voluntary registries and other voluntary public <b>formalities</b> systems; and (3) policymakers should use a mix of approaches to improve the functioning of both public and private <b>formalities</b> systems by promoting or requiring transparency, efficiency, and interoperability in their design and administration...|$|R

40|$|This paper, {{which was}} {{presented}} at the 2009 ALAI conference in London, examines the possible reintroduction of copyright <b>formalities</b> against the background of the challenges that copyright law faces in the digital era.

5|$|With the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople {{de facto}} {{recognized}} by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans {{went on to}} facilitate further conquests in Europe and in the Middle East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, Russian and Austrian attempts to contain the Ottoman threat {{became more and more}} a <b>formality</b> until the official dissolution of the Empire after World War I.|$|E
5|$|All German {{officers}} {{were required to}} obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic <b>formality.</b> When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born in Moscow in April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in Wellingsbüttel, Hamburg. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.|$|E

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the <b>formality</b> requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E
5|$|The College of Arms {{is also an}} {{authorised}} {{location for}} enrolling a change of name. In common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular <b>formality</b> to change one's name.

On being enrolled the deed is customarily 'gazetted', that is published in the London Gazette. The deed poll is not entered on the registers, but is still published, if the name change only affects one's given name.|$|E

Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement.

5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of <b>formality.</b> The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was {{the focal point of the}} service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E

Handling conference opponents Ohio and Miami (Ohio) with relative ease, Buffalo continued conference play by beating Akron in a four-hour, four-overtime slugfest, 43–40, in Akron's final football game at the Rubber Bowl. In their next game, against Bowling Green, the Bulls found themselves down 21–0 midway through the third quarter, but still managed to come back for their third overtime win of the season. With the win, Buffalo clinched the MAC East championship and ensured that they would have their first winning regular season since moving to Division I-A; the final regular season game, a 24–21 loss to Kent State, was only a <b>formality.</b> The Bulls finished the regular season with an overall record of 7–5, 5–3 within the conference.|$|E
