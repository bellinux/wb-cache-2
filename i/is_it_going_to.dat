So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna {{be a little bit of}} one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

[...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen? When <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E

500|$|Along with musicians D'Angelo and Erykah Badu, Maxwell was {{credited}} with helping to shape the [...] "neo soul" [...] movement that rose to prominence during the late 1990s. Along with D'Angelo's Brown Sugar (1995) and Badu's Baduizm (1997), Urban Hang Suite has been recognized by writers for beginning neo soul's popularity and helping the genre obtain commercial visibility. However, in contrast to D'Angelo, Maxwell was more conventional in his approach on his debut album. The term [...] "neo soul" [...] was penned in the late 1990s by record executive Kedar Massenburg, who managed both D'Angelo and Erykah Badu. According to Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from more classical styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R counterparts. In commenting on the [...] "new soul revival" [...] in music, Maxwell told Entertainment Weekly in 1997 that [...] "everything out there musically was inspired or influenced by something from the past. It's not about creating some super-fresh new thing. If it doesn't lend itself to your history, how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> extend to your future?" [...] According to Kerika Fields, Maxwell received an overwhelmingly positive reaction to his debut album from music listeners due to their weariness of contemporary black music's predictability.|$|E

2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Kevin Hoskins {{said that}} the band [...] "continues to rock stages year after year. I feel like I say that with every release, which is {{impressive}} since they've been around {{for almost two decades}} now. So, what's one to expect from 'O God Help Us All?' Exactly the same Disciple as always: some solid hard rock tunes mixed with a healthy dose of ballads. Though it may not carry the lyrical depth or stellar musical creativity of other acts, it can keep your head bobbing all day long." [...] Hoskins wrote that [...] "In the end, this is what Disciple is known for. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be played all over Christian rock stations? Absolutely. But will it be the most mind-blowing album you've heard this year? Definitely not. Fans of Disciple will not be disappointed, but I don't except the band to garner any new attention with this release." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} by Pitchfork, the album's lyrics address [...] "the emotional and environmental costs of modernity run amok". [...] "Red Barked Trees", the track {{that inspired the}} album title, was said by Lewis to be about [...] "dismay and hope, and the wonder of technology versus the ancient knowledge of alchemy. Will we destroy rare invaluable flora and fauna before we can research and exploit their unique properties? In the end, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the red-barked tree that's going to hold the cure for cancer?" [...] Newman stated about the song, [...] "It's got an open-eyed beauty to it, {{looking at the world}} as a mysterious place. It's more like Pentangle than Wire! Wire have never made a track anything like it: it's in ¾ time, with acoustic guitars, bouzouki and organ. It's an innovative track for Wire – perhaps the most different. There's nothing in our catalogue that sounds anything like it, and that pleases me immensely." ...|$|E
