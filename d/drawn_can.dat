50|$|Furthermore, two {{additional}} items known as Fire and Ice were added, {{and depending on}} which card is <b>drawn,</b> <b>can</b> be placed on certain pawns on the board, modifying the playing rules for those pawns. In short, fire gives a pawn {{the ability to move}} ahead quickly before the player's turn, and ice stops a pawn from being moved (or removed from play) at all.|$|E
50|$|The dominoes {{are first}} turned face down and shuffled. Then, each player picks seven dominoes {{to form their}} hand. With more than four players, the game {{requires}} an extended set. The number of dominoes <b>drawn</b> <b>can</b> be increased when fewer players are using a larger set (for instance, four players using a double-twelve set can draw 15 dominoes). Any remaining dominoes are placed to the side, forming the boneyard.|$|E

50|$|Script typefaces place {{particular}} {{demands on}} printing technology if the letters {{are intended to}} join up like handwriting. A typeface intended to mimic handwriting, such as Claude Garamond's grecs du roi typeface, will require many alternate characters. In digital type these (once <b>drawn)</b> <b>can</b> be substituted seamlessly through contextual ligature insertion in applications like InDesign, but this was complicated in metal. Another complexity in metal type was that sorts had to have delicate overhanging parts to interlock. This required careful design and casting for the sorts to fit together without gaps or the sorts breaking. Florian Hardwig, an expert on typesetting, has noted that in Germany {{in the twentieth century}} business needs led to the introduction of a more rugged style of script typeface without overhangs, in which gaps were filled in by the natural spread of ink on paper.|$|E

Only basic probability theory is needed for this purpose. The transversal counting can be done efficiently by a recently introduced algorithm that encodes all possible transversals in an efficient way.

Biases are often introduced in this initial phase of statistical analyses. The paper addresses the sampling problem in relation to traditional author co-citation analysis. It identifies common biases (misrepresentation of different theoretical orientations within the domain of study, national differences, misrepresentation of document types, ISI data) and discusses possible alternatives (“authoritative ” lists of authors, PFNETs, domain analysis). It concludes that conducting a proper domain analysis before starting the sampling procedure {{seems to be the}} only good answer to the sampling problem...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} both {{adolescents}} with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing controls {{were presented with}} conditional reasoning problems using familiar content. In this task both valid and fallacious conditional inferences {{that would otherwise be}} <b>drawn</b> <b>can</b> be suppressed if counterexample cases are brought to mind. Such suppression occurs when additional premises are presented, whose effect is to suggest such counterexample cases. In this study we predicted and observed that this suppression effect was substantially and significantly weaker for autistic participants. We take this as evidence that autistics are less contextualised in their reasoning, a finding that can be linked to research on autism on a variety of other cognitive tasks. 15 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Simulated Evolution (SimE) is an {{evolutionary}} metaheuristic that has pro-duced results comparable to well established stochastic heuristics such as SA, TS and GA, with shorter runtimes. However, for optimization {{problems with a}} very large set of elements, such as in VLSI cell placement and routing, runtimes can still be very large and parallelization is an attractive option for reducing runtimes. Compared to other metaheuristics, parallelization of SimE has not been extensively explored. This paper presents a comprehensive set of parallelization approaches for SimE when applied to multiobjective VLSI cell placement problem. Each of these approaches are evaluated with respect to SimE characteristics and the constraints imposed by the problem instance. Conclusions <b>drawn</b> <b>can</b> be extended to parallelization of SimE when applied to other optimization problems...|$|E
