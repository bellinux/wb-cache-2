5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
25|$|As President, Giri unquestioningly {{accepted}} Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's {{decision to}} sack the Charan Singh ministry in Uttar Pradesh and advised {{her to go}} in for early elections in 1971. The ordinance abolishing privy purses and privileges of the erstwhile rulers of India's princely states was promulgated by Giri after the government's original amendment was defeated in the Rajya Sabha. His advice to Prime Minister Gandhi against the appointement of A.N. Ray as the Chief Justice of India superseding three judges senior to him was ignored by her as was his warning that a crackdown on striking railwaymen would only <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> As President, Giri made 14 state visits to 22 countries in South and South East Asia, Europe and Africa.|$|E
500|$|On May27, {{three days}} before Agatha became a {{tropical}} depression, the Pacaya volcano, located about [...] south of Guatemala City, erupted, killing {{at least one person}} and blanketing nearby areas with layers of ash. The eruption prompted officials to shut down the country's international airport. Upon the formation of Agatha, people feared that excessive rainfall from the storm could <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and trigger lahars. This had the effect of clogging the underground pipes with soot, increasing the chances of pipe rupture.|$|E
50|$|In a {{qualifying}} {{match for}} the Olympic football tournament, home fans began rioting after a late Peru goal was disallowed. Police fired tear gas into <b>the</b> crowd, <b>exacerbating</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> which ended with 318 deaths.|$|R
5000|$|To {{make matters}} worse, Nadia's jealous ex-boyfriend, David (John Larroquette), shows up and <b>exacerbates</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> by {{stalking}} <b>the</b> couple all night, assaulting {{and attempting to}} assault Walter several times, even ramming Walter's car with his own.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first law}} of holes, or {{the law of}} holes, is an adage which states that [...] "if you find {{yourself}} in a hole, stop digging". Meaning that if in an untenable position, it is best to stop carrying on and <b>exacerbating</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|R
500|$|At {{the height}} of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing his untenable position, decided to abandon his {{responsibilities}} as leader of Miletus and of the revolt. He left Miletus with all the members of his faction who would accompany him, and went to the part of Thrace that Darius had granted to Histiaeus after the campaign of 513 BC. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled. Some modern historians have suggested that he went to Thrace to exploit the greater natural resources of the region, and thus support the revolt. [...] Others have suggested that finding himself at the centre of an internal conflict in Miletus, he chose to go into exile rather than <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
500|$|After the 1998 election, Janmaat became {{increasingly}} worried by legal pressure, {{believing that the}} Centre Democrats could become the government's next target after CP'86 was officially banned in 1998. He founded the [...] "Conservative Democrats" [...] as a potential successor party {{in the event that}} the Centre Democrats was proscribed. The new party contested the 1999 European elections as the Lijstverbinding Centrumdemocraten/Conservatieve Democraten, a supposed two-party cooperation, where the two names in reality represented the same party. It won only 0.5% of the vote in the election, a showing widely seen as the last spasm of a dying party. Janmaat's increasing physical exhaustion only served to <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> Nonetheless, with a new political climate following the September 11 attacks and the rise of Pim Fortuyn, Janmaat sought political rehabilitation in his final years. The reason was that his earlier criminal convictions arose from stating things that had now become accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Guidelines {{released}} in 2011 in the U.S. recommend {{that use of}} Drive Stun as a pain compliance technique be avoided.

The guidelines state [...] "Using the ECW to achieve pain compliance may have limited effectiveness and, when used repeatedly, may even <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> by inducing rage in the subject".|$|E
5000|$|Bishop and Goren {{often seem}} to have a lack of {{chemistry}} between them.

50|$|During {{the time}} of China’s {{economic}} reform in 1978, with soft budget constraints and the requirement to implement the government’s goal of full-employment, the SOE sector had substantial redundant labor and many state owned firms were operating at a loss. In 1995 and 1996, around 50% of the SOEs (mostly small or medium-sized) reported losses (Meng, 2003). The Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> <b>The</b> Chinese government was forced to take actions to improve efficiency of the SOEs and to stem losses.|$|R
50|$|Though {{protection}} {{exists in}} the park, {{there are a few}} loopholes. The geographical topography with hostile terrain cris-crossed by several rivers and their tributaries, long international border with Bangladesh, fishing trawlers and launches enables poaching and the cutting of wood, affecting the mangrove forests.

[...] "I signed the letter without reading it carefully enough, without asking myself {{if some of the}} wording wouldn't <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> rather than bring about constructive dialogue," [...] Fonda wrote on the Huffington Post website. She added that the suffering of both sides should be articulated.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} reports of abuse broke, the Prime Minister ordered Home Minister Azmi Khalid {{to travel to}} China to improve Malaysia's image there. Reportedly, the number of Chinese {{tourists}} had been dropping {{over the past few}} months, and it was feared the abuse scandal would further <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> It was later revealed that the Cabinet directed Azmi to go on the trip before the scandal blew open.|$|E
50|$|From 1950s on, Greek {{authorities}} did {{not comply}} with obligations undersigned in the Treaty, which gave way to considerable human rights violations. Growing political instability due to the Greek civil war followed by the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 further instigated Greek nationalism thus, <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of minorities, in particular of the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace.|$|R
50|$|The PND {{experienced}} internal {{division in}} the late 1990s. In May 1997, Awaleh suspended PND spokesman Farah Ali Wabert from the party, a move that reportedly <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> By November 1998, a rival leadership under Mahdi Ahmed Abdillahié controlled the PND headquarters, and in December 1998 Awaleh {{was reported to be}} missing.

40|$|Weaknesses {{within the}} check-clearing system played a {{hitherto}} unrecognized {{role in the}} banking crises of the Great Depression. Correspondent check-clearing networks were vulnerable to counter-party cascades. Accounting conventions that overstated reserves available to corresponding institutions may have <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> <b>The</b> initial banking panic began when a correspondent network centered in Nashville collapsed, forcing over 100 institutions to suspend operations. As the contraction continued, additional correspondent systems imploded. The vulnerability of correspondent networks is one reason that banks that cleared via correspondents failed at higher rates than other institutions during the Great Depression. ...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that heavy {{government}} borrowing over the past cycle has led to a severe structural deficit, reminiscent of previous crises, which will inevitably <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and place the UK economy in an unfavourable position compared to its OECD partners as attempts are made to stimulate recovery, other OECD nations having allowed greater room for manoeuvre thanks to contrasting policies of relatively tighter fiscal control prior to the global downturn.|$|E
50|$|To <b>exacerbate</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> {{the region}} {{experienced}} a drought {{during the summer}} of 1864. Sims' efforts to purchase wheat for the army met with little success. In October, Sims collected 14 bushels and 25 pounds of wheat for the Quartermaster Department. In November, 1864 Sims provided the Army Quartermaster with 1,948 pounds of baled oats; 2,093 pounds of fodder; and 1,242 pounds of corn. On March 9, 1865 he provided 11,284 pounds of straw.|$|E

50|$|Food riots were {{occurring}} {{before the}} arrival of Union troops because the Confederate Army was suffering the same food shortages and was taking food stocks for its own needs.

50|$|The Dynaflow was an {{inherently}} inefficient design {{due to its}} sole reliance on the torque converter in normal driving. <b>Exacerbating</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was <b>the</b> dual stator arrangement, which wasted more power than the simpler three element converters used with other automatic transmissions, such as Chrysler's TorqueFlite.

50|$|Conflicts of {{interests}} are minimized - With the manager scheduling workers into the shifts required of the business, unhappiness arises {{when all the}} needs of the workers is not met by the manager in their work schedule.

50|$|In 1927, {{the first}} militant anti-fascist organization, known as TIGR, was established. The organization, founded by local Slovenes (mostly {{young people of}} liberal, {{nationalist}} and social-democratic orientation) carried out several attacks on Italian military and administrative personnel, which further <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> in <b>the</b> region.
