This also collects water from the Gose on the way. A further 4.8 km long diversion runs from the Radau to the Großer Romke and thus into the Oker-Grane Tunnel as well.

50|$|The {{settling}} velocity, {{defined as}} the residence time taken for the particles to settle in the tank, enables the calculation of tank volume. Precise design and operation of a sedimentation tank is of high importance {{in order to keep}} the amount of sediment entering the <b>diversion</b> <b>system</b> to a minimum threshold by maintaining the transport system and stream stability to remove the sediment diverted from the system. This is achieved by reducing stream velocity as low as possible for the longest period of time possible. This is feasible by widening the approach channel and lowering its floor to reduce flow velocity thus allowing sediment to settle out of suspension due to gravity. The settling behavior of heavier particulates is also affected by the turbulence.|$|E

40|$|Access {{to rapid}} {{emergency}} {{care is a}} cornerstone ofmodern health care systems. The unexpected natureof many illnesses and injuries means that much of that care cannot be scheduled and occurs outside of regular business hours. However, widespread reports of emergency department (ED) overcrowding and ambulance diversion have {{cast doubt on the}} capacity of some emergency systems to provide consistent and rapid care. 1 – 4 Ambulance <b>diversion</b> <b>systems</b> help in the management of ambulance traffic during periods of ED overcrowding. Their purpose is to temporarily slow the influx of new pa-tients to a participating hospital and hence to ease over-crowding. The result is that ambulances do not take pa-tients to the closest hospital but travel instead to an alternate one further away, which inevitably results in some prehospital delay. 5 However, many ambulance systems al-low paramedics to override the diversion status of an ED when transporting critically ill patients. The extent of pre-hospital delay caused by these <b>diversion</b> <b>systems</b> is un-known, nor is it known whether override provisions dimin-ish delays for critically ill patients. Our objective was to determine whether greater ambu-lance diversion was associated with longer prehospital de-lays for patients with chest pain. We also sought to deter-mine whether the delay varied with the severity of illness. We chose to study patients with chest pain since this condi-tion is common, serious and urgent. 6 – 11 Our hypothesis was that a period of greater ambulance diversion would be asso-ciated with ambulance delays for patients with chest pain, with the longest delay occurring during the transport inter-val (departure from the scene to arrival at the hospital). We further hypothesized that this association would not vary with severity of illness.

5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{many of the}} {{professional}} mental health workers {{who had worked with}} Judge Goodman sought to re-establish a mental health court in Indianapolis. Representatives of the county's mental health service providers and other stake holders began meeting weekly. The group decided to accept the name of the PAIR Program (PAIR stood for Psychiatric Assertive Identification and Referral). After, a couple years of lobbying the local authorities in Marion County, Indiana, the mental health court began as a formal program in 1996. Many consider this to be the nation’s first mental health court in this second wave of mental health court initiatives. Since the PAIR Program did not operate with any new funds, there was not much scholarly research and therefore the accomplishments of Judge Goodman and the PAIR Program are frequently overlooked. The current PAIR Program is a comprehensive pretrial, post-booking <b>diversion</b> <b>system</b> for mentally ill offenders. [...] A program launched in Broward County, Florida was the first court, to be recognized and published as a specialized mental health court.

The Broward court and three other early mental health courts, Anchorage, AK, San Bernardino, CA, and King County, WA, were examined in a 2000 Bureau of Justice Assistance monograph, which was the first major study of this emerging judicial strategy.|$|E

A band-limited, random-noise signal, with most of the energy focused between 122 and 128 kHz, was projected into the turbine forebay during randomly selected generating cycles. The effectiveness of the <b>diversion</b> <b>system</b> was assessed by monitoring fish passage through the turbine and two adjacent fishways. During, the study, fish representing 27 taxa were captured. For the 11 species with sufficient data, we modeled the rate of passage {{as a function of the}} sampling site and the on/off status of the <b>diversion</b> <b>system</b> and compared models with and without a set of environmental variables. The environmental component of the model was highly significant for all 11 species. When the environmental variables were removed from the models, the standard errors of the diversion coefficients increased, and between-site comparisons showed that factors other than the on/off status of the <b>diversion</b> <b>system</b> were affecting the effectiveness estimates. Model coefficients were estimated using maximum likelihood, assuming Poisson or extra-Poisson error distributions. The catches of all 11 species were overdispersed, and the statistical significance of the effectiveness estimates was overestimated when a Poisson error distribution was assumed. We conclude that the <b>diversion</b> <b>system</b> reduced passage through the turbines for members of the genus Alosa but that it was not effective for the other eight specics.
