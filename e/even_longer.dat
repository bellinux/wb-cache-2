5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel {{was not designed}} to be serviced after launch, and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.|$|E

5|$|The lighter {{isotopes}} {{usually have}} shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100ms for 260Bh, 261Bh, 262Bh, and 262mBh were observed. 264Bh, 265Bh, 266Bh, and 271Bh are more stable at around 1s, and 267Bh and 272Bh have half-lives of about 10s. The heaviest isotopes {{are the most}} stable, with 270Bh and 274Bh having measured half-lives of about 61s and 54s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope 278Bh appearing to have an <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> half-life of about 690s. The unknown isotopes 273Bh and 275Bh are predicted to have <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> half-lives of around 90minutes and 40minutes respectively. Before its discovery, 274Bh was also predicted {{to have a long}} half-life of 90minutes, but it was found to have a shorter half-life of only about 54seconds.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, a {{redistribution}} divided Whitlam's electorate of Werriwa in two, {{with his}} Cronulla home {{located in the}} new electorate of Hughes. Although Whitlam would have received ALP support in either division, he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to Cabramatta. This meant <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> journeys for his older children to attend school, since neither electorate had a high school at the time, and they attended school in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission <b>even</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{large and}} {{damaging}} tsunami that was generated {{was out of}} proportion relative {{to the size of}} the event, based on its short-period body wave magnitude. The Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency assigned a magnitude of 6.8, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a similar value of 6.1 (both body wave magnitude) that were calculated from short-period seismic waves (1–2 seconds in the case of the USGS). The USGS then presented a moment magnitude of 7.2 that was calculated from 5–100-second surface waves, and Harvard University subsequently revealed that a moment magnitude of 7.7 had been resolved based on <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> 150-second surface waves.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals <b>even</b> <b>longer,</b> and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{trend toward}} {{increasing}} half-lives for the heavier isotopes; thus the heaviest three known isotopes, 267Sg, 269Sg, and 271Sg, are also the longest-lived, having half-lives in minutes. Some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> half-lives, with the longest-lived predicted isotope being 272Sg {{which is expected to}} have a half-life of about an hour. Additionally, 263Sg, 265Sg, 265mSg, as well as the predicted 268Sg have or should have half-lives measured in seconds. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives measured in milliseconds, {{with the exception of the}} shortest-lived isotope, 261mSg, with a half-life of only 92microseconds.|$|E
5|$|This {{rendition}} {{is fraught}} with many errors but the basic story line seems to fit the modern consensus. Father Queroz’s time line is also anachronistic.

Also the Gujarati origin of the Kings paternal line also in not in conformance with native claims of origin from the city of Varanasi which is in today's Uttar Pradesh not in the historical Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Volcanoes {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be active if they have had eruptions during the Holocene. However, {{as demonstrated by the}} unexpected eruption of Chaiten volcano in Chile in May 2008, even long-inactive volcanoes can become active again. Such volcanoes can constitute a threat to regions with seemingly quiet volcanism. Ciomadul has had repose periods of over 10,000 years and possibly <b>even</b> <b>longer.</b> Zircon crystallization data imply that the magma chambers of Ciomadul were active over time spans of over 300,000 years.|$|E

5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6seconds, but {{it is possible that the}} unconfirmed flerovium-290 with one extra neutron may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 19seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these farthest reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> half-lives.|$|E
5|$|All {{meitnerium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 7.6seconds. (The unconfirmed 282Mt is yet heavier and appears to have an <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> half-life of 67seconds.) A metastable nuclear isomer, 270mMt, {{has been reported to}} also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44seconds respectively. The remaining four isotopes have half-lives between 1 and 20milliseconds. The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as 265Mt, 272Mt, 273Mt, and 279Mt, are predicted to have half-lives longer than the known isotopes. Before its discovery, 274Mt and 277Mt were predicted to have half-lives of 20seconds and 1minute respectively, but they were later found to have half-lives of only 0.44seconds and 5milliseconds respectively.|$|E

His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Including {{the victory}} over Leeds in 1975, Bayern Munich {{had won the}} European Cup on three {{occasions}} going into the 1999 final. With three victories in a row from 1974 to 1976, they became only the third team to achieve such a feat after Real Madrid (1956 to 1960) and Ajax (1971 to 1973). They had also finished as runners-up twice: in 1982 against Aston Villa and 1987 against Porto. Although Bayern had been waiting 23 years for a European Cup title, Manchester United had had to wait <b>even</b> <b>longer,</b> their only victory having come in 1968. Their manager then was Matt Busby, who had been seriously injured in the Munich air disaster, which killed eight of his players {{on the way back}} from a European Cup tie in Belgrade 10 years earlier, before rebuilding the team to become European Cup winners. Busby died in 1994; the day of the 1999 Champions League final would have been his 90th birthday.|$|E
5|$|More than 150 {{years after}} its creation, the {{original}} main line {{has been described by}} an historian as one of the masterpieces of railway design. Working westwards from Paddington, the line crosses the valley of the River Brent on Wharncliffe Viaduct and the River Thames on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, which at the time of construction was the largest span achieved by a brick arch bridge. The line then continues through Sonning Cutting before reaching Reading after which it crosses the Thames twice more, on Gatehampton and Moulsford bridges. Between Chippenham and Bath is Box Tunnel, the longest railway tunnel driven by that time. Several years later, the railway opened the <b>even</b> <b>longer</b> Severn Tunnel to carry a new line between England and Wales beneath the River Severn.|$|E
