40|$|Summary]: The {{effect of}} <b>dehorning</b> Brahman {{crossbred}} cattle of four age groups on their subsequent bodyweight performance was monitored in 4 drafts of cattle between 1975 and 1980. During the 6 weeks following <b>dehorning,</b> bodyweight change of dehorned cattle was less (P < 0. 05) {{than that of}} horned cattle in half of the groups. There were no differences between treatments, in bodyweight gain to 12 months after <b>dehorning,</b> following any <b>dehorning</b> date or in final bodyweight, for each draft. The data suggest that age of <b>dehorning</b> is not critical...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} if ketoprofen, {{in addition to}} local anaesthesia, reduces pain following <b>dehorning,</b> we experimentally dehorned dairy calves, less than 2 weeks of age, with (20 calves) or without (20 calves) intramuscular injections of ketoprofen. All calves received a local anesthetic (lidocaine) prior to <b>dehorning</b> and were dehorned with heat cauterization. Cortisol concentration was measured via jugular blood samples taken immediately before <b>dehorning</b> and at 3 and 6 hours following <b>dehorning.</b> Calf behavior was recorded between 0 and 2, 3 and 5, and 6 and 8 hours following <b>dehorning.</b> There was no significant (P > 0. 10) effect on creep feed consumption, cortisol concentration, {{or any of the}} behavioral measures during the time periods studied. However, the difference in cortisol concentrations from the time of <b>dehorning</b> until 3 hours later was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in the ketoprofen-treated group. These results suggest that ketoprofen, in addition to local anesthesia, may alleviate short-term pain following <b>dehorning</b> with a butane <b>dehorning</b> device in dairy calves less than 2 weeks of age...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEffects of {{a single}} {{injection}} of meloxicam on calf behavior, pain sensitivity, and feed and water intakes were examined following <b>dehorning.</b> Sixty Holstein heifer calves were blocked by age and randomly assigned to receive an i. m. injection of meloxicam (0. 5 mg/kg) or a placebo. All calves were given a lidocaine cornual nerve block (5 mL per horn). Treatments and nerve blocks were administered 10 min before cautery <b>dehorning.</b> Continuous sampling of behavior was performed during five 1 -h intervals using video recordings, and total daily activity was monitored using an accelerometer. A pain sensitivity test was administered with a pressure algometer, and feed and water intakes were recorded daily. Calves were sham-dehorned 24 h before actual <b>dehorning</b> to establish baseline values, and all variables were assessed at the same times following <b>dehorning</b> and sham <b>dehorning</b> for up to 48 h post-dehorning. Meloxicam-treated calves displayed less ear flicking during the 44 h following <b>dehorning</b> (increases of 4. 29 ± 1. 10 and 1. 31 ± 0. 66 ear flicks/h in the first 24 h, and increases of 3. 27 ± 0. 89 and 0. 55 ± 0. 50 ear flicks/h during the second 24 h, for control and meloxicam calves, respectively) and less head shaking during the first 9 h following <b>dehorning</b> (increase of 2. 53 ± 0. 54 and 0. 85 ± 0. 46 headshakes/h over baseline for control and meloxicam, respectively). Meloxicam-treated calves were less active than controls during the first 5 h following <b>dehorning</b> (activity 34. 1 ± 3. 2 and 30. 6 ± 2. 6 for control and meloxicam, respectively) and displayed less sensitivity to pressure algometry 4 h after <b>dehorning</b> (pressure tolerance of 1. 62 ± 0. 13 kg of force and 2. 13 ± 0. 15 kg of force for control and meloxicam calves, respectively).

In Trial 1, 21 female Holstein dairy calves aged 8 to 24 weeks were randomly allocated to two groups: (1) scoop <b>dehorning</b> with a post-operative application of a novel topical anaesthetic powder (DTAP, n = 10); and (2) scoop <b>dehorning</b> with a post-operative application of a novel topical anaesthetic ethanol liquid (DTAE, n = 11). In Trial 2, 18 castrated male and 18 female Hereford beef calves aged 16 to 20 weeks were randomly allocated to four groups: (1) scoop <b>dehorning</b> with a pre-operative cornual nerve block of lignocaine (DCB, n = 9); (2) scoop <b>dehorning</b> with a post-operative application of the novel topical anaesthetic ethanol liquid from Trial 1 (DTAE, n = 9); (3) scoop <b>dehorning</b> with a post-operative application of a topical anaesthetic gel (DTAG, n = 9); and (4) sham <b>dehorning</b> (CON, n = 9). Sensitivity was assessed by scoring the behavioural response of calves to stimulation of the wound or skin at time points before and after treatment. In Trial 1, DTAP calves had a greater probability of displaying more severe responses than DTAE calves at 90 and 180 min (P < 0. 001).

40|$|In {{northern}} Australia, cattle genotypes {{are predominantly}} Bos indicus-derived and the extensive {{nature of the}} production systems mean they are commonly dehorned at 5 - 9 months of age.

We examined the effects on welfare of the administration of a local anaesthetic and/or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) during the dehorning of Brahman heifers (animal ethics approval RH 245 / 08). Weaners, 5 - 7 months-old, were allocated to four treatments (n= 15 /group) : Sham <b>dehorn</b> (S); <b>Dehorn</b> only (D); <b>Dehorn</b> + local anaesthetic (cornual block) + NSAID (LA/NSAID); and <b>Dehorn</b> + NSAID (NSAID).

50|$|Polled Holsteins are {{becoming}} more popular and frequently seen. Farmers understand the polled trait more and often benefit from having polled Holsteins in their herd. Horned Holsteins require <b>dehorning</b> at {{a few months of}} age to prevent growth of horns which can pose a threat to farmers and cattle handlers. <b>Dehorning</b> costs about $2 per calf. Holsteins with horns can also be more aggressive to fellow cows and cause severe injury to other cows within proximity. <b>Dehorning</b> Holstein calves costs money so having polled cows will save money. Another reason farmers prefer polled Holsteins is for the consumers. Consumers view <b>dehorning</b> as a painful process to calves and often animal welfare issues may arise or public intervention.

Two studies were conducted using three dimensional accelerometers to measure behavioral differences in cattle following <b>dehorning</b> and castration. The first study evaluated the potential of different analgesics to mitigate pain following castration and <b>dehorning</b> compared to negative controls as judged by behavioral measures. Holstein-Fresian calves given one of three different analgesic protocols (sodium salicylate, a combination of xylazine, ketamine and butorphanol, and both treatments together) or received no analgesia. All cattle were surgically castrated and dehorned. All treatment groups spent more time lying down and less time walking in the post-surgery than pre-surgery, and significant interactions were found between treatment and time relative to surgery (P< 0. 05). The second study evaluated behavioral changes following castration and <b>dehorning</b> performed independently or concurrently when compared to a negative control (no surgery). Accelerometers recorded behavior in Holstein-Fresian calves in which differing surgical procedures were performed: castration only (CO), <b>dehorning</b> only (DO), castration and <b>dehorning</b> (CD), and no surgical procedure performed (CON). Behavioral data was measured for 6 days following surgery. Significant interactions were found between treatment and time (P< 0. 05) in both walking and lying behavior.

40|$|Removing {{the horns}} of cattle when they arrive at feeding {{facilities}} is a common practice to reduce injury to other cattle. Bruising on carcasses of cattle that have been housed in pens containing horned cattle increases noticeably. Horned feeder cattle marketed in Arkansas regional livestock auction barns received average discounts of $ 3. 23 /cwt in 2005, giving producers the incentive to <b>dehorn</b> their cattle before marketing. Three common techniques (tipping, dehorning, and banding) are utilized {{in the field to}} remove or reduce horn length in beef cattle. Tipping is the practice of removing the tip of the horn such that the diameter of the horn is approximately 1 to 1. 5 inches in diameter. Dehorning is mechanically cutting {{the horns of}}f {{at the base of the}} horn near the head. The use of high-tension rubber bands to <b>dehorn</b> cattle has recently been implemented in some cattle feeding facilities. The band restricts blood circulation to the horns, resulting in necrosis, and the horns eventually fall off.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesHans CoetzeeDehorning is {{a painful}} {{husbandry}} procedure that is commonly performed in dairy calves. Parenteral meloxicam combined with local anesthesia mitigates the physiological and behavioral effects of <b>dehorning</b> in calves. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the influence of timing of oral meloxicam administration on physiological responses in calves after <b>dehorning.</b> Thirty Holstein bull calves 8 - 10 weeks of age (28 - 70 kg) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo-treated control group (CONT) (n= 10), calves receiving meloxicam administered orally (1 mg/kg) in powdered milk replacer 12 h prior to cautery <b>dehorning</b> (MEL-PRE) (n= 10) and calves receiving meloxicam administered as an oral bolus (1 mg/kg) at the time of <b>dehorning</b> (MEL-POST) (n= 10). Following cautery <b>dehorning,</b> blood samples were collected to measure cortisol, substance P (SP), haptoglobin, ex-vivo prostaglandin E 2 (PgE 2) production after lipopolysaccharide stimulation and meloxicam concentrations. Maximum ocular temperature (MOT) and mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) was also assessed. Data were analyzed using non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis and repeated measures ANOVA models. Mean peak meloxicam concentrations were 3. 61 ± 0. 21 μg/mL and 3. 27 ± 0. 14 μg/mL with average elimination half-lives of 38. 62 ± 5. 87 h and 35. 81 ± 6. 26 h in the MEL-PRE and MEL-POST groups respectively. Serum cortisol concentrations were lower in meloxicam-treated calves compared with control calves at 4 h post-dehorning (P= 0. 0004). SP concentrations were significantly higher in control calves compared with meloxicam-treated calves at 120 h after <b>dehorning</b> (P= 0. 038). PgE 2 concentrations were lower in meloxicam-treated calves compared with control calves (P= 0. 001). MNT was higher in control calves at 1 h after <b>dehorning</b> (P= 0. 02) but meloxicam-treated calves tended to have a higher MNT at 6 h after <b>dehorning</b> (P= 0. 07). There was no effect of timing of meloxicam administration on plasma cortisol concentrations (P= 0. 69), SP concentrations (P= 0. 86), haptoglobin concentrations (P= 0. 86), MOT (P= 0. 90), or MNT (P= 0. 99). However, PgE 2 concentrations in MEL-PRE calves were similar to CONT calves after 12 h post-dehorning, while MEL-POST calves had lower PgE 2 concentrations for 3 d post <b>dehorning.</b> These findings suggest that meloxicam reduced cortisol, SP and PgE 2 after <b>dehorning</b> but only PgE 2 production was significantly affected by the timing of meloxicam administration...|$|R
40|$|Data {{collected}} {{through a}} national, randomized mail survey (response rate 50 %) {{were used to}} identify reasons why veterinarians were likely (i) to use analgesic drugs when <b>dehorning</b> calves, and (ii) to perceive <b>dehorning</b> without analgesia as very painful. Logistic regression analysis indicated that veterinarians {{were more likely to}} be analgesic users the more they perceived that <b>dehorning</b> without analgesia was painful (OR = 1. 7, P < 0. 001). Other positive influences were if the veterinarian worked in British Columbia or Alberta (OR = 5. 9, P = 0. 005), and if they were primarily in dairy practice (OR = 3. 7, P = 0. 012) rather than beef practice. This effect of dairy practice was negated if the veterinarian also perceived that owners were unwilling to pay for analgesia (interaction term: OR = 0. 25, P = 0. 038). Veterinarians were also less likely to perceive <b>dehorning</b> without analgesia as very painful if they perceived that owners were unwilling to pay (OR = 0. 58, P = 0. 029). However, this effect on pain perception was offset by concern for personal safety (OR = 2. 7, P = 0. 015). The results are consistent with the relatively high level of outreach about animal welfare among farmers and veterinarians in the western provinces. The results confirm that many veterinarians’ approach to pain management for <b>dehorning</b> is influenced considerably by concern about cost. However, pain management for <b>dehorning</b> is not expensive and there is unequivocal evidence that <b>dehorning</b> calves without pain management causes significant distress.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Dehorning</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} involving calves on dairy operations in the United States. However, less than 20 % of producers report using analgesics or anesthetics during <b>dehorning.</b> Administration of a systemic analgesic drug {{at the time of}} <b>dehorning</b> may be attractive to dairy producers since cornual nerve blocks require 10 – 15 [*]min to take effect and only provide pain relief for a few hours. The primary objectives of this trial were to (1) describe the compartmental pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in calves after IV administration at 0. 5 [*]mg/kg and (2) to determine the effect of meloxicam (n[*]=[*] 6) or placebo (n[*]=[*] 6) treatment on serum cortisol response, plasma substance P (SP) concentrations, heart rate (HR), activity and weight gain in calves after scoop <b>dehorning</b> and thermocautery without local anesthesia.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{dynamic programming}} model is presented for decision-making by {{the manager of}} a small rhino reserve facing a poaching threat, with the objective of maximizing the rhino population size in the long term. The manager decides annually what proportion of the budget to spend on dehorning as opposed to law enforcement. Poacher incentives depend on revenues from illegal horn sales, which are related to the manager's decisions through the mean horn size of the rhino population (affected by spending on dehorning). Poacher incentives also depend on hunting costs, which are related to the manager's decisions through the risk of capture and punishment (affected by spending on law enforcement). The results suggest that, at realistic parameter values, the optimal strategy is to <b>dehorn</b> as many rhinos as possible annually except at very low rhino population sizes, budgets or mean horn sizes. The simple strategy of dehorning annually regardless of population size or mean horn size gives very similar results to the optimal strategy. Other potential strategies (such as dehorning only half the rhinos each year) performed badly. Selling horns and reinvesting the proceeds in rhino conservation did not provide enough revenue to significantly increase rhino population sizes...|$|E
40|$|As {{dehorning}} or {{removal of}} horn in cattle is rather a cruel but necessary operation, it is advisable {{to prevent the}} horns from growing in young calves rather than removing them after they have grown. However, in certain cases dehorning is required {{to be done in}} adult cattle due to fracture of the horn or horn cancer etc. In adult cattle, dehorning is best performed by a veterinary surgeon. Physical methods of dehorning include the use of embryotomy wire, guillotine shears, or dehorning knives, saws, or high tension rubber bands. The incorrect use of these instruments/tools can cause serious damage and even lead to fatalities. When cattle have large horns they are sometimes "tipped", a procedure that removes the sharp end of the horn but leaves the base. Dehorning of adult cattle is associated with increased risks of sinusitis, bleeding, prolonged wound healing and infection. Therefore, proper care must be taken to prevent these problems as per advice of a vet. To prevent maggot formation apply dressing oil containing linseed oil (100 ml), turpentine oil (10 ml) & eycalpytus oil (10 ml) twice daily Text Message: Dehornig is best done in young calf. To <b>dehorn</b> adult animal, help of vet is required. There is chance of bleeding and infection. Apply dressing oil to prevent fly. Reference...|$|E
40|$|The USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) {{collected}} data on management practices and cow-calf herds {{as a source}} of family income from a representative sample of cow-calf producers from 23 of the leading cow-calf states. Overall, 2, 713 producers with one or more beef cows participated in the NAHMS Beef ' 97 Study, representing 85. 7 percent of the beef cows and 77. 6 percent of the beef cow operations in the United States as of January 1997. Producers whose cow-calf herds were the primary source of family income were more productive than those whose herds were a supplemental source of income. Cow-calf herds were the primary source of income for 14 percent of the producers and provided supplemental income for 69 percent of the producers. While average herd size was larger for primary income herds, nearly half of the herds with 100 or more cows were non-primary income herds. Producers whose herds were a primary source of income were more likely to <b>dehorn</b> cattle, castrate bull calves, and practice artificial insemination and semen testing than producers whose herds were not a primary source of income. Primary income producers {{were also more likely to}} vaccinate preweaned calves. Due to greater weaning rates and a higher weaning percentage, primary income producers produced more pounds of weaned calf per exposed cow than did non-primary income producers (440 vs. 400 pounds).

40|$|Background: <b>Dehorning</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} involving calves on dairy operations in the United States. However, less than 20 % of producers report using analgesics or anesthetics during <b>dehorning.</b> Administration of a systemic analgesic drug {{at the time of}} <b>dehorning</b> may be attractive to dairy producers since cornual nerve blocks require 10 – 15 [*]min to take effect and only provide pain relief for a few hours. The primary objectives of this trial were to (1) describe the compartmental pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in calves after IV administration at 0. 5 [*]mg/kg and (2) to determine the effect of meloxicam (n[*]=[*] 6) or placebo (n[*]=[*] 6) treatment on serum cortisol response, plasma substance P (SP) concentrations, heart rate (HR), activity and weight gain in calves after scoop <b>dehorning</b> and thermocautery without local anesthesia. Results: Plasma meloxicam concentrations were detectable for 50 [*]h post-administration and fit a 2 -compartment model with a rapid distribution phase (mean T[subscript ½α][*]=[*] 0. 22 [*]±[*] 0. 087 [*]h) and a slower elimination phase (mean T[subscript ½β][*]=[*] 21. 86 [*]±[*] 3. 03 [*]h). <b>Dehorning</b> caused a significant increase in serum cortisol concentrations and HR (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). HR was significantly lower in the meloxicam-treated calves compared with placebo-treated calves at 8 [*]h (P[*]=[*] 0. 039) and 10 [*]h (P[*]=[*] 0. 044) after <b>dehorning.</b> Mean plasma SP concentrations were lower in meloxicam treated calves (71. 36 [*]±[*] 20. 84 [*]pg/mL) compared with control calves (114. 70 [*]±[*] 20. 84 [*]pg/mL) (P[*]=[*] 0. 038). Furthermore, the change in plasma SP from baseline was inversely proportional to corresponding plasma meloxicam concentrations (P[*]=[*] 0. 008). The effect of <b>dehorning</b> on lying behavior was less significant in meloxicam-treated calves (p[*]=[*] 0. 40) compared to the placebo-treated calves (P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Calves receiving meloxicam prior to <b>dehorning</b> gained on average 1. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 13 [*]kg bodyweight/day over 10 [*]days post-dehorning compared with 0. 40 [*]±[*] 0. 25 [*]kg bodyweight/day in the placebo-treated calves (p[*]=[*] 0. 042). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first published report examining the effects of meloxicam without local anesthesia on SP, activity and performance of calves post-dehorning. These findings suggest that administration of meloxicam alone immediately prior to <b>dehorning</b> does not mitigate signs of acute distress but may have long term physiological, behavior and performance effects...|$|R
