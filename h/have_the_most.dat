5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, {{but that the}} fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong enough to break human skin.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E

5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
