5|$|The Gracie Awards honor {{programming}} by, for {{and about}} women, {{as well as}} individuals who have made <b>exemplary</b> contributions to develop the industry. Gaga has won once.|$|E
5|$|The L had an <b>exemplary</b> safety record, and no {{members of}} the public were killed or injured during its 37-year existence, {{although}} accidents at Braunton Road and Chumhill did claim the lives of three track workers.|$|E
5|$|Captain Lang is a fully matured character, {{serious and}} calm in his demeanor, yet {{definite}} and energetic when strength was needed. Very good attitude as an officer. Demands of himself first. He understands {{how to reach}} the men under his command correctly. Captain Lang possesses an <b>exemplary</b> concept of service, has initiative and talent for improvisation to a large degree, well rooted in the National Socialist ideas.|$|E
5|$|Environmentalists, urban {{planners}} and cycling enthusiasts {{around the world}} have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate {{what they see as a}} success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond the Chicago metropolitan area have described the Cycle Center as <b>exemplary,</b> impressive, unique and ground-breaking.|$|E
5|$|Girl with Ball was {{exhibited}} at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in Newsweek {{review of the}} show. This work significantly alters the original source and is considered <b>exemplary</b> of Lichtenstein's works that exaggerate the mechanically produced appearance although {{the result of his}} painterly work. It is an enduring depiction of the contemporary beauty figure.|$|E
5|$|Ishaan's father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a {{successful}} executive who expects his children to excel. His mother, housewife Maya Awasthi (Tisca Chopra), is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan (Sachet Engineer), is an <b>exemplary</b> scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson {{was indicted}} on {{one count of}} knowingly {{receiving}} through the mails sexually explicit material depicting a minor in September. At trial in federal court, his attorney, George H. Moyer, noted his <b>exemplary</b> military service record, including a Bronze Star, service in Korea and Vietnam War and lack of a civilian criminal record beyond a drunken-driving conviction in 1958. He raised the entrapment defense.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing <b>exemplary</b> of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|The National Arts Awards is {{presented}} by Americans for the Arts, {{a nonprofit organization}} whose primary focus is advancing {{the arts in the}} United States. In 2015, Gaga received the Young Artist Award, which honors individuals who have achieved incredible accomplishments and <b>exemplary</b> leadership while still early in their career.|$|E
5|$|According to Billboard, it is {{the second-best}} selling album of the 2000s decade in the United States. With over eight million copies sold in 2004, the album {{was viewed as a}} sign of {{recovering}} album sales in the US, following three years of decline. It was also <b>exemplary</b> of urban music's commercial peak and dominance of the Billboard charts in 2004. Confessions has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2016, has sold over 10.3 million copies in the US and over 20 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are <b>exemplary</b> human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E
5|$|Botanical gardens {{must find}} a {{compromise}} between the need for peace and seclusion, {{while at the same}} time satisfying the public need for information and visitor services that include restaurants, information centres and sales areas that bring with them rubbish, noise, and hyperactivity. Attractive landscaping and planting design sometimes compete with scientific interests— with science now often taking second place. Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and <b>exemplary</b> environmental management.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of <b>exemplary</b> or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E
5|$|Confusion is a one-song Afrobeat {{album that}} begins with an entirely {{instrumental}} first half, which features free form interplay between Kuti's electric piano and drummer Tony Allen. It leads to an extended mid-tempo section with Allen's polyrhythms and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who subsequently delivers call-and-response vocal passages. In reviews since the record's release by EMI, the album was praised by music critics, who found it <b>exemplary</b> of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In both 2000 and 2010, Confusion was reissued and bundled with Kuti's 1973 Gentleman album.|$|E
5|$|Debates among monks on the Buddhist doctrines are {{integral}} to the learning process in the colleges in the Sera Monastery complex. This facilitates better comprehension of the Buddhist philosophy to attain higher levels of study. This <b>exemplary</b> debating tradition supplemented with gestures {{is said to be}} exclusive to this monastery, among the several other monasteries of Lhasa. Visitors also attend to witness these debates that are held as per a set schedule, every day in the 'Debating Courtyard' of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne players {{received}} a few accolades in the 2009–10 season. Junior Damian Saunders's outstanding play {{earned him a}} spot on the Atlantic 10 All-Conference First Team. He was also named the Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the Year. Earlier in the season, Jason Duty was nominated as a finalist for the Lowe's Senior CLASS award, an award which recognizes college seniors who demonstrate <b>exemplary</b> outstanding performance both on the court and in the classroom. Duty, who held a 3.72 GPA as an accounting major and had already accepted a job with PricewaterhouseCoopers, was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Academic Team.|$|E
5|$|For her <b>exemplary</b> {{service to}} the Marine Corps, Reckless was awarded two Purple Hearts (for the wounds {{received}} during the Battle of Vegas), a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a Presidential Unit Citation with bronze star, the National Defense Service Medal, a Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Korea Medal, a Navy Unit Commendation, and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. She would wear these awards on her horse blanket, plus a French Fourragere that the 5th Marines earned in World War I.|$|E
5|$|He led the Indian {{forces in}} Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. He {{was a member}} of the Army Sub Committee of the Forces Reconstitution Committee, which divided the British Indian Army into the Indian and Pakistani Armies after the Partition of India in 1947. After his {{retirement}} from the Indian Army in 1953, he served as the high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. As a token of gratitude for the <b>exemplary</b> service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India conferred the rank of field marshal on Cariappa in his 87th year, on 14 January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Ingres was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He often took months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are <b>exemplary</b> in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E
5|$|Machinima {{productions}} {{can remain}} {{close to their}} gaming roots and feature stunts or other portrayals of gameplay. Popular genres include dance videos, comedy, and drama. Alternatively, some filmmakers attempt to stretch {{the boundaries of the}} rendering engines or to mask the original 3-D context. The Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes <b>exemplary</b> productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Jagex, have sponsored contests involving it.|$|E
5|$|Ralph de Luffa (or Ralph Luffa (died 1123) was an English {{bishop of}} Chichester, from 1091 to 1123. He built {{extensively}} on his cathedral {{as well as}} being praised by contemporary writers as an <b>exemplary</b> bishop. He took little part in the Investiture Crisis which took place in England during his episcopate. Although at one point he refused to allow his diocese to be taxed by King Henry I of England, Luffa remained on good terms with the two kings of England he served.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{steady decline}} {{appears to have}} halted briefly during Dynasty XVIII (c. 1550– c. 1292 BCE), when Thinis enjoyed renewed prominence, based on its {{geographical}} connection to various oases of possible military importance. Certainly, the office of mayor of Thinis was occupied by several notable New Kingdom figures: Satepihu, {{who participated in the}} construction of an obelisk for Hatshepsut and was himself subject of an <b>exemplary</b> block statue; the herald Intef, an indispensable member of the royal household and the travelling-companion of Thutmose III; and Min, tutor to the prince Amenhotep III.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underwater}} flow is pillow lava, a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape. Less common are glassy, marginal sheet flows, indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks {{are common in}} shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption rates start to die down, and water erosion grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the seamount in alkalic flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some <b>exemplary</b> seamounts are Loihi Seamount, Bowie Seamount, Davidson Seamount, and Axial Seamount.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} {{was bought by}} the Ramada hotel chain in 1973, and was redecorated to cover the 1950s design, seen {{at the time as}} outdated. No longer in vogue, but centrally located, the hotel remained prominent for years, and hosted conferences, business meetings, and vacationers. Under Ramada management, however, the property began to show a lack of maintenance, and its popularity declined. It closed in 2001 and its demolition was considered when no purchase offers were received. Admirers of the hotel's <b>exemplary</b> architecture and its local history rallied to save it, and it was placed on the Scottsdale Historic Register.|$|E
5|$|The second {{individual}} to be conferred the rank was Kodandera M. Cariappa, the first Indian {{to serve as}} the commander–in–chief of the Indian Army. Unlike Manekshaw, who was conferred the rank just before his retirement, Cariappa was already retired in 1953, and since a field marshal never retires, therefore retired officers cannot be given the rank. But as a token of gratitude for the <b>exemplary</b> service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India overruled the pre-established criteria, and conferred the rank of field marshal on him on 28 April 1986 at a special investiture ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.|$|E
5|$|Were he to {{have died}} prior to AD23, {{he might have been}} hailed as an <b>exemplary</b> ruler. Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative characterization left by Roman historians, Tiberius left the imperial treasury with nearly 3 billion sesterces upon his death. Rather than embark on costly campaigns of conquest, he chose to strengthen the existing empire by building additional bases, using diplomacy as well as military threats, and generally refraining from getting drawn into petty squabbles between competing frontier tyrants.|$|E
5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an <b>exemplary</b> interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{long-term}} environmental programs and commitments, UCF was named an <b>exemplary</b> green {{institution in the}} 2010 Princeton Review's Guide to 286 Green Colleges, and the university has had its initiatives showcased by the U.S. Department of Energy. UCF has pledged to become climate-neutral under the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment by 2050 at the latest, and to increase its recycling rate to 75% by 2020, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 42% by 2030. Committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, all new construction must be designed and certified by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The UCF College of Medicine on the Health Sciences Campus is the only LEED Silver medical school in Florida.|$|E
5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as <b>exemplary.</b> The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.|$|E
5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an <b>exemplary</b> sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the <b>exemplary</b> function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E
5|$|In December, both Erich Hartmann and Gerhard Barkhorn, Graf’s best pilots, {{returned}} to active duty. Within a month, they both achieved their 300th victories. On New Year’s Day, the Luftwaffe's western command launched Operation Bodenplatte, against Allied air forces {{based in the}} Low Countries. It was an unsuccessful attempt to support the Battle of the Bulge offensive. For the failure, Göring fired Galland as General of the Fighters. In response, a meeting of senior Geschwadern commanders, in early January (including Graf), agreed to approach Göring and demand major changes. When confronted, Göring was furious and immediately demoted all the fighter leaders aside from Graf, who stayed as Kommodore of JG52 because of the unit’s <b>exemplary</b> war record. Göring told Graf he needed him against the imminent Soviet attack.|$|E
5|$|In his own 2003 thesis, Lieutenant Colonel Victor J. Bond {{said the}} 2nd Ranger Company's {{performance}} in Korea had been <b>exemplary,</b> {{in spite of}} racial discrimination against it. The troops, who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining the company, quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers. Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in Korea, noting the company did not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units {{to which they were}} attached were decorated. Bond also said many of the accomplishments of the company were attributed to white units, {{due in part to the}} command climate precipitated by Almond.|$|E
5|$|Kulesza {{left his}} job soon afterwards; {{according}} to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder {{some of the}} blame. Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing surprise at {{what they saw as}} excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from <b>exemplary,</b> but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.|$|E
5|$|She {{came from}} a close-knit family in Alabama, many of whom also moved to Texas when she married {{the man who was}} an {{accomplished}} politician in both Tennessee and Texas, and who had won the Battle of San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. The couple had eight children, and she gave birth to most of them while he was away attending to politics. Her mother Nancy Lea was a constant in their lives, helping with the children, managing the household help, and always providing either financial assistance or temporary housing. With the help of her extended family in Texas, Margaret convinced her husband to give up both alcohol and profane language. He believed his wife to be an <b>exemplary</b> woman of faith and, under her influence, converted to the Baptist denomination, after he had many years earlier been baptized a Catholic in Nacogdoches, Texas.|$|E
