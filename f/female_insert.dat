50|$|Lygus bugs {{are known}} for their {{destructive}} feeding habits - they puncture plant tissues with their piercing mouthparts, and feed by sucking sap. Both the physical injury and the plant's own reaction to the bugs' saliva cause damage to the plant. The <b>females</b> <b>insert</b> their eggs directly into the plant tissues using piercing ovipositors, and the newly emerged nymphs are voracious consumers of plant tissue juices. Signs that a plant has been attacked by lygus bugs include discoloration, deformation of shoots and stems, curling of leaves, and lesions on the plant tissues.|$|R

50|$|Cotesia urabae {{is a small}} (2.5-3.2 mm long) wasp, {{having a}} black body with {{yellow-brown}} legs, characterized by a solitary larval endoparasitoid stage (Austin and Allen, 1989). It {{is part of a}} large complex of 11 primary parasitoids of Uraba lugens Walker, many of which are polyphagous (Allen, 1990a, 1990b). The <b>female</b> <b>inserts</b> its ovipositor into the a U. lugens larva, depositing its eggs there, and it has been found that one female may carry up to 400 eggs (Allen, 1989). While C. urabae females are able to attack the same larva several times; only one single parasitoid completes its development in each larva (Berndt, 2010).|$|R
50|$|Damselflies are {{hemimetabolous}} {{insects that}} have no pupal stage in their development. The <b>female</b> <b>inserts</b> the eggs by means of her ovipositor into slits made in water plants or other underwater substrates and the larvae, known as naiads or nymphs, are almost all completely aquatic. Exceptions include the Hawaiian Mealagrion oahuense and an unidentified Megapodagrionid from New Caledonia, which are terrestrial in their early stages. The spreadwings lay eggs above the waterline {{late in the year}} and the eggs overwinter, often covered by snow. In spring they hatch out in the meltwater pools and the nymphs complete their development before these temporary pools dry up.|$|R
50|$|Nabis limbatus {{is found}} in tall grass and the {{herbaceous}} layer in moist to wet, half shady or open habitats.In forests they are found predominantly in glades, the edge of pathways and margins. Sometimes they are found in drier places. It is a predator with a non-specific range of prey and hunts {{on the ground as}} well as in the herb layer. Overwintering occurs as the egg. Nymphs are found from mid-May until July, adults from the end of June. <b>Females</b> <b>insert</b> their eggs mainly in August in blades of grass or the stems of herbaceous plants. The micropterous bugs go through four nymphal stages.|$|R
5000|$|The young nymphs of Himacerus major live {{predominantly}} on the ground. Older nymphs, and {{the adults}} may be encountered {{at night in}} higher parts of the vegetation such as, for example, shrubs. During the day they hide in ground litter or in grass or similar. If the species has a specific range of prey, is unknown. They have been observed in the sucking on Auchenorrhyncha. Overwintering occurs as the egg. The nymphs occur from May and {{can be observed in}} the Autumn. The adult bugs occur from July, rarely even from end of June and are active mainly in August and September. The <b>females</b> <b>insert</b> their eggs in grass.|$|R
50|$|The <b>female</b> <b>inserts</b> her saw-like {{ovipositor}} into plant {{tissues and}} lays her eggs under the epidermis. The eggs are white at first, turning orange later, and hatch in {{four to five}} days. The larvae are white or yellowish and suck sap from the plant tissues. Two larval stages lasting about nine days in total are followed by the non-feeding prepupal and pupal stages which last four to seven days in total. The adult survives {{for two or three}} weeks during which time the females lay about eighty eggs. Most of the eggs are unfertilised and produced by parthenogenesis. In Hawaii, only about one in a thousand individuals is male, and in this location, it breeds throughout the year. In cooler climates it overwinters in plant debris and becomes active again in spring.|$|R

50|$|Spawning occurs {{throughout}} the year but principally in spring and autumn. It is initiated by males performing various displays to attract potential females. During copulation, a male grasps the <b>female</b> and <b>inserts</b> the hectocotylus into the female's mantle cavity where fertilization usually occurs. Adult males usually then die shortly after spawning, whilst females survive {{for a short while}} until after brooding.|$|R
30|$|In Egypt, Tawfik et al. (1976) {{studied the}} biology of P. orobanchia {{and found that the}} <b>females</b> <b>insert</b> their eggs in the Orobanche flower. The total number of {{deposited}} eggs was 32.93 eggs per female. The durations of development for the three larval instars lasted about 1.1, 1.93, and 2.22  days, respectively. The total larval period lasted about 5.3  days. The larvae feed on the immature seeds inside the capsule. Pupation takes place either in the capsules or in the stem. For pupation in the fruit, the mature larva bores into the enclosed seeds and tissues leaving a rounded thin membranous area on the pericarp through which the adult will emerge. At the end of season, the mature larva bores inside toward the stem to enter diapause till the next season. The estimated lifecycle from egg deposition to first egg laid in the following generation lasted 18.9  days (17 – 20  days).|$|R
50|$|Females have a penis-like structure, {{called the}} gynosome {{that has a}} tube leading into their body to where their {{genitalia}} are located. Neotrogla males have a structure resembling that of a vagina. However, {{on the inside of}} their body, they have male genitalia. When the <b>female</b> <b>inserts</b> her organ into the male, the tip of the pseudo penis inflates. When this tip inflates, species specific ridges and spines flare up that match up with the walls of the male’s seminal duct. This serves two functions, to stimulate the male’s reproductive organs, and to keep the male and female locked together. After they have been locked together, {{the only way to get}} the two to part would be to rip off the abdomen of the male. During the lengthy, 40- to 70-hour copulation process, these male genitalia structures ejaculate inside of the male’s body. The sperm is then deposited into the female’s structure and then travels through a spermathecal duct to where it can fertilize the eggs.|$|R

40|$|The gypsy {{retrovirus}} invades {{the germ}} line of Drosophila <b>females,</b> <b>inserting</b> {{with a high}} frequency into the ovo locus. Gypsy insertion sites in ovo are clustered within a region in the promoter of the ovo gene that contains multiple binding sites for the OvoA and OvoB proteins. We found that a 1. 3 -kb DNA fragment containing this region is able to confer gypsy insertional specificity independent of its genomic location. The frequency of gypsy insertions into the ovo gene is significantly lower in wild-type females than in ovoD 1 females. In addition, gypsy insertions in ovoD 1 females occur during most stages of germ-line development whereas insertions in wild-type females occur only in late stages. This pattern of temporally specific insertions, {{as well as the}} higher frequency of insertion in ovoD 1 females, correlates with the presence of the OvoA or OvoD 1 proteins. The results suggest that gypsy insertional specificity might be determined by the binding of the OvoA repressor isoform to the promoter region of the gene...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Local mate {{competition}} (LMC) {{occurs when}} brothers compete {{with each other}} for mating opportunities, resulting in selection for a female-biased sex ratio within local groups. If multiple females oviposit in the same patch, their sons compete for mating opportunities with nonbrothers. Females, in the presence of other females, should thus produce relatively more sons. Sex ratio theory also predicts a more female-biased sex ratio when ovipositing females are genetically related, and sex-ratio responses to foundress size if it differentially affects fitness gains from sons versus daughters. The mating system of the parasitoid wasp Ooencyrtus kuvanae meets assumptions of LMC. <b>Females</b> <b>insert</b> a single egg into each accessible egg of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, host egg masses. Wasps complete development inside host eggs and emerge en masse, as sexually mature adults, resulting in intense competition among brothers. We tested the hypothesis that O. kuvanae exhibits LMC by manipulating the number of wasp foundresses on egg masses with identical numbers of eggs. As predicted by LMC theory, with increasing numbers of wasp foundresses on an egg mass, the proportions of emerging sons increased. In contrast, the presence of a sibling compared to a non-sibling femal...|$|R
5000|$|The {{life cycle}} of D. opalescens has four stages: eggs, {{hatchlings}} (called paralarvae), juveniles, and adults. Squid live for 6-9 months. Doryteuthis opalescens eggs are laid on sandy bottom substrates in 10-50 m depth, {{although there is a}} report of a shrimp trawler pulling up eggs from 400 fathoms (730 m). Females encapsulate hundreds of eggs in a sheath that is made of many layers of protein. Bacteria grow between the layers and may serve as an antibiotic for fungal infection. <b>Females</b> <b>insert</b> the egg capsules into the sand with a sticky substance that anchors them in place so that the ocean surge can ventilate them. The presence of eggs on the bottom of tanks stimulates females to lay more eggs. Groups of capsules are placed in masses that can extend into egg beds. Some egg beds can cover acres of the ocean floor. The eggs take 3-8 weeks to hatch with warmer water shortening the incubation time. Bat stars (Asterina miniatus) are the most prevalent predators of eggs. Fish do not eat them, although they will nip at eggs not covered by the capsule sheath. There is no brooding.|$|R
50|$|To locate host eggs, adult females use {{chemical}} and visual signals, such as egg shape and colour. After {{she finds a}} suitable egg, an experienced female will attempt {{to determine if the}} egg has previously been parasitized, using her ovipositor and antennal drumming (tapping on the egg surface). Females also use antennal drumming to determine the size and quality of the target egg, which determines the number of eggs the <b>female</b> will <b>insert.</b> A single <b>female</b> can parasitize one to ten host eggs a day.|$|R

40|$|The world’s {{only member}} of Hemiptera Auchenorrhyncha known to form true galls, the {{leafhopper}} Scenergates viridis (Vilbaste) (Cicadellidae), transforms leaves of camelthorn (Alhagi maurorum Medikus, Fabaceae) into pod-like chambers, up to 35 [*]mm long, inside which individual leafhoppers develop, mate, and lay eggs. At the study site 40 [*]km SE of Bukhara (Uzbekistan), two generations develop annually. First-instar nymphs cause young leaves to fold along the midrib. The subsequent development takes place inside the tightly closed growing gall, plugged at both ends {{with a mixture of}} leafhopper excrement, brochosomes, and crushed exuviae. These plugs act as mechanical barriers and sticky traps for intruders. The inner surface of the gall, lined with brochosomes and wax platelets, is hydrophobic. Adult males emerge from their galls and squeeze into female galls. Fertilized <b>females</b> <b>insert</b> an average of 146 eggs under the gall’s inner epidermis and remain inside, possibly protecting the brood, until they die.

50|$|In preusurpation V. austriaca individuals, Dufour’s gland {{contains}} clear oil material. It {{is part of}} {{the reproductive}} organs along with the ovaries and a poison gland. Distinctly enough, in new fall parasites, the Dufour’s gland was empty and flat and in older parasites, the gland had a little oil but flatten as well. Hypertrophy of the Dufour’s gland is known to occur but more evidence is needed. During and after the mauling period, female Vespula austriaca wasps will oviposit. This time period is brief. The <b>females</b> <b>insert</b> eggs in new cell combs. Workers act no differently during period of oviposition. However, one instance of a worker interrupting the oviposition of the parasite was recorded, which led to mauling of the worker by the parasite and the egg falling out of the designated cell. Eggs laid by Vespula austriaca females are not only found in cells but also found on the cell wall, exterior of the comb, between two cells, or along the caps. As mentioned before, the Vespula austriaca species do not produce any workers. Instead the queens lay eggs that eventually produce more queens and male adults. Normally in wasps, males move in swarms during mating season. A male Vespula austriaca male was seen hovering over a fig tree in Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|Before breeding, {{seahorses}} may {{court for}} several days. Scientists believe the courtship behavior synchronizes the animals' movements and reproductive states so the male can receive the eggs when the female {{is ready to}} deposit them. During this time, they may change color, swim side by side holding tails or grip the same strand of sea grass with their tails, and wheel around in unison in {{what is known as}} a [...] "predawn dance". They eventually engage in a [...] "true courtship dance" [...] lasting about 8 hours, during which the male pumps water through the egg pouch on his trunk which expands and opens to display its emptiness. When the female’s eggs reach maturity, she and her mate let go of any anchors and drift upward snout-to-snout, out of the seagrass, often spiraling as they rise. They interact for about 6 minutes, reminiscent of courtship. The female then swims away until the next morning, and the male returns to sucking up food through his snout. The <b>female</b> <b>inserts</b> her ovipositor into the male’s brood pouch and deposits dozens to thousands of eggs. As the female releases her eggs, her body slims while his swells. Both animals then sink back into the seagrass and she swims away.|$|R

40|$|The tachinid Celatoria compressa Wulp {{has been}} {{evaluated}} {{as a candidate}} biological control agent for the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, in Europe, where it is an invasive alien pest of maize. Special emphasis {{has been placed on}} understanding aspects of the parasitoid basic biology and on developing a rearing technique for a small-scale production of C. compressa puparia. The age of C. compressa adults was found to be the most crucial factor in achieving mating. Only newly emerged, 1 -h-old females, mated successfully with 2 - to 5 -day-old males, achieving a success rate of 74 %. After mating, a prelarviposition period of 4 days occurred. The 5 -day-old C. compressa <b>females</b> <b>inserted</b> their eggs containing fully-developed first instars directly into adults of D. v. virgifera. Total larval and pupal developmental time, including a pre-larviposition period of 4 days, was 29 days under quarantine laboratory conditions (25 °C daytime, 15 °C at night, L:D 14 : 10, 50 % ± 10 % r. h). Females of C. compressa were capable of producing on average 30 puparia throughout a female's mean larviposition period of 15 days. A large number of host attacks by C. compressa were unsuccessful, resulting in a mean larviposition success rate of 24 % per female. Parasitoid females appear to have difficulties inserting the egg through the intersegmental sutures or membranes around leg openings of the host adults.

5000|$|Along {{with his}} theory {{of the role of}} vital heat in {{nutrition}} and digestion, Aristotle believed that vital heat played a role in reproduction which includes several physical parts of the body different from the parts that participate in nutrition. Aristotle believed that blood was created through the process of digestion via vital heat and then pushed to the extremities of the body. However, blood is not in its final form but is transformed to a final substance to be used for the nourishment of the body. [...] "Aristotle holds that semen is nutriment in its final stage of concoction before it becomes part of the body. Hence, blood, before it turns into flesh, bones, etc., first turns into semen." [...] Although blood is not in its final form, it can still be used to nourish the body and create flesh and bone. [...] "Young males do not have semen because the conversion into flesh and bone must be done quickly owing to their rapid growth. And women do not have semen because they are not as hot as men and so lack the power of concocting blood into semen." [...] Blood in women is then naturally used to explain the menses. Therefore, when a male and female copulate and semen is emitted in the woman, the menses and the semen mix and begin a process that creates a new organism. [...] "That it is the heat of the semen that gives it the power to concoct the menses is shown, according to Aristotle by the fact that in some insects which do not produce semen the <b>female</b> <b>inserts</b> a part of her body into the male which then is acted upon by the heat of the male".|$|R
