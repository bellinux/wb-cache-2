40|$|Vietnam has {{improved}} its food security {{situation at the}} price of losing traditional varieties adapted to local tastes and conditions due to increased production and use of high-yield crop varieties (mainly large scale mono-cropping). Decreased diversity of foods is a growing issue, and the existence of malnutrition in regions where staple crop production and food availability are sufficient highlights the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to design interventions that target the four dimensions of food security - availability, access, stability and utilisation, of a diverse group of locally available nutritious foods. This paper demonstrates the use of the Four Cell Approach to participatory research to rapidly identify trends in a) species and food usage in a landscape and b) the dynamics of the food system which may contribute to, or be leveraged to improve, peoples' capabilities to be nutrition secure. In the case of Son La Province, Vietnam, explored in this paper, it is possible to conclude a positive relationship between increased production diversity and dietary diversity, and highlight the importance of markets for diffusion of diverse <b>foods.</b> <b>Diversification</b> of species production and consumption has a positive effect on resilience during the off-season, and diversification of coping mechanisms utilised by communities can build resilience for future shocks.

Various tools are now available to describe the biological diversity of plant species useful for <b>food</b> <b>diversification.</b> They allow fine analysis of basic components, but also their interactions, using different and complementary disciplines such as genetics, microbiology, biochemistry and physiology. The involvement of Plant biodiversity and <b>Food</b> <b>diversification</b> in one symposium is not a common process. However, the FAO data (2008) relevant {{to the state of}} the food worldwide are clear on at least two main points: I) there is a well defined relationship between quality of diet and dietary diversification; II) the most affected countries are India, countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific area of Asia and China as they have a high potential of biodiversity. If food is a vital necessity, the overall diet is different between rich and poor countries. In poor countries, cereals, roots and tubers cover 66 % of eaten plants. In rich countries, fruits and vegetables play a much larger role (19 % vs. 11 %). In rich countries, attention is increasingly paid to the nutritional quality and food intakes for a better life. In poor countries, it is foremost eat to survive. Nearly 900 million peoples suffering from hunger in the world but 90 % of them live in developing countries. India (231 MH) is at the head, followed by sub-Saharan Africa (212 MH), Asia - Pacific (189 MH) and China (123 MH). The rest of the world has barely 100 MH malnourished peoples. However, the Pacific area of Asia provided the world in many domesticated plant species (Citrus, numerous fruits and vegetables). Tools to describe biodiversity of plant species for <b>food</b> <b>diversification</b> have made many advances in recent years. New technologies allow deep and detailed analysis of the biodiversity and quality of the food supply. Several different and complementary disciplines such as genetics, microbiology, biochemistry and physiology are involved. Beyond the simple description step, it is to improve products or value-added varieties and also to maintain traditional pools of genetic diversity for tomorrow. We must also appeal to disciplines such as plant breeding or the wide range of plant biotechnologies to generate new diversity aspects and to preserve existing genetic resources. This requires of course a broad collaboration of local people, the best able to defend their specificities. In this context, 2010 Conference of Scientific Journeys of the BIOVEG network was organized around five main sessions: 1. Genetic resources, local domestication, plant breeding, cytogenetics. 2. Plants - micro-organisms interaction which include phytopathology, symbiotic relationship, toxins impacts. 3.

Utilizing a Community Capital Framework (Flora and Flora, 2013) and Governance of Complex Adaptive Systems (Duit and Galaz, 2008), this study concentrated {{on the role of}} cultural and political capital in supporting rural communities’ resilience to climate change. Specifically, this study inquires: 1) Does staple <b>food</b> <b>diversification</b> as traditional knowledge support community resilience to climate change?; 2) How does a government institution, i. e. via rice subsidy policy, facilitate the practice of staple <b>food</b> <b>diversification</b> as traditional knowledge?; 3) How does political capital play a role in facilitating community resilience to climate change?; and 4) What is the effect of social and human capital on political capital? Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from three rural communities in Java, Indonesia. Results indicate that cultural and political capital exhibit positive roles in mitigating rural communities’ resilience to climate change. However, there remains a lack of realization of climate change’s long-term effect and the need for adaptation action, even when communities have noticed changes in climate and the environment. Also, government institutions, in this case via rice subsidies, can go hand in hand with traditional knowledge on local staples to enhance communities’ resilience. Moreover, human capital, especially level of education, plays a substantial role in the exercise of political capital in rural communities. Low education level in the studied communities creates a reluctance to participate in policy discourse and a reliance on community leaders in policy-making processes, despite the ongoing decentralization policy that provides broader opportunities for rural communities to participate in development and policy-making...|$|E

While we theoretically predict a positive effect on crop diversification because of interrupted food supply chain, we also consider a negative effect due to the covariate shocks. We find robust and statistically significant empirical outcomes supporting such claims. The baseline outcomes withstand a series of robustness checks. The net effect of conflict on crop diversification is positive but not statistically significant.
