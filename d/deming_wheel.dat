40|$|National audienceID 6, {{a company}} {{specialized}} in decisional support systems (DSS), requested a development method for such systems. This method must achieve a fast development of reliable DSS according to user requirements {{in a context}} oriented reuse. None of the existing DSS-specific methods has become a standard. Moreover, they do not favor reuse of knowledge. In order to take advantages of our convention with I-D 6, we decided to define a method according to <b>Deming</b> <b>Wheel.</b> For the four iterations of our method definition, we use the Deming cycle. We present in this paper the process of our method definition according to <b>Deming</b> <b>Wheel...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIndustrial {{companies}} have to continuously improve their performance, which is {{defined in terms of}} numerous and multi-level criteria. According to the <b>Deming</b> <b>wheel</b> principle, decision-makers need to be provided with sound and pragmatic improvement methodologies, supplying operational tools for the objectives' definition, the action choice and the performance expression. Based on the generic PETRA methodology and using an established performance model that expresses overall performance by aggregating elementary ones, this article is a contribution to the decision-makers' information needs. By considering performance as a satisfaction degree of a given objective, we particularly focus, here, on the improvement of an overall performance, and thus on the choice of the right opportunity viewed as the best subset of relevant actions among the set of potential actions. Therefore the notion of action impact on the elementary performances is defined. Then the problem of the impact of a subset of actions on the elementary performances is posed and several ways are proposed to deal with it. Lastly the subset of actions impact on the overall performance is defined by a performance aggregation model. The proposed approach is applied to a case study submitted by an automation component manufacturer...|$|E

Cliff and Ron start with how the underpinning of Deming 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy was the idea of 2 ̆ 2 continuous improvement 2 ̆ 2, with the PDSA Cycle underlying that philosophy. They discuss the PDSA Cycle of never-ending improvement and learning, and how the iterative nature of the cycle fits with The Deming System of Profound Knowledge®. As Ron shares, Dr. Deming believed that 2 ̆ 2 business is more exacting than science 2 ̆ 2 as businesses must continually learn and improve to survive. Next Cliff and Ron delve into why they wrote a paper on the PDSA Cycle. Ron explains that the quality movement in America began after the NBC White Paper, If Japan Can [...] Why Can 2 ̆ 7 t We? aired in 1980. This raised interest in the Japan and the Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle, which originated there. Although Dr. Deming never spoke of PDCA, it was connected to him in the early 802 ̆ 7 s. That incorrect attribution was the inspiration behind the paper. Cliff and Ron discuss the evolution of the PDSA Cycle, starting hundreds of years ago with the theories of Galileo and Aristotle. Listen as they take you through the progression, from the Shewhart Cycle, through the <b>Deming</b> <b>Wheel</b> and ultimately the PDSA Cycle as we know it today. [URL]...|$|E
