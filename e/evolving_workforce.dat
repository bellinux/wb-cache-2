Labor quality growth was significantly higher in the early 1990 s than in the 1980 s. This strong increase was driven mainly by an increase in the share of those with tertiary education and workers in prime age. Growth in labor quality moderated again {{toward the end of the}} 1990 s, possibly reflecting the impact of robust employment growth resulting in the entry of workers with lower human capital. The contribution of labor quality to labor productivity has increased over time, accounting for up to one fourth of euro area labor productivity growth.

There {{are a number of}} drivers for this, including the changing demographics of patients and health professionals, changing working patterns and mobility of the health <b>workforce,</b> <b>evolving</b> models of care, emerging evidence base, altering funding models, and the need to underpin health care service delivery with safety, effectiveness, patient centeredness, efficiency, equity, and timeliness. It is in this time of change that role extension within health disciplines is seen as an important tool to meet some of these challenges. Role extension is viewed as a skills escalator, where practitioners move up the skills escalator within the scope of their discipline, to advance it and then, with training, extend it. Within allied health, in some disciplines, advanced and extended scope of practice initiatives have mushroomed. Often these initiatives have been ad hoc, and opportunistically created in response to local needs and requirements. As these initiatives are local and context-dependent, to date there is very little uniformity or congruency between these initiatives. This has led to variability in implementation, lack of rigorous evaluations and, ultimately, poor long-term sustainability. In this paper, we reflect on a number of key issues, drawing on our own experiences in undertaking such initiatives, which need {{to be taken into account}} when considering advanced and extended scope of practice for allied health.

This article synthesizes evidence regarding the status of female physicians in three purposively selected regions outside the United States: Japan, Scandinavia, and Russia and Eastern Europe. These three regions markedly differ in the proportion of female physicians in the workforce, overall status of the medical profession, cultural views of gender roles, and workforce policies. Through a review of studies and articles published between 1992 and 2012 examining women's representation, status measures such as salary and leadership positions, and experiences of female physicians, the authors discuss potential relationships between the representation of female physicians, their status in medicine, and the overall status of the profession. The findings suggest that even when women constitute a high proportion of the physician workforce, they may continue to be underrepresented in positions of leadership and prestige. <b>Evolving</b> <b>workforce</b> policies, environments, and cultural views of gender roles appear to play a critical role in mediating the relationship between women's participation in the medical profession and their ability to rise to positions of influence within it.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the history of Salter Bros Ltd and the firms connected with it. Founded in 1858, it became not only {{one of the most important}} businesses associated with the recent history of the Upper Thames, but also a significant employer in Oxford. The study takes a thematic approach, which involves examining the five main areas of the firm’s commercial activities, which were: providing services for the sport of rowing (chapter 1), boat-building (chapter 2), boat-letting (chapter 3), passenger boat operating (chapter 4) and property development (chapter 5). This thesis draws on the firm’s archive, which has previously been unavailable to scholars. The mainly quantitative data from the archive is contextualised by reference to wider qualitative sources, although there is not always much comparative information to draw on. Finally, it focuses on the evolution of the workforce, which shows how the business managed to survive both the impact of the industrialisation of Oxford in the twentieth century and some of the challenges associated with family firms (chapter 6). By examining the areas shown above, the work sheds light on our understanding of (1) the socio-economic context of Oxford and the Thames, (2) the development of different forms of water-based leisure, and (3) how a family firm overcame some of the classic weaknesses of such businesses. Chapter 1 analyses the contribution that the firm made to the sport of rowing. The family moved to a riverside tavern in the mid- 1830 s and this resulted in heavy involvement with the rowing scene. They made a successful transition from professional oarsmen to successful racing boat-builders, which led to John and Stephen Salter moving to Oxford to start their own business in 1858. By exploiting the strong local rowing scene they built their firm up to be the market leader in the 1860 s. Supplying craft for the Oxford and Cambridge (university) boat race was important for helping the business gain worldwide fame and, although Salters’ lost the ascendency in the 1870 s, it provided a wide range of services for the sport until the second half of the twentieth century. It then slowly became divorced from the rowing scene and, despite a brief renaissance in the 1970 s, the company finally bowed out of racing boat construction at the end of the 1980 s. Chapter 2 explores the development of the boat-building side of the business. The firm was a major producer of craft and it was especially busy in the late 1920 s and late 1970 s, when new products helped to stimulate demand. By examining four areas of expertise (steel manufacturing, motorised boats, corporation craft and fibreglass construction) it becomes clear that the business was relatively slow to embrace new technology. Yet although it was not particularly innovative, Salters’ successfully exploited a number of emerging markets, like supplying craft for council-run boating lakes from the 1920 s onwards. After a period of decline in the 1960 s, the firm’s boat-building department was briefly revived by the introduction of fibreglass construction in the following decade, although this brought to an end skilled craftsmanship in the industry. Salters’ had to be flexible in order to survive, as is shown by the contract work it took on during the two World Wars, but in the second half of the twentieth century the firm’s focus moved away from boat-building towards providing leisure services. Chapter 3 examines the nature and timing of the rise of pleasure boating on the Thames and Salters’ role in promoting it. The railway destroyed much of the carrying trade on the river, but the waterway gained a new lease of life by the rise of leisure activities on it. Different types of boating were popular at different times and certain waterside locations were busier than others, but it is possible to discern short-term peaks in pleasure boating on the Upper Thames, as a whole, in the early 1890 s and either side of the First World War (although the river became busier still after the Second World War). There were many factors contributing to the rise of leisure on the waterway, but Salters’ helped to popularise ‘the Thames trip’ between London and Oxford, which was linked to the growth of camping. The firm’s fortunes were also closely tied to the local market and by the late 1880 s it had one of the largest fleets of rental craft in the country. Salters’ had to diversify according to changing fashions in pleasure boating, but after the 1920 s there was a slow reduction in the number of craft it operated, until it stopped boat-letting altogether in the early 1990 s – although this side of the business was revived a decade later, albeit on a smaller scale. Chapter 4 explores the firm’s involvement with passenger services on the waterway. The long-distance steamboat trips took much longer to become established on the Upper Thames, because of the logistical problems caused by having to pass through locks. Salters’ was the first business to make a success of running between Oxford and Kingston and it did this by forging a close association with the railway, which opened up the river to the day-trip market, and by building up its fleet to establish a monopoly over the long-distance journey. The service had to overcome many challenges, but one of the most serious problems it faced was the growth in pleasure boating after the Second World War. Although passenger numbers on the steamers peaked in the 1970 s, general traffic on the river also reached record levels, which caused significant delays and forced the firm to end the through-service between Oxford and Kingston. Furthermore, by catering for the growing demand for shorter round trips Salters’ was drawn into direct competition with other companies that were already focused on this market. By the end of the twentieth century, the firm was no longer dominating the waterway and it was heavily reliant on income from both its home city of Oxford and private parties. Chapter 5 examines the extent and significance of the property the firm came to occupy. Salters’ acquired many new properties in order to expand the business and the firm’s success also enabled it to accumulate residential accommodation, which was part of the employment package offered to its staff, as well as being a source of rental income. The commercial sites were useful for preventing competitors from encroaching on the firm’s territory, whilst they were also subsequently used for further development. Most importantly, the property was a reservoir of capital that Salters’ relied upon in times of financial hardship. Chapter 6 focuses on how the <b>workforce</b> <b>evolved</b> in the twentieth century, which sheds light on how the business survived both the industrialisation of Oxford and some of the challenges associated with family firms. Salters’ went from being an employer with a highly skilled and local workforce to one that had fewer specialised craftsmen and which recruited mainly from outside the city. This was symptomatic of the city’s employment market that had been transformed by the motor industry in the interwar period, as well as the firm’s greater focus on its passenger boats, which was connected with it. Salters’ had to be flexible to accommodate the changes, but it was unable to compete with the high wages offered in the car factories and a shortage of local labour meant that it not only struggled to retain employees, particularly its skilled craftsmen, but standards of discipline also deteriorated. Nevertheless, the impact of wage competition was mitigated by the firm’s paternalism and the considerable appeal of working on the passenger boats. The latter offered an enjoyable lifestyle that was very different from the working environment of other waterway communities. The Salter family also played an important part in the survival of their company. Although the firm suffered from many of the classic weaknesses associated with such businesses, the way in which the ownership and management of the company developed in the second half of the twentieth century – which was both by chance and by design – was important for ensuring its longevity. The study shows that Salters’ achieved considerable success in the commercialisation of water-based leisure by expanding and diversifying its services. The firm went from being a leading racing boat-builder in the 1860 s to becoming one of the country’s most significant boat-letters by the late 1880 s. By the early twentieth century it was the major passenger boat operator on the Upper Thames, as well as being one of the foremost inland boat-builders. Its early commercial success enabled Salters’ to build up an asset-base (in the form of property) on which it relied in the second half of the twentieth century, when many areas of the business declined (although the company experienced a brief resurgence in the late 1970 s). There were many reasons for the downturn, but the problems were exacerbated by both the industrialisation of Oxford, which transformed the local employment market, and some of the weaknesses associated with family firms. Nevertheless, the company’s adaptability was of paramount importance and the firm ultimately shifted its emphasis away from the risky and volatile leisure market towards property development. Only the front matter for this thesis is currently available via ORA...|$|R
40|$|Introduction As {{concerns}} grow that a thinning {{labor force}} due to retirement {{will lead to}} worker shortages, it becomes critical to support positive employment outcomes of groups who have been underutilized, specifically older workers and workers with disabilities. Better understanding perceived age and disability discrimination and their intersection can help rehabilitation specialists and employers address challenges expected {{as a result of}} the <b>evolving</b> <b>workforce.</b> Methods Using U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Integrated Mission System data, we investigate the nature of employment discrimination charges that cite the Americans with Disabilities Act or Age Discrimination in Employment Act individually or jointly. We focus on trends in joint filings over time and across categories of age, types of disabilities, and alleged discriminatory behavior. Results We find that employment discrimination claims that originate from older or disabled workers are concentrated within a subset of issues that include reasonable accommodation, retaliation, and termination. Age-related disabilities are more frequently referenced in joint cases than in the overall pool of ADA filings, while the psychiatric disorders are less often referenced in joint cases. When examining charges made by those protected under both the ADA and ADEA, results from a logit model indicate that in comparison to charges filed under the ADA alone, jointly-filed ADA/ADEA charges are more likely to be filed by older individuals, by those who perceive discrimination in hiring and termination, and to originate from within the smallest firms. Conclusion In light of these findings, rehabilitation and workplace practices to maximize the hiring and retention of older workers and those with disabilities are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The broad aim of {{the project}} was to {{facilitate}} alignment of occupational health and safety (OHS) education with <b>evolving</b> <b>workforce</b> requirements. With a focus on education of the generalist OHS professional, the project was informed by current issues in OHS education, including (1) lack of an agreed core body of knowledge for OHS; (2) lack of clarity regarding the required level of education for an OHS professional; (3) appropriateness of current teaching strategies for equipping OHS professionals for operation in a changing business environment; (4) appropriateness of external modes of delivery of OHS programs; (5) availability of suitably qualified OHS educators; and (6) preparation of OHS professionals to be lifelong learners. The investigation strategy facilitated extensive consultation with professional, regulator, educator, registered training organisation and graduate stakeholders. Mapping the content and delivery of OHS education at Australian universities involved exploring the disciplinary underpinning of current programs, and eliciting stakeholder expectations of the learning outcomes and underpinning curriculums required for generalist OHS professional competency. Further insight resulted from identification of strengths, challenges and gaps in the delivery of OHS education as perceived by stakeholders. Three key requirements for delivery of OHS graduate outcomes were identified: (a) undergraduate tertiary education has to be recognised as the entry-level qualification for generalist OHS professionals; (b) OHS undergraduate education programs need a multidisciplinary base; and (c) a work-integrated learning model of education needs to underpin the curriculum design process. In an ALTC OHS educators' workshop, analysed data were presented to stakeholders, who were empowered to take ownership of project outcomes. Workshop participants established the Academy of OHS Education and Research, a significant project outcome with potential for massive positive impact on the future of OHS education in Australia...|$|E

This circumstance has left HEIs to grapple with the challenge of managing the consequences of talent void among faculty in areas of course/module allocation, project supervision and recruitment of new talents to fill the vacuum occasioned by brain drain. This loss of experienced academics remains a challenge to institutions of higher learning in particular and often culminates in disruptive academic service delivery. In a proactive approach to manage the fallouts of talent void in HEIs, this research proposes a talent management strategy based on application of Profile theory to manage talent positioning in a higher education institution in Nigeria in order to cope with <b>evolving</b> <b>workforce.</b> The research specifically had its focus on three scenarios; talent recruitment, project supervision, and course/module allocation. The research used a mixed method of inquiry involving five departments in a single institution in which two sets of data were collected. The first set of data collection involved survey using questionnaire and interview. While simple descriptive statistics was used in analysing the questionnaire, Soft System Methodology was used in interpreting and analysing the qualitative data in order to gain rich contextual understanding of the problem situation. The second set of data collection involved anonymous artefact representing candidates’ attributes used for modelling candidates profile for capability and compatibility. The profile theory based talent management strategy was developed and evaluated using Importance-Satisfaction analysis model. Specifically, profile theory modelled candidates’ characteristics/attributes for talent identification and made distinctive talent identification where ties occurred based on capability and compatibility This research contributes to body of knowledge in two ways. First, it demonstrates how Talent Management approach can mitigate the impact of brain drain and other forms of employee turnover in HEI. Second, it also explores and demonstrates how profile theory tool can be applied in filling talent void and allocation of duties as a strategy for talent positioning within academic roles in a HEI...|$|E
40|$|There {{were many}} paths from slavery to free {{labor in the}} Americas and the Caribbean. In some cases, freedom came with a thunderclap amid civil war and revolution. Elsewhere, governments sounded slavery's knell through a {{prescribed}} process of immediate or delayed emancipation. The people of northern Maryland experienced {{a different kind of}} emancipation in the decades preceding the Civil War. Final freedom came when Maryland adopted a new constitution in 1864, but slavery along the Mason-Dixon Line had been collapsing under the combined weight of slave flight, manumission, and the interstate slave trade since the 1820 s. This dissertation examines the dynamic, multifaceted relationships that developed among northern Maryland's labor regimes during the region's gradual transition from slavery to free labor. 	Having expanded into the Maryland piedmont during the flush decades of the Napoleonic Wars, slavery experienced a sharp decline in the lean years that followed the Panic of 1819. Faced with mounting slave resistance and stagnant demand for wheat, their primary staple, landowners struggled to forge a more efficient, economical workforce. Many espoused the emerging free labor critique and began to divorce themselves from slavery by liberating their bondspeople or selling them southward. Slavery did not, however, die a quick death. Many owners freed their slaves through delayed manumission agreements, which guaranteed that the institution would linger for several decades. During this extended emancipation, landowners and their free and enslaved workers fought pitched battles over the terms of emancipation and the contours of the emerging free labor regime. 	Unlike previous scholarship, which tends to examine the various segments of a given workforce in isolation, this dissertation considers the <b>evolving</b> <b>workforce</b> of northern Maryland as a single, unified whole. It examines how landowners cobbled together workforces from a diverse laboring population of apprentices, indentured servants, slaves, and wage laborers. The study also explores how [...] and why [...] the composition of the workforce changed over time, and how the region's myriad labor regimes jostled and merged. In tracing the evolution of northern Maryland's kaleidoscopic workforce, the dissertation considers how wage laborers and slaves navigated the treacherous shoals of the rural economy and how workers' gender, race, and status shaped their experiences...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The broad aim of Safeguarding Australians was to {{facilitate}} alignment of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) education with <b>evolving</b> <b>workforce</b> requirements. With {{a focus on}} education of the generalist OHS professional, the project was informed by current issues in OHS education, including: •	lack of an agreed core body of knowledge for OHS; •	lack of clarity regarding the required level of education for an OHS professional; •	appropriateness of current teaching strategies for equipping OHS professionals for operation in a changing business environment; •	appropriateness of external modes of delivery of OHS programs; •	availability of suitably qualified OHS educators; and •	preparation of OHS professionals to be lifelong learners. Literature relevant to education of the generalist OHS professional was reviewed with thematic attention on integrity of the profession, student learning and the OHS ‘academy. ’ The investigation strategy was geared to facilitating extensive consultation with OHS professional, regulator, educator, registered training organisation and graduate stakeholders. Action research methodology allowed a cyclic multi-phase process of data collection and analysis, with ongoing refinement of survey instruments. Various combinations of stakeholder groups were included in focus group discussions, surveys, telephone interviews and a workshop. Mapping the content and delivery of OHS education at Australian universities involved exploring the disciplinary underpinning of current programs, and eliciting stakeholder expectations of the learning outcomes and underpinning curricula required for generalist OHS professional competency. Further insight resulted from identification of strengths, challenges and gaps {{in the delivery of}} OHS education as perceived by stakeholders. Three key requirements for delivery of required OHS graduate outcomes were identified: 1) undergraduate tertiary education has to be recognised as the entry-level qualification for generalist OHS professionals; 2) OHS undergraduate education programs need a multidisciplinary base; and 3) a work-integrated learning model of education needs to underpin the curriculum design process. Assessment of the sustainability of the academy of OHS educators highlighted ominous negative influences. In an ALTC OHS Educators’ Workshop, analysed data were presented for discussion and validation by stakeholders. At this workshop, Wenger’s (1998) notion of a ‘community of practice’ provided a fruitful perspective for discussing how OHS educators might engage for their own professional development and to strengthen OHS professional education. Empowered to take ownership of project outcomes, workshop participants established the Academy of OHS Education and Research, a significant project outcome with potential for massive positive impact on the future of OHS education in Australia...|$|E
