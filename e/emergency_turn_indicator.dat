40|$|Introduction: This article {{describes}} one experiment that studied {{the influence of}} Daytime Running Lamps (DRL) on pedestrian detection of <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b> Method: An experimental device including one DRL and one <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> was used {{in order to determine}} Visual Reaction Times (VRT) of 148 observers in different situations involving <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> activation. Such situations were combinations of three main variables: color of DRL, separation between DRL and <b>Turn</b> <b>Indicator,</b> and observation angle. Results: Significant changes in VRT were found depending on the configurations above, especially the observation angle and the color of DRL. This second result demonstrates that amber DRLs inhibit the detection of <b>Turn</b> <b>Indicators.</b> Impact on industry: One of the main targets {{of this paper is to}} recommend that carmakers introduce only white DRLs on new vehicles. We also intend to advise regulatory bodies working on automotive regulation about the consequences of allowing amber DRLs and also about the danger of introducing constrains on the distance between DRL and <b>Turn</b> <b>Indicator</b> without further experimental evidences...|$|R
50|$|Instruments, {{either the}} <b>turn</b> and slip <b>indicator</b> or the <b>turn</b> coordinator, have the {{standard}} rate or half standard rate turn clearly marked. Slower aircraft {{are equipped with}} 2-minute <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> while faster aircraft are often equipped with 4-minute <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|IMO say's that {{a maximum}} allowed {{deviation}} from the real situation shown by the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is 0.5 degrees. The rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> has to keep this accuracy until a speed of 30 knots is reached.|$|R
50|$|In the US, {{trailer lights}} {{usually have a}} shared light for brake and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b> If such a trailer is to be {{connected}} to a car with separate lamps for <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> and brake a Trailer light converter is needed.|$|R
50|$|If a ship is {{equipped}} with an AIS system and a rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> then the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> must {{be connected to the}} AIS to send the rate of turn to other vessels. This makes it easier for other vessels to interpret the manoeuvre of the ship.|$|R
50|$|It {{has to be}} {{possible}} to test the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{gyroscopic}} instruments {{commonly used}} in instrument flying in the United States are the <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> the directional gyro, the gyromagnetic compass, the gyroscopic horizon, and the automatic pilot. These instruments are described. Performance data and the method of testing in the laboratory are given for the <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> the directional gyro, and the gyroscopic horizon. Apparatus for driving the instruments is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> {{have been}} {{integrated}} into the headlamp housing and the tail lamp cluster features a segmented stop and brake light section with the <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> built into a single unit that wraps around the brake lightâ€™s bottom side. Also LEDs have been used replacing the conventional bulbs. The split hand grips for the pillion rider serves in providing a different look.|$|R
50|$|A rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> has to {{be fully}} {{operational}} within four minutes after start-up.|$|R
50|$|The International Maritime Organisation has {{developed}} some requirements {{on the development}} of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Turn Signal Indicators.Not all {{motorcycles}} have <b>turn</b> signal <b>indicators,</b> or [...] "blinkers." [...] Off road cycles do not. Prior to the 1970s, most motorcycles, even roadsters, {{were not}} fitted with <b>turn</b> signal <b>indicators.</b> All road bikes are now factory fitted with <b>turn</b> signals <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Autumn/Fall of 1978 {{the larger}} {{headlights}} and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were also {{applied to the}} remaining Kadett Cs.|$|R

50|$|Bajaj {{introduced}} {{another version}} of Pulsar (UG III). New features included: pilot lamps separated from the main headlamp, <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> with clear lenses and amber bulb, self-cancelling <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> switch, flush LCD screen with digital read-out of key vehicle data, non-contact speed sensor, non-contact backlit switches, twin-stripe LED tail-light assembly and side panels altered for a sharp, tapering-towards-the-rear look. The engine had increased torque availability, reduced vibration and improved gear shift feel. cc variants.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Hillman Avenger Saloon: a two-door {{version was}} offered from 1973. The absence of {{wrap-around}} <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> {{on the front}} corners identifies this as a pre-facelift Avenger.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of {{the rate of the}} <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is based on a gyroscope with an availability of turning in just one direction. When the ship is steering a straight course, the gyroscope will point in a straight direction and the pointer will point to the zero on the display. When the vessel makes a turn to port, the gyroscope will turn to port side due to inertia and this will be pointed on the display of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator.</b> The same can be said for the starboard side.|$|R
5000|$|Options {{included}} themed special editions {{as well as}} 18-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, racing stripes, [...] "dragon" [...] and [...] "houndstooth" [...] graphics, and LED <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another <b>emergency</b> <b>turn</b> by {{the convoy}} brought {{two hours of}} suspenseful quiet while Orillia aided Tahchee and searched for {{survivors}} astern of the convoy. Then U-432 torpedoed the 3205-GRT Dutch freighter Winterswijk and the 1113-GRT Norwegian freighter Stargard. The freighter Regin stopped to rescue Starguards survivors and opened fire on a surfaced U-boat. [...] While Skeena and Kenogami searched for U-boats around stricken Winterswijk and Stargard, [...] torpedoed the 3252-GRT British freighter Sally Maersk, and the convoy made another <b>emergency</b> <b>turn</b> to avoid a surfaced U-boat. [...] torpedoed the 7465-GRT British CAM ship Empire Hudson {{less than two hours}} after Skeena regained station ahead of the convoy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> stalk or <b>turn</b> {{signal lever}} is the control lever which {{operates}} the <b>turn</b> signal or <b>indicator</b> {{lights on the}} front, sides and rear of the vehicle. It is usually operated by lifting or lowering the lever, the direction being commensurate with the clockwise or anticlockwise direction in which the steering wheel {{is about to be}} turned.|$|R
25|$|The Z8 used neon {{exterior}} lighting, {{the tail}} lights and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> are powered by neon tubes that offer quicker activation than standard lightbulbs {{and are expected}} to last {{for the life of the}} vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirements}} for the display of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> are that the zero {{has to be on}} top, the indicator has to go to the left when ship is turning to port side, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|After {{midnight on}} 15/16 October, SC 48 made an <b>emergency</b> <b>turn</b> to port, {{followed}} before dawn by a turn to starboard, {{in an attempt}} to shake off pursuit; this was initially successful, but the pack regained contact in the afternoon of 16th and again closed in.|$|R
5000|$|... 1978 brought slight {{cosmetic}} changes: the grille was black; the rear-facing hood vents {{replaced the}} sideways vents; and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were {{mounted in the}} bumper instead of in the grille. The CVCC engine was now rated at 60 hp (45 kW).|$|R
50|$|Daylight on 10 September brought several periscope {{sightings}} and <b>emergency</b> <b>turns</b> by {{the convoy}} before U-85 torpedoed the 4748-GRT British freighter Thistleglen. Skeena and Alberni counterattacked and damaged U-85 with depth charges. Thistleglen sank with 5200 tons of steel, 2400 tons of pig iron, and 3 of her crew.|$|R
50|$|Externally {{the car is}} {{very similar}} to the 1500 with {{differences}} including: amber or white (depending on market) front <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> shared with white parking lamps, separate stop/tail and turn lamps in the rear, and 1600 badging on the boot and the cowl.|$|R
50|$|The Savvy, {{along with}} other in house {{designed}} Protons such as the Gen-2, Persona, Satria Neo, Waja, Waja Chancellor, and second generation Saga, feature <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> switches placed at the left hand side, unlike models introduced earlier, such as the first generation Saga, Wira and Perdana.|$|R
50|$|The TVS calls {{their design}} {{approach}} for Flame as Deltaedge.

30|$|In <b>turn,</b> <b>indicators</b> of {{disability}} insurance generosity explain 75 % of the cross-national variation. We conclude {{that it is}} not health but the country-specific design of early retirement and labor market insitutions, and especially disability insurance rules, which explain the observed cross-country variation in the receipt {{of disability}} benefits.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a {{radio-controlled}} tractor {{was introduced}} in the all new radio controlled 'SIKU Control' line, which added play value in addition to the regular SIKU Farmer Series vehicles. These have working acceleration, steering, headlights and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b> Other models have since been added to the Control line.|$|R
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{gyroscopic}} {{instrument that}} {{works on the}} principle of precession. The gyro is mounted in a gimbal. The gyro's rotational axis is in-line with the lateral (pitch) axis of the aircraft, while the gimbal has limited freedom around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Convoy SG-19 {{soon came}} into the periscope sight of , which maneuvered astern to bring her tubes to bear. The U-boat torpedoed Dorchester astern at 0355.
