25|$|Patterson {{knocked out}} Johansson {{in the fifth}} round of their rematch on June 20, 1960, {{to become the first}} man in history to regain the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Johansson hit the canvas hard, {{seemingly}} out before he landed <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back. With glazed eyes, blood trickling from his mouth and his left foot quivering, he was counted out. Johansson lay unconscious for five minutes before he was helped onto a stool.|$|E
25|$|In 1971–72 Lloyd {{suffered}} {{a back injury}} while playing for a Rest of the World team at the Adelaide Oval. He was fielding in the covers when Ashley Mallett hit a lofted drive towards his area. He made an amazing effort to take the catch but it bounced {{out of his hands}} when he hit the ground awkwardly. When he went to get up, he felt a stabbing pain in his back and he was unable to move. He spent the next few weeks in an Adelaide hospital <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back.|$|E

25|$|The 5000 metres final {{was held}} {{on the final day}} of the Championships. In his second-best event, Vainio {{surprised}} the Finnish audience with a bronze medal. The tight race again culminated in the final metres with Eamonn Coghlan as the overwhelming champion. As in the 10,000 metres race, Werner Schildhauer took the silver, beating Vainio by 0.14 seconds. Vainio won his bronze medal in an extraordinary way; he flung himself in the last 5 metres and fell <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. As a result, he beat Dmitri Dmitriyev, who was fourth, by 0.04 seconds. Vainio considers this race to be the most sentimental event in his career.|$|E
25|$|He had a {{major role}} in the melodrama Another Time, Another Place (1958) as a British {{reporter}} named Mark Trevor, caught in a love affair opposite Lana Turner and Barry Sullivan. During filming, star Lana Turner's possessive gangster boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato, who was visiting from Los Angeles, believed she was having an affair with Connery. He stormed onto the set and pointed a gun at Connery, only to have Connery disarm him and knock him <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back. Stompanato was banned from the set. Connery later recounted that he had to lie low for a while after receiving threats from men linked to Stompanato's boss, Mickey Cohen.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{next day}} the {{administration}} threw in its big guns -- Secretary Acheson, Louis Johnson, and, from ECA, William Foster. This time the going was really rough from the Republican {{side of the table}} and Acheson consciously lost his temper over some of Wherry's remarks and got up and tried to slug him. Adrian Fisher, State Department Legal Adviser and a close friend of Acheson, caught his arm, fortunately, because Acheson would have missed Wherry by about three feet and probably fallen <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face on the floor. It was a great show." ...|$|E
50|$|Lee's {{most recent}} {{body of work}} is a blog {{concerning}} the advertising industry and responsibilities of its members. It is published on the professional networking site LinkedIn and although less satirical than his usual output has been generally well received. The first edition, named 'Chapter A', reached up to 11 likes. His second post however has been less popular so far, containing the word 'nipples' and describing how he stares into people's <b>flats</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> commute home.|$|R

500|$|For all of Dunglass's humour and patience, the {{following}} two years were a grave trial. He was encased in plaster and kept <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back for most of that period. Although buoyed up by the sensitive support {{of his wife and}} family, as he later confessed, [...] "I often felt that I would be better dead." [...] Towards the end of 1942 he was released from his plaster jacket and fitted with a spinal brace, and in early 1943 he was mobile {{for the first time since}} the operation. During his incapacity he read voraciously; among the works he studied were Das Kapital, and works by Engels and Lenin, biographies of nineteenth and twentieth century politicians, and novels by authors from Dostoyevsky to Koestler.|$|E
500|$|The labourers {{worked in}} 12-hour shifts of 3,000–4,000 men, with three 20-minute breaks during each shift. The work {{continued}} around the clock, {{seven days a}} week, under giant floodlights during the night. The living and working conditions were extremely harsh, especially for the political prisoners and the eastern Europeans, who were given especially punitive treatment due to their status as the most expendable members of the workforce. For the non-German workers, falling ill or being unable to work through injury {{was the equivalent of}} a death sentence, as they would either be left to die or be transported back to the concentration camps from which they had been brought. A German commission that inspected the labour camps in the area in late 1943 commented: [...] "The Eastern [...] worker is very tough. He works at his job until he falls <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face in the mire, and all that is left for the doctor to do is to issue the death certificate." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine Tan Mui Choo (...) was {{referred}} to Lim by a fellow bargirl, who claimed the spirit medium could cure ailments and depression. [...] Tan, at that time, was grieving {{the death of her}} grandmother to whom she had been devoted. [...] Furthermore, her estrangement from her parents weighed on her mind; having been sent away at the age of 13 to a vocational centre (a home mostly for juvenile delinquents), she felt unwanted by them. [...] Tan's visits to Lim became regular, and their relationship grew intimate. [...] In 1975 she moved into his <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> insistence. [...] To allay his wife's suspicions that he {{was having an affair with}} Tan, Lim swore an oath of denial before a picture of Jesus Christ. [...] However, she discovered the truth and moved out with their children a few days later, divorcing Lim in 1976. [...] Lim quit his Rediffusion job and became a full-time medium. [...] He enjoyed brisk business, at one point receiving S$6,0007,000 (US$2,8383,311) a month from a single client. [...] In June 1977, Lim and Tan registered their marriage.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the seventh}} round, he sent Cooper <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{back on the}} turf and jumped on top of him, winding Cooper so badly he could hardly rise. [...] He did rise for the next round, but in the eleventh, Donnelly {{finished}} him off with a tremendous right hand that smashed Cooper's jaw. [...] The sound of the cheering was likened {{to the sound of}} artillery going off. [...] The cheers could be heard in villages for miles around. [...] Donnelly was the conquering hero.|$|E
2500|$|An {{came into}} the Olympic Games ranked first and was largely {{expected}} to take the gold in Rio. He was hailed by Korean media {{as one of the}} two predicted golds from judo at the Rio. In Round 2 he faced Kazakhstan's Zhansay Smagulov. He won by waza-ari through seoi nage, and sealed the win awasete ippon with a juji-gatame. He continued his ippon streak in the third round with another waza-ari with seoi nage, and then landed his opponent from France, Kilian LeBlouch, with sode-tsurikomi-goshi <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back.|$|E
50|$|In 1922 Cardiff Football Club, later renamed Cardiff Rugby Football Club, and Cardiff Cricket Club amalgamated to {{form the}} Cardiff Athletic Club. Before that in 1878, the two Clubs had been granted the use of Cardiff Arms Park at a peppercorn rate, by the 3rd Marquess of Bute, who owned the site at the time. The two clubs wanted to {{preserve}} their grounds, and so the cricket and rugby clubs joined forces, and created Cardiff Athletic Club. The Athletic Club purchased the site from the 4th Marquess of Bute, apart from a strip of land adjoining Westgate Street, for GB£30,000 on the understanding that the site should be preserved for recreational purposes only. By 1935, the 4th Marquis of Bute built a new block of <b>flats</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> land adjoining Westgate Street.|$|R

2500|$|He was 5'11" [...] {{tall and}} wore a size 38 jacket and size 9C boots. At various times he weighed between 143 pounds (at {{the end of the}} 1869 Kansas campaign) to a muscular 170 pounds. A splendid horseman, [...] "Custer mounted was an inspiration.". He was quite fit, able to jump to a {{standing}} position from lying <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back. He was a [...] "power sleeper", able to get by on very short naps after falling asleep immediately on lying down. He [...] "had a habit of throwing himself prone on the grass for a few minutes' rest and resembled a human island, entirely surrounded by crowding, panting dogs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{rather than}} lifting the {{opponent}} or throwing him for grand amplitude {{in order to}} win the period as in the international styles, the collegiate wrestler most often seeks to take his opponent down to the mat and perform a [...] "breakdown" [...] (that is, to get his opponent in the defensive position <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach or side). With the opponent off of his base of support (that is, off of his hands and knees), the collegiate wrestler in the offensive position would then seek to run pinning combinations, or combinations of techniques designed to secure a fall. Failing to gain a fall could still result in an advantage in riding time and potential nearfall points.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1975, a group of {{traveling}} Finnish athletes (without Lasse Virén) took part in an NCAA Prep meet at Hayward Field in Eugene. After the event on Thursday, May 29, which included a 5,000-meter race that Prefontaine won, the Finnish and American athletes attended a party. [...] While returning from the party shortly after midnight, Prefontaine was driving on Skyline Boulevard, east of the University of Oregon campus near Hendricks Park. His orange 1973 MGB convertible swerved into a rock wall (...) and flipped, trapping Prefontaine underneath it. A nearby resident was {{first on the scene}} and reported he found Prefontaine <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, still alive but pinned beneath the wreck. By the time medics arrived, he was pronounced dead. It had been reported that his blood alcohol content was found by the Eugene Police Department to be 0.16.|$|E

Rock <b>On</b> Ruby recorded <b>his</b> first win <b>on</b> <b>his</b> next start at Taunton in February, beating Karasenir by three quarters of a length when ridden by his namesake, Ruby Walsh. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> only other start of the season he beat Karasenir again, this time carrying top weight of 163 pounds in a similar event at Newbury in March.|$|R

2500|$|There {{have been}} many {{outstanding}} bowling performances in Roses Matches, not least Jack Iddon's 9 for 42 for Lancashire in 1937 while the brilliant Yorkshire left arm spinner Johnny Wardle took 9 for 25 on a rain-affected pitch at Old Trafford in 1954. Fred Trueman made his debut in the 1949 game while his longtime England partner, Lancashire legend Brian Statham, made a big impact aged just 20 in his first Roses match in August 1950, when he shocked a packed Old Trafford crowd by falling <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face {{at the start of}} his opening spell. He picked himself up, dusted himself down and later that over ripped out Frank Lowson's middle stump. He soon dismissed Ted Lester and Willie Watson for 2 more ducks and Wisden said his bowling [...] "bordered on the sensational".|$|E
2500|$|On May 23, 1999, Hart fell to {{his death}} in Kansas City, Missouri during the Over the Edge {{pay-per-view}} event. Hart {{was in the process}} of being lowered via harness and grapple line into the ring from the rafters of Kemper Arena for a booked Intercontinental Championship match against The Godfather. In keeping with the Blazer's new [...] "buffoonish superhero" [...] character, he was to begin a dramatic entrance, being lowered to just above ring level, at which time he would act [...] "entangled", then release himself from the safety harness and fall <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face for comedic effect—this necessitated the use of a quick release mechanism. It was an elaboration on a Blue Blazer stunt done previously on the Sunday Night Heat before Survivor Series in 1998. While being lowered into the ring, Hart fell 78 feet (24 m), landing chest-first on the top rope (approximately a foot from the nearest turnbuckle), throwing him into the ring.|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Blanc {{revealed}} that during his recovery, his son Noel [...] "ghosted" [...] several Warner Bros. cartoons' voice tracks for him. Warner Bros. had also asked Stan Freberg {{to provide the}} voice for Bugs Bunny, but Freberg declined, {{out of respect for}} Blanc. At the time of the accident, Blanc was also serving as the voice of Barney Rubble in The Flintstones. His absence from the show was relatively brief; Daws Butler provided the voice of Barney for a few episodes, after which the show's producers set up recording equipment in Blanc's hospital room and later at his home to allow him to work from there. Some of the recordings were made while he was in full-body cast as he lay <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back with the other Flintstones co-stars gathered around him. He also returned to The Jack Benny Program to film the program's 1961 Christmas show, moving around by crutches and a wheelchair.|$|E
50|$|Bob has {{no direct}} {{evidence}} of any cheating until Gene realizes that an overhead camera in the Family Fracas studio may have recorded it.

60|$|He {{looked at}} Felix and scowled, an angry scowl of revenge. Then, {{as he turned}} and walked away, under cover of the great umbrella, with its {{dangling}} pendants on either side, the temple attendants clapped their hands in unison. Fire and Water marched slow and held the umbrella over him. As he disappeared in the distance, and the sound of his tom-toms grew dim on the hills, Toko, the Shadow, who had lain <b>flat,</b> trembling, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face in the hut while the god was speaking, came out and looked anxiously and fearfully after him.|$|R
