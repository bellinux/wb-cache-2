40|$|Paper and {{paperboard}} are {{the most}} widely used packaging materials in the world. The combination of corrugated medium (fluting) and linerboard can be varied to design a corrugated paperboard package in relation to specific mechanical properties of the paper and paperboard. Tensile tests were performed on five different paper <b>grammages</b> (175 g m- 2, 200 g m- 2, 225 g m- 2, 250 g m- 2, and 300 g m- 2) in the principal directions of the paperboard (machine direction, cross direction and thickness direction) at standard conditions (23 °C and 50 % relative humidity) and refrigerated transport conditions (0 °C and 90 % relative humidity). At the same environmental conditions, edgewise compression tests were performed on the corrugated paperboard. Results showed that the mechanical properties of paper and paperboard were affected by the environmental conditions. At the refrigerated transport conditions, the modulus of elasticity strongly decreased in the range of 20 – 53 % compared to standard conditions for all the paper <b>grammages.</b> The modulus of elasticity was observed to be higher in the machine direction (MD) than other directions for all the paper <b>grammages.</b> The buckling behaviour of the experimental edgewise compression test of the corrugated paperboard was compared with numerical results. The finite element model of the corrugated paperboard accurately predicted the experimental value of the incipient buckling load with an error of 0. 4 % and 5. 5 % at the standard and refrigerated conditions, respectively...|$|R

40|$|For {{this thesis}} project, {{a method to}} analyze the {{dewatering}} time for the drainage process during laboratory sheet making on a Finnish sheet former was developed. The resulting method proved to deliver very reliable information about the dewatering time and the transient speed of the sheet making process. The method was then used for two studies to find how fiber types, refining and/or slower dewatering conditions affects sheet properties, like formation and tensile strength. The first study compared the difference in formation and strength between softwood and hardwood fibers at three different drainage restrictions. The second study was performed to understand the effect of refining on dewatering time and the connection to resulting sheet properties. The results of both studies showed that at low <b>grammages,</b> the fiber web that was formed {{did not affect the}} dewatering time and speed regardless of the type of fibers or refining level. This meant that the drainage for low <b>grammages</b> sheets was solely controlled by the drainage restriction of the draining pipe on the sheet former. In addition, tensile strength and formation of the sheets did not vary significantly between the different dewatering speeds tested and the differences where more related to fiber properties than to the modified conditions of the dewatering of the sheet making process...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of paper formation is widely appreciated amongst papermakers {{in relation to}} sheet appearance, but much remains unclear about its role in paper strength, particularly for paper made from mechanical pulps. This paper addressed {{the question of how}} formation affects the tensile strength of such pulps. Two softwoods mechanical pulps from species of differing fibre length and coarseness were fractionated by fibre length and formed into handsheets at standard handsheet consistency and at a headbox consistency. As found by previous workers, handsheets from the shorter fibre fractions gave higher strength. These handsheets also had better formation, as expected from shorter fibres. To isolate the influence of formation from other factors which differ between species and fractions and may cause strength differences, we compared one fraction of one species at differing forming consistencies. This showed that the direct contribution of formation to tensile strength was significant, with poor formation giving lower strength for all fractions. In addition, we compared tensile strengths of whole pulps formed at standard handsheet consistency and headbox consistency at reduced <b>grammages</b> over the range 60 - 30 gsm...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of wide format inkjet printers made the technology available for large area commercials. Outdoor advertising uses {{a wide range}} of substrate including paperboard, vinyl, canvas, mesh; the material of the substrate itself has to endure the physical and chemical effects of local weather. Weather elements (humidity, wind, solar irradiation) degrade printed products inevitably; plastic products have better resistance against them, than paper based substrates. Service life of the printed product for outdoor application is a key parameter from the customer’s point of view. There are two ways to estimate expected lifetime: on site outdoor testing or laboratory testing. In both cases weathering parameters can be monitored, however laboratory testing devices may produce the desired environmental effects and thus accelerate the aging process. Our research objective was to evaluate the effects of artificial weathering on prints produced by inkjet technology on plastic substrates. We used a large format CMYK inkjet printer (Mutoh Rockhopper II, with Epson DX 4 print heads) to print our test chart on two similar substrates (PVC coated tarpaulins) with <b>grammages</b> 400 g/m 2 and 440 g/m 2.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies on suction box dewatering, three mechanisms were identified that determine the dry {{content of a}} web, viz. web compression, displacement of water by air and rewetting. In the present work, {{the relative importance of}} the three mechanisms was investigated through direct measurement of the web deformation, the dry content changes during and after the suction pulse, the air flow through the fibre network and the saturation of the web after the suction pulse. Suction pressure, suction time and rewetting time were varied. The experiments were done with chemical and mechanical pulp webs of various <b>grammages.</b> It was found that a large web deformation took place during the suction pulse, particularly at its beginning. Compression dewatering was found to be the most dominant dewatering mechanism. Displacement dewatering started after most of the web compression had occurred. Its contribution to the increase in dry content was most pronounced for higher suction pressures, longer suction times and for chemical pulp webs. A surprisingly large expansion of the web was observed immediately after the suction pulse. This expansion was the effect of rewetting. This rewetting strongly reduced the dry content of the web if the web had not been immediately separated from the forming fabric {{at the end of the}} suction pulse. Under the conditions studied, the decrease in dry content amounted to the order of 3 to 6 %. Rewetting was smaller for longer suction times and higher suction pressures. A considerable air flow through the web occurred under these conditions. This air flow apparently moved water from the forming fabric into the suction box, thus making less water available for rewetting. Rewetting for mechanical pulp webs was more pronounced and took place faster than for chemical pulps. The use of a membrane on top of the web during suction box dewatering proved to be advantageous for reducing the air flow through the web. However, under the conditions investigated, the dry content could not be improved. Although the web compression was increased when using a membrane, especially at a higher suction pressure, rewetting after the suction pulse had an even larger negative impact on the dry content, which, as a result, was lower.

Työ on jaettu kirjallisuusosaan ja kokeelliseen osaan. Kirjallisuusosassa esitellään nykyisin käytetyt aaltopahvin raaka-aineet, aaltoprofiilit ja aaltopahvin valmistusprosessi sekä raaka-aineiden ja valmiin aaltopahvin testausmenetelmät ja tärkeät ominaisuudet. Kokeellinen osa koostuu laboratoriokokeista, pilot-koeajoista ja aaltopahvin valmistuksesta. Kokeellisen osan laboratoriovaiheessa käytetty massa fraktioitiin lyhyeen ja pitkään fraktioon. Lyhyestä ja pitkästä fraktioista valmistettiin eri fraktio-osuuksilla yksi- ja kaksikerrosarkkeja. Laboratorioarkkien neliömassa-alue oli 70 - 125 g/m 2. Lisäksi muuttujana oli tiheys. Laboratoriomittausten perusteella parhaimmat rakenteet valittiin ajettavaksi pilot-mittakaavan koekartonkikoneella. Koekoneella valmistetuista yksi- ja kaksikerroskartongeista valmistettiin tehdasmittakaavassa F-aaltopahvia ja saadut rakenneyhdistelmät testattiin. Koetulosten perusteella voidaan sanoa, että mikroaaltolainerille on olemassa optimaalinen rakenne, joka riippuu painotettavasta ominaisuudesta.

The {{purpose of}} this master's thesis was {{to find out what}} kind of linerboards should be used in microflutes and which {{properties}} are required of them. This thesis consists of literary and experimental sections. The literary section deals with the raw materials, profiles and the manufacturing process of the corrugated board. The different testing methods and the important properties of these raw materials and the finished corrugated board are also introduced. The experimental section includes the presentation of laboratory tests, pilot test runs and manufacturing of the corrugated board. The stock used at the laboratory stage was fractioned into short and long fractions. Both these fractions were used to produce one- and two-layer sheets with different fraction proportions. The laboratory sheets had <b>grammages</b> between 70 - 125 g/m 2. In addition, density was examined as one variable. On the basis of the laboratory measurements, the best structures were chosen to be processed by Anjalankoski PM 3 pilot machine. The one- and two-layer boards manufactured by the pilot machine were converted into F-flute and the given structure combinations were then tested in the laboratory. The tests showed that there is an optimal structure of linerboard used for microflute corrugated boards. The optimal structure depends on properties to be emphazised. When targeting to the best surface properties the optimal structure of linerboard is not the best in terms of strength properties. Also, the strongest structure does not give the best surface properties. Optimal structure depends also on purpose of use i. e. whether the linerboard is aimed to be surface or back liner of the corrugated board...|$|R

40|$|The {{appearance}} {{and design of}} a package are key properties to attract and to focus {{the attention of a}} customer. Print quality contributes to a great degree to achieve these requirements. Most critical perceived in terms of quality are print defects like mottling, gloss and stripiness, which all appear in the printing of corrugated board. Stripiness is especially critical because it is a defect directly caused by the corrugated board construction. A further cause can be generated by the production process of corrugated board. Pre-studies by Odeberg Glasenapp (2004) revealed a difference in surface micro-roughness between the regions on the peak line of the liner and the regions in the valley between two peaks of the corrugation. This knowledge was the basis for the work described in this thesis. In a first stage, laboratory trials were conducted with sets of coated and uncoated samples of various <b>grammages.</b> The trial was set-up in order to simulate the conditions in the corrugator as closely as possible. In the evaluations, it was found out that the settings were too high. For that reason, the coated samples were influenced to a too high degree and needed to be excluded from further evaluations. With the uncoated samples, on the other hand, a change in micro surface roughness was detectable. The roughness is decreased on the peaks and the gloss appearance was the conclusion. The analysis of the printed samples focused on shifts in colour and print density. It is unclear if both are affected only surface roughness changes and/or by the typical corrugated board effect of washboarding. A full-scale test was performed in order to confirm the results of the laboratory test. A test series was chosen with coated and uncoated outer liners. Contrary to the lab-test results, the uncoated grades showed no surface roughness changes. Instead, the coated samples were affected to a great extent. The changes in surface roughness and gloss appearance were similar to the lab-test. This confirms that the lab-test samples were exposed to heat, pressure and shear to a too high degree. The print analysis of the full-scale test did not agree with the laboratory test. Gloss lines were visually detectable, but they were difficult to measure. A reason could be that the ink is capable on forming an ink film layer on top of the surface of the paper. This would cover the micro roughness of the matt parts thereby creating an almost homogeneous glossy appearance. QC 2010111...|$|R
