6000|$|Inside the shoe-store, the {{proprietor}} was excited. [...] "Why," [...] he exclaimed to his assistant, [...] "that must be Appleby, the pedestrian--fellow you read so much about--the Indianapolis paper said <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{that he was}} some place {{in this part of}} the country--you know, the fellow who's tramped all over Europe and Asia with his wife, and is bound for San Francisco now." [...] His one lone clerk, a youth with adenoids, gaped and grunted. It was incredible to him that any one should walk without having to.|$|E
6000|$|The Young Man: [...] "I {{returned}} rather suddenly. I <b>just</b> got in <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Our steamer was due yesterday, {{but there}} was so much ice in the harbor that we didn't work up till a few hours ago." ...|$|R

"Well, then, Miss Feemy, as {{your brother}} is here, and as your father isn't <b>just</b> himself <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I {{might as well}} do my {{business}} with him; but as it is of some importance, and as Mr. Flannelly wishes to have your father's answer as soon as possible, he will not object, I hope, to giving his opinion, when he shall have heard what I have to say." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Say--uh--if I {{may be so}} {{bold and}} just suggest it, we'd be honored if you and the madam could take dinner at our house and {{tell us about your}} trip. The wife and me was talking about it <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The wife said, guessed we'd have to pike out and do the same thing! Hee, hee! And Doc Schergan--fine bright man the doc, very able and cultured and educated--he's crazy to meet you. We were talking about you just this morning--read about your heading this way, in the Indianapolis paper. Say," [...] he leaned forward and whispered, after a look at his clerk which ought to have exterminated that unadventurous youth--"say, is it true what they say, that you're doing this on a ten-thousand-dollar bet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, look here, Mr. Appleby; if you {{are going}} to be around, couldn't you and the madam come to dinner, as I was so bold as to suggest awhile ago? That would give us a chance to discuss things. Aside from any future {{business}} dicker between you and me personally, I'd like to show you just why Lipsittsville is going to be a bigger town than Freiburg or Taormina or Hongkong or Bryan or any of the other towns in the county, let 'em say what they like! Or couldn't you come to supper to-night? Then we could let the ladies gossip, and I'll have Doc Schergan come in, and maybe him and me between us could persuade you to think of taking a partnership with me--wouldn't cost you a cent of capital, neither. Why, the doc was saying, <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> when we was speaking of having read about you in the paper--he was saying that you were the kind of man we need for president of our country club, instead of some dude like that sissified Buck Simpson. Buck is as punk an athlete as he is a shoeman, and, believe me, Mr. Appleby, we've got the makings of a fine country club. We expect to have a club-house and tennis-courts and golluf-links and all them things before long. We got a croquet-ground right now! And every Fourthajuly we all go for a picnic. Now can't the madam come? Make it supper this evening. But, say, I want to warn you that if we ever did talk business, I don't see how I could very well offer you more than a forty-per-cent. interest, in any case." ...|$|E
5000|$|Secretary of State Colin Powell {{spoke on}} Fox News Sunday, saying [...] "And {{as we saw}} in {{reporting}} <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> he is still trying to acquire, for example, some of the specialized aluminum tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you an enrichment capability." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Diplomatic {{world in}} Dresden is in great emotion; more {{especially}} <b>just</b> at present. <b>This</b> <b>morning,</b> before leaving, Friedrich {{had to do}} an exceedingly strict thing: secure the Originals of those Menzel Documents. Originals indispensable to him, for justifying his new procedures upon Saxony. So that there has been, at the Palace, a Scene <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> of a very high and dissonant nature,--"Marshal Keith" [...] in it, [...] "Marshal Keith making a second visit" [...] (say some loose and false Accounts);--the facts being strictly as follows.|$|R
60|$|Yet Matthew {{wished to}} keep her, of all unaccountable things! Marilla {{felt that he}} wanted it <b>just</b> as much <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> as he had the night before, {{and that he would}} go on wanting it. That was Matthew's way--take a whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent {{persistency}}--a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he had talked it out.|$|R
5000|$|Ian Fleming {{author of}} the James Bond novels, who {{attended}} Durnford before Eton together with his brother Peter. The school was next to the estate of the Bond family whose motto is The World Is Not Enough. The book [...] "For Your Eyes Only: Ian Fleming and James Bond" [...] by Ben Macintryre describes Durnford as a [...] "traditionally brutal prep school". He claims it [...] "epitomised the strange British faith in bad food, plenty of Latin and beatings from an early age". Macintyre quotes from a letter Fleming sent to his mother {{at the age of}} seven, saying: [...] "My coff (sic) has grown to a whoping (sic) coff now. Don't tell Mr Pellatt (the headmaster) cause <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> he said that nun (sic) of us had coffs.I am afraid that I do not like school very much." [...] Macintyre adds that the school, which closed in the Second World War made Ian no more ill nor miserable that anyone else. The head's wife read to the pupils from popular fiction including John Buchan adventures, The Prisoner of Zenda and Bulldog Drummond yarns. Durnford School's buildings became a ramshackle out-station of the Air Research Establishment's Telecommunications Research Establishment, devising Britain's radar systems from 1940-42. Some were demolished soon afterwards although Durnford House still stands.|$|E

Dear Friends, <b>Just</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I {{received}} a letter mailed June 8 th. It had traveled to four rather distant points before it finally caught up, {{but it was very}} welcome in any case. About two weeks ago a package of cookies also came my way after a trip nearly as long. I intended to notify you of my change in address, but before I had a chance to catch my breath from the last trip, I was on my way on another. You will find my latest address in the upper right hand corner; it may be old before you send the next item, but at least it will cut down the trip by three or four stops. Letters and packages mean a great deal to a man in the Army, which is a familiar remark by now, but nevertheless it is true. Candy and cigarettes are always available at the Post Exchange, but they mean more when they come through the mails as a gift. Thanks again for your kindnesses, and I hope you get half the fun from sending as I do on the other end. Very truly yours, Pfc. Robert N. Fowler 								[Transcription ends...|$|E

He saw every step which I took to draw my toils round him. Again and again he strove to break away, but I as often headed him off. I tell you, my friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest could be written, it would take its place as the most brilliant bit of thrust-and-parry work in the history of detection. Never have I risen to such a height, and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent. He cut deep, and yet I <b>just</b> undercut him. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> the last steps were taken, and three days only were wanted to complete the business. I was sitting in my room thinking the matter over, when the door opened and Professor Moriarty stood before me.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gaylord stooped {{forward and}} picked up the bit of wood which her husband had thrown down; her {{vigilance}} was rewarded by finding a thread on the oil-cloth near where it lay; she whipped this round her finger, and her husband continued: [...] "He'd better give up his paper and go into the law. He 's done well in the paper, and he's a smart writer; but editing a newspaper aint any work for a man. It's all well enough as long as he's single, but when he's got a wife to look after, he'd better get down to work. My business is in just such a shape now that I could hand it over to him in a lump; but come to wait a year or two longer, and this young man and that one 'll eat into it, and it won't be the same thing at all. I shall want Bartley to push right along, and get admitted at once. He can do it, fast enough. He's bright enough," [...] added the old man, with a certain grimness. [...] "M-well!" [...] he broke out, with a quick sigh, after a moment of musing; [...] "it hasn't happened at any very bad time. I was <b>just</b> thinking, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> that I should like to have my whole time, pretty soon, to look after my property. I sha'n't want Bartley to do that for me.
