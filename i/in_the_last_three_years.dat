25|$|Having won two Stanley Cup championships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> the Kings {{entered the}} 2014–15 {{season as the}} early {{favorites}} to retain their title.

A defeat to the Calgary Flames in the penultimate {{game of the season}} eliminated the Kings from playoff contention, while qualifying Calgary, which coincidentally missed the post-season during the Kings' five-season playoff streak. Despite finishing with a record of 40–27–15, the Kings became the first defending Stanley Cup champion to miss the post-season since the 2006–07 Carolina Hurricanes and only the fourth overall since the 1967 NHL expansion season.|$|E

25|$|Today, all {{funding for}} state {{highways}} and around 50% {{of funding for}} local roads comes directly from road users through the National Land Transport Fund.

In addition, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> the government has increasingly allocated additional funds to land transport, {{to the extent that}} today the total expenditure by the NZ Transport Agency on land transport projects exceeds road tax revenue collected.
