5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description {{differs from that of}} the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|He {{also studied}} other vessels from the period, {{such as the}} Le Soleil Royal, La Couronne, La Royale and Le Reale de France, to better {{understand}} 17th-century ship design. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of the Unicorn jolly boat. No ship named the Unicorn was listed {{in the annals of}} the French Navy, but Hergé instead took the name from a British frigate which had been active in the mid-18th century; the fictional ship's unicorn figurehead was also adopted from the frigate.|$|E

5|$|Matlock became {{interested}} in Russia as a Duke University undergraduate, and after studies at Columbia University and a stint as a Russian-language instructor at Dartmouth College, entered the Foreign Service in 1956. His 35-year career encompassed much of the Cold War period between the Soviet Union and the United States. His first assignment to Moscow was in 1961, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> embassy there that he experienced the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, helping to translate diplomatic messages between the leaders. The next year he was posted to West Africa, and he later served in East Africa, during the post-colonial period of superpower rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} Douglas {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, {{which is no}} longer in existence, for the garden of the Honourable MrsCholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2ndBaron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at Vale Royal Abbey in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of St John the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, as a memorial to his first wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E

25|$|Until 1918, the Irish Parliamentary Party {{who sought}} {{independent}} self-government for whole of Ireland through {{the principles of}} parliamentary constitutionalism, remained the dominant Irish party. But from the early 20th century, a radical fringe among Home Rulers became associated with militant republicanism, particularly Irish-American republicanism. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> former Irish Volunteer ranks that the Irish Republican Brotherhood organised an armed rebellion in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Since {{portions}} of northern New Spain {{became part of}} the United States' Southwest region, there has been considerable scholarship on the Spanish borderlands in the north. The motor of the Spanish colonial economy was the extraction of silver. In Bolivia, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> single rich mountain of Potosí; but in New Spain, there were two major mining sites, one in Zacatecas, the other in Guanajuato.|$|E
25|$|Parts {{of the old}} Saxon town wall were {{discovered}} in the early 70s when considerable archaeological excavation was carried out. The wall {{was found to be}} of earth faced with stone and probably had a wooden fighting top and palisade.

25|$|Still, the {{relationship}} between the ILP and the Labour Party was characterised by conflict. Many ILP members viewed the Labour Party as being too timid and moderate in their attempts at social reform, detached as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> socialist objective during its first years. Consequently, in 1912 came a split in which many ILP branches and a few leading figures, including Leonard Hall and Russell Smart, chose to amalgamate with the SDF of H. M. Hyndman in 1912 to found the British Socialist Party.|$|E
25|$|The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism, which regards it as {{the place}} where God's divine {{presence}} is manifested more {{than in any other}} place, and is the place Jews turn towards during prayer. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood, since according to Rabbinical law, some aspect of the divine presence is still present at the site. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Holy of Holies that the High Priest communicated directly with God.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Anglican {{established}} church, {{and particularly}} from the Orangemen, that the bitterest opposition to the union proceeded. The proposal found support among the Roman Catholic clergy and especially the bishops, while in no part of Ireland was it received with more favour than {{in the city of}} Cork. This attitude of the Catholics was caused by Pitt's encouragement of the expectation that Catholic emancipation, the commutation of tithes, and the endowment of the Catholic priesthood, would accompany or quickly follow the passing of the measure.|$|E

25|$|Yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance {{that modern}} Secular Humanism grew, with the {{development}} of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.|$|E
25|$|The {{designer}} Louis Masreliez– {{who became}} a trendsetter in the interior design of the period– was commissioned for the interiors. The pavilion {{was just one of}} many great plans and visions that Gustav III had for the Haga Park, many of which made it no further than the drawing board. Gustav III made use of the pavilion for a few years before his assassination. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pavilion that Gustav III left for the fateful masquerade ball at the Opera on 16 March 1792. After the assassination of Gustav III, Duke Charles used the pavilion as his temporary residence.|$|E
25|$|Although not as {{overwhelmingly}} supportive as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1930s {{through the}} early 1960s, a clear majority of the American public approves of labor unions. The Gallup organization has tracked public opinion of unions since 1936, when it found that 72 percent approved of unions. The overwhelming approval declined in the late 1960s, but - except for one poll in 2009 in which the unions received a favorable rating by only 48 percent of those interviewed, majorities have always supported labor unions. The latest poll in August 2016 gave labor unions a 56 percent approval rating, versus 36 percent who disapproved of unions.|$|E
