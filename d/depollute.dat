The use of sorption phenomenon, especially biosorption on dead residues of microorganisms produced by fermentation industries, can be an economical alternative method to <b>depollute</b> these effluents from heavy toxic metals. In this study we have investigated the adsorption capacity of Cr(III) present in the samples of effluents from a Algeria tannery, by the mycelial by-products of filamentous fungi as Rhizopus arrhizus. Efficiency of metal ion recovery from metalloaded biomass and subsequent regeneration of the biosorbent were also determined. The results show that, at pH 4. 8, the biomass was able to adsorb 60 mg/g biomass while precipitation effects augmented these values at higher pH ranges. Adjusting the pH value to about 0 resulted in 95 % and 90 % recovery of Cr by used H 2 SO 4 and HCl respectively. The biomass resulted from desorption processes was able to retain approximately 95 % of original adsorption capacity for Cr with sixteenth repeated adsorption and recovery runs. The rate of elimination of the chromium in the effluent of the tannery is about 83 % after the sixteenth cycle. The chromium recovered is reused in tannery for preparation of new tanning bath and the obtained results {{are similar to those}} obtained by the use of the conventional chromium...|$|E

The present study has the goal to analyse, under a historical retrospective and future perspective, the floating litter problem at Guanabara’s Bay. Therefore, the methodology for the historical analysis was done by a literature study. In turn, the present analysis was based on field data related to the floating litter on previous studies at the beaches of Icaraí, Charitas and São Francisco located at the city of Niterói, Flamengo beach on Rio de Janeiro and at the Mangrove of Barão de Mauá City’s Natural Park in Magé, respectively. Where samples were collected and current information about the actions related to the floating litter studied.

40|$|Herein, {{we report}} {{the first example}} of a supramolecular carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) -based magnetic <b>depolluting</b> agent for divalent metal ion (M 2 +) removal from aqueous solutions. In particular, magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (m-MWCNTs) coated with poly(vinylpyridine) (PVPy) self-aggregate in aqueous solutions that contain divalent metal ions (such as Zn 2 +, Cu 2 + and Pb 2 +) to form tight insoluble bundles in which the M 2 + ions remain trapped through pyridyl-M 2 +-pyridyl interactions. Magnetic filtration ultimately affords the efficient separation of the <b>depolluted</b> solution from the precipitated M 2 +-CNT agglomerates. Upon acid treatment, the supramolecular threads could be disassembled to afford the free CNT-polymer hybrid, thus allowing recycling of the <b>depolluting</b> agent. All materials and complexation/decomplexation steps were thoroughly characterised by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM, respectively). The quantification of the M 2 + residual concentrations in water was evaluated by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), which showed that, depending on the metal cation, this material can remove up to 99 % of the contaminant.

40|$|A {{model for}} a 1000 kW class solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system running on biogas from a sewage sludge {{digestion}} plant was implemented in a process flow scheme using external steam reforming. The model stack consisted of planar anode supported cells operated at 800 degreesC displaying state-of- the-art electrochemical performance (0. 15 W/cm(2) at 80 % fuel utilisation). Real annual data from an existing sewage plant were used as input to the model. From the input of 43 m(3) /h biogas (63 % CH 4), equivalent to 269 kW (higher heating value, HHV), the SOFC stack was calculated to deliver 131 kW,l electricity (48. 7 %) using a steam-to-carbon ratio of 0. 5. This would allow the sewage site to more than cover its own electrical needs, hence to <b>depollute</b> the waste stream at negative energy cost. In its current exploitation using a low efficient gas engine (130 M), the site is only approximate to 50 % self- sufficient. Special attention {{was given to the}} thermal balance of the stack. The stack developed heat (143 kW) could be balanced by endothermal reforming (78 kW) and by cathode excess air lambda (= 3), allowing a temperature difference between stack inlet and outlet of 200 K. The case was compared to other fuel scenarios. Steam-added biogas behaves basically identically to steam-reformed methane. For partial oxidation of biogas or pure hydrogen feeding, electrical efficiency drops to under 43 % while needs to be raised to 4. 5 to maintain the 200 K thermal gradient over the stack...|$|E
40|$|Les {{applications}} potentielles des cultures de microalgues et cyanobactéries en dépollution d'effluents dans des photobioréacteurs à membrane souffrent de performances limitées par un colmatage de l'élément filtrant dû en grande partie aux exopolysaccharides sécrétés par ces micro-organismes. Cette étude du laboratoire quantifie les effets de l'adsorption de ces polysaccharides sur des membranes organiques d'ultra et microfiltration tangentielle de matériaux et charges de surface différents. L'alginate de sodium est utilisé comme adsorbat modèle. Les membranes propres sont d'abord testées par une mesure de flux à l'eau pure, puis mises en contact avec une solution d'alginate durant un temps choisi. Le flux à l'eau pure des membranes après adsorption est ensuite à nouveau mesuré. La réduction relative du rayon de pore (ZEMAN, 1983) met en évidence l'effet de la mouillabilité et des charges superficielles. L'étude comparée de membranes d'ultra et microfiltration {{montre que}} cette réduction relative du rayon de pore augmente avec le seuil de coupure ou le diamètre de pore. L'effet de la concentration révèle aussi que la résistance hydraulique d'adsorption (MATTHIASSON, 1983) à l'équilibre évolue selon l'isotherme de LANGMUIR. Le modèle cinétique traduisant l'évolution de la résistance d'une membrane d'ultrafiltration proposé par BAKLOUTI et al. (1984), amélioré par AIMAR et al. (1988) puis discuté par RUIZ-BEVIÁ et al. (1997), est complété par un nouvel exposant agissant sur le facteur temps. La comparaison des résistances à l'écoulement de membranes de microfiltration avec celle d'une membrane d'ultrafiltration hydrophile neutre permet de dégager des critères de choix pour l'optimisation du fonctionnement d'un photobioréacteur à membrane utilisable en dépollution d'effluents. Potential applications of microalgae and cyanobacteria {{for treatment of}} wastewater effluents using membrane-photobioreactors suffer from limited performance due to fouling effects, mainly attributable to exocellular polysaccharides secreted by these micro-organisms. A membrane photobioreactor {{is defined as a}} process associating the culture of photosynthetic micro-organisms with a continuous separation by membrane filtration of the biomass and the water treated. The goal of the present laboratory-scale study was to quantify polysaccharide adsorption effects on organic membranes (ultra and microfiltration) characterised by different materials and surface charges. Sodium alginate was used as the "model adsorbate". Seven plane organic membranes were tested. The influence of membrane cut-off (or of pore diameters) {{as well as that of}} the material polyethersuphone (PES), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinilidene fluoride (PVDF) and of its properties (hydrophobicity, surface charges, …) were assessed. The study consisted of two parts : 1. the first part was concerned with the kinetics of alginate adsorption and the influence contact time and solute concentrations on the reduction of pore diameter (ZEMAN, 1983) or on the increase of hydraulic resistance (MATTHIASSON, 1983); 2. the second part dealt with adsorption equilibrium (formulations of LANGMUIR and FREUNDLICH). The study constituted the first step of a research program aimed at developing membrane photobioreactors for the treatment of specific industrial effluents. The fluid used to test the membranes was quality II pure water (ISO 3696 norm). Tangential velocities were set to 2. 5 m. s- 1, corresponding to a Reynolds number of 2500. To represent exopolysaccharides, we used alginic acid at concentrations of 1, 10 and 50 g, neutralised with sodium hydroxide at pH 9. New (or clean) membranes were first characterised through pure water flux measurements. J 0, the flux of pure water for a new membrane, was obtained (flowrate / unit of surface area), and then the membrane was kept in contact, for a definite duration, with the alginate solution. After adsorption and rinsing, the pure water flux was measured again. Ja, the pure water flux, was measured through the membrane after adsorption. Adsorption model at equilibrium:The effect of adsorption is quantified under the form of the relative pore size reduction as described by ZEMAN (1983) and included in the relation : ∆r / r= 1 - (Ja / Jo) 1 / 4. A variation of this quantification is that of the MATTHIASSON model (1983) applied to the pure water flux, based on DARCY's law expressing the relative value of the hydraulic resistance of the adsorbed layer Ra in relation to the intrinsic resistance of the membrane Rm : Ra / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1. To express adsorption phenomena at the solid/liquid interface of membranes, we used LANGMUIR's law together with MATTHIASSON's experimental observation (1983) : the relative resistance Ra / Rm due to adsorbed compounds is proportional to the mass "x" of solute adsorbed per unit of membrane surface area, x=Kx. Ra. If one assumes that the mass m of a homogeneous plane membrane per unit of membrane surface area is proportional to its adsorbing surface area Ω per unit of membrane surface area (m=Km. Ω), and if one combines the flux equations expressed by DARCY's and POISEUILLE's laws, then the result is m=K'm. Rm in a homogeneous membrane. Substituting x and m in LANGMUIR's law results in the equilibrium model Rae / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1 =a. c / (1 + bc) in which c=concentration of adsorbing solute; a and b are coefficients; and Rae is the resistance due to compounds adsorbed at equilibrium. Kinetic model: To show the evolution of membrane resistance with time, we suggest the introduction of an empirical exponent j over the time parameter in the AIMAR et al. model (1988). Results: The effect of changing the alginate concentration reveals that the hydraulic resistance of adsorption, at equilibrium, (MATTHIASSON, 1983) evolves according to LANGMUIR's isotherm. The relative decrease of pore radius ∆r / r in the presence of l g. l- 1 of sodium alginate shows that a quasi-plateau is obtained after two hours using the most hydrophobic membrane. The curves ∆r / r=f (t) for five membranes made of different materials, monitored during the transition phase before the plateau with common 1 g. l- 1 concentrations, reveal similar adsorption behaviour, characterised by the limiting common value ∆r / r= 0. 06 ± 0. 005. However, the uncharged hydrophilic membrane PAN 3038 stands out owing to a much lower ∆r / r value of 0. 09. This peculiar behaviour can also be observed in the influence of the alginate concentration: hydrophobic and charged hydrophilic membranes display a saturation effect with ∆r / r little affected by the increase of alginate concentration, whereas the uncharged hydrophilic membrane PAN 3038 displays a ∆r / r value three to six times lower with great sensitivity to concentration effects at concentrations below 10 g. l- 1. The model Rae / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1 =a. c / (1 + bc) is in agreement with the experimental results obtained with hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes. The proposed kinetic model shows that time dependence of R (t) does not seem to be linked to the nature of membranes. However, compared with concentration, R (c) is very sensitive to the nature of membranes. A comparative study of ultra and microfiltration membranes shows that the reduction in ∆r / r values increases with molecular weight cut-off (or pore diameter). Criteria for the choice of membranes: A comparative study of three polyacrylonitrile membranes reveals that membrane 3038 PAN (neutral) displays a very interesting, peculiar behaviour: its adsorption, expressed by ∆r / r or Rae/(Rae+Rm) is four to six times weaker than that of the other two. The surface charge of membranes seems to influence the intensity of adsorption in a significant way. Wetability also has a strong influence on adsorption. The sum of resistances Rae + Rm of ultrafiltration membrane 3038 PAN is only four times as great as those of hydrophobic microfiltration membranes. Experimentation already showed that, in the presence of microparticles, interactions between the layer of adsorbed alginate and microparticles will increase the likelihood of fouling of microfiltration membranes, decreasing their resistance down to the level of very little adsorbing ultrafiltration membrane IRIS 3038 (ROSSIGNOL et al., 1999). A culture system of marine microalgae in a membrane photobioreactor using ultrafiltration membrane IRIS 3038 PAN displayed a stable permeation flux during 6 weeks and easy regeneration, which meant adsorption was almost nil. The ability of some microalgae to assimilate ammonia nitrogen, nitrates and phosphates contained in waste water with excellent efficiencies (e. g., Phormidium bohneri: SYLVESTRE et al., 1996) allows one to consider using membrane photobioreactors in the treatment of home or industrial effluents.

Compression heat integration, bypass regenerative heater with improved heat exchange, preheating of the oxygen flow with the bypass flow surplus heat and reheat of the cold <b>depolluted</b> flue gas in a regenerative heater are implemented. Important reduction in exergy destruction is reported and the exergy efficiency of the integrated power plant increases from 36. 4 % to 39. 6 % (considering CO 2 as a product), which corresponds to an overall exergy destruction diminution of 16 %. The resulting net plant energy efficiency is 36. 1 %LHV, which is a 3. 5 %-pts increase compared to the base-case oxy-fired power plant, reducing the energy penalty down to 7. 9 %-pts when compared to the reference air-fired unit without CCS...|$|R
40|$|A {{presentation}} {{of this paper}} was given at the 16 th Conference on Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction, Rodes(Greece) 29 September- 2 October 2013 This article is available online at [URL] audienceWhile oxy-combustion CO 2 capture was foreseen to have higher improvement potential than post-combustion a decade ago, research has not been carried out at the same pace since then and today, the latter exhibits higher technological maturity along with low energy penalty thanks to advanced process integration and solvents formulation. Thus, significant efficiency improvement is needed for the oxy-combustion route to be competitive with post-combustion for carbon capture on coal-fired power plants. In order to achieve such improvements, process integration at system level is required to assess the true energy savings potential of oxy-combustion. In this study, an exergy-based methodology is performed to compare various flue gas recirculation strategies on a state-of-the-art 1100 MWe gross oxy-fired power plant. Exergy analysis at unit operation level allows the identification of the location and the magnitude of the thermodynamic irreversibilities occurring in the process, leading to an enhanced understanding of the studied system. In addition to the reference case in which the secondary recycle is fully <b>depolluted</b> and dehydrated; three alternative flue gas recirculation options have been investigated. Among the studied strategies, recirculation of the secondary flow prior the regenerative heat exchanger with a high temperature particle removal device leads to the highest net plant efficiency. This option not only allows the minimal exergy losses in the boiler but also minimizes the flowrate going through the downstream depollution devices. The net plant efficiency obtained for this architecture is 38. 0 %LHV, which represents a 3 % increase compared to the reference oxy-combustion plant. Comparing this figure to an air-fired power plant modeled with the same set of hypotheses, the energy penalty is 8. 1 %-pts...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEither used as nano-carriers in blood, <b>depolluting</b> {{agents in}} groundwaters or nanofertilizers in soils {{engineered}} nanoparticles (ENPs) {{are prone to}} a growing interest that explains their multiple uses {{as well as their}} increasing industrial production. The very small size of ENPs (having at least one space dimension < 100 nm) gives rise to some exceptional physicochemical properties that ensue from their high reactivity. In environmental and agricultural fields, where iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are particularly used, this reactivity is directly related to their adsorption capacity, which is of prime interest regarding soil contamination and soil recovery issues. Considering the peculiar role of copper (Cu) in soils, we investigated the specific relationships that exist between IONPs and Cu. Most particularly, this study aims at understanding how pH, Cu concentration and Fe 3 O 4 -NPs natural coatings drive Cu adsorption to IONPs. In a primary step, eight nm-sized Fe 3 O 4 -NPs were synthesized using a co-precipitation method and thoroughly characterized with TEM, XRD, FT-IR and BET while in a second stage Cu-adsorption tests were conducted through ultrafiltrations (< 2 kDa) and monitored with ICP-MS analyses. In these experiments, four types of IONPs were investigated regarding their mineralogy and the nature of their coating. They were tested with four copper concentrations (0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 5 mM) and five different pH values (3. 5; 5; 6; 7 and 8). According to the results, un-adsorbed Cu decrease with increasing pH values and about 100 % of Cu is adsorbed to IONPs at high pH values. Although the trend looks repeatable regardless NPs’ coating and Cu concentrations, each NP-type may have its typical pHpzc value and the amount of Cu adsorbed to IONPs is also likely {{to be related to the}} number of available adsorption sites...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{focused on}} {{nanomaterial}} (NM) engineering for occupational health and safety, {{in the frame}} of the EU project “Safe Nano Worker Exposure Scenarios (SANOWORK) ”. Following a safety by design approach, surface engineering (surface coating, purification process, colloidal force control, wet milling, film coating deposition and granulation) were proposed as risk remediation strategies (RRS) to decrease toxicity and emission potential of NMs within real processing lines. In the first case investigated, the PlasmaChem ZrO 2 manufacturing, the colloidal force control applied to the washing of synthesis rector, allowed to reduce ZrO 2 contamination in wastewater, performing an efficient recycling procedure of ZrO 2 recovered. Furthermore, ZrO 2 NM was investigated in the ceramic process owned by CNR-ISTEC and GEA-Niro; the spray drying and freeze drying techniques were employed decreasing NM emissivity, but maintaining a reactive surface in dried NM. Considering the handling operation of nanofibers (NFs) obtained through Elmarco electrospinning procedure, the film coating deposition was applied on polyamide non-woven to avoid free fiber release. For TiO 2 NF the wet milling was applied to reduce and homogenize the aspect ratio, leading to a significant mitigation of fiber toxicity. In the Colorobbia spray coating line, Ag and TiO 2 nanosols, employed to transfer respectively antibacterial or <b>depolluting</b> properties to different substrates, were investigated. Ag was subjected to surface coating and purification, decreasing NM toxicity. TiO 2 was modified by surface coating, spray drying and blending with colloidal SiO 2, improving its technological performance. In the extrusion of polymeric matrix charged with carbon nanotube (CNTs) owned by Leitat, the CNTs used as filler were granulated by spray drying and freeze spray drying techniques, allowing to reduce their exposure potential. Engineered NMs tested by biologists were further investigated in relevant biological conditions, to improve the knowledge of structure/toxicity mechanisms and obtain new insights for the design of safest NMs...|$|R

The photocatalytic activity is systematically monitored {{as a function of the}} chemical composition of the matrix at the molecular level, and thus the final structure of the material. The partial elimination of the organic groups brings by the organosilane precursors under UV exposure was followed by HPLC and by surface analysis (XPS, contact angle). The impact of the alkoxysilane structure on the final structure of the matrix is evaluated. In the same way, the impact of thermal and photonic pretreatments on the coating photocatalytic activity is evaluated using formic acid as model pollutant. Finally, the role of the remaining organic groups in the silica network on the structure modification and on the photocatalytic activity is investigated by varying their nature and ratio. <b>Depolluting</b> and self-cleaning activities of optimized coatings are studied by degrading formic acid and methylene blue in different conditions of pollutant concentration and photon flux. We interestingly show that in all cases, the presence of the organic groups in the matrix induces an increase in the photocatalytic efficiency. Finally, efficient photocatalytic flexible films are prepared and show promising photocatalytic degradation mechanism under low UV excitation, comparable to solar UV irradiation.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of photocatalytic decomposition of water on TiO 2 electrodes by Fujishima and Honda [1], heterogenous photocatalysis has been widely studied for environmental applications. Photocatalytic processes are new technologies for waste water treatment because new compounds (alkanes, pesticides, dyes, etc.) in effluents are not readily degraded by the conventional treatments [2]. Oxidative processes can completely destroy organic pollutants [3] or microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) [4, 5]. At this moment, the commercial Degussa P 25 is the mostly used photocatalyst. Nevertheless, it requires UV light to be activated, that is why scientists try to activate TiO 2 under visible light. The {{aim of this study}} is to synthesize photocatalysts activated by visible light and to evaluate their activity for the degradation of pollutants and microorganisms. The sol-gel process allows the direct introduction of visible light sensitive species like porphyrins inside the TiO 2 matrix during the synthesis [6]. Two tetracarboxyphenyl porphyrins are synthesized for the sensitization of TiO 2 to visible light : the metal free tetracarboxyphenyl porphyrin and the nickel tetracarboxyphenyl porphyrin. These porphyrins are characterized by 1 H NMR, FT-IR and UV/Vis spectroscopies. They are introduced during the sol-gel synthesis of TiO 2 matrix. Diffuse reflectance and FT-IR spectroscopies are used to ensure that porphyrins are incorporated inside the matrix of TiO 2. Indeed, characteristic porphyrins peaks appear on spectra. The cristallinity and specific surfaces of catalysts are also determined by XRD and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements respectively. The <b>depolluting</b> efficiency of photocatalysts is evaluated for the degradation in water of p-nitrophenol, which is listed as one of the 114 organic pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US. After 6 h under visible light, 40 % of p-nitrophenol are degraded with some catalysts. The activity is influenced by i) the presence of porphyrins : the photoactivity increases with the amount of porphyrins; ii) the nature of porphyrins : nickel porphyrins are more active than free metal porphyrins; and iii) the crystallinity of catalysts : amorphous catalysts are less active than crystallized samples. The photocatalysts with the highest degradation rating of dyes will be selected for the degradation in water of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. [1]	A. Fujishima, K.

40|$|National audienceThe work {{detailed}} {{in this document}} {{is the result of}} a collaborative effort of the LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse and MEAS-France / TE Connectivity during a period of three years. The goal here is to develop a methodology to design smart embedded sensors with the ability to estimate physical parameters based on multi-physical data fusion. This strategy tends to integrate sensors technologies, currently dedicated to lab measurements, in low powered embedded systems working in imperfects environments. After exploring model oriented methods, parameters estimations and Kalman filters, we detail various existing solutions upon which we can build a valid response to multi-physical data fusion problematics, for linear systems with the Kalman Filter, and for non-linear systems with the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter. Then, we will synthesize a filter for hybrid systems, having a linear evolution model and a non-linear measurement model. For example, using the best of the two worlds in order to obtain the best complexity/precision ratio. Once we selected the estimation method, we detail computing power and algorithm complexity problematics in order to find available optimizations we can use to assess the usability of our system in a low power environment. Then we present the developed methodology application to the UQS sensor, sold by TE Connectivity, study case. This sensor uses near infra-red spectroscopy to determine the urea concentration in a urea/water solution, in order to control the nitrogen-oxyde <b>depolluting</b> process in gasoline engines. After a design principles presentation, we detail the model we created in order to represent the system, to simulate its behavior and to combine the measurement data to extract the desired concentration. During this step, we focus on the obstacles of our model calibration and the deviation compensation, due toworking conditions or to components aging process. Based on this development, we finally designed the hybrid models addressing the nominal working cases and the model re-calibration during the working duration of the product. After this, we presented obtained results, on simulated data, and on real-world measured data. Finally, we enhanced the methodology based on tabulated “black box” models which are easier to calibrate and cheaper to process. In conclusion, we reapplied our methodology to a different motion capture sensor, to compile all possible solutions and limits. Fruit d’un travail collaboratif entre le LAAS-CNRS de Toulouse et l’entreprise MEAS-France / TE Connectivity, ces travaux ont consisté en la mise en place d’une méthodologie permettant la réalisation de capteurs embarqués intelligents utilisant la fusion de données multi-physique pour estimer un paramètre en amoindrissant l’impact des variations environnementales. Nous explorons ici les méthodes liées à la modélisation et l’estimation de paramètres au travers des filtres de Kalman, pour les systèmes linéaires, et des filtres de Kalman étendus (EKF) et Unscented Kalman Filter pour les systèmes non-linéaires. Nous proposons ensuite des méthodes hybrides permettant d’obtenir le meilleur rapport charge de calculs/précision pour les systèmes présentant une évolution linéaire et une mesure non-linéaire.

40|$|A {{research}} project was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} performance of a typical metal shredding process in terms of inputs versus outputs and to characterise the component materials of the automotive shredder residue (ASR) generated by the metal shredder. Research focused upon the identification of specific components of the ASR amenable to separation, recovery and recycling. A controlled experiment where 16 End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs) were shredded in isolation revealed the total metal recovered amounted to about 75 % (comprised of 72 % ferrous metal and 3 % nonferrous) of the combined weight of the ELVs. The remaining 25 % represented the ASR and was composed of three individual fractions based on particle size; ASR large size fraction (> 130 mm) 2 %, ASR medium size fraction (10 to 130 mm) 14 % and ASR fines fraction Ã‚Â«lomm) 9 %. The main type of materials identified in the ASR large size fraction were (in order of magnitude) tyre (33 % by mass), plastics (19 %), ferrous metal (16 %), foam (10 %), textiles (6 %), wire (5 %), rubber and elastomers (5 %), nonferrous metal (3 %). The materials identified in the ASR medium size fraction were plastics (32 %), foam (15 %), rubber and elastomers (12 %), metal and wire (9 %), textiles (7 %) and wood, paper and cardboard (7 %). The (A) SR fine fractions were too small in particle SIze to allow macroscopic identification of composite materials. Therefore, pyrolysis was used to characterise the material composition of the fine fractions in terms of organic and inert constituents. Pyrolysis experiments were conducted at a temperature of 650 Ã‚Â°C using both laboratory and bench scale reactors. The pyrolysis product yields averaged 52 - 58 % solid residue, 25 - 27 % liquids and 19 - 21 % gas. The pyrolysis solid and liquid products were characterised further using different analytical techniques. Structural analysis of the pyrolysis oil products were conducted using GC/MS, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The pyrolysis oils contained significant amounts of potentially useful alkanes, alkenes and aromatic compounds. The pyrolysis solid residues examined in this research were found to contain between 10 - 14 % ferrous metals and 2 - 5 % nonferrous metals. Elemental compositions of the resulting pyrolysis solid residues after ferromagnetic separation were determined using ICP-OES and XRF analysis. Subsequent tertiary recycling of the inert materials of the solid residues via the cement production process is restricted by maximum permissible limits of O. l%wt for lead, copper, chromium and nickel with zinc permissible at 0. 5 %wt (Origny & Obourg, 1998). Although efforts were made to reduce the levels of lead in the solid residues, by reducing the lead content of the shredder feed, the resulting lead concentrations continually exceeded the 0. 1 % limit. Accordingly, the inert materials of the pyrolysis solid residues have limited potential in terms of material reuse in this form. Additionally, treatment processes and deposition into the environment of such heavy metal containing materials will require due consideration with respect to the related potential health impacts. The original contribution to knowledge of this research lies in the processes and techniques used to determine the characteristics of the ASR and SR fines. This novel approach included determination of the distribution of selected analytes (particularly the heavy metals of copper, lead and zinc) throughout the individual particle size fractions of the inert materials of the ASR and SR fines. Comparison of the lead concentrations in the corresponding particle size fractions of the ASR and SR fines serves to indicate the contribution <b>depolluted</b> ELVs make to lead levels of general SR fines. The results of the research have increased our knowledge of the recycling potential of the constituent materials of the ASR and SR fines in terms of either energy or materials recovery.

40|$|Grassed and forested buffer zones {{can reduce}} {{pesticides}} tranfer by surface runoff from cropped areas to rivers at {{the scale of}} rural watersheds. Their effectiveness and their functioning as <b>depolluting</b> systems is due to several soil phenomena, of physical (infiltration), chemical (sorption) and biological (degradation) origins. The part of each phenomenon is however not quantified and may significatively {{vary according to the}} season and the site specificities At relatively short terms (years), some soil properties are modified by the change in land-use consecutively to the implantation of a buffer zone : a soil intensively cropped turning to permanent grassland or to forest. Some of these modifications will play a determinant role in the fate of the pesticides trapped within the filter strips. The increase of organic matter with a large input of non humified residues {{is one of the first}} modification occurring in the topsoil. This study aimed to quantify the role of organic matter changes on the sorption of two herbicides, lsoproturon and Diflufenican and Isopropylaniline, a potential metabolite of Isoproturon. A soil originating from the same site, but with three contrasted land-uses : grassland, forest and maize-wheat crop rotation has been considered. Several soil horizons were distinguished and for the top layers, soil size fractions were isolated by physical fractionation techniques in order to separate particulate organic matter (POM) from fine organomineral fractions < 50 µm. Coarse plant debris at the soil surface were also recovered and studied. On each soil layer and soil size fraction, we have characterized the sorption and desorption of the three molecules using 14 C labelling techniques. Sorption of the 3 compounds is significatively greater in the grassed and forested soils compared to the cropped soil. Isoproturon dissipates faster in the grasssed topsoil, compared to the forest soil due to more active degradation. In both soils, dissipation is explained by the formation of the metabolite isopropylaniline which was irreversibly sorbed. The coupling between isoproturon degradation and the formation of non extractable residues is particularly important in the grassed strip litter. The results obtained in forest and grass litter layer suggests that the amount and the nature of organic materials are two important factors in the regulation of these coupling. Significant differences in sorption coefficients Koc were observed between the surface horizons and suggested that the nature of organic matter was involved. Particulate organic matter showed high sorption capacities and may play an important role in the overall retention capacity of the surface soil layers. The informations obtained on the soil size separates by FT-IR and 13 C NMR and wettability measurements demonstrat that the aromaticity and the hydrophocity of POM were important regulating parameters of the sorption capacities. The specific area of the soil size fractions was also an important issue as well as the accessibility of sorption sites within the particles themselves. Comparing the sorption behaviour on the different soil size fractions to the behaviour in the whole soils, show that the accessibility of organic matter in the soil agregates may explain the differences observed under the three different soil use, and intefere with the influence of soil organic composition. L'objectif de ce travail est de comparer la rétention de deux herbicides, l'isoproturon et le diflufénicanil, et d'un métabilite de l'isoproturon l'isopropylaniline, pour trois occupations de sols contrastées: un sol cultivé, un sol souis bande enherbée et un sol forestier. Pour chaque sol, différentes fractions granulométriques ont été isolées. sur chaque sol et chaque fraction, la sorption et la desorption des trois molécules ont été caractérisées. La rétention des molécules est plus élevée dans les sols enherbés et boisés que dans les sols cultivés. Des différences significatives des coefficients Koc entre les horizons superficiels sous culture, parairies et forêt, suggèrent que le nature des matières organiques (MOS) est en cause dans les différences observées. Les matières organiques particulaires ont des capacités de rétention particulièrement élevées vis à vis des trois molécules étudiées. Les résultats montrent que l'aromaticité des MOS, leur caractère hydrophobe et leur surface spécifique sont les principaux paramètres régulant les capacités de sorption des pesticides étudiés...|$|R
