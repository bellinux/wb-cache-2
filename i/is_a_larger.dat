5|$|Beyond {{the core}} territory, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> feeding range which is {{variable}} in size, but typically ten {{or more times}} {{the area of the}} breeding territory. It is believed that the female has a larger feeding range than the male. After breeding has finished, this species abandons its territory, and may join small flocks including other warblers prior to migration.|$|E
5|$|Fiji {{has another}} Erythrura species, the rare and {{endangered}} pink-billed parrotfinch. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> bird {{with a green}} head, blue crown and black face, and a very large pink bill. The Fiji parrotfinch resembles the closely related royal and red-headed parrotfinches, and the rare blue-headed variant is very like the blue-faced parrotfinch, but these three species do not occur in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to paddle on much of Catawissa Creek for parts of the year. However, it is not usually possible to paddle on the creek during the summer. Upstream of Mainville, there are some riffles and small rapids. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> rapid downstream of a lowdam in the lower reaches of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Despite being off {{the menu}} in the United States for several years, {{the product was}} still sold in several other {{countries}} under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States. One such example sold by BK's European arm of the company <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL, based on the company's Whopper sandwich. The Big King XXL {{is part of a}} line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced.|$|E
5|$|The El Badi Palace flanks {{the eastern}} side of the Kasbah. It was built by Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur after his success against the Portuguese at the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578. The lavish palace, which took around a quarter of a century to build, was funded by {{compensation}} from the Portuguese and African gold and sugar cane revenue. This allowed Carrara marble to be brought from Italy and other materials to be shipped from France, Spain and India. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> version of the Alhambra's Court of the Lions. Although the palace is now a ruin with little left but the outer walls, the site has become the location of the annual Marrakech Folklore Festival and other events.|$|E

At the end of [...] "the rec", there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tennis club, with a club house and 5 tennis courts, 3 of which are under flood-lights.|$|R

5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> {{press corps}} in Brussels than Washington D.C.; in 2007 media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels correspondent. However, since the global {{downturn}} by 2010 {{the press corps}} in Brussels shrunk by a third. There is one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none for Lithuania. Although {{there has been a}} worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies. In the face of high-level criticism, the Commission is also due to shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} younger workers act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the older workers go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both younger and older workers. These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated social environment between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage less. A predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> foraging force. This means that the workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, which makes a colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E
5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta'sâ€”whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E

5|$|The edible Coprinellus bisporus {{is nearly}} {{identical}} but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black {{but do not}} dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinus atramentarius <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger,</b> gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus radians develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and {{is said to be}} almost indistinguishable from C.micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as C.truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C.micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C.truncorum, C.micaceus is browner {{in the center of the}} cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.|$|E
