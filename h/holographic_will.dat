5000|$|A person's last {{will and}} {{testament}} requires seven witnesses; {{in the modern}} world, fewer witnesses are required, and sometimes none at all, in the case of <b>holographic</b> <b>wills</b> (i.e., wills that are entirely handwritten by the testator).|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, unwitnessed <b>holographic</b> <b>wills</b> were valid in Scotland {{until the}} Requirements of Writing Scotland Act 1995 which {{abolished}} the provision; such wills written after 1 August 1995 are now invalid in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. <b>Holographic</b> <b>wills</b> {{need not be}} signed, when subscription to the writing appearing on the last page of such sheet is [...] "your loving mother," [...] or words to the effect which designates the family or personal relationship, {{if it is a}} material consideration, the signature is sufficient. This is most commonly found in documents written in emergency situations, or those prepared by individuals who have not consulted legal advice.|$|R

In both states any such will is void one year after that member's discharge from service “unless the testator … does not then possess testamentary capacity” under Maryland law (Md. Estates and Trusts Code Ann. § 4-103(b) (2013)) and for one year after the testator regains testamentary capacity under New York law (NY Est Pow & Trusts L § 3-2.2(d) (2012)).|$|R

50|$|Holographic wills {{are common}} {{and are often}} created in {{emergency}} situations, such as when the testator is alone, trapped, and near death. Jurisdictions that do not generally recognize unwitnessed holographic wills will accordingly grant exceptions {{to members of the}} armed services who are involved in armed conflicts and sailors at sea, though in both cases the validity of the <b>holographic</b> <b>will</b> expires at a certain time after it is drafted.|$|E
50|$|Some jurisdictions {{recognize}} a <b>holographic</b> <b>will,</b> made out {{entirely in the}} testator's own hand, or in some modern formulations, with material provisions in the testator's hand. The distinctive feature of a <b>holographic</b> <b>will</b> is less that it is handwritten by the testator and often that it need not be witnessed. In Louisiana this type of testament is called an Olographic or Mystic will. It must be entirely written, dated, and signed in the handwriting of the testator. Although the date may appear anywhere in the testament, the testator must sign the testament {{at the end of}} the testament. Any additions or corrections must also be entirely hand written to have effect. In England, the formalities of wills are relaxed for soldiers who express their wishes on active service; any such will is known as a serviceman's will. A minority of jurisdictions even recognize the validity of nuncupative wills (oral wills), particularly for military personnel or merchant sailors. However, there are often constraints on the disposition of property if such an oral will is used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rule for}} {{creating}} a minimally acceptable [...] "holographic" [...] will has been agreed upon: to be indisputably without edit or revision by an outsider (other than the author), absolutely no mechanically printed material must be contained in the document. It must not be typeset, typewritten, mechanically printed or scribed by any means other than by {{the hand of the}} original author. This rule does not, however, apply to non-material terms of the will. As a result, so-called [...] "form wills" [...] purchased at stationery stores can constitute legally valid <b>holographic</b> <b>wills</b> provided that their material terms are completed solely in the testator's handwriting.|$|R
5000|$|To be {{effective}} as a testamentary document, a [...] "holographic" [...] will must be signed by its author. Unlike a typewritten or word-processed [...] "formal" [...] will, where usually two disinterested witnesses are required to attest to the author's signing or [...] "execution" [...] of the document, a <b>holographic</b> <b>will</b> does not require any witnessing or notarization (an accepted form of witnessed certification of authenticity) {{in order to be}} a proper and valid testamentary instrument (document) having full legal force and effect.|$|E

His <b>holographic</b> <b>will</b> {{in favor}} of his brother in France (written in 1841 and devising {{property}} worth nearly $400,000) was unsuccessfully contested {{by the state of}} Louisiana. It held that the will was void as a legal and physical impossibility because of Martin's blindness, or as being an attempted fraud on the state. Under it the state would not receive the customary 10% estate tax if the property went to the heirs of Martin in France.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Holographic</b> <b>wills</b> often {{show that}} the {{requirements}} for making a valid will are minimal. The Guinness Book of World Records lists the shortest will {{in the world as}} [...] "Vše ženě" [...] (Czech, [...] "everything to wife"), written on the bedroom wall of a man who realized his imminent demise and made a swift attempt to distribute his chattels before expiring. It clearly meets the minimum requirements, being his own work and no one else's. On 8 June 1948 in Saskatchewan, Canada, a farmer named Cecil George Harris who had become trapped under his own tractor carved a will into the tractor's fender. It read, [...] "In case I die in this mess I leave all to the wife. Cecil Geo. Harris." [...] The fender was probated and stood as his will. The fender is currently on display at the law library of the University of Saskatchewan College of Law.|$|R
50|$|The trial finally {{begins and}} goes well. Jake builds his case, and Lettie's own {{testimony}} {{makes a good}} impression on the jury and Jake succeeds in discrediting the testimonies of Seth Hubbard's children and their assertion to have been close to their father and deeply caring during his illness. However, the opposing lawyer manages to spring a surprise witness, whose testimony seems to show that Lettie had tried to influence an earlier ailing employer to leave her money in a <b>holographic</b> <b>will,</b> creating a suspicion of her systematically preying on the weakness of old ailing people. Still another surprise witness, a former black female employee with whom Seth Hubbard had sexual relations comes forward, implying that Lettie had also slept with Hubbard.|$|E
50|$|A {{year after}} the War for Haven City, Jak, Daxter, Keira, Ashelin, and Torn were invited to Kras City to read the final will of the late ganglord Krew. There, they met Krew's {{daughter}} Rayn. Krew's <b>holographic</b> <b>will</b> described that the drinks they had just consumed as a toast were poisoned, {{and that the only}} way to win the antidote is to win the Kras City Grand Championship in the sport of combat racing. After several races, including death matches, lap races, and other types of events, Jak eventually won the entire race, to the frustration of the ganglords that ran the sport under ground. The group won the antidote and were saved, and Rayn was revealed to be partially behind it the whole time. Rayn escaped and the group returned to Haven.|$|E
5000|$|Jake {{receives}} a letter sent by Hubbard {{just before he}} kills himself, containing a new <b>holographic</b> <b>will</b> that renounces a will he filed the year before in which he leaves all his assets to his daughter and son {{as well as his}} grandchildren. In this new will, Hubbard stipulates that his children will receive nothing. Instead, five percent will be given to the local church and another five percent will be left to his long-disappeared brother, Ancil Hubbard. The remaining ninety percent is to be given to his black housekeeper Letitia [...] "Lettie" [...] Lang. Further instructions stipulate that the will must not be filed for probate until after Seth's funeral so that his children, who rarely visited him during his bout with cancer, can put on a show not knowing that they will ultimately be left with nothing.|$|E
50|$|A {{holograph}} is {{a document}} written {{entirely in the}} handwriting of the person whose signature it bears.
