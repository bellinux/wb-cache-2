One was the fear that creating a facility with too great a capacity to analyze the samples would discourage <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> to outside researchers and effectively exclude them. [...] In addition, space biologists and the United States Public Health Service expressed concern about [...] "back contamination" [...] of Earth by extraterrestrial microorganisms brought back via returning spacecraft, (although many of the astronauts and scientists involved in the program were skeptical that non-terrestrial microorganisms could survive lunar conditions). To address these issues, the committee in 1965 recommended a laboratory with limited analytical capacity and an ability to quarantine the returning astronauts and samples.|$|E
