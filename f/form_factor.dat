5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined <b>form</b> <b>factor.</b> The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible through the top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2016, {{during its}} E3 2016 press conference, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Xbox One S, {{a revision of}} the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined <b>form</b> <b>factor.</b> Its new casing is 40% smaller than the original design, and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The capacitive power and eject keys were replaced by physical buttons, the side USB port and controller sync button were moved {{to the front of}} the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather than sitting externally. Xbox One S requires a USB adapter to attach a Kinect sensor, as it no longer includes the proprietary port used on the original model. A free USB adapter was provided by Microsoft to Kinect owners who registered their ownership of Kinect and Xbox One S online, but this promotion ended in March 2017. Although Microsoft stated that it would eventually bundle the adapter with standalone Kinect units, it is instead sold separately.|$|E

40|$|The renormalised <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> for pseudoscalar meson-baryon {{coupling}} are computed in chiral colour dielectric model. This {{has been}} done by rearranging the Lippmann-Schwinger series for the meson baryon scattering matrix {{so that it can be}} expressed as a baryon pole term with renormalized <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> and baryon masses and the rest of the terms which arise from the crossed diagrams.

This integral equation is solved and renormalized meson baryon <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> and renormalized baryon masses are computed.

40|$|In the {{covariant}} light-front quark model, {{we investigate}} the <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> of B_c decays into D, D^*, D_s, D_s^*, η_c, J/ψ, B, B^*, B_s, B_s^* mesons. The <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> in the spacelike region q^ 2 < 0 are directly evaluated. To extrapolate the <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> {{to the full}} kinematic region, we fit the <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> by adopting a three-parameter form from the spacelike region. b→ u,d,s transition <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> at maximally recoiling point (q^ 2 = 0) are smaller than b→ c and c→ d,s transition <b>form</b> <b>factors,</b> while the b→ d,s,c <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> at zero recoiling point are close to each other. In the fitting procedure, we find the parameters for the <b>form</b> <b>factors</b> A_ 2 (B_c→ B^*) and A_ 2 (B_c→ B^*_s) strongly depend on the decay constants of B^* and B_s^* mesons. Fortunately, the semileptonic and nonleptonic B_c decays are not sensitive to these <b>form</b> <b>factors.</b> With the <b>form</b> <b>factors,</b> we also investigate the branching fractions, polarizations of the semileptonic B_c→ Mlν decays. Semileptonic B_c→ (η_c,J/ψ) lν and B_c→ (B_s,B_s^*) lν decays have much larger branching fractions than B_c→ (D,D^*,B,B^*) lν. In the three kinds of B_c→ Vlν decays, contributions from the longitudinal polarized vector is comparable with those from the transversely polarized vector. These predictions will be tested at the ongoing and forthcoming hadron colliders. Comment: 15 pages, 1 figure, uncertainties reanalyzed, several parts reorganized, conclusions unchange...|$|R
