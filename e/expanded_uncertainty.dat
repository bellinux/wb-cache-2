However, only limited power spectral density (PSD) data can be obtained at the stage of flight test.

At 0. 1 MPa, it has an average absolute deviation of 0. 03 %, a bias of 0. 01 %, and an <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (at the 95 % confidence level) of 0. 06 %. Over the whole range of pressures, the density correlation has an average absolute deviation of 0. 05 %, a bias of 0. 004 %, and an <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (at the 95 % confidence level) of 0. 18 %. In the case of the viscosity, two correlations are presented, one a function of density and temperature, based on the Assael-Dymond model, and the other a function of temperature and pressure, based on a modified Vogel-Fulcher- Tammann equation. The former is slightly superior to the latter at high temperatures (above 410 K), whereas the reverse is true at low temperatures, where the viscosity is strongly temperature dependent.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of benzene measurements {{obtained by the}} analysis of thermally desorbable Radiello diffusive samplers was evaluated according to the recent standard EN 14662 - 4 (2005). Considering the results of laboratory experiments, all the sources of uncertainty regarding the diffusive sampler method characteristics were accessed for the sampling times of 7 and 14 days. The {{major part of the}} uncertainty budget (> 79 %) was explained by the variation of the sampling rate due to the environmental factors (temperature and concentration level). For weekly sampling, the diffusive sampler method satisfies the data quality objectives of the European Directive to supply the indicative measurements as well as the reference measurement, since the <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is found lower than 25 %. Using a model-predicted sampling rate which depends on the concentration and temperature, the <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is significantly decreased. The Radiello sampler was found to give correct results for weekly sampling provided that the range of benzene concentrations remained between 0 and 10 µg. m- 3, which is generally observed in ambient air monitoring.
