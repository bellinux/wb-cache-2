5|$|They {{return to}} LaCroix, {{learning}} that the Sabbat tried {{to steal the}} sarcophagus to destroy it and prevent Gehenna, and kill the Sabbat leader to disperse his followers. The fledgling is met by Ming-Xiao, who offers to form an alliance. Ming-Xiao reveals that she has the key, and LaCroix killed <b>Grout</b> to prevent his powerful insight from unveiling LaCroix's plans; Ming-Xiao changed into Nines at the mansion to frame him. Denying Ming-Xiao's claims, LaCroix rescinds the blood hunt on Nines and entrusts the fledgling with recruiting the Anarchs to punish the Kuei-Jin for murdering <b>Grout.</b> The fledgling finds Nines hiding in the forest, and they are then attacked by a werewolf and Nines is badly injured. The fledgling escapes with Jack, who reveals that LaCroix has issued an execution order on the fledgling for framing Nines on orders from Ming-Xiao.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed <b>Grout</b> of Maryland. Mr. <b>Grout</b> arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret was that this was only part of the painting). It was revealed that King had been searching for it for some time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building.|$|E
30|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>grouting</b> methods: pre-grouting and post-grouting {{dependent}} on the <b>grouting</b> time relative to roadway driving; cement <b>grouting,</b> clay <b>grouting,</b> and chemical <b>grouting</b> according to <b>grouting</b> materials; single formula <b>grouting</b> and double formula <b>grouting</b> based on the <b>grouting</b> procedures; backfilling <b>grouting,</b> permeating <b>grouting,</b> squeezing <b>grouting,</b> splitting <b>grouting,</b> and high pressure jet <b>grouting</b> according to the geological conditions, the <b>grouting</b> spreading and permeating properties.|$|R

5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of <b>grout.</b> In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} {{the disappearance of the}} Malkavian chief, Alistair <b>Grout.</b> At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E

30|$|<b>Grouting</b> {{pressure}} {{is the driving}} force that causes slurry to diffuse into the rocks, and it obviously affects the <b>grouting</b> quality and performance. The selection of the <b>grouting</b> {{pressure is}} influenced by ground conditions, <b>grouting</b> materials, <b>grouting</b> procedure, and so on. If a very high <b>grouting</b> pressure is adopted, splitting <b>grouting</b> will take place resulting in the rib spalling or roof collapse. If the <b>grouting</b> pressure is too low, it is difficult to make the slurry diffuse into the rocks.|$|R
30|$|<b>Grouting</b> {{materials}} {{can be divided}} into three groups: cement <b>grouting</b> materials, chemical <b>grouting</b> materials, and compound <b>grouting</b> materials. The main performance indexes of <b>grouting</b> materials include slurry viscosity, mechanical properties, and permeability. In addition, flame-retardant and antistatic properties must be stressed for underground coal mines.|$|R
30|$|<b>Grouting</b> is an {{effective}} method to reinforce the broken rocks surrounding roadways. Many new <b>grouting</b> materials were developed. To overcome the faults of common cement <b>grouting</b> materials, ultrafine cement slurry was developed with good permeability, high cohesion and durability. Chemical <b>grouting</b> materials, such as polyester, urea–formaldehyde and polyurethane <b>grouts,</b> were also developed and widely used in underground coal mines. A new compound <b>grouting</b> material with polyurethane and silicate was also developed to improve <b>grouting</b> mechanical properties, and reduce costs.|$|R
5|$|Another {{effort to}} raise Monitors {{propeller}} was successful on 8 June 1998, although {{the amount of}} effort required {{to work in the}} difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers shored up the port side of the hull with bags of <b>grout,</b> installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Strong showings for Victoria earned Meckiff {{selection}} in Neil Harvey's XI for the one-off match against Ray Lindwall's XI {{at the start}} of January 1957. These annual fixtures were used as trials for the leading players vying for national selection. Lindwall's men batted first and made 428; Meckiff was the most successful bowler, taking 6/75 while his fellow-bowlers struggled to make inroads into the opposition batsmen. His first wicket was Test batsman Ken Mackay for 99, and he followed this by removing Bob Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Graeme Hole in the middle-order. Meckiff followed his productive bowling with 47 runs in a tail-wagging performance, adding 71 for the eighth wicket with Wally <b>Grout</b> as Harvey's men responded with 419. The Victorian took 0/18 in the second innings as Lindwall's team fell for 188 to leave Harvey's XI with a victory target of 198, which was achieved with seven wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{knee injury}} {{prevented}} Toshack from playing during the 1948–1949 Australian domestic season. The Australian team to tour South Africa in 1949–50 was named {{at the end}} of the previous season, and Toshack was omitted after a season on the sidelines. At the start of the 1949–50 season, when his Test teammates were sailing across the Indian Ocean to South Africa, Toshack made a strong start to his first-class comeback. He took 4/41 and 5/59 in a Shield match against Queensland in Brisbane, removing Ken Mackay and Wally <b>Grout</b> twice, helping to seal a close 15-run win. In the second match, against Western Australia, Toshack took 4/68 in the first innings before his injury resurfaced. New South Wales won the match despite Toshack's inability to bowl in the second innings. The injury cost Toshack dearly; it forced him to retire from first-class cricket and cost him a Test recall. Toshack had been offered a position on the South African tour as a reinforcement for Johnston, who had been involved in a car crash. Instead, Miller took the position and played in all five Tests.|$|E
30|$|<b>Grouting</b> time {{denotes the}} {{cumulative}} time needed for <b>grouting.</b> For rocks with fully developed fractures or pores, the <b>grouting</b> {{time should be}} controlled not too long to prevent the slurry leaking into roadways, while the <b>grouting</b> pressure and quantity should also be controlled. For rocks with less developed fractures, in which the slurry is taken in slowly and diffused hardly, {{it is necessary to}} extend the <b>grouting</b> time to improve <b>grouting</b> performance.|$|R
30|$|The {{geological}} {{and mining}} conditions, such as project purpose, rock type and structures, should be fully understood before <b>grouting</b> practices, as result of which then reasonable <b>grouting</b> materials, procedures and parameters can be determined. <b>Grouting</b> parameters include <b>grouting</b> time, pressure, volume, spreading radius, and borehole pattern, {{and all these}} parameters affect the <b>grouting</b> performance to some extent.|$|R
40|$|Development in <b>grouting</b> {{technique}} and its material causes an increasingly demand of its using in geotechnical constructions. To evaluate the <b>grouting</b> effect, a laboratory or field test towards {{the physical and}} mechanical properties of <b>grouted</b> soil and rock is needed. One of methods for evaluate <b>grouting</b> distribution is geoelectric or resistivity sounding method. This study is purposed to identify the subsurface resistivity change of study area before and after <b>grouting</b> using resistivity data from resistivity sounding method. Evaluation towards <b>grouting</b> effect can be determined by comparing the resistivity value change before and after <b>grouting.</b> <b>Grouting</b> effect and its distribution in soil and rock is analysed using isoresistivity map before and after <b>grouting.</b> Methods {{used in this study}} are survey and descriptive method supported by literature references for determine geological and geotechnical characteristics of study area. Geoelectric measurement uses Schlumberger’s configuration array. Resistivity data before and after <b>grouting</b> is used to interpret subsurface section along the study area. Based on this data, the resistivity value change before and after <b>grouting</b> can be analysed. Isoresistivity map is needed to determine the <b>grouting</b> distribution at various definite depths. Type of soil is mould soil which is loose, not compacted, and has uneven density along this area. Otherwise, tuffaceous sand and tuff characterized with cracks and joints. <b>Grouting</b> is needed to fix these weaknesses. Data analysis shows there is a relatively decrease in resistivity value after <b>grouting,</b> which is mould soil has average value 27. 43 ohm meter before <b>grouting,</b> decrease to 23. 66 ohm meter after grouting; tuffaceous sandstone decrease from average value 22. 15 ohm meter to 17. 13 ohm meter; tuff decrease from average value 11. 70 to 8. 36 ohm meter. Depth of <b>grouting</b> distribution can reach 7 meter depth, which is minimum 1 meter vertically from injection depth. Lateral distribution of <b>grouting</b> material can covers all of this <b>grouted</b> area with 3 meters spacing. Medium of <b>grouting</b> distribution is pore spaces in mould soil, otherwise cracks and pore spaces in tuffaceous sandstone and tuff...|$|R
25|$|The process {{consists}} of pumping a cementitous <b>grout</b> or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The <b>grout</b> can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base. The <b>grout</b> also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, <b>grout</b> injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grout</b> then toured India and Pakistan {{over the}} 1959-60 summer, and captain Richie Benaud insisted Jarman play two tests as almost all {{games on the}} tour were Test matches. Upon return, much of the team were struck down with hepatitis, and the {{exhausted}} <b>Grout</b> and Ray Lindwall {{were the only two}} test players able to play for Queensland in a match against Western Australia, but during the match <b>Grout</b> picked up eight wickets in a single innings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grout</b> {{played in}} 51 Test matches between 1957 and 1966. He made his Test debut against South Africa at Wanderers Stadium, {{during which he}} caught a record six wickets behind the stumps in the second innings. Australia never lost a series in which <b>Grout</b> played.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{hydraulic}} cement <b>grouts</b> are approved for Iowa Department of Transportation projects {{on the basis}} of a pullout test. However, other properties of the <b>grouts</b> should be evaluated. Therefore, this research was initiated to develop criteria to better evaluate {{hydraulic cement}} <b>grouts.</b> Fourteen <b>grouts</b> were tested for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency and shrinkage. Tested <b>grouts</b> all yielded compressive strengths higher than 3000 psi at 7 days and durability factors were well above 70. Time of set and consistency was adequate. The testing showed most <b>grouts</b> tested shrank, even though tested <b>grouts</b> were labeled non-shrink <b>grouts.</b> For many applications of <b>grouts</b> such as setting in anchor bolts and as a filler, minor shrinkage is not a problem. However, for some critical applications, shrinkage cannot be tolerated. The proposed Instructional Memorandum will identify those <b>grouts</b> which do not excessively shrink or expand in the tests used. Based on test results, criteria for evaluation of hydraulic cement <b>grouts</b> have been recommended. Evaluation consists of tests for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency, shrinkage and pullout test...|$|R

30|$|Choosing <b>grouting</b> {{pressure}} is mainly dependent on rock permeability, <b>grouting</b> scope in need, and slurry properties. For cement slurry, if rocks are seriously broken, 0.5 – 1  MPa {{is the proper}} <b>grouting</b> pressure; if rock are moderately broken, 1 – 2  MPa is the proper <b>grouting</b> pressure; and if rocks are less broken, 2 – 5  MPa is the proper <b>grouting</b> pressure. For the rocks with very low strength, the <b>grouting</b> pressure should not exceed {{one third of the}} rock compressive strength.|$|R

40|$|Mud {{and water}} often gush {{suddenly}} during the construction process of deep buried karst tunnels, which may cause serious accidents {{and result in}} major economic losses. Accordingly, for tunnels buried in deep rich water districts, discovering how to effectively control water gushing and ensure the stability of surrounding rock has great influence on the safety of engineering construction. The case study in this paper simulates the water-rich section of Dou-mo tunnel from Shanghai to Kunming of China. Numerical {{analysis was used to}} simulate the construction of the curtain <b>grouting</b> section and to evaluate the effects of the various curtain <b>grouting</b> parameters. The optimal <b>grouting</b> parameters were selected and then evaluated by applying them to the <b>grouting</b> method. The results show that (1) the <b>grouting</b> effect is the most notable one when the thickness of the <b>grouting</b> circle is outside the 4 [*]m range of the tunnel contour. (2) In the same circle, the <b>grouting</b> quantity of the same ring is presented as a wave form. Therefore the number of the same ring <b>grouting</b> holes should reduce and increase the distance between the adjacent <b>grouting</b> holes appropriately {{to reduce the number of}} <b>grouting</b> holes and speed up the <b>grouting</b> progress...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the use of <b>grouting</b> methods for pile foundation improvement, a generic term that is used here to define both foundation renovation (increasing the bearing capacity of a pile foundation that has insufficient bearing capacity) and foundation protection (safeguarding the piles of the foundation against possible damage resulting from underground construction activities in the vicinity). A full-scale test, of which the general set-up and consistency check are outlined in the thesis, examining the feasibility of foundation improvement by means of <b>grouting</b> techniques was conducted in Amsterdam. The main part of the thesis focuses on permeation <b>grouting,</b> jet <b>grouting</b> and compaction <b>grouting.</b> For each method, first some more general aspects like history, <b>grouting</b> equipment, <b>grouting</b> parameters and fields of application are outlined. Subsequently existing theories used in modelling the <b>grouting</b> process are examined and compared. The test results are discussed. By using the pile displacements, soil stresses, pore pressures and pile bearing capacity measured in the test, it was possible to examine the influence of <b>grouting</b> methods on pile foundations. The use of and suitability of geophysical verification methods for <b>grouting,</b> which were necessary to determine the shape and position of <b>grouted</b> elements, were also considered. To determine how <b>grouting</b> methods can best be applied for foundation renovation purposes, the cost of <b>grouting</b> methods and the hindrance that they cause have been compared with those of conventional foundation renovation methods. The construction cost of <b>grouting</b> can be up to about 50 % lower than that of conventional methods of underpinning a structure. Taking cost, hindrance and the test results into consideration, it can be concluded that permeation <b>grouting</b> and compaction <b>grouting</b> are economic and effective alternatives to conventional underpinning methods for renovating pile foundations. The methods may also be used for pile foundation protection. Jet <b>grouting</b> is only suitable for use in the renovation of end bearing piles when the structure is strong and stiff enough to redistribute the loads from the <b>grouted</b> pile. Jet <b>grouting</b> is very suitable for use in protecting pile foundations because it can be applied in any type of soil. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
