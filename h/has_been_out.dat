25|$|In the United States, {{the rate}} of unionization for these workers is about 36 percent, {{much higher than the}} average for all occupations.

Hiring halls rank the candidates by the length of time the person <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of work and fill open slots accordingly. Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports.|$|E

In 1997, a year after the D/SP merger with Union Pacific, the UP closed the line. Although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of service for nearly 2 decades, the rails are still in usable condition, though many of the signals have been ravaged by time and vandals. In 2011, under a federal Beautification Grant, the railroad's overhead signal pole lines were removed, for scrap by a private contractor.|$|E
25|$|The Copts {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} Christian {{communities}} in the Middle East. Although integrated in the larger Egyptian nation state, the Copts have survived as a distinct religious community forming around 10 to 20 percent of the population, though estimates vary. They pride themselves on the apostolicity of the Egyptian Church whose founder was the first in an unbroken chain of patriarchs. The main body for 16 centuries <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of communion with both the Roman Catholic Church (in Rome) and the various Eastern orthodox churches.|$|E

25|$|In the CMWU damage {{assessment}} report, waste water networks in Gaza City, Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia have sustained severe damage. The Ash Sheikh 'Ijleen sewage plant which treats the raw sewage {{of an area}} inhabited by 400,000 people <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of order since it {{was struck by a}} shell in the second week of the conflict. The final report of the {{damage assessment}} carried out by the CMWU reveals that repairing the water and wastewater network and facilities will cost approximately 6 million US dollars, including 830,000 dollars to repair the wastewater network. According to the Palestinian Hydrology Group, solid waste is accumulating in most areas affected by the hostilities, with the exception of Gaza city where only two areas face problems with solid waste. The group also reported that on 13 February, 3,000 litres of fuel had leaked into wastewater infiltration basin of the Beit Lahia emergency wastewater treatment plant, posing a risk for chemical contamination of the aquifer by hydrocarbons. Major repairs can not take place without the entry of needed spare parts into Gaza, which remains problematic.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E
500|$|Staunton {{introduced}} the Staunton Gambit against the Dutch Defense (1.d4 f5 2.e4!?). Although {{it was once}} a feared attacking line, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of favour since the mid-1920s, and is thought to [...] "offer White equality at best". Staunton also analysed a different gambit approach to the Dutch, 2.h3 followed by g4. In 1979 Viktor Korchnoi, one of the world's leading players, successfully introduced this line into top-class competition, but later authorities concluded, as Staunton had, that Black gets a good game with 2...Nf6 3.g4 d5! ...|$|E

500|$|At [...] "The Three Pigeons" [...] inn, it is a {{good day}} for some: the miser Boomblehardt <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> {{collecting}} rents from his tenants, and Sergeant Klooque, hero of Johannesburg, has just arrived at the inn on leave and may now flirt with any lady he chooses, without the need to pretend they are his relatives to get around his tyrannical Colonel. However, it is not a good day for Martha, the landlady of the inn: staying there is a strange old lady, a mischievous fairy, who refuses to pay or to leave, and who needs neither food nor water. This is substantially cutting into Martha's profits. She enlists Boomblehardt and Klooque, the cowardly farmer Peter, and her extremely shy niece, Pipette, to help solve this problem.|$|E
500|$|On January 6, 2006, just a {{few days}} after the Gator Bowl, Virginia Tech {{officials}} dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick hid the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal. In response to being dismissed from the team, Vick was quoted as saying, [...] "It's not a big deal. I'll just move on to the next level, baby". Vick appeared in one regular-season NFL game for the Miami Dolphins in 2006. The Dolphins did not renew his contract, and he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of football ever since.|$|E
500|$|In {{a broader}} sense, [...] "Western Wall" [...] {{can refer to}} the entire 488-metre-long (1,601ft.) {{retaining}} wall {{on the western side}} of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, {{while the rest of the}} wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter, with the small exception of a 25ft (8m) section, the so-called Little Western Wall. The segment of the Western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the [...] "Western Wall", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian stonework than the [...] "Little Western Wall". In religious terms, the [...] "Little Western Wall" [...] is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the [...] "presence of God" [...] (Shechina), and the underground Warren's Gate, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of reach since the 12th century, even more so.|$|E
