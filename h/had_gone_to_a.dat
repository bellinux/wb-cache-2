5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views {{regarding the}} marital status of Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

25|$|On {{one visit}} to Benalla in 1876, Dan {{was arrested for}} {{stealing}} a saddle. The police let him go when they could not get enough evidence. Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door. They were charged with violent assault, damage to property (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth £113. The boys went into hiding, and the police spent three weeks looking for them. Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly {{to get them to}} give themselves up. In court, the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth £10.|$|E
25|$|Controversy arose {{during the}} {{election}} surrounding the application for a minority-race candidate certificate by James Gomez of Workers' Party. On the 24 April, Gomez went to the Elections Department to fill up the minority-race candidate certificate application form accompanied by the chairperson Sylvia Lim. Instead of handing in the application form to election official, Gomez slipped the form in his bag. At the time, Sylvia Lim <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> waiting area and did not witness the event. However, {{on the eve of}} Nomination Day, James Gomez went to collect his minority-race candidate certificate claiming he had submitted the application form. Following two days of dispute between both sides, the Elections Department was able to produce video evidence showing that James Gomez did not submit the application form; a day later, James Gomez apologised to the Elections Department saying he was distracted by his busy schedule.|$|E
25|$|María Eugenia Vidal {{was elected}} {{governor}} of the populous Buenos Aires Province, defeating the controversial Aníbal Fernández; her victory influenced as well the growth of Macri in the presidential elections. Similarly, the unpopular Fernández may have subtracted non-Kirchnerite votes from Scioli. The victory was considered significant given that Fernández was the incumbent Cabinet Chief of the Kirchner administration, and that Vidal was directly replacing Daniel Scioli's post as {{governor of the}} province. It is made more significant as {{she is the first}} female governor of the province, and the first non-Peronist governor since 1987. The Republican Proposal also retained the city of Buenos Aires, that elected Horacio Rodríguez Larreta as the new mayor. The PRO stronghold <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> second round between Larreta and Martín Lousteau (also of the Cambiemos front, but not in the same party) after the Front for Victory's Mariano Recalde finished third. Juan Schiaretti won the elections in Córdoba, and he is the single governor of the UNA ticket. The socialist Miguel Lifschitz was elected governor of Santa Fe, after a controversial triple tie with the PJ and PRO. Carlos Verna was reelected governor of La Pampa.|$|E

500|$|On 25 September, a {{receptionist}} at the Automobile Association office in Barnstaple {{reported that a}} man matching Wood's description had requested an international driving licence. [...] Interpol were notified of the case on the same day, after which French police interviewed Ledez's parents. [...] Up until this point, Wood, who owned no other properties, was believed by police to {{still be in the}} Yorkshire area. [...] After Wood's capture, British and French authorities were [...] "puzzled" [...] by the ease with which Wood travelled under his own name. [...] At his trial, it was established that Wood <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pub after committing the killings and then, {{over the course of the}} next few days, travelled to Dover where he caught a ferry to France.|$|E
500|$|Alice is {{a fictional}} child living {{during the middle}} of the Victorian era. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), which takes place on 4 May, the {{character}} is widely assumed to be seven years old; Alice gives her age as seven and a half in the sequel, which takes place on 4 November. In the text of the two Alice books, author Lewis Carroll often did not remark on the physical appearance of his protagonist. Details of her fictional life can be discovered from the text of the two books. At home, she has a significantly older sister, a pet cat named Dinah, an elderly nurse, and a governess, who teaches her lessons starting at nine in the morning. Additionally, she <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> day school at some point in her backstory. Alice has been variously characterised as belonging to the upper class, middle class, or part of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to official watchlists, the press ranked Burke atop several midseason National Player of the Year tabulations. For example, in mid-January, The Sporting News {{called him the}} Player of the half-year. On both February 7, February 21 and March 7, ESPN.com posted straw polls {{of people who are}} an [...] "actual voter for {{at least one of the}} Wooden, Naismith, Associated Press or Robertson awards" [...] that had Burke in first place. Since the NCAA Tournament <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> seeded format in 1985, no point guard had won any of the four major player of the year awards without leading his team to a #1 seed. However, neither Jay Williams (2002, Sweet 16) nor Jameer Nelson (2004, Elite 8) reached the championships as national player of the year and only a few players at any position had done so in the previous 20 years: Ed O'Bannon (UCLA, 1995), Shane Battier (Duke, 2001) and Anthony Davis (Kentucky 2012).|$|E

500|$|Before {{meeting with}} Madonna, McDaniel first {{listened to the}} song and found it inspiring. When asked by the singer about her {{references}} for the video, McDaniel presented her with pictures from her favorite 1970s photographer, Bill Burke, who took pictures of people considered as freaks or inbred. Another reference was the photography book, East 100 Street by Bruce Davidson, which showed pictures of people in Spanish Harlem. Madonna let the director live in her New York apartment to continue research {{and asked her to}} go through her book collections, including those by Helmut Newton and Richard Avedon. Madonna also started working with a stylist from McDaniel's team called Brigitte Echols, for the fashion and wardrobes in the video. Echols <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-rent mall called Crenshaw Swap Meet and bought a $180 gold necklace with the name [...] "Madonna" [...] in it, inside a jewelry box. Madonna liked it and together they decided on the wardrobe, including skirts and tops, vintage clothes from costume houses, La Perla bra, and two designs from then unknown Marc Jacobs. Echols described Madonna's approach to style as [...] "collaborative".|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
500|$|Historian Hugh Ross {{argued that}} in gaining the nomination, Willkie [...] "gave {{exceptional}} promise of being a winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party, queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership in order to entrust its political fortunes to a man without political experience. [...] In most of the previous instances, the nomination <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> military man. In 1940, it went to a businessman." [...] Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered {{by the success of}} its Eastern Establishment wing; [...] "whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come." [...] Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie's oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was Gerald R. Ford, who wrote many years later in his memoirs, [...] "I now realize that my participation did not make much difference at all to the political fate of Wendell Willkie. But it made a lot of difference to me." ...|$|E

500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his arm around her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.|$|E
