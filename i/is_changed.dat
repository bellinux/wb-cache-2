Perhaps we should consider first how it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> It cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by telling people that they must change their behaviour. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> with training or guidance or by altering structures or organizational models. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by avoiding conflict or by forcing the organization to innovate. And, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by launching a grandiose (and expensive) programme for changing organizational culture.|$|R

5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, <b>is</b> <b>changed</b> from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E
5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password <b>is</b> <b>changed</b> or the private key revoked).

Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E
