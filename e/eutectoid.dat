5|$|There {{are many}} types of heat {{treating}} processes available to steel. The most common are annealing, quenching, and tempering. Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the <b>eutectoid</b> composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a <b>eutectoid</b> steel), are cooled, the {{austenitic}} phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the <b>eutectoid</b> composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eutectoid</b> {{composition}} of austenite is approximately 0.76% carbon; steel with less carbon content (hypoeutectoid steel) will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites {{that do not}} participate in the <b>eutectoid</b> reaction and cannot transform into pearlite. Likewise steels with higher carbon content (hypereutectoid steels) will form cementite before reaching the <b>eutectoid</b> point. The proportion of ferrite and cementite forming above the <b>eutectoid</b> point can be calculated from the iron/iron—carbide equilibrium phase diagram using the lever rule.|$|E
50|$|When the {{solution}} above the transformation point is solid, rather than liquid, an analogous <b>eutectoid</b> transformation can occur. For instance, in the iron-carbon system, the austenite phase can undergo a <b>eutectoid</b> transformation to produce ferrite and cementite, often in lamellar {{structures such as}} pearlite and bainite. This <b>eutectoid</b> point occurs at 727 C and about 0.76% carbon.|$|E
50|$|There is one <b>eutectoid</b> {{point on}} the diagram, at 83 wt% of In. The <b>eutectoid</b> {{temperature}} is 322K (49 °C; 120.20 °F). In the cooling process the phase ε will form BiIn2 and In.|$|E
50|$|A <b>eutectoid</b> alloy is similar, but {{the phase}} change occurs, {{not from a}} liquid, but from a solid {{solution}}. Upon cooling a <b>eutectoid</b> alloy from the solution temperature, the constituents will separate into different crystal phases, forming a single microstructure. A <b>eutectoid</b> steel, for example, contains 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling slowly, the solution of iron and carbon (a single phase called austenite) will separate into platelets of the phases ferrite and cementite. This forms a layered microstructure called pearlite.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} {{composition of}} an alloy system will {{usually have a}} great effect {{on the results of}} heat treating. If the percentage of each constituent is just right, the alloy will form a single, continuous microstructure upon cooling. Such a mixture is said to be <b>eutectoid.</b> However, If the percentage of the solutes varies from the <b>eutectoid</b> mixture, two or more different microstructures will usually form simultaneously. A hypoeutectoid solution contains less of the solute than the <b>eutectoid</b> mix, while a hypereutectoid solution contains more.|$|E

50|$|Pearlite is a two-phased, {{lamellar}} (or layered) structure {{composed of}} alternating layers of ferrite (88 wt%) and cementite (12 wt%) that occurs in some steels and cast irons. During slow cooling of an iron-carbon alloy, pearlite forms by a <b>eutectoid</b> reaction as austenite cools below 727 C (the <b>eutectoid</b> temperature). Pearlite is a microstructure occurring in many common grades of steels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eutectoid</b> steel can in {{principle}} be transformed completely into pearlite; hypoeutectoid steels {{can also be}} completely pearlitic if transformed at a temperature below the normal <b>eutectoid.</b> Pearlite can be hard and strong but is not particularly tough. It can be wear resistant because of a strong lamellar network of ferrite and cementite. Examples of applications include cutting tools, high strength wires, knives, chisels, and nails.|$|E
50|$|Austenite, {{also known}} as gamma-phase iron (γ-Fe), is a metallic, {{non-magnetic}} allotrope of iron or a solid solution of iron, with an alloying element. In plain-carbon steel, austenite exists above the critical <b>eutectoid</b> temperature of 1000 K (727°C); other alloys of steel have different <b>eutectoid</b> temperatures. The austenite allotrope exists at room temperature in stainless steel. It is named after Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen (1843-1902).|$|E
50|$|A {{hypoeutectoid}} steel contains less than 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling a {{hypoeutectoid steel}} from the austenite transformation temperature, small islands of proeutectoid-ferrite will form. These {{will continue to}} grow and the carbon will recede until the <b>eutectoid</b> concentration {{in the rest of the}} steel is reached. This <b>eutectoid</b> mixture will then crystallize as a microstructure of pearlite. Since ferrite is softer than pearlite, the two microstructures combine to increase the ductility of the alloy. Consequently, the hardenability of the alloy is lowered.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the folding}} process, {{most of the}} {{impurities}} are removed from the steel, continuously refining the steel while forging. By the end of forging, the steel produced was among the purest steel-alloys of the ancient world. Due to the continuous heating the steel tends to decarburize, so a good quantity of carbon is either extracted from the steel as carbon dioxide or redistributed more evenly through diffusion, leaving a nearly <b>eutectoid</b> composition (containing 0.77 to 0.8% carbon). The edge-steel itself will generally {{end up with a}} composition that ranges from <b>eutectoid</b> to slightly hypoeutectoid (containing a carbon content under the <b>eutectoid</b> composition), giving enough hardenability without sacrificing ductility The skin-steel generally has slightly less carbon, often in the range of 0.5%. The core-steel, however, remains nearly pure iron, responding very little to heat treatment. Cyril Stanley Smith, a professor of metallurgical history from MIT, performed an analysis of four different swords, each from a different century, determining the composition of the surface of the blades: ...|$|E

50|$|While {{cementite}} is thermodynamically unstable, eventually being {{converted to}} ferrite and graphite at higher temperatures, {{it does not}} decompose on heating at temperatures below the <b>eutectoid</b> temperature (723 °C) on the metastable iron-carbon phase diagram.|$|E
5000|$|A {{eutectic}} transformation, {{in which}} a two component single phase liquid is cooled and transforms into two solid phases. The same process, but beginning with a solid instead of a liquid is called a <b>eutectoid</b> transformation.|$|E
5000|$|Point a {{at around}} 700 °C is the minimum {{temperature}} the steel should be heated to {{so it can}} be quenched. By the modern theory it is the temperature of austenite <b>eutectoid</b> transformation (see the picture on the right).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} types of heat {{treating}} processes available to steel. The most common are annealing, quenching, and tempering. Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the <b>eutectoid</b> composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment.|$|E
50|$|In metallurgy, {{quenching}} is {{most commonly}} used to harden steel by introducing martensite, {{in which case the}} steel must be rapidly cooled through its <b>eutectoid</b> point, the temperature at which austenite becomes unstable. In steel alloyed with metals such as nickel and manganese, the <b>eutectoid</b> temperature becomes much lower, but the kinetic barriers to phase transformation remain the same. This allows quenching to start at a lower temperature, making the process much easier. High speed steel also has added tungsten, which serves to raise kinetic barriers and give the illusion that the material has been cooled more rapidly than it really has. Even cooling such alloys slowly in air has most of the desired effects of quenching.|$|E
50|$|Austenite is {{slightly}} undercooled when quenched below <b>Eutectoid</b> temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse pearlite is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form pearlite nucleate. This transformation is complete at the pearlite finish time (Pf).|$|E
5000|$|For a <b>eutectoid</b> {{carbon steel}} of thin section, if the quench {{starting}} at 750 °C and ending at 450 °C {{takes place in}} 0.7 seconds (a rate of 430 °C/s) no pearlite will form and the steel will be martensitic with small amounts of retained austenite.|$|E
5000|$|Lamellar {{structures}} or microstructures {{are composed}} of fine, alternating layers of different materials {{in the form of}} lamellae. They are often observed in cases where a phase transformation front moves quickly, leaving behind two solid products, as in rapid cooling of eutectic (such as solder) or <b>eutectoid</b> (such as pearlite) systems.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypereutectoid}} steel {{contains more than}} 0.77% carbon. When slowly cooling a {{hypereutectoid steel}}, the cementite will begin to crystallize first. When the remaining steel becomes <b>eutectoid</b> in composition, it will crystallize into pearlite. Since cementite is much harder than pearlite, the alloy has greater hardenability at a cost in the ductility.|$|E
5000|$|For a <b>eutectoid</b> steel (0.78% C), between 6 and 10% of austenite, called {{retained}} austenite, will remain. The {{percentage of}} retained austenite increases from insignificant {{for less than}} 0.6% C steel, to 13% retained austenite at 0.95% C and 30-47% retained austenite for a 1.4% carbon steels. A very rapid quench is essential to create martensite.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of certain alloying elements, such as manganese and nickel, can stabilize the austenitic structure, facilitating heat-treatment of low-alloy steels. In the extreme case of austenitic stainless steel, much higher alloy content makes this structure stable even at room temperature. On the other hand, such elements as silicon, molybdenum, and chromium tend to de-stabilize austenite, raising the <b>eutectoid</b> temperature.|$|E
50|$|Tempering: This is {{the most}} common heat {{treatment}} encountered, because the final properties can be precisely determined by the temperature and time of the tempering. Tempering involves reheating quenched steel to a temperature below the <b>eutectoid</b> temperature then cooling. The elevated temperature allows very small amounts of spheroidite to form, which restores ductility, but reduces hardness. Actual temperatures and times are carefully chosen for each composition.|$|E
50|$|A <b>eutectoid</b> (eutectic-like) alloy {{is similar}} in {{behavior}} to a eutectic alloy. A eutectic alloy is characterized by having a single melting point. This melting point is {{lower than that of}} any of the constituents, and no change in the mixture will lower the melting point any further. When a molten eutectic alloy is cooled, all of the constituents will crystallize into their respective phases at the same temperature.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypereutectic}} alloy {{also has}} different melting points. However, between these points, {{it is the}} constituent with the higher melting point that will be solid. Similarly, a hypereutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures. When cooling a hypereutectoid alloy from the upper transformation temperature, it will usually be the excess solutes that crystallize-out first, forming the proeutectoid. This continues until the concentration in the remaining alloy becomes <b>eutectoid,</b> which then crystallizes into a separate microstructure.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the above-mentioned types of phase diagrams, {{there are thousands of}} other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a liquid. There is also the peritectoid, a point where two solid phases combine into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase transforms into two solid phases during cooling, is called the <b>eutectoid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Peritectic transformations {{are also}} similar to {{eutectic}} reactions. Here, a liquid and solid phase of fixed proportions react {{at a fixed}} temperature to yield a single solid phase. Since the solid product forms at the interface between the two reactants, it can form a diffusion barrier and generally causes such reactions to proceed much more slowly than eutectic or <b>eutectoid</b> transformations. Because of this, when a peritectic composition solidifies it does not show the lamellar structure that is found with eutectic solidification.|$|E
50|$|Alloying {{elements}} {{are added to}} achieve certain properties in the material. As a guideline, alloying {{elements are}} added in lower percentages (less than 5%) to increase strength or hardenability, or in larger percentages (over 5%) to achieve special properties, such as corrosion resistance or extreme temperature stability.Manganese, silicon, or aluminum are added during the steelmaking process to remove dissolved oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus from the melt.Manganese, silicon, nickel, and copper are added to increase strength by forming solid solutions in ferrite. Chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten increase strength by forming second-phase carbides. Nickel and copper improve corrosion resistance in small quantities. Molybdenum helps to resist embrittlement. Zirconium, cerium, and calcium increase toughness by controlling the shape of inclusions. Sulfur ({{in the form of}} manganese sulfide) lead, bismuth, selenium, and tellurium increase machinability.The alloying elements tend to form either solid solutions or compounds or carbides. Nickel is very soluble in ferrite; therefore, it forms compounds, usually Ni3Al. Aluminium dissolves in the ferrite and forms the compounds Al2O3 and AlN. Silicon is also very soluble and usually forms the compound SiO2•MxOy. Manganese mostly dissolves in ferrite forming the compounds MnS, MnO•SiO2, but will also form carbides in the form of (Fe,Mn)3C. Chromium forms partitions between the ferrite and carbide phases in steel, forming (Fe,Cr3)C, Cr7C3, and Cr23C6. The type of carbide that chromium forms depends on the amount of carbon and other types of alloying elements present. Tungsten and molybdenum form carbides if there is enough carbon and an absence of stronger carbide forming elements (i.e., titanium & niobium), they form the carbides W2C and Mo2C, respectively. Vanadium, titanium, and niobium are strong carbide forming elements, forming vanadium carbide, titanium carbide, and niobium carbide, respectively.Alloying elements also {{have an effect on the}} <b>eutectoid</b> temperature of the steel. Manganese and nickel lower the <b>eutectoid</b> temperature and are known as austenite stabilizing elements. With enough of these elements the austenitic structure may be obtained at room temperature. Carbide-forming elements raise the <b>eutectoid</b> temperature; these elements are known as ferrite stabilizing elements.|$|E

50|$|Spheroidizing: Spheroidite forms when {{carbon steel}} is heated to {{approximately}} 700 °C for over 30 hours. Spheroidite can form at lower temperatures {{but the time}} needed drastically increases, as this is a diffusion-controlled process. The result is a structure of rods or spheres of cementite within primary structure (ferrite or pearlite, depending on {{which side of the}} <b>eutectoid</b> you are on). The purpose is to soften higher carbon steels and allow more formability. This is the softest and most ductile form of steel. The image to the right shows where spheroidizing usually occurs.|$|E
50|$|To {{produce the}} right amount of {{hardness}} in the finished product, the smith generally begins with steel that has a carbon content that is higher than desired. In ancient times, forging often began with steel that had a carbon content much too high for normal use. Most ancient forge-welding began with hypereutectoid steel, containing a carbon content sometimes well above 1.0%. Hypereutectoid steels are typically too brittle to be useful in a finished product, {{but by the end of}} forging the steel typically had a high carbon-content ranging from 0.8% (<b>eutectoid</b> tool-steel) to 0.5% (hypoeutectoid spring-steel).|$|E
