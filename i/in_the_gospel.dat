5|$|As the Word, Jesus was {{eternally}} {{present with}} God, active in all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Luke {{the words}} of the Magnificat are spoken by Mary when she visits her cousin Elizabeth, both being pregnant, Mary with Jesus and Elisabeth with John the Baptist. In Christianity, the feast commemorating that visit is called Visitation. It is a chosen {{opportunity}} to give more than ordinary attention to the Magnificat canticle in liturgy, while the feast celebrates the event tied to its origin.|$|E

2500|$|Mainstream {{historical}} scholars {{argue that}} the story of Jesus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> includes many mythical or legendary elements, but that these are religious elaborations added to the biography of a historical figure. The more methodical writings of David Friedrich Strauss caused an uproar in Europe in 1835. Strauss did not deny the existence of Jesus, but believed that very few facts could be known about him and characterized <b>the</b> miraculous accounts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> as [...] "mythical". However Christ Myth Theorists, such as Robert M. Price, argue that <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> are a type of legendary fiction, and that <b>the</b> Jesus portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> fits <b>the</b> mythic hero archetype.|$|R

5|$|Thirty {{pieces of}} silver was {{the price for}} which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus, {{according}} to an account <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew 26:15 in the New Testament.

5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative {{the words of}} the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's translation of the biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition as he had done with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> accounts.|$|E
5|$|Since our blessed Lord, {{instead of}} a rich and honourable station in this world, was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition; let not those, on whom the bounty of Providence hath {{bestowed}} wealth and honours, despise the men who are placed in a humble and inferior station; but rather, with their utmost power, by their countenance, by their protection, by just payment of their honest labour, encourage their daily endeavours {{for the support of}} themselves and their families. On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things honest in the sight of all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> to the poor, I mean the kingdom of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Jesus' {{childhood}} home is identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> of Luke and Matthew {{as the town}} of Nazareth in Galilee, where {{he lived with his}} family.

His other family members—his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters—are mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> and other sources.|$|R

5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew {{is the only one}} of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. In Mark 6:1-4, the author of the Gospel of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Ebionite gospel is {{one example}} of a type of gospel harmony that used the Gospel of Matthew as a base text but did not include the Gospel of John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E
