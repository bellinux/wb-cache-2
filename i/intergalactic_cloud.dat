Mid-infrared and far-infrared images were obtained with IRAC and MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our analysis of these maps is done at each wavelength relative to the Hi spatial distribution. We observe a probable detection at 8 µm and a marginal detection at 24 µm associated with the highest Hi column densities in the cloud. At 70 and 160 µm, upper limits on the dust emission are deduced. The level of the detection is low so {{that the possibility of}} a fortuitous cirrus clump or of an overdensity of extragalactic sources along the line of sight can not be excluded. If this detection is confirmed, the quantities of dust inferred imply a dust to gas ratio in the <b>intergalactic</b> <b>cloud</b> up to a few times solar but no less than 1 / 20 solar.

Past or present stellar activity in the gas might have been expected to produce detectable visual infrared, CO, OH, or radio recombination-line emission. None was detected. The limits are used to study physical conditions in the intergalactic gas. In particular, B and V band limits on starlight and IRAS limits on the presence of dust strongly constrain the presence of stars or stellar by-products. However, given the uncertainties about physical conditions in the intergalactic environment, it is difficult to rule out entirely the presence of stellar-processed materials.

40|$|Abstract. The {{severity}} of the intervening photoelectric absorption out to large redshift due to neutral hydrogen contained in quasar absorption line systems is reassessed in light of improved absorber statistics resulting from the HST Quasar Absorption Line Key Project. Compared to previous estimates, the updated statistics imply roughly a doubling of the anticipated fraction of the sky showing a given residual opacity at the wavelength of the He ii λ 304 line. Because of the steepness of the quasar luminosity function, this slight lifting of the <b>intergalactic</b> <b>cloud</b> cover significantly affects the expected appearance of the high redshift quasar population at short far-UV wavelengths, resulting in somewhat more optimistic prospects for carrying out further studies of intergalactic He ii absorption beyond the four objects toward which such absorption has been detected so far.

Observations of distorted jets The jets and hotspots of radio galaxies and quasars often show complex structure. Jets can bend by over 90 ◦ and remain collimated for several jet radii (Bridle and Perley, 1984), despite the expectation that the oblique shock causing the bend should decelerate the jet (Icke, 1991).

40|$|Abstract. We have mapped the {{distribution}} of the rotation measure of the CSS source 3 C 119 on milliarcsecond scales using VLBA observations obtained at three widely-separated frequencies in the available 8. 4 -GHz band. The resulting images at frequencies 8. 16, 8. 52, and 8. 86 GHz demonstrate that the material associated with the large integrated rotation measure of the source is concentrated near the brightest jet component C. There is a large, smooth gradient of the rotation measure in this component of 2300 rad/m 2 /mas, with the largest rotation measure at the leading edge. This supports the idea that C is associated with a collision between the VLBI jet and a dense <b>intergalactic</b> <b>cloud.</b> The magnetic field in C is aligned with the flow into C from the northeast, and swings through ∼ 45 ◦ so that it remains aligned with the inferred flow toward the emission further down the jet, nearly directly to the south...|$|E

We have specifically tailored our simulation parameters to facilitate comparison with recent observations of Minkowski's Object (M.

As shown in our simulations, such a collision triggers shocks which propagate around and through the cloud.

Our simulations provide information about the expected star formation rate, total mass converted to H 1, H_ 2, and stars, and the relative velocity of the stars and gas.

This exerted a negative feedback on the rate of collapse of gas out of the background IGM by raising the Jeans mass there and affected the appearance and evolution of the IGM and the structure which subsequently collapsed out of it.

We show that these disparate systems define a simple relationship between the Ovi column density and absorption-line width that is independent of the Oxygen abundance over the range O/H ∼ 10 % to twice solar. We show that this relation is exactly that predicted theoretically as a radiatively cooling flow of hot gas passes through the coronal temperature regime- independent of its density or metallicity (for O/H � 0. 1 solar).
