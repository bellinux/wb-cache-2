CINDER is often mistakenly associated with Wikileaks in the media. This is possibly {{due to the}} confusion between DARPA programs focused {{on identifying}} human <b>insider</b> <b>threat</b> such as ADAMS [...] and the identification of software espionage posed by malware in the CINDER program. This issue was clarified by Mudge in his Defcon 2011 keynote at 46 minutes and 11 seconds into the talk.|$|E

In this paper, we analyze the problem of <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> with emphases on the Cloud computing platform. Security {{is one of the}} major anxieties when planning to adopt the Cloud. This paper will contribute towards the conception of mitigation strategies that can be relied on to solve the malicious <b>insider</b> <b>threats.</b> While Cloud computing relieves organizations from the burden of the data management and storage costs, security in general and the malicious <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> in particular is the main concern in cloud environments.

30|$|Although major {{advances}} {{have been made}} in protection of cloud platforms against malicious attacks, little has been done regarding the protection of these platforms against <b>insider</b> <b>threats.</b> This paper looks into this challenge by introducing self-adaptation as a mechanism to handle <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> in cloud platforms, and this will be demonstrated in the context of OpenStack. OpenStack is a popular cloud platform that relies on Keystone, its identity management component, for controlling access to its resources. The use of self-adaptation for handling <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> has been motivated by the fact that self-adaptation {{has been shown to be}} quite effective in dealing with uncertainty in a wide range of applications. <b>Insider</b> <b>threats</b> have become a major cause for concern since legitimate, though malicious, users might have access, in case of theft, to a large amount of information. The key contribution of this paper is the definition of an architectural solution that incorporates self-adaptation into OpenStack Keystone in order to handle <b>insider</b> <b>threats.</b> For that, we have identified and analysed several <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> scenarios in the context of the OpenStack cloud platform, and have developed a prototype that was used for experimenting and evaluating the impact of these scenarios upon the self-adaptive authorisation system for the cloud platforms.|$|R
30|$|These {{scenarios}} {{were used}} to experiment and evaluate the impact of self-adaptive authorisation approaches into cloud platforms. We have observed how an autonomic controller handles <b>insider</b> <b>threats,</b> and {{the time it takes}} from detection to its response. From the results obtained, we have confirmed the potential, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, that self-adaptation can provide in mitigating and protecting cloud platforms against <b>insider</b> <b>threats.</b> Starting from the fact that self-adaptive authorisation infrastructures are able to dynamically react to <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> by adapting during run-time its access control policies [3].|$|R

30|$|Based on the above, the {{contributions}} of this paper are threefold. First, we discuss the limitations of OpenStack platform for dealing with <b>insider</b> <b>threats.</b> Second, we propose an architectural solution that incorporates self-adaptation into OpenStack, {{in order to deal}} with <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> at the user level. This architectural solution is defined in the context of OpenStack components that are responsible for dealing with authorisation issues based on the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model [26]. Third, we have developed a prototype for experimenting and evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of self-adaptive authorisation mechanisms in dealing with <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> in a cloud platform, like OpenStack. For the evaluation, we have identified several potential <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> scenarios, and for dealing with these threats, we have define potential responses from a self-adaptive authorisation infrastructure that is integrated with OpenStack.|$|R
40|$|Regardless of the {{established}} security controls that organizations have {{put in place to}} protect their digital assets, a rise in <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> has been observed and particularly in incidents of data leakage. The importance of data as corporate assets is leading to a growing need for detection, prevention and mitigation of such violations by the organisations. In this paper we are investigating the different types of <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> and their implications to the corporate environment, with specific emphasis to the special case of data leakage. Organisations should evaluate the risk they are facing due to <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> and establish proactive measures towards this direction. In response to the challenging problem of identifying <b>insider</b> <b>threats,</b> we design a forensic readiness model, which is able to identify, prevent and log email messages, which attempt to leak information from an organisation with the aid of steganography...|$|R

40|$|Security is {{considered}} a significant deficiency in cloud computing, and <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> problem exacerbate security concerns in the cloud. In addition to that, cloud computing is very complex by itself, because it encompasses numerous technologies and concepts. Apparently, overcoming these challenges requires substantial efforts from information security researchers to develop powerful mitigation solutions for this emerging problem. This entails developing a taxonomy of <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> in cloud environments encompassing all potential abnormal activities in the cloud, and can be useful for conducting security assessment. This paper describes {{the first phase of}} an ongoing research to develop a framework for mitigating <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> in cloud computing environments. Primarily, it presents a multidimensional taxonomy of <b>insider</b> <b>threats</b> in cloud computing, and demonstrates its viability. The taxonomy provides a fundamental understanding for this complicated problem by identifying five dimensions, it also supports security engineers in identifying hidden paths, thus determining proper countermeasures, and presents a guidance covers all bounders of <b>insiders</b> <b>threats</b> issue in clouds, hence it facilitates researchers’ endeavours in tackling this problem. For instance, according to the hierarchical taxonomy, clearly many significant issues exist in public cloud, while conventional insider mitigation solutions can be used in private clouds. Finally, the taxonomy assists in identifying future research directions in this emerging area...|$|R
