5|$|Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, Adam Sedgwick, and Charles Lyell {{attacked}} it vigorously. It {{has been}} suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science, and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.|$|E
5|$|Deodato also hired Perry Pirkanen {{and another}} actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out {{shortly before the}} {{production}} team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently chose Carl Gabriel Yorke to replace him for the role. Yorke, a stage actor who had studied under Uta Hagen and appeared in three national tours of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was chosen <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because Cannibal Holocaust was a non-Union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.|$|E
5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> disliked his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part {{so that he could}} return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a larger leadership and scoring role than anticipated.|$|E

2500|$|By December 2007, the Clinton {{campaign}} {{charged that}} Obama's campaign was getting much more favorable media treatment than their own, especially once their campaign began faltering. [...] Washington Post media analyst Howard Kurtz found {{a number of}} journalists who agreed with the claim, with Mark Halperin, Time magazine's editor-at-large for political news, saying, [...] "Your typical reporter has a thinly disguised preference that Barack Obama be the nominee. The narrative of him beating her is better than her beating him, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> she's a Clinton and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a young African American. ... There's no one rooting {{for her to come}} back." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{was excited}} to read Michael Risch’s latest Article,America’s First Patents, <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> and I {{generally}} agree, especially when it pertains {{to the topic of}} patent-eligible subject matter. In this Article, Professor Risch examines patent-eligible subject matter through a unique lens—history based on early patents...|$|R
5|$|Friedrich was a {{prolific}} artist who {{produced more than}} 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as The Stages of Life, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted {{during one of the}} revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.|$|E
5|$|The King lent {{support to}} Fisher, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> disliked Beresford, and {{eventually}} Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign {{outside of the}} navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although {{the bulk of his}} policies were retained. The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.|$|E
5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was the only one who}} confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E
50|$|Donald Trump won the {{election}} in Idaho with 59.2% of the vote. Hillary Clinton received 27.6% of the vote. Despite the national Republican trend, Trump carried Idaho by a slightly reduced margin than Mitt Romney in 2012, <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> lost support to third party candidates Evan McMullin and Gary Johnson.|$|R
50|$|Gorlin {{had great}} success {{with his first}} title, Choplifter, which he {{developed}} in six months. Airheart, however, took about three years to develop. This is <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> also developed other games which he lost interest in and never completed and also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{did a lot of}} research and built a number of tools to help in game development.|$|R
25|$|Unlike his predecessors, Robert was impetuous and violent, <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> perhaps, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had {{inherited}} a severe form of gout from his grandfather. He was also unreliable {{and lacking in}} political sophistication. Almost {{as soon as he}} took control of his estate, he attacked the priory of Tutbury, which his family were patrons of.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was {{overlooked}} {{until the}} mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers {{and was not}} widely imitated. In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work. The painting remained {{in a series of}} private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, along with 25 other paintings at least claimed to be by Velázquez; it was here that it became known as the Rokeby Venus. It {{does not appear to have}} been copied by other artists, engraved or otherwise reproduced, until this period. In 1890 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London, and in 1905 at Messrs. Agnews, the dealers who had bought it from Morritt. From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well-known globally through reproductions. The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed, although individual artists would have been able to see it on occasion throughout its history.|$|E
5|$|In the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles won the {{championship}} 7–0 during a blizzard in Philadelphia's Shibe Park. Following the win, Eagles owner Alexis Thompson advocated a championship {{game between the}} top teams in the NFL and the AAFC, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was losing money and felt an inter-league championship would draw large crowds. Thompson was also a leading proponent among NFL owners of negotiation with the AAFC over a deal to ease the leagues' competition for talent, which had driven up salaries and was eating into owners' profits. Thompson met with Browns owner Mickey McBride and agreed to a playoff – either one game in Yankee Stadium or a best-of-three series with games in Philadelphia, Cleveland and possibly New York. Thompson's proposal was shot down by other NFL owners, however, and {{he was given a}} reprimand by commissioner Bert Bell for suggesting the NFL-AAFC championship. Frustrated with his financial losses and lack of support among the owners, Thompson sold the Eagles shortly after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{negotiations}} led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino {{resulted in}} the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held {{and the city of}} Dorpat to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva.|$|E
50|$|Chuck has {{developed}} {{in other ways}} since the series started. At the beginning, he is socially awkward {{to the point of}} driving away women, <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is unable to get over his betrayals at Stanford. He is stuck in a bad job, unsure if he even wants to advance within the company, and lacks confidence that he can do better.|$|R
50|$|Little is {{recorded}} about Philip's childhood and youth, <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was of minor royal birth. Philip's father Charles, Count of Valois, {{the younger brother}} of King Philip IV of France, had striven throughout his life to gain a throne for himself but was never successful. He died in 1325, leaving his eldest son Philip as heir to the counties of Anjou, Maine, and Valois.|$|R
50|$|In his photography, Guenther often {{works in}} black and white, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of what <b>he</b> {{identifies}} as its documentary aspect, which helps to free his images from the clutter of unintended cultural references.|$|R
5|$|After {{his brother}} Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men {{suspected}} of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt {{and his brother}} Warren {{set out on a}} vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was the only one who}} was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt's assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt's death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.|$|E
25|$|Slack {{made his}} Middlesex debut in 1977, {{but failed to}} {{establish}} himself in the side, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> played out of position, in the middle order.|$|E
25|$|Earl Long {{endorsed}} Davis in {{the runoff}} <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had a longstanding personal dislike of Morrison. Long's gubernatorial running-mate, James A. Noe, who finished {{fourth in the}} primary, stood with Morrison, as did the fifth-place gubernatorial candiudate and former Long lieutenant governor, Bill Dodd.|$|E
50|$|There {{is nothing}} else known about Antoninus' life, aside from the high {{position}} {{in the court of}} Shapur II. This may <b>in</b> <b>part</b> have been <b>because</b> <b>he</b> spoke both Greek and Latin.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, he {{recorded}} only 1.5 sacks, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> although <b>he</b> was the starting left defensive end {{he moved to}} defensive tackle in the Bears [...] "nickel defense," [...] perhaps cutting down on his pass-rush opportunities. He was slated to play that spot again in 1992, however, the development of Alonzo Spellman allowed Armstrong to play end in all situations. As a result, his sack total was a 6.5.|$|R
50|$|While {{invisible}} to most, McCay becomes {{visible to the}} Justice League on one occasion when the Flash grabs him from the dimension through which he travels. He attempts to tell Superman that the apocalypse will result from their actions. Superman, however, is confused by his appearance and refuses his warning <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because,</b> knowing <b>he</b> is trapped, McCay delivers the warning {{in the form of}} repeating a biblical passage spoken to him by Dodds.|$|R
25|$|In December 2007, the Philadelphia Inquirer {{reported}} that Scarfo Jr. had been demoted within the Lucchese crime family {{in part because}} of ongoing media coverage of his activities and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> intended to start a mob war to regain control of the Philadelphia outfit.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of his}} socialist ideals, he {{proposed}} that Power Jets be nationalised; <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> saw that private companies would profit from the technology freely given during the war. By 1964 he had deserted his previously socialist beliefs, {{going so far as}} to launch a fierce attack on the Labour candidate in Smethwick.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that H. G. Wells’ fictional HMS Thunder Child from his novel The War of the Worlds may have been based on this ship, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> described Thunder Child as an ironclad torpedo ram, and Polyphemus was the only ship of this type which the Royal Navy possessed.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} was Korda's first Hollywood film {{after moving to}} America from Berlin where he had previously been working. Korda was assigned the film <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was a native of}} Hungary, where the film's action is set. It was shot at the Burbank Studios of First National Pictures during the summer of 1927. It was a moderate success once it was released in August 1927. It was released in Britain on May 28, 1928. Korda's next film was the far more successful The Private Life of Helen of Troy.|$|R
60|$|Rob had not {{informed}} himself perhaps--in his then {{state of}} mind {{it would have been}} an act of no common temerity to inquire--whether he yielded so completely to this influence <b>in</b> any <b>part,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had floating suspicions of his patron's being a master of certain treacherous arts in which he had himself been a poor scholar at the Grinders' School. But certainly Rob admired him, as well as feared him. Mr Carker, perhaps, was better acquainted with the sources of his power, which lost nothing by his management of it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cathedral chapter}} at Namur, intent on {{rebuilding}} their aged and cramped cathedral, which {{had recently been}} damaged in a flood, turned to Pisoni <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> was <b>he</b> was at work in Brussels, effecting alterations in the palace of the governor, Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, and thus had a local reputation [...]Pisoni died at Locarno. Gaetano Matteo Pisoni also built the St Jean's collegiate church in Liège Collégiale Saint-Jean-en-l'isle de Liège, with an exceptional plan making of this church a unique and remarkable element of the Belgian architectural heritage.|$|R
25|$|Romney {{has opposed}} {{ratification}} of New START, a bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wishes to deploy defensive missiles on submarines.

25|$|On July 26, 2010, Kang Kek Iew (aka Comrade Duch), {{director}} of the S-21 prison camp in Democratic Kampuchea where more than 14,000 people were tortured and then murdered (mostly at nearby Choeung Ek), was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 35 years. His sentence was reduced to 19 years <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had been behind bars for 11 years.|$|E
25|$|The Henley regatta, {{which is}} held {{annually}} on the River Thames in Henley, England, {{was the most}} prestigious event in rowing. Kelly's application was rejected <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had done manual labor as a bricklayer. The rejection became widely publicized. This led Kelly to seek and gain redemption {{by going to the}} 1920 Summer Olympics which he had originally not planned to attend.|$|E
50|$|Haines {{turned down}} a peerage from Wilson in the 1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>he</b> claimed, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{did not wish to}} be awarded one in a list also {{consisting}} of Joe Kagan and Eric Miller, already under suspicion of criminal activity at the time.|$|R
50|$|He taught {{history at}} Amherst College (1947-1949), at Vassar College (1951-1953), {{and reached the}} rank of full Professor at McGill University, Montreal, while {{teaching}} there (1955-1965). The move to Canada resulted <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of difficulties <b>he</b> encountered finding a tenure-track position in the U.S.A. because of his political beliefs, as McCarthyism threatened academic freedom.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Newning’s ideal {{development}} was never realized <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{did not anticipate}} {{the extent to which}} commercial development would occur on South Congress, the difficulty of crossing the river, and the distance from town. Before {{the turn of the century}} a number of Victorian homes were built on the large lots. Development, however, was so sparse that starting in the 1910s lots were subdivided into smaller parcels. In the 1920s and 1930s, small bungalows and cottages were built on these smaller lots. A much altered and scaled-back Fairview Park was not built out until the 1940s.|$|R
