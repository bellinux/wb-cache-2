50|$|Fence {{viewers in}} New York resolve {{disputes}} about maintenance of <b>division</b> <b>fences</b> {{and the value}} of a <b>division</b> <b>fence</b> to be transferred. Disputes are resolved by any two of the fence viewers of a town, with one selected by each party to the dispute. If the two fence viewers do not agree, they select a third fence viewer which results in a majority decision which when filed in writing becomes final. Fence viewers may question and subpoena witnesses, and are paid one dollar and fifty cents per day. Fence viewers assess damages from neglected or unbuilt fences, including damages caused by animals not kept on the owners property. They can specify the distance between posts of a barbed wire <b>division</b> <b>fence.</b> Fence viewer are compensated ten cents per mile for travel related to escape of animals. They are also charged with selling at auction strays that are not redeemed by the owner.|$|R

40|$|In Nebraska, if I {{want to make}} a {{neighbor}} pay for part of a <b>division</b> <b>fence,</b> I can ask him or her to do so. If they refuse, for over a century I could have requested fence viewers to determine how much of the <b>division</b> <b>fence</b> each neighbor should pay for. Now if I want to do that I must go to court. I can also build the fence myself and assume full responsibility for the costs of construction and maintenance. Ideally, neighbors should have a written agreement (filed with the real estate deeds) identifying how the costs of building and maintaining the fence will be shared. But written fence agreements are rare...|$|R
50|$|In Rhode Island, <b>division</b> <b>fences</b> {{cannot be}} made of barbed-wire unless both {{adjoining}} owners consent in writing. If a barbed-wire fence is erected without proper consent, the town fence viewer notifies that the fence be removed, {{and if it is}} not taken down, the fence viewer removes the fence and stores the material. Barbed-wire fences built prior to April 20, 1906 are exempt. Fence viewers also determine the cost to be paid for a <b>division</b> <b>fence</b> if the owners do not otherwise agree.As in other states, they resolve disputes concerning the maintenance of fences and can order the delinquent party to build, repair, or rebuild a fence. The fence viewer also files a lien for twice the cost to complete such an order if it is ignored. The fence viewer is entitled to six dollars per day and must pay five dollars per day for failing to perform their function. A complainant may file a complaint about a fence with any fence viewer they choose from the town in which the subject fence is located.|$|R

Two of his sons, Robert Jr. and Wallace began a similar {{business}} in Wichita, Kansas in 1886. They returned to Covington nine years later, and joined their father's business, {{along with a}} third brother. They opened a bridge works plant in Cincinnati, Ohio, and a related service, called Stewart Jail Works. Needing more space, the brothers built a new plant on 8 acre near Madison and 17th Streets in 1903. The firm had four buildings to house its five divisions, the jail cell division, a truck <b>division,</b> wrought iron furniture and <b>fence</b> <b>division,</b> and a chain-link <b>fence</b> <b>division.</b> A branch in Cincinnati operated {{during the period of}} 1903 through 1915. The company won the grand prize and gold medal in construction at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. By 1915, the company had 600 employees. Stewart began producing trucks in 1912, which placed the company in debt {{by the end of the}} 1920s. During World War I, it was an important supplier of trucks, at its peak producing 100 for the U.S. Army in 1918, but ceased truck manufacturing a decade later.|$|R

After Millburn purchased Stewart's <b>fence</b> <b>division</b> from Pott Industries, he moved the company in 1983 to Erlanger, Kentucky. With the Erlanger plant reaching capacity by 1987, Millburn moved the operations to the Covington plant's 60000 sq ft building.

40|$|Brooklyn's {{urban fabric}} is a {{redundant}} array of perimeter residential blocks, built {{out over the}} last 200 years as a layered accretion. Within each block is a core that is spatially unified yet distinct from the public front of the street. These spaces are defined by their enclosure yet this barrier is not entirely impenetrable. Each block possesses a few unique moments of slippage in which the perimeter mass opens up to reveal a slivered view into the depths, and potentials, of this internalized world. To the vast majority, including residents, these slivers and cores remain a visual phenomenon. The near-universal practice of extruding backyard parcel lines has created an architecture of <b>division,</b> namely the <b>fence,</b> closing off the yard from the block and the block from the neighborhood. This thesis proposes an alternative scenario, in which rear fences are removed and a thin line of public space is inserted into the mosaic of existing yards. The line, activated {{through a set of}} calibrated relationships with the ground and floating infrastructure, stitches together people within the open core and works against the detritus of old divisions. Through this intervention, a new grain emerges which connects Brooklyn's blocks and transforms the residual slivers into a network of spaces that open to an engaging, and unexpected, rendering of the pre-existing. by David Miranowski.

In the distance, too, in {{the direction in which}} Rollo pointed, lay the town of Cologne. The roofs of the houses extended over a very wide area, and among them there was seen a dark square tower, very high, and crowned, as Rollo had said, with {{what seemed to be a}} spire, only it was bent over half way; and there it lay at an angle at which no spire could possibly stand.|$|R
30|$|Since 2009 the sedentarisation {{efforts of}} the Chinese {{government}} have become highly visible on the grassland area of Amdo, a Tibetan region in western China. However, the settling process is not an innovation, since it was started some decades ago, with the central Government interfering in the traditional way of nomadic life, trying to re-educate the nomads (Gruschke, 2006). After {{the collapse of the}} communes in 1981, new measures were taken to facilitate the sedentarisation of Tibetan nomads. An important step was the land distribution to single households within the Household Responsibility System during the decollectivisation period of the 1980 s. With each household gaining use rights for its part of pastureland, fences had to be introduced to reduce quarrels concerning property matters (Yeh 2003). Additionally, the <b>fences</b> demarcated the <b>division</b> of the grassland. With defined winter grassland property it was easier for the nomads to raise permanent houses. This was strongly supported by the government through the Project to increase living comfort (Chin: 温饱工程 wenbao gongcheng) introduced in 1978 and the Four completions project (Chin: 四配套 sipeitao) of the 1990 s (ADGM II 1994). The regulations of these projects were similar to the recent Nomadic settlement project and already included governmental support to erect fences, plant grass, and construct permanent houses and animal sheds at the winter pasture of each household (ADGM III 2003).|$|R

Research {{carried out}} in 2005 in the Rector’s Palace {{on the island of}} Lopud {{resulted}} in two kinds of finds. One clarified the function and appearance of the rooms of this monument {{in the second half of}} the 15 th century and proved to be important for the renovation. The second set of finds, however, can be considered completely unexpected, relating to the manner of construction, the preparation of the ground and the way the rooms are equipped technologically. Here it is not the stone furniture or installations that are meant. Almost nothing of these finds can be renovated and restored to its function, but is of great importance for knowledge of the conditions of housing at that time. By referring to the notes in little known fragments from the writings of the greatest treatise writers of the time it has been shown that the camino and necessario together with all the outlet ducts (chimneys and channels) are topics that they found engrossing. The typological particularity of the Lopud Rector’s Palace derives from the combination of the two essentially different functions – residential and public. However, of all the seats of government in the extra-urban area of Dubrovnik, this is the best example of the creation of a grand building for public use by the adoption of the typological and architectural features of country villa architecture. The characteristic L-shaped ground plan created by a two storey house and wing with terrace, the disposition of the developed parts within the <b>fenced</b> plot and the <b>division</b> of the <b>fenced</b> garden into two parts (including the courtyard), the link of the hall with the terrace in front of the façade and with the garden behind are all marks of many of the Dubrovnik villas. But while the villas, almost without exception, have a standard floor plan on both ground floor and first floor – a central hall and two rooms on each side, in the Lopud Rector’s Palace there was a deviation from this kind of plan. In the ground floor the deployment of the rooms and their apertures in shape and size is subordinated to function. But on the first floor it is very different: in that part of the façade that is visible in the full height, the fenestration is symmetrical, irrespective of the asymmetrical arrangement of the rooms. Here prevailed, clearly, the aspiration to mark the piano nobile by the regular distribution of windows. On the façade, then, the apertures of the ground floor and the upstairs do not correspond along the vertical axes. This prompts the conclusion that some of the elements in the organisation of the space and the fenestration – in spite of the stylistic forms of architectural decoration – reveal a stronger connection with Gothic than with Renaissance architecture. The interweaving of Gothic and Renaissance elements can be followed in the Lopud palace in the spatial division, in the distribution of apertures on the facades, and also in the parallel appearance of windows in both one and the other style. What is more, here it is shown that in spite of the increasingly marked penetration of Renaissance forms, the traditional Gothic shapes were still preferred, and considered a mark of refinement, particularly where the exterior is concerned. For this reason on the front elevation, which can be seen from a distance and from all around, there are only Gothic apertures, while the Renaissance windows are placed on the subsidiary lateral elevations visible only from the garden. The time of the creation of the Rector’s Palace on Lopud was determined by some characteristics of the architecture and some stylistically formed elements of its stone furnishing. And while on the fireplace and all the wall wardrobes in the rooms, in the private areas, that is, Renaissance forms prevail, in the grandest public room in the hall on the top floor the most important decorative element, the large wall wash basin, the Gothic type of framework remains, decorated with Renaissance motifs. Irrespective of such combinations of two styles corresponding to a fairly broad time span, it is certain that a decision to build the Rector’s Palace on Lopud could have occurred only after 1447; the upper limit for the building can be placed in the 1470 s. Proof of this kind of dating can be found in Lopud itself. In its own Lopud surrounds, the Rector’s Palace remained a supreme achievement. The example would be followed in various ways, but it would have been hard for the forms of the two styles to be so logically and properly combined at all levels anywhere else. In the quality of its architecture the Rector’s Palace on Lopud should call to mind numerous still unexplored and undiscovered houses, palaces and mansions that with the loss of their original function are gradually disappearing, while at the same time, outside this country, increasing attention is being devoted to the history of residential architecture...|$|R
