25|$|According to the Cornerstone exposé, Rivera had a 'history {{of legal}} entanglements' {{including}} fraud, credit card theft, and writing bad checks. Warrants had been issued {{for his arrest}} in New Jersey and Florida, and he was wanted by the Spanish police for 'swindles and cheats'. While in the U.S. in 1967, he claimed to be collecting money for a Spanish college, which never received this money. The details of his religious claims changed over time. For example, in 1964 he claimed that {{he had left the}} Catholic Church in July 1952. Rivera later put the date at March 20, 1967 - an almost 15 year discrepancy. Despite this second claim of conversion from Catholicism in March 1967, Rivera was still promoting Catholicism in a newspaper interview of August that same year. Although supposedly placed involuntarily in the sanatorium where he claimed to have nearly been murdered in 1965 and held there for three months, he gave the date of his release as September 1967. This leaves a period of more than a year unaccounted for <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> narrative.|$|E
2500|$|Taking up {{the study}} of the Qabalah and the {{writings}} of the notorious early 20th-century occultist Aleister Crowley, Moore accepted ideas from Crowley's religion, Thelema, about True Will being connected to the will of the pantheistic universe. In some of his earlier magical rituals, he used mind-altering psychedelic drugs but later gave this up, believing that they were unnecessary, and stated, [...] "It's frightening. You call out the names <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> incomprehensible language, and you're looking into the glass and there appears to be this little man talking to you. It just works." ...|$|E
2500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{production}} features {{a dark and}} intricately [...] "detailed sonic landscape", as Amos put it. Of the trip-hop and electronic influences on the album, the artist stated: [...] "I want to make audio mescaline", referring to the hallucinogenic, LSD-like drug. PopMatters reflected that the album's sound [...] "is like the electronic experiments of From the Choirgirl Hotel crossed with film noir". On developing the sound {{of one of the}} songs and of the album in general, Amos declared, [...] "It became much more of a technology experiment [...] the piano being there but <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dragoș Ungureanu, a {{specialist}} at the National Patrimony Institute, makes [...] "a clear distinction between the holiness status of Prince Brâncoveanu and the same quality of some European monarchs who haven’t suffered a martyr's death. Brâncoveanu was canonized for his and his sons' martyrdom, just like the Christians martyrdom in ancient Rome, killed for their faith in Christ. And just like other Christian martyrs, Brâncoveanu {{had to choose between}} his and his sons' death and the denial of Christ, (in their case, by converting to Islam). His character, the nature of his relations with the others, the unexpected events of life brought, against his will, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>strange,</b> even shocking situation for the year 1714." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Tom Brown's Schooldays and Harry Potter involve {{an average}} eleven-year-old, better at sport than {{academic}} study, who {{is sent to}} boarding school. Upon arrival, the boy gains a best friend (in Tom's case, East, in Harry's case, Ron Weasley) who helps him adjust to the new environment. They are set upon by an arrogant bully – in Tom Brown's case, Flashman, in Harry's case Draco Malfoy. Stephen Fry, who both narrates the British audio adaptations of the Harry Potter novels and has starred in a screen adaptation of Tom Brown, has commented many times about {{the similarities between the}} two books. [...] "Harry Potter – a boy who arrives <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> school to board {{for the first time and}} makes good, solid friends and also enemies who use bullying and unfair tactics", notes Fry, [...] "then is ambiguous about whether or not he is going to be good or bad. His pluck and his endeavour, loyalty, good nature and bravery are the things that carry him through – and that is the story of Tom Brown's Schooldays".|$|E
60|$|The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow didn't {{mind the}} dark at all, but Woot the Wanderer felt worried {{to be left}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> place <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> manner, {{without being able to}} see any danger that might threaten.|$|E

60|$|Now I {{reflected}} {{that there could}} be little harm <b>in</b> repeating to <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> doctor what so many already knew. So I told him everything, and the tale was long.|$|R
