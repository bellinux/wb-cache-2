40|$|Recently, a lot {{of single}} <b>stage</b> <b>detectors</b> using multi-scale {{features}} have been actively proposed. They are much faster than two <b>stage</b> <b>detectors</b> that use region proposal networks (RPN) without much degradation in the detection performances. However, the feature maps in the lower layers close to the input which are responsible for detecting small objects in a single <b>stage</b> <b>detector</b> have a problem of insufficient representation power because they are too shallow. There is also a structural contradiction that the feature maps have to deliver low-level information to next layers as well as contain high-level abstraction for prediction. In this paper, we propose a method to enrich the representation power of feature maps using Resblock and deconvolution layers. In addition, a unified prediction module is applied to generalize output results and boost earlier layers' representation power for prediction. The proposed method enables more precise prediction, which achieved higher score than SSD on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

To {{take full advantage of}} the very low internal grid-anode capacitance, the valve must be used in circuits in which the shielding between anode and grid is continued externally. In the case illustrated (S625), the valve was intended to be inserted into a hole in an external, grounded, sheet-metal shield aligned to correspond with the position of the internal screen-grid.

The Greinacher circuit is also commonly known as the half-wave voltage doubler.This circuit was first invented by Heinrich Greinacher in 1913 (published 1914) to provide the 200-300 V he needed for his newly invented ionometer, the 110 V AC supplied by the Zurich power stations of the time being insufficient. [...] He later extended this idea into a cascade of multipliers in 1920. [...] This cascade of Greinacher cells is often inaccurately referred to as a Villard cascade. It is also called a Cockcroft-Walton multiplier after the particle accelerator machine built by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, who independently discovered the circuit in 1932. The concept in this topology can be extended to a voltage quadrupler circuit by using two Greinacher cells of opposite polarities driven from the same AC source. The output is taken across the two individual outputs. As with a bridge circuit, it is impossible to simultaneously ground the input and output of this circuit.|$|E

30|$|Once all {{the shots}} are scored, the event <b>detector</b> <b>stage</b> is initiated. Here {{the aim is}} to choose the final shots that will produce the video {{sequence}} of soccer highlights. In order to do so this stage takes into account the user’s preferences about the summary. The user can specify in advance the length of the summary and also the percentage of appearance of each one of the advanced filters. As an example, the user could select a summary of 3  min where 50 % of the time is dedicated to goals, 30 % to important game moments, 10 % to goal-celebrations and 10 % to faults. The shot selection algorithm gathers the shots with the highest local scores for each one of the advanced filters, sorts them by their global scores and finally selects a number of shots till the desired duration is achieved. One problem that commonly arises is that there are too few shots for a specific advanced filter. In this case the system equally distributes the missing duration within the remaining advanced filters.|$|E
