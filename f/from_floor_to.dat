25|$|The spatial diagram {{created by}} TtEias (1979) {{is very similar}} to the sense of space and {{movement}} created in her earlier Tecelares series woodprints. Like Tecelares, the lines of TtEias (1979)are made with simple materials, include geometric shapes, and create movement through the intersection of lines and the creation of space. So too, there is a human element in the use of materials and the production of the work, in which each thread is pulled taut <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling by hand.|$|E
25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich wood grain trim <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling, with a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E

The Main Library located near Central Park in downtown opened in 2006 after residents passed a $30 million bond measure. Upon opening, the three story 93,000 square foot building earned numerous design awards and was LEED certified NC Gold. Windows <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling provide abundant natural light inside. It is modeled after a retail bookstore and is technologically advanced.|$|E

With these products performing at equal to or even better than conventional hardwoods, coconut timber represents a viable substitute for endangered hardwoods from an ecologically-sound source.|$|R

25|$|Circles and squares {{form the}} unifying theme of the {{interior}} design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of the interior, <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling, is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not line up. The overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance {{has not always been}} appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{interventions}} {{within the}} buildings allow constant interaction between patrons {{and the outer}} environment. <b>From</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying shadows on the interior.|$|E
25|$|Of all of Pape's works, TtEias (1979) {{is perhaps}} most emblematic of her artistic process. The TtEias was first {{conceived}} in 1979, {{but it was not}} until the 1990s that it was produced in full scale. The artwork consists of nine semi-transparent prisms, which were created using gold thread. A square platform drilled with nails serves as the base of each prism. The gold thread is then wrapped around each protruding nail, <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling, to create the prism. Light is shined onto the prisms at various angles, emphasizing the metallic sheen of the thread. The exhibition space is otherwise dark, giving the allusion that the prisms continue infinitely upwards.|$|E

25|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the road is Crannagh Park and Road, Rathfarnham Park and Ballytore Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named Tower Court in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of Lord Ely's occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> roof with holes for the pigeons. A floor of more recent date has been inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground floor}} {{consists}} of one open space with access {{provided by a}} series of recent aluminium-framed doors with fixed glass panels in between. Stairs lead up to the first floor {{at each end of the}} building. These stairs incorporate heavy timber treads and fine steel sections, which run vertically <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling and act as a screen and a support for the balustrade. The end of one of the staircases is expressed to form a decorative zigzag pattern. The first floor ceiling lining follows the zigzag line of the roof, exposing the steel roof structure. This floor contains the original steel framed hopper windows and fixed glass panels along the south wall. The flooring is of mixed hardwood. An elevated link joins this building to the neighbouring Commerce Building and Meat Hall.|$|E
25|$|RIMAC Arena is {{the name}} {{used to refer to}} the 186,000 square foot {{building}} that houses both the home arena of the Tritons and the adjacent auxiliary gym. The 44,000 square foot arena itself stands 52 feet tall (45 feet <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> rafters) and contains six dressing rooms and a 60-by-40-foot-stage, among other facilities. It seats 4,200 spectators in the bleachers for Triton basketball and volleyball home games, expandable to 5,000 through the use of floor seats for concerts. Curtains can divide the facility into five basketball courts that use Robbins Bio-Cushion I flooring. The floor space can also be used for conventions, concerts, trade shows, and other events. In the past, it has hosted training camps for the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Clippers, and Sacramento Kings. Since 2011, concerts have been exclusively booked by Nederlander Concerts.|$|E
50|$|By 1972, {{the clean}} and press was {{discontinued}} because athletes started to push with legs and bend backwards instead of strictly pressing the weight overhead, and this left the sole elements {{of what is}} today's modern Olympic weightlifting programme - the snatch and the clean and jerk. The snatch consists of lifting the barbell <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> an overhead position in one fluid motion. It is a very precise lift that can be nullified {{by a lack of}} balance of the athlete. The clean and jerk consists of moving the barbell <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> overhead in 2 movements: <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the shoulders, and from the shoulders to overhead.|$|R

500|$|In March 1904 {{a three-day}} festival of Elgar's works was {{presented}} at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, [...] "Four {{or five years ago}} if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his mind." [...] The king and queen attended the first concert, at which Richter conducted The Dream of Gerontius, and returned the next evening for the second, the London premiere of The Apostles (first heard the previous year at the Birmingham Festival). The final concert of the festival, conducted by Elgar, was primarily orchestral, apart for an excerpt from Caractacus and the complete Sea Pictures (sung by Clara Butt). The orchestral items were Froissart, the Enigma Variations, Cockaigne, the first two (at that time the only two) Pomp and Circumstance marches, and the premiere of a new orchestral work, In the South, inspired by a holiday in Italy.|$|E
500|$|Inside the house, the Palladian form {{reaches a}} height and {{grandeur}} seldom seen {{in any other}} house in England. It has, in fact, been described as [...] "The finest Palladian interior in England." [...] The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for [...] "the eloquence of a plain surface". Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster reredos. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink Derbyshire alabaster), modelled by Kent on a Roman basilica. The room is over 50feet (15m) <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> ceiling and {{is dominated by the}} broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or peristyle: here alabaster Ionic columns support the coffered, gilded ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities.|$|E
