25|$|Since {{marriage}} is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable,</b> {{whether he or she}} is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to zina, or adultery.|$|E
25|$|Defensive players may {{no longer}} lead with the head or use the head as the primary contact point to hit a passer. Ducking the head and {{launching}} at a passer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable.</b> In the 2006 season, Spergon Wynn {{was the victim of}} such a hit at the hands of Scott Schultz. There was no penalty on the play, although Schultz was subsequently fined.|$|E

25|$|Several {{manufacturers}} have made deliberately incompatible variants for use where connection with standard plugs <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable.</b> Common uses include filtered supplies for computer equipment and cleaners' supplies in public buildings and areas (to prevent visitors plugging in unauthorised equipment). Examples are one design made by MK {{which has a}} T-shaped earth pin, and the Walsall Gauge 13A plug, which has each pin rotated 90°, the latter being in use on parts of the London Underground for 110V AC supply. and also in some British Rail offices for filtered computer supplies.|$|E
25|$|When the Committee {{releases}} {{its view}} (or decision) it will outline {{the merits of}} the case or the reasons why it did or did not find that a violation had taken place. It will also include any conclusions drawn by Members whose findings differed from those of the Committee generally. This will be decided on the facts presented in the original complaint as well as taking into account the laws of the State party in conjunction with the rights contained in the ICCPR. If the State had made a reservation to the right in question when acceding to the ICCPR then generally the Committee will respect this, however, in some exceptional cases, they can {{come to the conclusion that}} the reservation itself <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In his 1799 {{doctorate}} in absentia, A new {{proof of the}} theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of {{the first or second}} degree, Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Mathematicians including Jean le Rond d'Alembert had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable,</b> owing to implicit use of the Jordan curve theorem. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.|$|E
50|$|Some out {{of wedlock}} births are intended, but many are unintentional. Out of wedlock births <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to society, and they often result in single parenting. A partner may also leave {{as he or she}} may want to shirk {{responsibility}} of bringing up the child. This also may result in a negative impact on the child. Where they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable,</b> they sometimes result in forced marriage, however such marriages fail more often than others.|$|R

25|$|A fiduciary's duty {{must not}} {{conflict}} with another fiduciary duty. Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when {{a lawyer or}} an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, {{and the interests of}} those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.|$|E
500|$|The epistolary Satirical Letter of Papyrus Anastasi I written {{during the}} Nineteenth dynasty was a {{pedagogical}} and didactic text copied on numerous ostraca by schoolboys. Wente describes the versatility of this epistle, which contained [...] "...proper greetings with wishes for this {{life and the}} next, the rhetoric composition, interpretation of aphorisms in wisdom literature, application of mathematics to engineering problems and the calculation of supplies for an army, and the geography of western Asia". Moreover, Wente calls this a [...] "...polemical tractate" [...] that counsels against the rote, mechanical learning of terms for places, professions, and things; for example, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to know just the place names of western Asia, but also important details about its topography and routes. To enhance the teaching, the text employs sarcasm and irony.|$|E
500|$|In England, Griffith {{responded that}} the tour would be {{cancelled}} were D'Oliveira {{not allowed to}} play, {{and that he was}} in the team on merit having missed selection first time around by [...] "a bee's whisker". Cowdrey, meanwhile, proposed flying to South Africa himself to safeguard the tour but the South African minister Ben Schoeman said that D'Oliveira had been chosen because of politics and that South Africa would make no deal to let him play. Coy and Cheetham flew secretly to London to try to find a compromise. They held a four-hour meeting with the MCC committee on 24 September, directly after which the committee announced that [...] "the side selected to represent MCC in South Africa <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> for reasons beyond the control of the SACA. The MCC committee therefore decided unanimously that the tour will not take place." [...] Williams argues that the delay in cancelling the tour suggests that some in the MCC might still have hoped to find common ground with the South Africans. D'Oliveira briefly considered withdrawing from the team to save the series, but decided not to.|$|E
