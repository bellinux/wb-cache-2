5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the <b>key</b> <b>system</b> of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the <b>key</b> <b>system</b> that is now used for the transverse flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that <b>key</b> <b>system</b> because {{it was based on}} that used for flute.|$|E
5|$|The current Boehm <b>key</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key {{just above the}} thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb. Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key {{at the side of}} the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the <b>Key</b> <b>System.</b> This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower {{deck of the}} Bay Bridge, but the system was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E

50|$|Two lesser-known <b>key</b> <b>systems</b> {{were used}} at {{airports}} for {{air traffic control}} communications, the 102 and 302 <b>key</b> <b>systems.</b> These were uniquely designed for communications between the air traffic control tower and radar approach control (RAPCON) or ground control approach (GCA), and included radio line connections.|$|R
5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual <b>key</b> <b>system,</b> one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Following the Great Crash of 1929, {{a holding}} company called the Railway Equipment & Realty Co. was created, with the {{subsidiary}} <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> Ltd running the commuter trains. In 1938, the name became the <b>Key</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
25|$|The A, B, C, E and F {{lines were}} the last <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> rail lines. Train service ended on April 20, 1958, {{replaced}} by buses using the same letter designations. AC Transit preserved the letter-designated routes when it took over the <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> two years later, and are still in use; AC Transit's B, C, E, F, G and H lines follow roughly the corresponding Key routes and neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Key</b> <b>System's</b> famed {{commuter}} train system was dismantled in 1958 {{after many years}} of declining ridership as well by the corrupt monopolistic efforts of National City Lines. The last run was on April 20, 1958. In 1960, the newly formed publicly owned AC Transit took over the <b>Key</b> <b>System's</b> facilities.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Key</b> <b>System's</b> first trains were {{composed}} of standard wooden railroad passenger cars, complete with clerestory roofs. Atop each of these, {{a pair of}} pantographs, invented and manufactured by the <b>Key</b> <b>System's</b> own shops, were installed to collect current from overhead wires to power a pair of electric motors on each car, one on each truck (bogie).|$|R

40|$|In case we use {{a quantum}} computer, we have to {{construct}} the countermeasure. Due to the high efficiency and fast computation time, the multivariate quadratic public <b>key</b> <b>systems</b> are considered {{as an alternative to}} RSA or ECC based systems. However, the large key size is a fatal disadvantage of the multivariate quadratic public <b>key</b> <b>systems.</b> For this reason, the multivariate quadratic public <b>key</b> <b>systems</b> are not widely used. In this paper, we measure how much the private key memory size can be reduced by using a secure pseudo-random number generator in the UOV scheme. Almost 93 % of the private key memory size is reduced...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Key</b> <b>System,</b> a {{local transit}} company, {{acquired}} the general {{offices of the}} California and Nevada {{as well as their}} nascent pier into San Francisco Bay, which was quickly transformed into a long pier reaching nearly to Yerba Buena Island. The <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> established its main rail yard adjacent to the yard of the Santa Fe in a large tract west of San Pablo Avenue in the vicinity of Yerba Buena Avenue (so named because the island was visible in line with the thoroughfare). The Key System's main power plant, used to energize its streetcars and commuter trains, was constructed adjacent to the city limits with Oakland. The immense smokestack was a local landmark for decades, surviving right through the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. It was demolished for safety reasons shortly thereafter. The old <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> mainline to the pier, and later, to the Bay Bridge, ran in a subway below Beach Street and the Southern Pacific mainline near the power plant. That subway survives and is today used as a private entrance to the main sewage treatment plant of East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD, the water utility serving Oakland and many surrounding cities). The rail yards and shops of the <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> and Santa Fe were acquired by Santa Fe's real estate development arm, later known as the Catellus Development Corporation, and this firm proceeded to develop the site into a shopping center and multiunit residential district which remains there today.|$|E

50|$|Intensive care {{usually takes}} a system by system {{approach}} to treatment, {{rather than the}} SOAP (subjective, objective, analysis, plan) approach of high dependency care. The nine <b>key</b> <b>systems</b> (see below) are each considered on an observation-intervention-impression basis to produce a daily plan. As well as the <b>key</b> <b>systems,</b> intensive care treatment raises other issues including psychological health, pressure points, mobilisation and physiotherapy, and secondary infections.|$|R

25|$|The Eastshore and Suburban Railway (E) was a {{formerly}} independent {{unit of the}} <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> {{which ran}} streetcar trains in Richmond, San Pablo, and El Cerrito.

They all provide a comprehensive introduction to the issues faced by designers of robust cryptographic devices and to the currently available methodologies and techniques for protecting these devices against fault injection attacks. The papers are organized in topical sections on attacks on public <b>key</b> <b>systems,</b> protection of public <b>key</b> <b>systems,</b> attacks on and protection of symmetric <b>key</b> <b>systems,</b> models for fault attacks on cryptographic devices, fault-resistant arithmetic for cryptography, as well as fault attacks and other security threats...|$|R
