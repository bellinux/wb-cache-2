Large fiscal financing needs, both in advanced and emerging market economies, have often been met by borrowing heavily from domestic banks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an index of the fiscal stance {{suitable}} for practical use in short-term policy making. The index {{is based on a}} comparison of a target level of the debt-GDP ratio for a given finite horizon with a forecast of the debt-GDP ratio based on a VAR formed from the government budget constraint. This approach to measuring the fiscal stance is different from the literature on fiscal sustainability. We emphasise the importance of having a forward-looking measure of the fiscal stance for the immediate future rather than a test for fiscal sustainability that is backward-looking, or based just on past behaviour which may not be closely related to the current fiscal position. We use our methodology to construct a time series of the indices of the fiscal stances of the US, the UK and Germany over the last 25 or more years. We find that both the US and UK fiscal stances have deteriorated considerably since 2000 and Germany's has been steadily deteriorating since unification in 1989, and worsened again on joining EMU.

40|$|The basic aim of {{this article}} is to {{consider}} the effect of the current financial crisis on the movements and sustainability of the public debt in the period up to 2013. It is shown that changes in the public debt come from the effect of the primary deficit created, stockflow adjustment, the real growth of the GDP and real interest rates. On the basis of results of the European Communities (2009) a statistical estimate is given of the trends in the primary deficit for EU- 12, after which the model is adjusted to Croatian figures. The projection of stock-flow adjustment is undertaken from a projection of the primary deficit, due to the relatively strong negative correlation between those two variables in the past, whilst the projection of the real growth rate of the GDP and real interest rates is significantly simplified. The main hypothesis tested is that the ratio of the public debt in the GDP up to 2013 does not exceed the margin of sustainability prescribed in the Maastricht criterion of 60 %, which is finally confirmed by this analysis.
