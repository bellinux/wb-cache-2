5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> {{was taking}} place in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially {{prohibited}} the use of dogs or hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> is still practised and popular. <b>Hare</b> <b>coursing</b> in Portugal is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as lebre a corricão. <b>Hare</b> <b>coursing</b> in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, the <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> is open coursing, and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. <b>Hare</b> <b>coursing</b> also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E
5|$|Lure {{coursing}} is a {{sport for}} dogs based on <b>hare</b> <b>coursing,</b> but involving dogs chasing a mechanically operated lure. Some critics of <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> suggest that coursers could test their dogs through lure coursing. However, coursers believe that, while lure coursing is good athletic exercise for their dogs, {{it does not}} approximate the testing vigour and sport of live coursing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hare</b> <b>coursing</b> is {{the pursuit}} of hares with greyhounds and other sighthounds, which chase the hare by sight and not by scent.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} <b>hares</b> killed in <b>coursing</b> is unclear. The UK government's Burns Inquiry which {{submitted}} its final report in 2000 {{said that about}} 250hares were killed each year in formal coursing. although much larger numbers of kills are believed {{to take place in}} informal coursing. [...] The UK National Coursing Club and the organisers of the now defunct Waterloo Cup said that, on average, one in seven or eight <b>hares</b> <b>coursed</b> were killed. Inspectors from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals who attended the event estimated that a greater number, one in five <b>hares</b> <b>coursed,</b> were killed.|$|R

5|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> incidents had fallen by approximately 78 per cent across Suffolk since the re-launch of an operation against coursing in September 2013.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, {{coursing}} {{crossed the}} class divide, and {{reached its peak}} of popularity, with more than 150coursing clubs in Britain, some attracting up to 80,000 people. By the late 19th century, <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> had become a predominantly working class sport.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hare</b> <b>coursing</b> {{is popular}} in the Republic of Ireland, with the {{national}} meeting in Clonmel, County Tipperary, being the most important event in the coursing calendar, attracting 10,000spectators, and claimed by its organisers to be worth up to €16million for the local economy. There are around 70formal coursing clubs in the Republic and two in Northern Ireland, together holding 80–85 meetings per year.|$|E
500|$|In early 2006, the TV channel ABC 7 {{showed a}} film of {{coursing}} with sets of three greyhounds competing in the chase {{of a number of}} <b>hares.</b> <b>Coursing</b> was banned in the County concerned, and California Assemblywoman Loni Hancock promoted a bill, AB2110, to make it a crime for any person in California to engage in open field coursing – defined as a [...] "competition in which dogs are, by the use of rabbits, hares, or foxes, assessed as to skill in hunting live rabbits, hares, or foxes". A pro-coursing campaign was also established. The Bill was passed by the Public Safety Committee but did not become law.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for <b>hares.</b> Opponents of <b>coursing</b> say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than <b>hares</b> living where <b>coursing</b> takes place. It is also the case that <b>coursing</b> kills slower <b>hares,</b> and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|R
60|$|But Wapoota did {{not feel}} quite so easy, for in their mad race they had outstripped the flying enemy, bands of whom were {{constantly}} passing them in their flight before the Mountain-men. His anxieties, however, were groundless, for no sooner did any of the Raturans set eyes on Zeppa, than, with howls of consternation, they diverged at a tangent like hunted <b>hares,</b> and <b>coursed</b> away homeward {{on the wings of}} terror.|$|R
5|$|In {{the context}} of open (not park) coursing, the (British) National Coursing Club {{evidence}} to the Burns Inquiry said that muzzled coursing can cause more suffering than unmuzzled if the coursing officials {{are not able to}} reach injured hares quickly. The Irish Council Against Bloodsports, an organisation that campaigns against <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> has video evidence that shows this happening, even in enclosed coursing.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> has only recently, in historical terms, been debated in Parliament, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from the cruelty legislation, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, for animals released for coursing. Eric Heffer, MP for Liverpool Walton, {{was a major}} opponent of coursing in the late 1960s, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson joined in the criticism.|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> {{is practiced}} using {{a number of}} sighthounds: mainly greyhounds but also Borzois, Salukis, Whippets, and Deerhounds that are {{registered}} with a governing body such as the National Coursing Club or Kennel Club in Great Britain, the Irish Coursing Club, or the National Open Field Coursing Association (NOFCA) in the US. Events are conducted through local coursing clubs which are regulated by their governing body. The objective of legal formal coursing is to test and judge the athletic ability of the dogs rather than to kill the hare.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{repetition}} of unpleasant experiences in analysis could be considered 'unpleasure for one system [...] and simultaneously satisfaction for the other [...] [...] In the second edition of 1921, he extended the point, stating explicitly that transference repetitions <b>'are</b> of <b>course</b> the activities of instincts intended to lead to satisfaction; but no lesson has been learnt from the old experience of these activities having led only to unpleasure'.|$|R
5000|$|According to an Ipsos MORI poll, the {{majority}} of the British public remain in favour of keeping a number of activities banned by the Hunting Act 2004 illegal: fox hunting (80%); deer hunting (86%); <b>hare</b> hunting and <b>coursing</b> (88%); dog fighting (98%); and badger baiting (95%).|$|R
50|$|Two {{fragments}} of a 14th-century grave stone {{are attached to}} the inner wall of the porch depicting a <b>coursing</b> <b>hare</b> and Lombardic lettering possibly relating to the legend of Melangell, which some antiquaries have tried to connect with the hare iconography seen at Pennant Melangell, which once received the tithes of the township of Bryn.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{documented}} {{description of}} <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> {{is the work}} known in English as On Coursing. It was written by Arrian a Greek historian of the Roman period, circa 180AD and is known in Anicent Greek as Kynegetikos and in Latin as Cynegeticus. Arrian felt compelled to describe the sight hunt and sighthounds because the Ancient Greeks only knew the scent hunt; On Coursing complements Xenophon's classic work on that subject, Cynegeticus (On Hunting). William Dansey, an English clergyman, translated On Coursing in 1831.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} <b>hare</b> <b>coursing.</b> Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{coursing}} {{has taken}} place in Northern Ireland since 2002, as Ministers have refused the coursing clubs permission to net hares, and have protected them from being coursed or hunted under the Game Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act and in June 2010 the Northern Ireland Assembly voted to ban the practice. The two extant Northern Ireland coursing clubs since 2002 have travelled to the Republic to hold meetings jointly with coursing clubs there. Opinion polls commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports as part of its campaigning have shown very strong public opposition to <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> from both urban and rural residents of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland).|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next morning}} when little Mr. Mouse awoke, he {{discovered}} that in the night {{something had happened to}} his hind legs. They were very long and strong, regular jumping legs like those of Mr. <b>Hare.</b> Of <b>course</b> he was in such a great hurry to try them that he couldn't wait for his breakfast. He began by making little short hops, and {{in no time at all}} he was getting about splendidly. At last he got up his courage to try a long jump. Up in the air he shot, and then something happened. Yes, Sir, something happened. He couldn't kept his balance. He turned two or three somersaults and landed on his back.|$|R
50|$|The Geoscience Research Institute {{owes its}} {{existence}} to Adventist science {{teachers in the}} late 1950s who were concerned about a lack of Adventists credentialed in the Earth sciences. The church responded to their concerns in 1957 by forming the Committee on the Teaching of Geology and Paleontology, which selected biologist Frank Lewis Marsh and chemist P. Edgar <b>Hare</b> to inaugurate <b>courses</b> in those fields. The GRI was officially founded in 1958 and was originally located {{on the campus of}} Andrews University in Michigan.|$|R
50|$|The Hare Indian dog is an extinct domesticated canine; {{possibly}} a breed of domestic dog, coydog, or domesticated coyote; formerly found and originally bred in northern Canada by the <b>Hare</b> Indians for <b>coursing.</b> It had {{the speed and}} some characteristics of the coyote, but the domesticated temperament and other characteristics of a domestic dog. It gradually lost its usefulness as aboriginal hunting methods declined, and became extinct or lost its separate identity through interbreeding with dogs in the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{legality}} of <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> across the different {{states of the}} USA is not always clear. Animal Place, a California-based animal rights group which opposes coursing, claims that the activity is legal in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming but illegal in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin. The pro-coursing campaign, Stop2110 says that open field coursing is legal in all US states with a huntable population of jackrabbits. Washington state lists jackrabbits as a protected species, due to an unusually low population for a western state, and bans all forms of hunting them.|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> simply {{involved}} {{two dogs}} chasing a hare, the winner being the dog {{that caught the}} hare; this could be for sport, food or pest control. In order to indulge in the informal practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term lurchers) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for coursing, such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. Informal coursing has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or poaching, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised informal coursing with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.|$|E
5|$|The ballad Master McGrath {{concerns}} a greyhound {{of that name}} from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, {{referred to in the}} lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E
60|$|The sharp {{contrast}} between the snow and the black coat of the fox {{made it possible for}} Sparrer to follow the animal's movements at a distance which under ordinary conditions would have been impossible. He had turned and was working up wind, continually stopping to carefully test the light air in the hope of scenting a <b>hare.</b> His <b>course</b> was now directly away from Sparrer toward {{the lower end of the}} swamp. The boy could get only an occasional glimpse of him and presently lost him altogether. Once more bitter disappointment rankled in his heart. What should he do now? Should he remain where he was, or should he move on? How he wished that he knew more about hunting and the ways of animals, black foxes in particular. What would Pat do were he in his place? Would he give up? Somehow he couldn't picture Pat as giving up without further effort to capture so great a prize.|$|R
5000|$|Unarmed fox {{hunting on}} horseback with hounds {{is the type}} of hunting most closely {{associated}} with the United Kingdom; in fact, [...] "hunting" [...] without qualification implies fox hunting. What in other countries is called [...] "hunting" [...] is called [...] "shooting" [...] (birds) or [...] "stalking" [...] (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a <b>hare</b> in <b>coursing,</b> where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in <b>coursing</b> the <b>hare</b> (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.|$|R
60|$|He gave {{a cry of}} rage, {{and before}} I could retire to some safe entrenchment behind the table or the sofa, he was upon me like a mad dog. He had me by the throat, and I had rolled {{backwards}} down on to the floor, {{with him on the}} top of me, squeezing the breath out of me till I verily thought that my last hour had come. Estelle had run out of the room like a startled <b>hare.</b> This, of <b>course,</b> was in accordance with my instructions to her, but I could not help wishing then that she had been less obedient and somewhat more helpful.|$|R

25|$|There are now twenty {{licensed}} greyhound stadiums in Ireland. There are seventeen in the Republic {{where the}} licensing authority is Bord na gCon, the Irish Greyhound Board. This is a semi-state body and {{was established by}} the Irish government in 1958. The three stadiums in Northern Ireland are licensed by the Irish Coursing Club, which also organises <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> throughout the Island.|$|E
25|$|At this time, Heffer was {{a strong}} proponent of British {{membership}} of the EEC. He headed a study group established by the Society for Parliamentary Studies (a group for left-wing Labour MPs) to look into British relations with Europe, and demanded the resignation of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Fred Peart when Peart expressed doubts about {{the merits of the}} Common Agriculture Policy. At the 1967 Labour Party conference, Heffer argued for Britain in Europe to build up a third force in the world which would stand up to the USA and the Soviet Union. He also began a campaign to win a place on the National Executive Committee at this conference, standing again each year and steadily building his support. Another preoccupation which began at this time was the Waterloo Cup, a <b>hare</b> <b>coursing</b> event at Great Altcar near his constituency: he promoted unsuccessful Private Member's Bill to ban <b>hare</b> <b>coursing,</b> returning to the subject at intervals over the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} coursed on open land, the Irish form is {{run in a}} secure {{enclosure}} over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase the <b>hare.</b> After the <b>coursing</b> event, the <b>hares</b> are transported {{back to where they}} were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run with dogs winning points for their running and turning of the hare, the Republic of Ireland form is run on the basis that the first dog to turn the hare wins. This is denoted by either a red flag or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.|$|R
5|$|Whippet rags were {{a popular}} Sunday {{event in the}} north and Midlands at the time. There were also {{international}} events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney's Paddock, there were races of more than 300 whippets every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track. Eventually, the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who <b>coursed</b> <b>hare,</b> for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to greyhound races. Few of the Whippets of any of the four types were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races. Many racing dogs were part terrier, part Greyhound, or part Lurcher.|$|R
5000|$|The gods {{who listened}} on were cruel-hearted, {{and as a}} prank, {{instructed}} the hare to wash himself in the briny sea, and blow himself dry in the wind. The <b>hare</b> was of <b>course</b> in much more stinging pain than was before. Then came along Ōkuninushi lagging far behind. The gentle-hearted god told the hare {{to go to the}} mouth (of the river) and wash himself in the fresh water, then gather the flowering spikes of cattail plants growing all around, and scatter the catkins on the ground and tumble around until he is covered by fleece. The cured rabbit makes a divined prediction that Ōnamuji will be the one to win Princess Yakami, [...] "Though thou bearest the bag." [...] (Evidently his brother was treating him as a luggage carrier, and that was why he was outpaced {{by the rest of the}} group).|$|R
