Numerous empirical studies undertaken by academics and various public and private organizations have attempted to shed some light on this phenomenon. Research findings on disproportionate minority contact have hardly been uniform, leaving much of this practice unexplained. This study uses data obtained at the <b>detention</b> <b>decision</b> point over a three-year period examining variance in juvenile case processing related to race. Findings suggest that extra-legal factors influencing the decision to detain vary by race.

40|$|On {{each and}} {{every day of the year}} (excluding Sundays), {{children}} are presented for an initial hearing in the Family Division, Juvenile Branch of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Because of unusually broad and often misapplied preventive detention laws, children charged with property offenses such as theft, or status offenses such as truancy and ungovernability, are subject to detention for an indefinite period of time through summary procedures which do not adequately ensure the reliability of the <b>detention</b> <b>decision.</b> Because the detention of juveniles has become routine in superior court, its potential harm to the child is often easy to ignore. The child is deprived of liberty and of the home and family support system he or she has known. The injurious consequences of this confinement, such as stigmatization, negative self-labeling, and institutionalization have been well noted. In addition, detention increases the likelihood that the child will be committed if found delinquent. Given these grave consequences, detention should be used sparingly, and imposed through procedures which ensure the decision to detain will be a considered and reliable one. This article will examine the District of Columbia preventive detention statute and its application to the children appearing in Juvenile Court. Intended as an aid to counsel practicing in Juvenile Court, this article will describe the operation of the preventive detention law, highlight important issues in the detention process, and consider the viability of constitutional attacks upon the statute...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} use of social {{characteristics}} and legal factors as criteria in making decisions about the detention of juveniles prior to adjudication. This research is {{based on data from}} two metropolitan courts (Denver and Memphis) that differ in their orientation to juvenile justice as well as regional location. Exploiting Goodman's method of log linear analysis to uncover relationships among categorical variables we find: (1) the major determinants ofjuvenile detention or release (prior toadjudication) are present activity (whether a juvenile is conventionally active or idle), prior record, and the orientation to juvenile justice held by the court; (2) {{there is no evidence of}} direct race or social class bias in the detention decision; but (3) there is some evidence for what may be viewed as a sex bias in the treatment of female youths referred for decorum offenses andmales referred for property andviolent offenses. One of the most controversial, but seldom investigated, aspects of the juvenile justice process is the use of pre-adjudicatory detention. In the pre-adjudicatory detention process court officials determine whether a referred juvenile is to be placed in protective custody in a detention facility or jail, or released to the custody of parents or guardians pending disposi-tion of the case.

In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records.

On the facts of the case, the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held to fall outside the precedent fact category.

Similarly, the decision whether there was evidence to revoke an order under section 10 in the public interest had expressly been entrusted to the Minister by the Act. In addition, since the Court was of the view that the judicial process was not suitable for determining issues involving national security, it did not think that Parliament could have intended for a court of law to determine whether, on the evidence, a detainee was likely to pose a security risk.

40|$|Spending on U. S. incarceration has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the last several}} decades. Much of this cost is on incarcerating pretrial detainees—inmates not convicted of a crime—which constitute the majority of individuals in our nation’s jails. Current statutory schemes give judges almost complete discretion to order pretrial detention based on unexplained or unidentified factors. With this discretion, judges tend to make inconsistent decisions in every jurisdiction, some releasing almost all defendants—including the most dangerous—and others detaining most defendants—even those who are safe to release. There are constitutional and moral reasons to evaluate our current detention scheme, but even the fiscal impact of pretrial detention alone calls for an empirical analysis. Although legal scholarship has applied cost-benefit analysis to other areas of criminal law, this Article is the first attempt at conducting such analysis in the pretrial arena. This Article compares the risk posed by each defendant and the cost of any crimes they may potentially commit while released with the costs incurred by detaining these defendants.

50|$|The trials raise {{a series}} of fair trial {{concerns}} common to cases involving terrorism charges, including prolonged pre-trial detention and limitations on access by defendants and their lawyers to the evidence against them. Frequent use of arrests instead of judicial supervision, limited access to files, failure to give detailed grounds for <b>detention</b> <b>decisions</b> and revisions of such decisions highlight the need to bring the Turkish criminal justice system into line with international standards and to amend the anti-terror legislation. The detention of elected representatives {{is a challenge to}} local government and hampers dialogue on the Kurdish issue. The evidence against the defendants is largely based on wiretaps, surveillance of an office some of the accused frequented, intercepted email correspondence, and testimony from secret witnesses. However, there is scant evidence to suggest the defendants engaged in any acts that could be defined as terrorism as it is understood in international law. Prosecutions brought under anti-terrorism legislation have frequently been based on secret witness testimony that cannot be examined by defence lawyers. On 15 April 2011 the Joint Platform for Human Rights (formed by the Human Rights Association (HRA), the Association of Helsinki Citizens and the Turkish section of Amnesty International) issued a report on the trial in Diyarbakir.

The information gathered {{from the use of}} a detention-screening instrument {{can also be used to}} examine the extent to which extralegal factors such as gender, age, and race enter into <b>detention</b> <b>decisions.</b> Results indicate that detention screening is an effective mechanism for cen-sus management and that after controlling for legal factors, females are detained at a higher rate than males are and youth younger than 14 are detained at a higher rate than older youth are.

5000|$|The Crime Prevention Law (No. 7 of 1954) in Jordan authorizes {{administrative}} detention.

The law allows the detention of anyone [...] "about {{to commit a}} crime or to assist in its commission", people who [...] "'habitually' steal, shelter thieves, or fence stolen goods" [...] or anyone deemed to present [...] "a danger to the people" [...] if they are not detained. Although the Crime Prevention Law does not provide a legal basis for the use of administrative detention for [...] "protective custody", the law was routinely used until 2007 to detain women at risk of violence, honor killing by family members for example. The use of the law in this way has been criticized by the United Nations and Human Rights Watch. In 2007, the government opened the Wifaq Center for women at risk of violence, and in 2008, women who had been in protective custody were transferred from prison to the center, although the practice of sending women to prison for [...] "protective custody" [...] using the Crime Prevention Law has not completely ceased. Detained women cannot obtain their own release, the transfer must be approved by the family members who have threatened the women.

40|$|Past {{research}} has demonstrated that those arrested for drug crimes is not representative of drug use, suggesting that drug policy and enforcement is highly racialized and unequal. We know much less about where and how racial inequality is reproduced with{{in the criminal justice system}}, however. Focusing on racial inequality as both a total effect and as a process, I examine where and how racial inequality is cumulatively produced in the criminal justice system for drug defendants. Using data from state and federal courts, I examine this question through three primary analyses. First, I develop a measure of cumulative racial inequality for the court process and for sentencing outcomes to better understand the total effects of inequality. I also analyze the mechanisms of cumulative racial inequality in the state and federal court systems by examining disparities in court processing and outcome decisions while accounting for the effects of previous stages in later stages of the court process. Finally, I focus on a single city to examine how cumulative racial inequality operates in drug arrest patterns, court processes, and alternative to incarceration programs. I find that racial inequality may be difficult to detect by only examining outcomes at single stages of the process because disparities are often small at any individual stage, and because they occur mostly at early, less visible stages of the criminal justice process. Proactive policing drives much of the initial racial inequality through the use of geographically targeted arrests that focuses on nonwhite neighborhoods. Even before sentencing outcomes, the court process acts as a stratification mechanism in itself, where many mechanisms of inequality, including bail and pretrial <b>detention</b> <b>decisions,</b> occur in pre-sentencing stages. They also occur indirectly through factors such as criminal history which in itself is partially a function of previous criminal justice system contact...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how prosecutorial strategies affect pretrial decisions in U. S. terrorism trials and how pretrial decisions in turn affect the disposition of those trials. This research builds off of the work of Smith and Damphousse (1996) which compared terrorism indictees to traditional federal offenders. They found that the use of explicit politicality as a prosecution strategy was a significant predictor of both disposition and the sentence length in terrorism trials. This study focuses on the question of whether the use of an explicitly political prosecution strategy impacts pretrial decisions in terrorism cases and whether the pretrial decisions impact the guilty plea rates in those cases. This study addresses this issue through a structural-contextual theoretical framework by looking at the prosecutorial strategy of explicit politicality. The reason for this research is to see whether defendants in more heavily politicized cases are less likely to receive pretrial release and if the pretrial detention of the defendants affects the disposition of the trial. Using available data from the American Terrorism Study database, this study looks at data collected for 480 individuals indicted from the years 1980 - 2006 to investigate whether the prosecutorial strategy used had an effect on pretrial <b>detention</b> <b>decisions.</b> Rather than comparing terrorism indictees with traditional criminals, this study looks at indictees who have been indicted in federal terrorism trials, but were either prosecuted as traditional offenders or had their cases politicized by the prosecution. The study uses bivariate and multivariate analyses to measure the strength of the relationships between prosecution strategy, pretrial decisions, and trial disposition for both traditional and politicized terrorism trials. In regards to pretrial release, this analysis has shown that defendants with less than high school education are less likely to receive pretrial release and that crime severity and community ties have significant roles in pretrial bail decisions. Surprisingly, race was also significant with white defendants being less likely to be released on bail. However, failure to secure pretrial release was not found to have any significant relationship with case dispositions...|$|R

Certain {{questions about the}} effectiveness of an educational policy, program, or practice, ask researchers to make causal inferences under the following conditions: (1) random assignment is not practical or feasible; (2) assignment to the treatment condition is highly selective; (3) the assignment mechanism can vary across sites; and (4) the treatment effect can vary across students and sites. For example, school administrators might want to know whether an Advanced Placement curriculum affects student learning compared to the standard curriculum, or whether an out-of-school suspension affects subsequent student behavior differently than in-school <b>detention.</b> District <b>decision</b> makers might want to know whether a dropout prevention program keeps students in school, or whether grade retention improves long-term student outcomes. If researchers are asked to address these questions with pre-existing state or district data, they must confront the standard barriers to causal inferences that stem from a non-randomized design, and face further complication from the highly selective, and variable, nature by which students end up in the treatment condition.
