5|$|Work {{planned for}} 1985 {{included}} {{the replacement of}} the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails. The external walls of the mill were tarred and <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> plastered. Two work-ins were held, from 20 July to 28 July and 17 August to 26 August. Further work {{over the next two years}} saw the restoration completed in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Materials for {{building}} the Shrine were sourced from within Australia: the chosen building stone was granodiorite quarried from Tynong; the <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> use sandstone from Redesdale; {{and the black}} marble columns used stone from Buchan. This raised some concerns when redeveloping the Shrine, as the Tynong quarry {{was no longer in}} use, and it proved to be prohibitively expensive to reopen the site. Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone.|$|E

40|$|Wood {{construction}} presents numerous advantages on {{the environmental}} impact. Envelopes of wood frame houses already have air gaps. We wish to use them in systems aiming at to reduce the energy loads in winter and to improve the thermal comfort in summer. We so decided to couple a façade integrated solar air collector with a heavy and ventilated <b>internal</b> <b>wall.</b> The envelope of wood frame houses being light, {{it is possible to}} store solar energy in the <b>internal</b> <b>wall.</b> The <b>internal</b> <b>wall</b> justifies itself with regard to summer comfort as we considered it is important to increase the thermal inertia of the house in a sensitive way. Furthermore, the cooling of the house can be obtained thanks to a night-ventilation of the <b>internal</b> <b>wall.</b> 1...|$|R

25|$|The keep {{is divided}} {{internally}} {{by a wall}} running west to east. South of this wall {{on the ground floor}} is the hall, measuring 6m by 12m. The hall was accessed from the entrance lobby to the west, and was lit by three large windows. A fireplace stood in the <b>internal</b> <b>wall,</b> and a minstrel's gallery overlooks from the west wall. The hall ceiling was a stone vault, and the room fills the whole height of the keep. North of the <b>internal</b> <b>wall</b> was the kitchen, and a private room. Above these, within the height of the keep, were two additional rooms accessed from below. Another four rooms were located in the attic. The roof was a double gable, the central valley supported by the <b>internal</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R

5|$|Within {{a year of}} the enquiry, almost 100 cells {{had been}} {{enlarged}} by knocking down the inner wall between two cells, and a classification system was introduced. <b>Internal</b> <b>walls</b> were constructed in the main block, creating four separate divisions. Following the urgings of the prison Superintendent George and various official enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. Five spaces were designed for tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters.|$|E
5|$|In 1538, {{the current}} walls of Jerusalem were {{completed}} on {{the orders of}} Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. These walls, along with the <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> built by the Armenians, determined {{the outline of the}} quarter. In the 1562–63 record, only 189 Armenians were counted, whereas 640 were counted by the Ottomans in 1690, an increase of 239%. According to the chronicler Simeon Lehatsi only some twelve Armenian families lived in Jerusalem in 1615–16. The significant increase in the population in 1690 is attributed to urbanization experienced by the Armenians and other Christians. Thus Armenians came to make up 22.9% of Jerusalem's Christians by 1690, becoming the second largest Christian community.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle Prison, a former Australian prison in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a prison for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction. The design for Fremantle Prison {{was based on the}} Pentonville Prison in Britain, and it would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and was completed by the end of 1859. The prison was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally sentenced prisoners. Following a Royal Commission held in 1898−99, some changes were made to Fremantle Prison, including knocking down the inner wall between two cells, introducing a prisoner classification system, and constructing <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> in the main block to create four separate divisions. A new cell block, New Division, was completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of places of worship in Summer Hill. St Patrick's Catholic Church was built in 1874, and is the oldest known {{building}} in the suburb. There is also a small primary school associated with the church and located next to it. The building was originally a private home known as Kelvin Grove, and owned by Mrs Jane Drynan. Much of the exterior of the church is original but none of the <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> were retained when the building was converted into a church. Following Drynan's death, Kelvin Grove was owned or leased by a succession of different people, including the Haberfield real-estate developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s Kelvin Grove may have been used as a nursing home. The first mass was celebrated in Kelvin Grove on St Patrick's day 1946, giving the church its name.|$|E
25|$|Building No.7 is {{a larger}} {{pavilion}} which runs parallel to the John Reid Annexe. It is also of single-skin timber construction with chamferboard cladding. The southern side wall has diagonal timber lattice at the top, which has been covered in fibrous-cement sheeting. Some <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> have horizontal boarding. The gable roof is corrugated iron supported on hardwood rafters. A single line of square timber columns runs down {{the centre of the}} building. It has an early roof construction.|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{predicting}} the corrosion {{rates in the}} furnace <b>internal</b> <b>wall</b> tubes of the refinery boiler was resolved, using the first order differential equation derived from the material balance equation of the system. The mathematical model was able to predict the metal loss recorded by ultrasonic thickness scanning technique (UTS), and the results shows an agreement. The results from both the model and UTS shows that in the various tubes of the furnace, <b>internal</b> <b>wall</b> of the refinery boiler were between the same range. The percentage deviation which was calculated to ascertain the acceptability of the model result as compared to that from UTS proved that the model is effective. The inhibitor model result show that corrosion will drastically reduce {{in the presence of}} corrosion inhibitors under proper chemical treatment and management. The model developed can be used to monitor furnace <b>internal</b> <b>wall</b> corrosion even when the system is in operation by extrapolating the result to further years. ...|$|R

25|$|The Maltese temple {{complexes}} {{were built}} in different locations, and over a wide span of years; while each individual site has its unique characteristics, they all share a common architecture. The approach to the temples lies on an oval forecourt, levelled by terracing if the terrain is sloping. The forecourt is bounded on one side by the temples’ own façades, which faces south or south-east. The monuments’ façades and <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> {{are made up of}} orthostats, a row of large stone slabs laid on end.|$|E
25|$|Tired of {{administrative}} work, which kept {{him away from}} his research, Pegram asked Butler to relieve him {{of the position of}} dean in 1930. This request was accepted, in spite of Pegram's demonstrated ability as an administrator. His achievements included the construction of the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Pegram was intimately involved in its design, insisting on a structure without load bearing <b>internal</b> <b>walls,</b> so that it could be reconfigured over time, and with large two-storey lecture theatres. He attempted to expose his physics students to ideas from Europe, inviting Hendrik Lorentz, Larmor, Planck, Max Born and Werner Heisenberg to visit Columbia.|$|E

The indoor wideband channel characteristics, such as the path-loss, Root-Mean-Square (RMS) delay spread and number of the multipath components (MPCs), are presented. The simulated results demonstrate that the path-loss and MPCs are affected by the permittivity, dielectric loss tangent and thickness of the <b>internal</b> <b>wall,</b> while the RMS delay spread is almost not relevant with the dielectric permittivity. Furthermore, the comparison of simulated result with the measured one in a simple scenario has validated the simulation study...|$|R

25|$|In the Watton Green {{area of the}} estate, eleven {{houses were}} {{completed}} in February 2001 {{with a focus on}} low-energy features. Designed by PCKO Architects and built by Focus Housing Group, they broke the trend of new homes constructed entirely of brick on the estate. The shells of these buildings were constructed quickly with insulated wall panels and roof pieces, manufactured using recycled newspaper and containing no foam or resin. The <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> are not load-bearing, allowing changes to the plans of the buildings in the future. The buildings are clad in cedar cladding and Tresca panels. For water conservation, low flush toilets, aerated taps and water butts were installed. Altogether, the scheme cost £958,000, with an average unit cost of £87,000.|$|E
25|$|The largest major {{incident}} in BC Penitentiary’s history started on September 27, 1976. A {{large percentage of}} the inmate population started rioting as they were released from their cells for showers. Over the next few days, the inmates destroyed most of the cellblocks and several other parts of the prison. They destroyed the <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> between cell blocks – which had stood for nearly a century – in many cases with their hands. The principal complaints were abuse by the guards, and the refusal by the guards to follow new, more humane directives. Two guards were taken hostage. Police riot control squads, and Canadian Army soldiers surrounded the perimeter of the prison. After the newly formed Citizens' Advisory Committee arrived on site and began participating in negotiations, the hostage-takers released one hostage in a show of good faith, and a nine-point deal was eventually struck on October 2, peacefully ending the riot and hostage-taking.|$|E
25|$|Carathéodory's celebrated {{presentation}} of equilibrium thermodynamics refers to closed systems, which {{are allowed to}} contain several phases connected by <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> of various kinds of impermeability and permeability (explicitly including walls that are permeable only to heat). Carathéodory's 1909 version of the {{first law of thermodynamics}} was stated in an axiom which refrained from defining or mentioning temperature or quantity of heat transferred. That axiom stated that the internal energy of a phase in equilibrium is a function of state, that the sum of the internal energies of the phases is the total internal energy of the system, and that the value of the total internal energy of the system is changed by the amount of work done adiabatically on it, considering work as a form of energy. That article considered this statement to be an expression of the law of conservation of energy for such systems. This version is nowadays widely accepted as authoritative, but is stated in slightly varied ways by different authors.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} shape in Inca {{architecture}} was the rectangular building without any <b>internal</b> <b>walls</b> and roofed with wooden beams and thatch. There were several variations of this basic design, including gabled roofs, rooms {{with one or}} two of the long sides opened and rooms that shared a long wall. Rectangular buildings were used for quite different functions in almost all Inca buildings, from humble houses to palaces and temples. Even so, there are some examples of curved walls on Inca buildings, mostly in regions outside the central area of the empire. Two-story buildings were infrequent; when they were built the second floor was accessed from the outside via a stairway or high terrain rather than from the first floor. Wall apertures, including doors, niches and windows, usually had a trapezoidal shape; they could be fitted with double or triple jambs as a form of ornamentation. Other kinds of decoration were scarce; some walls were painted or adorned with metal plaques, in rare cases walls were sculpted with small animals or geometric patterns.|$|E
