40|$|With the {{expansion}} of <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> <b>content</b> stored online and concurrent proliferation of capturing devices, the management and visualization of personal photo collections have become very challenging tasks. In order to gain insight into novel ways of handling and representing large personal photo collections, this paper presents results of a user experience study into novel visualizations of multiple photo streams, sourced from different individuals or capture devices. A web-based application prototype was designed and implemented offering synchronized visualization of photo streams in a single- or multi-window display layout. An experimental {{study was conducted with}} 20 users, and the results demonstrate high user demand for concurrent presentation of multiple media streams as well as recommends methods for leveraging its potential...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Both {{calliper}} {{devices and}} <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> {{methods have been}} used to quantify foot arch height parameters. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the reliability of both a calliper device and <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> method in determining the arch height index (AHI). Methods Twenty subjects underwent measurements of AHI on two separate days. On each day, AHI measurements during both sitting and standing were taken using the AHIMS and <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> methods by the same single tester. The intra-tester reliability of each measurement technique was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Additionally, the relationship between AHI measurements derived from the two different methods was assessed using a correlation analysis. Results The reliability for both the AHIMS and <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> methods was excellent with ICC values exceeding 0. 86 and SEM values of less than 0. 009 for the AHI. Moreover, the reliability of both measurement techniques was equivalent. There was a strong positive correlation between the AHI values collected using both methods. AHI values calculated using the <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> method tended to be greater than those derived using the AHIMS. Conclusion <b>Digital</b> <b>photographic</b> methods offer equivalent intra-tester reliability to previously established calliper methods when assessing AHI. While AHI measurements calculated using both methods were highly related, the greater AHI values in the photographic method implied caution should be exercised when comparing absolute values between the two methods. Future studies are required to determine whether <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> methods can be developed with improved validity. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} {{the current state of}} {{metadata}} practices for <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> collections in archives, libraries, and museums in Norway in terms of the awareness of metadata and metadata types, the availability of guidelines, the chief source of information on cataloging <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> items, the metadata scheme used, subject cataloging standards and the opinions of staff on the problems and factors regarding cataloging <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> collections. A descriptive survey is used as the research method. Data was collected by using an online questionnaire. A survey link was distributed to archives, libraries, and museums in Norway which have <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> collection projects. A total of 45 returned questionnaires were analyzed into descriptive statistics by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program The findings indicate that most of the responding memory institutions have guidelines for cataloging <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> collections available at their workplaces (in print format more often than digital format). In the opinion of respondents, cataloging <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> materials is similar to cataloging photographs in other formats. Further, metadata is very important for organizing digital collections in their perspective. The Standard for Fotokatalogisering is the most adopted metadata scheme for <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> collections and responding memory institutions assign free keywords more often than using standardized subject heading lists. For the most part, the respondents agree that the mandatory elements in the Standard for Fotokatalogisering are the most important. Considering problems facing the digital collection projects of responding institutions, an insufficient budget is the most problematic, with the highest mean response. Inadequate existing data on the materials and a high demand for specialized knowledge and skills also greatly challenge them. As future challenges facing such projects, respondents most frequently point out user needs, policies on <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> collection development, and technology. Respondents highlight knowledge, skills and work resources as their potential contributions of institutions to collaborative projects. Joint Master Degree in Digital Library Learning (DILL...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the manners photographic images act and function online, and {{the processes that}} govern them through analyses of the artworks of four Post-Internet appropriation artists. 	Chapter 1 describes the online functions of the photographic images that were appropriated {{in the work of}} the discussed artists. Through exploration of the characteristics of the <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> image, as well as the online functions of the images appropriated in the discussed works, the state of the photographic image in the post-photographic era is described. 	Chapter 2 goes into the practice of the four discussed artists, in order to consider the manners they have altered and formed the <b>photographic</b> <b>content</b> after the appropriation of these images. This postproduction practice has been inherently informed by online paradigms, which can then also be seen in the ways content is shaped in the artworks. 	Chapter 3 will discuss these artworks from the point of the post-Internet condition the artists are referring to. By connecting the findings of the first two chapters, it will be possible to consider how these images are positioned and what these artists are aiming to convey in doing so...|$|R

40|$|Digital aerial {{photogrammetry}} has {{the virtue of}} high precision and efficiency, but the plane array of single digital camera is not wide enough, so the land coverage and base-height ratio of single digital camera is smaller than the traditional film camera. So people always array several single digital cameras (usually two or four) together as one camera, and it’s called multiple plane array <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> camera or mosaic camera, the angle of single digital camera is not level as usual, it circumgyrates around it’s own axis of lens to get large land coverage, {{and it has become}} the focus in recent research. The tilting angle of single camera is the most important parameter in multiple plane array <b>digital</b> <b>photographic</b> camera system; it determines the image quality and the useful land coverage (effective virtual picture format). The image distortion caused by camera incline was studied particularly in the process of multi-lens aerial digital camera exterior marriage in this paper.
