5|$|Neuner has {{won seven}} gold and four silver medals at the Biathlon Junior/Youth World Championships. With the {{exception}} of the individual discipline, she has won a medal in <b>every</b> <b>race</b> she entered. In 2004, at her first junior world championships in Haute Maurienne, France, Neuner won two titles (sprint and relay). One year later, she claimed gold in the sprint race in Kontiolahti, Finland, and in 2006, she again won two titles (pursuit and relay) in Presque Isle, Maine, United States. Neuner did not participate in the 2007 event. She returned to the junior world championships in 2008 when they were held in Ruhpolding, Germany, winning two more gold medals (sprint and pursuit).|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{won five}} {{consecutive}} drivers' titles from 2000 to 2004, including an unprecedented sixth and seventh title. In 2002, Schumacher won the title {{with a record}} six races remaining and finished on the podium in <b>every</b> <b>race.</b> In 2004, Schumacher won twelve {{out of the first}} thirteen races and went on to win a record 13 times as he won his final title. Schumacher retired from Formula One in 2006, after finishing runner-up to Renault's Fernando Alonso. Schumacher returned to Formula One in 2010 with Mercedes. He produced the fastest qualifying time at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix, and achieved his only podium on his return at the 2012 European Grand Prix, where he finished third. In October 2012, Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} tracks {{included}} in the game, with locations inspired {{from different parts of}} the globe, from Belize to Tokyo. Progression through the game is achieved by competing in and winning races against computer-controlled racers spread over different tracks and in different leagues. Players begin in the Rookie league, across three of the tracks, where the chances of detachment from the race surface are decreased and rates of acceleration reduced. Success in the Rookie league unlocks the less forgiving Pro league with more tracks on which to compete. Further success unlocks the most difficult league, the Ballistics league, competition in this league occurs across every track and to complete this, the player must place first in <b>every</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Automobile and Touring Club of Greece (Ελληνική Λέσχη Περιηγήσεων & Αυτοκινήτου, Elliniki Leschi Periigiseon kai Aftokinitou, {{abbreviated}} ELPA) is a Greek motor sports organisation which organizes <b>every</b> <b>racing</b> {{event in}} Greece, including the world famous Acropolis Rally.|$|R

5|$|For 1987, Forti {{moved up}} to International Formula 3000 with less {{immediate}} success than experienced in Formula Three. The main reason for this was the chassis the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, {{all of which were}} produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three chassis supplier Gian Paolo Dallara, who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a chassis which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team's car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend <b>every</b> <b>race</b> on the schedule. Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard chassis.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 the Canadian city of Calgary {{hosted the}} first Winter Olympics to span 16days. New events were added in ski-jumping and speed skating; while future Olympic sports curling, short track speed skating and {{freestyle}} skiing made their appearance as demonstration sports. For {{the first time}} the speed skating events were held indoors, on the Olympic Oval. Dutch skater Yvonne van Gennip won three gold medals and set two world records, beating skaters from the favoured East German team in <b>every</b> <b>race.</b> Her medal total was equalled by Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen, who won all three events in his sport. Alberto Tomba, an Italian skier, made his Olympic debut by winning both the giant slalom and slalom. East German Christa Rothenburger won the women's 1,000metre speed skating event. Seven months later she would earn a silver in track cycling at the Summer Games in Seoul, to become the only athlete to win medals in both a Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of <b>every</b> <b>race</b> and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E
50|$|Pit stops are included, and a team-radio {{imitation}} {{tells the}} player {{when to go}} to the pits for tires, wing and engine repair. Weather forecasts are available before <b>every</b> <b>racing</b> session. However, in rare cases the weather can change during the race, forcing players to make an unscheduled change of tires.|$|R
50|$|The {{infrared}} {{weapon is}} the only weapon not controlled by the player. The infrared is turned on in <b>every</b> nighttime <b>race</b> and off in <b>every</b> daytime <b>race.</b> When turned on, the screen {{is covered with a}} tone of red and {{it is much easier to}} see and avoid obstacles and cars.|$|R

5|$|Grand Prix – This mode has {{the player}} race against 7 (or 6) teams, which are {{controlled}} by the computer, {{in a series of}} predetermined courses. The player can choose to race using 3 different engine size classes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. A fourth unlockable class, Mirror Mode, allows the player to race through a mirrored version of the tracks using the 150cc engine size. Since all karts go faster when using higher engine sizes, the 4 classes serve as difficulty levels. There are 16 tracks, divided into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star and Special. A 5th cup has the player race in every track called the All-Cup Tour. The tour always starts with Luigi Circuit and ends with Rainbow Road, but the remaining tracks show up in random order. <b>Every</b> <b>race</b> is three laps long except for Baby Park and Wario Colosseum, which have 7 and 2, respectively. After all the human players cross the finish line, the positions of the computer-controlled teams are immediately locked in and they are given points based on those eight positions, ranging from 0 to 10. At the end of the cup, there will be an award ceremony for the 3 teams, where they will get a trophy ranging from bronze to gold. No matter which position they earned after each race, everyone will move on because of these new rules.|$|E

He {{began the}} year by capturing the races that are {{now known as the}} Strub Series at Santa Anita Park, becoming the first horse to win the Malibu Stakes, the San Fernando Stakes and the Santa Anita Maturity, now the Strub Stakes. He ended the season as the winner of <b>every</b> <b>racing</b> award available to him, including Horse of the Year.|$|R
50|$|Pedal Car Racing can {{be found}} {{in many parts of the}} world. The UK, France and Italy all have championships and the UK and Hong Kong have a 24-hour <b>race</b> <b>every</b> year. <b>Racing</b> pedal cars are {{lightweight}} machines built for the sole purpose of racing and are therefore unsuitable for road use.|$|R

25|$|Points for the 1991 Drivers' Championship {{were awarded}} on a 10–6–4–3–2–1 {{basis for the}} first six places in each race. This was the first season in which 10 points (rather than 9) were awarded for a win, and <b>every</b> <b>race</b> counted towards the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
25|$|Three {{teams that}} started the 1990 season would not make {{the start of the}} 1991 season: EuroBrun had failed to {{complete}} the season. Onyx Grand Prix also pulled out during 1990, but went as far as designing a 1991 car before finally folding, while the absence of Life, a team that failed to prequalify for <b>every</b> <b>race,</b> surprised no-one.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{splitting}} {{has been}} a strategy well documented in professional running since the early 20th century. Runners including Steve Prefontaine, Wilson Kipsang, Julia Lucas, and Galen Rupp have used them in <b>races.</b> Like <b>every</b> <b>racing</b> strategy there are pros and cons, with negative splitting having its strengths in shaving time off the clock and its weakness being {{that it will not}} always get the runner the win, but often has led to wins.|$|R

25|$|At {{the sound}} of the gun, the cyclists leave their {{starting}} blocks and attempt to gain position behind the pacer, a keirin bicyclist wearing purple with orange stripes. As the pace quickens, the pacer will usually depart the track with between one and two laps remaining, but the actual location where the pacer leaves varies with <b>every</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DFV {{was also}} the engine for which the Formula 3000 series was created in 1985, and thus it won <b>every</b> <b>race</b> that year. The DFV and its {{variants}} continued racing in F3000 for a decade, Pedro Lamy taking the last win for a DFV in top-class motorsport, at Pau in 1993, its 65th F3000 win in 123 races.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Purvis {{moved to}} Diamond Ridge Motorsports. He had two less top-5s than in 1998, but two more top-10s, {{as well as}} being able to run <b>every</b> <b>race.</b> A 3rd place at Talladega was his best finish of 1999, but the {{consistency}} allowed for Purvis to finish 6th in points, bettering his 1996 standing. Even with the solid 1999, Purvis's job was in jeopardy.|$|E
50|$|At {{the current}} form, {{national}} events are organized for various classes throughout Greece in various locations and venues.

25|$|The {{forecasts}} for the Senate {{proved to}} be correct for <b>every</b> <b>race.</b> But the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day. And in Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.|$|E
25|$|In Australia {{he retired}} with a {{transmission}} problem. He retired again in Malaysia with leaking hydraulics.

After that, he finished <b>every</b> <b>race</b> outside the points, but made no further retirements. His final race at the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix was a quiet farewell where he finished 14th, ahead of former teammate Michael Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|The race is {{monitored}} by four referees, each {{located in a}} tower {{next to one of}} the four turns (referred to as corners). After <b>every</b> <b>race,</b> each referee will wave either a white or red flag. A white flag indicates that no infractions occurred in that area. A red flag, however, signals a possible infraction and launches an inquiry into the race. Judges then examine video of the race and then decide if a participant committed a rules violation; if so, the rider is disqualified and retires from the remainder of the meet.|$|E
