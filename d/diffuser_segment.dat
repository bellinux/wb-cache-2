This paper represented a design method of the supersonic separator used in natural gas liquefaction plant, including {{the design of the}} Laval nozzle, the design of the rectifier straight segment and the design of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>segment.</b> The size of each part and the appropriate shape can be gotten by the theoretical calculation. The design results of an experiment liquefaction device using supersonic separator is given. The work is helpful for the natural gas transportation in remote and low production gas field...|$|E
