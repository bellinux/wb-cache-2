I get in the car and Baby’s my instructor. We’re in Atlanta taking a tour [...] Baby is like, ‘Bow, pull over. Tell this to shorty.’ He tests me on my speaking game with the ladies. A normal DMV person would be testing you on your right turn, [...] ‘check your mirrors.’ Me, I was tested on did I spit game to the girl correctly." ...|$|E

500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Townshend played {{keyboards}} {{on several}} Who songs. On Who's Next, {{he began to}} work with analogue synthesizers, using the ARP 2600 model that he first encountered at Cambridge University. He {{had this to say}} about the instrument: [...] "I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that aren't in my hands: the sound of an orchestra, French horns, strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar you're stuck with as fast as you can play and I don't play fast, I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> synth." ...|$|E
