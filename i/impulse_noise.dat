The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, <b>impulse</b> <b>noise,</b> oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E
25|$|The {{compression}} effect: The amplification {{needed to}} make quiet sounds audible, if applied to loud sounds would damage the inner ear (cochlea). Louder sounds are therefore reduced giving a smaller audible volume range and hence inherent distortion. Hearing protection is also provided by an overall cap to the sound pressure. Also of protective value is <b>impulse</b> <b>noise</b> suppression, available in some high-end aids.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{long-term}} {{risk factor}} from firefighting is exposure {{to high levels}} of sound, which can cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. [...] NIHL is caused by exposure to sound levels at or above 85dBA according to NIOSH and at or above 90dBA according to OSHA. dBA represents A-weighted decibels. dBA is used for measuring sound levels relating to occupational sound exposure since it attempts to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound. OSHA uses a 5-dBA exchange rate, which means that for every 5dBA increase in sound from 90dBA, the acceptable exposure time before a risk of permanent hearing loss occurs decreases by half (starting with 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 90dBA). NIOSH uses a 3-dBA exchange rate starting at 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 85dBA. [...] The time of exposure required to potentially cause damage depends on the level of sound exposed to..The most common causes of excessive sound exposure are sirens, transportation to and from fires, fire alarms, and work tools. Traveling in an emergency vehicle has shown to expose a person to between 103 and 114dBA of sound. According to OSHA, exposure at this level is acceptable for between 17 and 78 minutes and according to NIOSH is acceptable for between 35 seconds and 7.5 minutes [...] over a 24-hour day before permanent hearing loss can occur. This time period considers that no other high level sound exposure occurs in that 24-hour time frame. Sirens often output about 120dBA, which according to OSHA, 7.5 minutes of exposure is needed and according to NIOSH, 9 seconds of exposure is neededin a 24-hour time period before permanent hearing loss can occur. In addition to high sound levels, another risk factor for hearing disorders is the co-exposure to chemicals that are ototoxic. [...] The average day of work for a firefighter can often be under the sound exposure limit for both OSHA and NIOSH. The average day of sound exposure as a firefighter is often under the limit, but firefighters can be exposed to <b>impulse</b> <b>noise,</b> which has a very low acceptable time exposure before permanent hearing damage can occur due to the high intensity and short duration.|$|E

30|$|Motivated by {{the above}} observations, we propose a {{universal}} video enhancement system to automatically recover the ideal high-quality signal from noise degraded videos and enlarge their {{contrast to a}} subjectively acceptable level. For a given defective video, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal connective (ASTC) filter, which adapts from temporal to spatial filters based on noise level and local motion characteristics to remove mixture of Gaussian and <b>impulse</b> <b>noises.</b> Both the temporal and the spatial filters are noniterative trilateral filters, formed by introducing a novel local image statisticâ€”neighborhood connective value (NCV) into the traditional bilateral filter. NCV represents the connective strength of a pixel to all its neighboring pixels and is a good measure for differentiating between <b>impulse</b> <b>noises</b> and fine features. After noise removal, we adopt pyramid segmentation algorithm [13] to divide a frame into several regions. Based on the areas {{and standard deviations of}} these regions, we produce a novel adaptive piecewise mapping function (APMF) to automatically enhance the video contrast. To show effectiveness of our NCV statistic, we conducted a simulation experiment by adding <b>impulse</b> <b>noises</b> into three representative pictures and reported superior noise detection performance compared with other noise filters. In addition, we tested our system on several real defective videos adding mixed noises. These videos cover diverse kinds of defectiveness: underexposure, overexposure, mixture of them, and so forth. Our outputs are much more visually pleasing than those of other state-of-art approaches.|$|R

5000|$|The low VHF {{channels}} from 2 to 6, while {{requiring the}} lowest power (up to 100 kW analog video or 20 kW digital), {{are prone to}} electromagnetic interference. The ATSC digital TV system has severe problems with susceptibility to <b>impulse</b> <b>noise,</b> bursts of interference which briefly render the entire channel unusable, due to its inability to instantaneously determine where in a video frame to resume display when the signal returns. The result is macroblocking and pixelation of the entire signal whenever <b>impulse</b> <b>noise</b> sources (such as motors, appliances or electrical storms) are active. They also are the lowest in frequency and therefore the longest in wavelength, requiring the largest antennas both to transmit and receive. They are also prone to atmospheric ducting, especially at night when the ground (and the air near it) cools rapidly.
