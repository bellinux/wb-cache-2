5|$|Following his 83rd aerial victory, Müncheberg {{was summoned}} to his {{commanding}} officer, Geschwaderkommodore Schöpfel, who informed him of his transfer to Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51—51st Fighter Wing) on the Eastern Front. Müncheberg was destined to become a Geschwaderkommodore but prior to receiving his own command he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> as a Kommodore in training. He went on a three weeks home leave, staying at his parents home, before he received his orders to head east on 21 July 1942.|$|E
25|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1863, Slocum was {{transferred}} with his corps to the Western Theater. When he learned that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> under Joe Hooker, Slocum, who had disliked Hooker since Chancellorsville, wrote to President Lincoln saying that he would rather resign from the Army. Lincoln assured {{him that he would}} not actually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> under Hooker and a compromise was reached whereby one division of the corps, under Slocum, was assigned to protect the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad while the other division served directly under Hooker.|$|E

Baker's fine was also reduced from ¥5,000,000 (approximately £24,392) to ¥3,000,000 (approximately £14,635). This had to be paid within four weeks or he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> an extra 150 days of hard labour.|$|E
25|$|Like in {{the rest}} of the Ottoman Empire, Greeks had to carry a receipt {{certifying}} their payment of jizya at all times or be subject to imprisonment. Most Greeks did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> in the Sultan's army, but the young boys that were taken away and converted to Islam were made to serve in the Ottoman military. In addition, girls were taken in order to serve as odalisques in harems.|$|E
25|$|Mattock turned {{herself in}} to police in September 2014 {{on charges of}} using the {{proceeds}} of crime to achieve her $250,000 bail. She decided not to re-post bail {{in the hopes of}} receiving a quicker trial date. On December 18, 2014, Mattock pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering and received a 33-month sentence, less time served. As a result of this plea, she will not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> time in a federal penitentiary, and she will likely be released in 2015.|$|E

25|$|On 4 August 2002, Whiting was {{attacked}} {{with a razor}} by another prisoner while fetching hot water at Wakefield Prison. Convicted killer Rickie Tregaskis (serving life imprisonment with a 25-year recommended minimum for the 1997 murder of a disabled man in Cornwall) {{was found guilty of}} carrying out the slashing which left Whiting with a six-inch scar on his right cheek. Tregaskis received a six-year sentence (to run concurrently alongside his life sentence) after being found guilty on a wounding charge relating to the attack on Roy Whiting. This will not mean that he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> any extra time in prison if the Parole Board decides that he can be freed on life licence.|$|E
25|$|Leopold {{emphasized}} military defence as {{the basis}} of neutrality, and strove to make Belgium less vulnerable militarily. He achieved the construction of defensive fortresses at Liège, at Namur and at Antwerp. During the Franco-Prussian War, he managed to preserve Belgium's neutrality in a period of unusual difficulty and danger. Leopold pushed for a reform in military service, but he was unable to obtain one until he was on his deathbed. Under the old system of Remplacement, the Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service. This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> in the military.|$|E

25|$|With Barrichello {{in seventh}} and Button {{out of the}} points scoring {{positions}} in 10th, Vettel looked to capitalise and try to close Button's 26 point lead in the Championship. By lap 13 he was 2.1 seconds behind Rosberg, who was in turn 2.5 seconds behind Hamilton. Vettel {{was the first of}} the leaders to stop, on lap 17. A lap later Rosberg pitted but he misjudged the level of grip on the pit exit, causing his car to cross the white line that distinguishes the pit lane from the race track, an offence that is punished by a drive-through penalty. Rosberg was issued with the penalty on lap 20 and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> penalty within three racing laps. Hamilton also pitted on lap 20.|$|E
25|$|The Copyright Act of 1976 {{contained}} a provision which {{allowed for a}} creator to terminate their grant of the copyright to their work 56 years after the date the copyright was first secured. The creator would then have a five-year window to do so. The creator, however, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> a notice of termination {{in advance of the}} effective date; between two and ten years in advance. Action Comics #1 was published on April 18, 1938. Consequently, Superman's copyright would become eligible for termination beginning April 18, 1994 and ending April 18, 1999, and the termination notices had to be served between April 18, 1984, and April 18, 1997. Likewise, Superboy's copyright became eligible for termination between December 2000 and December 2005, and the notices had to be served sometime between and December 1990 and December 2003.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, {{his party}} {{nominated}} {{him to run}} for Congress, again against his wishes. He again reluctantly accepting, believing he would be defeated and not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> in the office. He was overwhelmingly defeated in the election, finished out his two remaining years as a state senator, {{and returned to his}} farm in 1892. The following year the nation was adversely affected by the Panic of 1893, leading to a collapse of farm and produce value. Across the state, farmers began to lose their land to their lenders. The following year in the 1894 mid-term elections the Republicans swept to power in the statehouse, and took control of the Indiana General Assembly. As a farmer, Mount was also affected by the economic downturn and decided a return to politics was the best way he could help the situation.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} a {{political}} debate regarding {{the site of a}} new airport. Fornebu was one alternative. However, it only had a single runway, which was too small to serve intercontinental flights. It would therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> in tandem with Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other proposals were placing the airport at Hurum, Ås and Hobøl, or building a new airport at Gardermoen. The Norwegian State Railways developed a series of plans for the various airport locations, including the Hurum Line, the Gardermoen Line—which was ultimately built—and branches of the Østfold Line to Hobøl and Ås. The ground transport system was {{a major part of the}} considerations and proposals were made both for motorway and railway access to all the alternatives. As part of its 1986 proposal NSB also launched the concept of a people mover to the airport.|$|E
25|$|Plans from 2011 {{have called}} for a new tunnel which runs from Majorstuen via Stortinget to Tøyen, but {{following}} a different route and with intermediate stations at Bislett, Hammersborg and Olaf Ryes plass, in the St. Hanshaugen and Grünerløkka boroughs north of the city center. Three of the lines would thus follow the existing tunnel to Stortinget and then switch to the new line, while the other three lines would follow the new tunnel to Stortinget and then run along the old tunnel onwards. This would allow for a six-minute headway on all but two branches, and also allow the proposed Fornebu Line to Skøyen, Fornebu and Nesodden to be built as part of the metro. Ruter has stated that the current stations are located in the areas which the most people want to travel to, and that if a second tunnel should deviate from these areas, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> places which generate as much traffic as the current stations.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{recruited}} guerrilla fighters had {{to follow}} a two months basic military training program {{that is different from}} the physical training (PT) programs. The basic training consists of having to identify firearms and getting used to specific models and their physical operation, such as the Russian AK-47 and U.S. M16 assault rifles, as well as mortar rifles and basic communication systems. The PT programs are separate from the main training schedule, as they are included in the day-to-day life of a guerrilla, by climbing mountains, running with loads, participating in the digging of military trenches, making bunkers and occasionally also some swimming programs taking place in natural water resources such as rivers and lakes. Playing of soccer is another activity available to all male and female guerrillas as it gives them a proper mental relaxation. FARC clearly advises all guerrilla commanders to avoid assigning barely trained guerrillas directly in the front lines, establishing that they only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> in rear lines when coming fresh from basic training.|$|E
