25|$|A CD is read by {{focusing}} a 780nm wavelength (near infrared) semiconductor laser housed within the CD player, through {{the bottom of}} the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a photodiode, the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the semiconductor laser is placed on a swing arm within the disc tray of any CD player. This swing arm allows the laser to read information from the centre {{to the edge of a}} disc, without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.|$|E
25|$|Outside Western cultures, male {{clothing}} includes {{skirts and}} skirt-like garments. One common form {{is a single}} sheet of fabric folded and wrapped around the waist, such as the dhoti/veshti or lungi in India, and sarong in South and Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka. In Myanmar {{both women and men}} wear a longyi, a wraparound tubular skirt like a sarong that reaches to the ankles for women and to mid-calf for men. There are different varieties and names of sarong depending on whether the ends are sewn together or simply tied. There is a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a dhoti and lungi is worn. While a lungi is more like a wrap around, wearing the dhoti involves the creation of pleats by folding it. A dhoti also passes between the legs making it more like a folded loose trouser rather than a skirt.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a major}} <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{in which}} {{different}} bowlers or pitchers contribute to a single game. In baseball, a single pitcher starts the game, and makes every pitch until the manager replaces the tiring pitcher with a relief pitcher. Replaced pitchers cannot return to pitch again in the same game (unless they are shuttled to another position {{in the field and}} thus stay in the line-up, a move rarely seen in the major leagues), and a succession of pitchers may come into the game in sequence until it ends. In cricket, two bowlers begin the game, with those not actively bowling spending time as fielders. Every player in the team, including the wicket-keeper but excluding the 12th man, is available {{to be used as a}} bowler. Bowlers alternate bowling overs of six balls each. A bowler will usually bowl for a 'spell' of several (alternate) overs, and will generally bowl the entire spell from the same end of the pitch. A second bowler will bowl the overs missed by the first, from the other end of the pitch, for his own spell. After a bowler is taken off, he may be, and often is, asked to bowl another spell later in the same innings. Although moving a pitcher to a fielding position and returning him to pitch later in the game is legal in baseball, it is a rarely used and potentially risky strategy, as the pitcher may be unprepared to play another position.|$|E
500|$|Saunders {{went before}} an officer {{selection}} board {{that had been}} set up on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, where the units of the 6th Division had been based following their return from New Guinea. The interview panel on the board consisted of three senior officers– all experienced infantry battalion commanders– who were tasked with determining a candidate's suitability for commissioning as an infantry officer. Saunders was found to be an acceptable candidate and posted to an officer training unit in Seymour, Victoria. Upon completion of the 16-week course, he was promoted to lieutenant in November 1944, becoming the first Aboriginal commissioned officer in the Australian Army. The precedent of his commissioning had caused the Army some concern due to its [...] "special significance", and as a result the paperwork for its confirmation was eventually sent to the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, for approval. Nevertheless, Blamey is reported to have [...] "insisted upon following the usual procedure", believing {{that there should be no}} <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Saunders' commission should be treated to any other soldier who had completed the necessary training. The story garnered much press coverage in Australia, most of it favourable, if in parts paternalistic.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Gregory Paul {{published}} a new {{reconstruction of the}} skeleton of [...] "B." [...] brancai, highlighting a number of differences in proportion between it and B. altithorax. Chief among them is a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the trunk vertebrae vary: they are fairly uniform in B. altithorax, but vary widely in the African material. Paul believed that the limb and girdle elements of both species were very similar, and therefore suggested to separate them not at genus, but only at subgenus level.|$|E

2500|$|Adventists reject Calvinistic predestination. Such a {{decision}} makes judgment {{a necessary part}} of the divine plan of salvation (Wesleyan-Arminian concept). Adventists use the term [...] "atonement" [...] in harmony with the [...] "Day of Atonement" [...] service found in Leviticus 16. That service includes both the death of the sin offering, and the ministry of the high priest in the sanctuary before the full scope of atonement is completed. Many Christians today limit their concept of atonement {{to the point where the}} sin offering has been made and is completed. This <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the term is defined by the various groups within Christendom has been a source of some undue criticism.|$|E

[...] He remarked about Vincent Canby's review of the film: [...] "In the New York Times, Vincent Canby complained that we are not given enough information about the quality of Vivian's broken marriage, asking if perhaps her lesbianism was a hysterical reaction to her divorce. This is the point at which many heterosexual critics disqualify themselves from perceptively reviewing gay films." ...|$|E
