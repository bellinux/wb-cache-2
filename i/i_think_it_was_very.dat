500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> quick, like {{right out of the}} gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E

2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E

Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> natural perversity; {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> false pride {{at getting}} over sea-sickness; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> reading 'Robinson Crusoe,' and books warning of {{me not to}} go to sea." ...|$|R

2500|$|During the [...] "Executive Actions" [...] {{symposium}} held by The Washington Post and George Washington University in April 2015 (shortly {{after the}} launch of the HBO Now streaming service), HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he does not want the network to be akin to Netflix in which users [...] "binge watch" [...] its television shows and film content, saying [...] "I don't {{think it would have been}} a great thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out for an extended period of time." [...] Pleper cited that he feels that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] Jeanne admitted. [...] "I went {{to sleep}} {{listening}} for footsteps. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> rude of Ronald to go away without saying good-bye to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impertinent of him," [...] Mary {{said in a}} tone of vexation. [...] "I am sure {{nothing could}} have been nicer than they were even when I saw them, I am certain there were no blunders in them, and I don't see how they could be improved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> kind of her {{thinking}} of it," [...] Isobel said, [...] "and I don't {{think it is}} nice of you, Doctor, {{to say that it}} was an evident relief to her when she found I had someone else to take care of me. Why should it have been a relief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a bit, child," [...] {{he assured}} her; [...] "in fact <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good of you.

Au revoir!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Five years later, {{singer and}} co-writer Ron Peno said the album {{remained}} the band's creative watermark. [...] "Now there's an album {{that should have}} done something," [...] he told the Daily Telegraph. [...] "It's a very loved album and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a special record for us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> criminal that <b>it</b> got ignored." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I see {{no great}} harm in that paragraph," [...] says Sir Brian. [...] "I wish {{my brother had}} gone to the Roebuck, and not to the King's Arms, as the Roebuck is our house: but he could not be {{expected}} to know much about the Newcome inns, as he is a new comer himself. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{right of the people to}} call on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If my betrothed had died, {{nothing would}} have induced {{me to marry}} [...] anybody else. I would have {{remained}} an old maid. But so few [...] people have any really nice feeling! Mr. Dryland, the curate, [...] had already proposed to Mary, and she had refused him. He is a [...] pleasant-spoken young man, with a rather fine presence--not my [...] ideal at all; but that, of course, doesn't matter! Well, a month [...] after the funeral, Mary {{told me that he}} had asked her again, and [...] she had declined. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> bad taste on his part, but [...] Mary said she thought it most noble.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the best}} book that ever was written," [...] calls out Clive. The Colonel {{said he had not}} read it, but he was {{informed}} Mr. Mill's was a very learned history; he intended to read it. [...] "Eh! there is plenty of time now," [...] said the good Colonel. [...] "I have all day long at Grey Friars,--after chapel, you know. Do you know, sir, when I was a boy I used what they call to tib out and run down to a public-house in Cistercian Lane--the Red Cowl sir,--and buy rum there? I was a terrible wild boy, Clivy. You weren't so, sir, thank Heaven! A terrible wild boy, and my poor father flogged me, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> hard on me. It wasn't the pain, you know: it wasn't the pain, but----" [...] Here tears came into his eyes and he dropped his head on his hand, and the cigar from it fell on to the floor, burnt almost out, and scattering white ashes.|$|E

25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> therefore taking all those circumstances in view... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a lovely thought and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is something one just cannot know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> [...] . <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{the morning}} of that pampero off the Plate, when you were thrown through the door into my father's stateroom.

6000|$|... 'Ah, but I {{do think}} so, {{whatever}} you may say, Mr. Le Breton,' Hilda went on eagerly. 'I do think so, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{good of you}} to fight it out so against papa for what you believe is right and proper. For my own part, you know, I don't see any particular harm in pigeon-shooting. Of course it's very dreadful that the poor dear little things should be shot and wounded and winged and so forth; but then everything, almost, gets shot, you see--rabbits, and grouse, and partridges, and everything; so that really it's hardly worth while, it seems to me, making a fuss about it. Still, that's not the real question. You think it's wrong; which is very original and nice and proper of you; and as you think it's wrong, you won't countenance it in any way. I don't care, myself, whether it's wrong or not--I'm not called upon, thank goodness, to decide the question; but I do care very much that you should suffer for what you think the right course of action.' And Lady Hilda in her earnestness almost laid her hand upon his arm, and looked up to him in the most unmistakable and appealing fashion.|$|E

5000|$|Earlier {{that year}} Sutherland had written approvingly of Ian McEwan's novel Saturday. Banville {{strongly}} criticized {{the work in}} The New York Review of Books. Banville later admitted that, upon reading Sutherland's letter {{in response to his}} review, he had thought: [...] "Well, I can kiss the Booker goodbye. I have not been the most popular person in London literary circles over the past half-year.

5000|$|Years later, Pryor {{acknowledged}} the effect the shift between Something to Write Home About and On a Wire had on their fan base {{in an interview}} with New York Press: [...] "I feel like the way that we rolled out On A Wire was kind of abrasive and confrontational. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> polarizing to our fans.
