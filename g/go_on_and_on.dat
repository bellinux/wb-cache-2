2500|$|According to some critics, Sparks was {{inspired}} by the 1992 best-selling novel The Bridges of Madison County in writing Nights in Rodanthe. The Bridges of Madison County has a few similarities to Nights in Rodanthe: the characters are roughly of the same age and their relationships had ended. Sparks, said he was more guided by his novel The Notebook than The Bridges. He explained that the latter is a story of adultery while his is not.

2500|$|The {{whole process}} unravels when H arrives {{at its own}} number K. We will proceed with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...3214, and this number is unsuccessful. Then H {{increments}} N to produce K = 4355...3215, i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must by definition <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> testing, ad infinitum, because it is [...] "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions.

2500|$|It took eight {{working days}} to shoot an episode, and days were {{regularly}} 14–20 hours long.

[...] The cast were required to be word-perfect in all the scenes, while also reciting large amounts of dialogue at speed. Matt Czuchry, who had a main role for the final three seasons, commented [...] "The pace of the dialogue was what made that show incredibly unique, and also incredibly difficult as an actor. To {{be able to maintain}} that speed, tone, and at the same time, try to make layered choices was a great experience to have early in my career. It really challenged me." [...] The combination of the difficult dialogue and long takes meant each scene had to be shot many times; Graham said in 2015: [...] "never before or since have I done as many takes of anything". Alexis Bledel recalled that one scene required 38 takes. Graham added, [...] "that show – as fun and breezy and light as it is – is technically really challenging".|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'.

A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read.

2500|$|Asher {{explains}} that he and Wilson had many lengthy, intimate discussions centered around their [...] "experiences and feelings about women and the various stages of relationships and so forth". He maintains that his contribution to the music itself was minimal, serving mainly {{as a source of}} second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, Asher clarified, [...] "The general tenor of the lyrics was always his... and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter." [...] While speaking about [...] "God Only Knows", Wilson reflected: [...] "I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, I started thinking about it deeper... because I had never written that kind of song. And I remember him talking about 'Stella by Starlight' and he had a certain love for classic songs." [...] A typical writing session would either start with Wilson playing melody or chord patterns that he'd been working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. Asher called his interactions with Wilson and the Beach Boys an [...] "embarrassing" [...] experience, and that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book [...] he'd just read.
