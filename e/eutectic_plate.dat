An Italian company was the first manufacturer to install a compressor mini-refrigerator in the NASA Space Shuttle in 1982.

The independent effects of both elements were investigated in ingot solidification experiments, {{and the effect of}} lithium studied in uni-directional solidification experiments. The predominant effect of lithium was to encourage <b>eutectic</b> AlFe <b>plate</b> breakdown producing a finer eutectic structure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the feasibility of unidirectionally solidifying the Al Ni <b>eutectic</b> in <b>plate</b> form. The plates solidified displayed good fiber formation but poor fiber alignment. Tensile strengths achieved were nearly twice that of the as cast alloy but only half of strengths achieved in cylindrical specimens. Plates with thickness to width ratios of 2, 25, and 75 were grown and tested [...] The hot pressing of Al. Ni plates was found to increase the strength to more than twice that of the as cast alloy.

50|$|The ice hold was {{equipped}} with large <b>eutectic</b> refrigeration <b>plates</b> that allowed ice to be easily kept in the 5 large bins {{on either side of}} the center line of the vessel for standard 10-day fishing trips. The hold also had a large freezer for storage of bait. This arrangement of ice and refrigeration only required running the diesel for approximately 2 hours a day to maintain temps in the hold, further saving on fuel and ice costs. Typically only about 3 tons of ice was need for a 10-day trip as opposed to the 6 to 10 tons that a standard vessel typically required. Fuel was a major cost factor for the standard grouper snapper vessels, the standard diesel driven vessels of the time could use as much as 500 to 1000 gallons on a ten-day trip where as the CSY typically used about 50 gallons and rarely used more than 100 gallons of its 500-gallon tankage. This pushed the break even point down substantially and increase profits proportionately.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The major {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are the engineering development and the structural analysis with finite element method (FEM) of a refrigerated container having a passive equipment and a remote control system to carry both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) goods. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to offer some solutions to the many disadvantages of using phase change material (PCM) to refrigerate the insulated container for transporting both fresh and frozen goods. Design/methodology/approach - In order to transport both fresh products (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen products (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C), the PCM elements are filled with one eutectic liquid only, so as to avoid problems related to filling and emptying the <b>eutectic</b> <b>plates,</b> and to plate corrosion. Moreover, specially shaped air ducts and a cool flow control system are designed to maintain a uniform circulation of cool air and constant humidity values. All the structures of the container are correctly designed by means of FEM calculations to assure that all the structural, safety standards parameters are satisfied. Findings - An innovative refrigerated container with PCM and a remote control system used to transport both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) products, in which it is possible to maintain the temperature values for almost seven days, has been considered here. Many disadvantages due to the use of PCM have been eliminated. It is possible to maintain a uniform circulation cool air and humidity values within the design parameters by means of fans; moreover, this container is light and environmentally friendly. All structures of the container are designed using FEM. Originality/value - This paper presents a refrigerated container with passive equipment and a remote control system to carry both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) goods in which it is possible to maintain the temperature values necessary for almost seven days. The container is equipped with a remote control system powered by photovoltaic panels which works in real time, is capable of giving information about the environmental parameters set in it and monitors the state of products by means of a network of sensors. Furthermore, the remote control system can send information about the position of the container to a remote control centre. The relevant structural conditions are numerically (FEM) evaluated and reported...|$|R
40|$|Gold-tin {{eutectic}} solders (30 at % Sn) {{are used}} for packaging microelectronic and optoelectronic devices, because of their excellent thermal and mechanical properties and relatively low melting or reflow temperature (280 °C). Electroplating is a cost effective alternative to current commercial solder deposition processes, such as solder preforms and evaporation. A coelectroplating process for depositing Au/Sn alloys, from a slightly acidic, chloride-based solution using pulsed currents, onto metallized ceramic and semiconductor substrates has been developed. Two separate Au/Sn compositions, 15 at % Sn and 50 at % Sn, can be deposited under appropriate plating conditions, i. e., current density, and pulse on/off time and duration. These compositions, according to the Au-Sn phase diagram, correspond to Au 5 Sn and AuSn, respectively. By using multiple current pulses and varying their duration, {{it is possible to}} deposit a composite solder structure with an overall composition ranging from 15 - 50 at % Sn, including the important <b>eutectic</b> composition. <b>Plating</b> results for both unpatterned and patterned (with photoresist) substrates are presented. All substrates were metallized with Ti/Au or Ti/Mo/Au, to provide a gold seed layer for electroplating...|$|R
40|$|Secondary-sourced {{recycled}} {{aluminium alloys}} can exhibit {{high levels of}} different impurities. It {{is well known that}} the presence of iron, the most common impurity, can lead to the formation of hard and brittle intermetallic phases which are detrimental to the machining properties and the mechanical behaviour of the material in service. The purpose of this work is to study the nucleation and growth of the β-Al 5 FeSi intermetallic phase in the framework of the eutectic reaction: Liquid → α-Al + β-Al 5 FeSi. In situ X-ray microtomography has been used to investigate the formation of the irregular <b>eutectic</b> β-phase <b>plates</b> during the solidification at low cooling rate of an Al- 8 Si- 4 Cu- 0. 8 Fe alloy. The results show that only a few plates form, nucleating early near the sample surface. Next, growth occurs very rapidly in the principal growth direction and slowly in the thickness direction. The plates are highly branched and appear to form as a divorced eutectic, i. e. not coupled with the α-Al. These features are inconsistent with the common irregular eutectic solidification theory based on the Jackson and Hunt model...|$|R

The solidification microstructures {{were characterized by}} SEM, XRD and EDS. The results show that solidified layer thickness of eutectic ceramics is enhanced by DSLZR. The <b>eutectic</b> ceramic <b>plates</b> with density up to 98. 5 %± 1 % are obtained, in which the thickness is 8. 2 mm, and the length is 65. 0 mm. The thickness of solidified layer is increased with decreasing laser scanning rate and increasing laser power. The density is initially increased and then decreased {{with the increase of}} laser scanning rate. The eutectic ceramic obtained by DSLZR is only consisted of uniform and interweaved Al 2 O 3 and YAG phases. The relation between the eutectic spacing (λ; only 1. 0 ~ 3. 5 μm) and solidification rate (v) agrees with the Jackson-Hunt formula. With the increase of laser scanning rate, the eutectic spacing reduces. Furthermore, the growth of eutectic at double side remelting interface is continuous, so the binded interface is very well. The eutectic ceramic obtained has high Vickers hardness ((18. 6 ± 1. 0) GPa) due to the fine solidification microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} high {{performance}} cast aluminum alloy components is often disturbed by increasing impurity elements, such as iron accumulated from recycled scraps. It is strongly required that coarse plate-like iron compound of モ-Al 5 FeSi turns into harmless form {{without the need}} for applying refining additives or expensive virgin ingots. The microstructural modification of Al- 7 mass%Si alloy billets with different iron contents was examined by applying ultrasonic vibration during the solidification. Ultrasonically melt-treated billets were thixocast right after induction heating up to the semisolid temperature of 583 ìC, the microstructure and tensile properties were evaluated in the thixocast components. Globular primary メ-Al is required to fill up a thin cavity in thixocasting, so that the microstructural modification by ultrasonic melt-treatment was firstly confirmed in the billets. With ultrasonic melt-treatment in the temperature range of 630 ìC to 605 ìC, the primary メ-Al transforms itself from dendrite into fine globular in morphology. The coarse plate-like モ-Al 5 FeSi compound becomes markedly finer compared with those in non-treated billets. Semisolid soaking up to 583 ìC, does not appreciably affect the size of モ-Al 5 FeSi compounds; however, it affects the solid primary メ-Al morphology to be more globular, which is convenient for thixocasting. After thixocasting with preheated billets, <b>eutectic</b> silicon <b>plates</b> are extremely refined due to the rapid solidification arising from low casting temperature. The tensile strength of thixocast samples with different iron contents does not change much even at 2 mass% of iron, when thixocast with ultrasonically melt-treated billets. However, thixocast Al- 7 mass%Si- 2 mass%Fe alloy with non-treated billets exhibits an inferior strength of 80 MPa, compared with 180 MPa with ultrasonically melt-treated billets. The elongation is also improved by about a factor of two in thixocastings with ultrasonically melt-treated billets for all iron contents of Al- 7 mass%Si alloys, for example, the elongation of 11 % in thixocast of Al- 7 mass%Si- 0. 5 mass%Fe alloy with ultrasonically melt-treated billets, 5 % in that with non-treated billets...|$|R
40|$|The {{model and}} {{results of the}} 2 D {{simulation}} of the cooperative growth of two phases in the lamellar eutectic are presented. The pro-posed model takes into account heat transfer, components diffusion and nonstationary concentration distribution in the liquid and solid phases, non-equlibrium nature of the phase transformation and kinetics of the growth, influence of the surface energy and interface curva-ture on {{the conditions of the}} thermodynamic equilibrium. For the determination of the phase interface shape the Cellular Automata tech-nique (CA) was used. For the calculation of temperature and concentration distribution the numerical solution of the Fourier equation was used. The partial differential equations were solved by Finite Differences Method (FDM). The spatial position and cell sizes of CA lattice and FDM mesh are equal. Proposed model can predict the steady state growth with a constant interlamellar spacing in the regular <b>plate</b> <b>eutectic,</b> as well as some transient processes that bring to the changes of that parameters. Obtained simulation data show the solid-liquid interface changes result in the termination of lamella and enlargement of interlamellar spacing. Another simulation results illustrate a pocket formation in the center of one phase that forestalls nucleation (or intergrowth) of the new lamellae of another phase.

40|$|A cermet {{composed}} of a metallic component (nickel) and a ceramic matrix (yttria stabilized zirconia) is commonly used as the anode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). In the present work we intend to improve the performance of Ni–YSZ anodes by surface laser melting. Symmetrical cells, consisting of two NiO–YSZ anodes (∼ 20 μm thickness) separated by a relatively thin YSZ electrolyte (∼ 500 μm) were fabricated by convectional ceramic techniques. Subsequently, laser melting treatments of both anodes were performed using a CO 2 laser system, producing a NiO–YSZ eutectic lamellar microstructure. Laser power of 100 W and processing rates of 1 mm s− 1 were determined as the optimum processing conditions. Symmetrical processed <b>plates</b> (<b>eutectic</b> sample) were electrically characterized by impedance spectroscopy (EIS), {{and the results were}} compared with non-processed plates (ceramic sample). Preliminary EIS results showed that the polarization resistance at higher temperatures (in the range of 900 °C) is about 0. 5 Ω cm 2 for both the eutectic and the ceramic sample. However, at lower temperatures (in the range of 800 °C) the polarization resistance for both samples differs considerably (2. 9 and 1. 6 Ω cm 2 for the ceramic and eutectic sample, respectively). These experiments confirmed that optimization of the microstructure by laser surface treatment plays {{a crucial role in the}} electrochemical properties of the anode cermets.

40|$|This {{sample is}} a casting alloy of {{eutectic}} composition. From the melt a eutectic is formed between aluminium solid solution and virtually pure silicon. Slow solidification produces a very coarse microstructure. The <b>eutectic</b> comprises large <b>plates</b> of silicon in the aluminium matrix. This microstructure displays poor ductility {{due to the}} brittleness of large silicon plates. The microstructure is normally refined through either rapid solidification, which lets the silicon phase assume a fibrous form, or by {{a process known as}} modification. It may be noted that primary aluminium dendrites can be seen, although the composition is very close to the eutectic point and an entirely eutectic microstructure might thus have been expected. This effect is a consequence of the strongly skewed nature of the eutectic "coupled zone" in the Al-Si system. The coupled zone represents the combinations of melt composition and interfacial undercooling (or growth velocity) for which (coupled) eutectic growth can occur. It can be plotted on the phase diagram by extending the two liquidus lines below the eutectic temperature. The Si liquidus line curves sharply back towards higher Si contents as the undercooling is increased. (This is associated with the facetted growth mode of the Si phase.) Thus, depending on growth conditions, a nominally eutectic alloy may solidify initially outside the coupled zone, leading to primary aluminium dendrite formation (before the melt composition rises sufficiently for the coupled zone to be entered and eutectic growth to occur).
