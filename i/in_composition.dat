5|$|Although Mendelssohn {{attributed}} {{great importance}} to musical education, and made a substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in Leipzig, he did not greatly enjoy teaching and took only a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities. Amongst such students were the composer William Sterndale Bennett, the pianist Camille-Marie Stamaty, the violinist and composer Julius Eichberg, and Walther von Goethe (grandson of the poet). At the Leipzig Conservatoire Mendelssohn taught classes <b>in</b> <b>composition</b> and ensemble playing.|$|E

5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different <b>in</b> <b>composition</b> and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Saint Petersburg music scene, Prokofiev {{developed}} a reputation as a musical rebel, while getting praise for his original compositions, which he performed himself on the piano. In 1909, he graduated from his class <b>in</b> <b>composition</b> with unimpressive marks. He continued at the Conservatory, studying piano under Anna Yesipova and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar <b>in</b> <b>composition</b> to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E

There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively.

5|$|Her {{essays on}} Pushkin and Poem Without a Hero, her longest work, were only {{published}} after her death. This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and {{also one of}} the finest poems of the twentieth century. It gives a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent <b>in</b> <b>composition</b> and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.|$|E

5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors <b>in</b> <b>composition.</b> When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an appropriate way to express herself.|$|E

5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a testo, a flat terra cotta or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived. It is sometimes cooked further in boiling water and then served. Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia <b>in</b> <b>composition,</b> and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of Al 1 −xInxN(101 ⎯⎯ 0) surfaces is investigated by cross-sectional scanning tunneling spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The surface exhibits empty Al and/or In-derived dangling bond states, which are calculated {{to be within}} the fundamental bulk band gap for <b>In</b> <b>compositions</b> smaller than 60 %. The energy of the lowest empty In-derived surface state is extracted from the tunnel spectra for lattice-matched Al 1 –xInxN with <b>In</b> <b>compositions</b> of x[*]=[*] 0. 19 and x[*]=[*] 0. 20 to be EC[*]−[*] 1. 82 [*]±[*] 0. 41 and EC[*]−[*] 1. 80 [*]±[*] 0. 56 [*]eV, respectively, in good agreement with the calculated energies. Under growth conditions, the Fermi level is hence pinned (unpinned) for <b>In</b> <b>compositions</b> smaller (larger) than 60 %. The analysis of the tunnel spectra suggests an electron affinity of ∼ 3. 5 [*]eV for nonpolar lattice-matched Al 1 –xInxN cleavage surfaces, which is large compared to linearly interpolated values of polar AlN and InN (0001) surfaces...|$|R
