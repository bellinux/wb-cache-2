She {{looked down at the}} fire sideways, drawing her dress away from it and making her proposal with a shy sincerity that added to her charm. Her charm was always great for Allan Wayworth, and the whole air of her house, which was simply a sort of distillation of herself, so soothing, so beguiling that he always made several false starts before departure. He had spent some such good hours there, had forgotten, in her warm, golden drawing-room, so much of the loneliness and so many of the worries of his life, that it had come to be the immediate answer to his longings, the cure for his aches, the harbour of refuge from his storms. His tribulations were not unprecedented, and some of his advantages, if of a usual kind, were marked in degree, inasmuch as he was very clever for one so young, and very independent for one so poor. He was eight-and-twenty, but he had lived a good deal and was full of ambitions and curiosities and disappointments. The opportunity to talk of some of these in Grosvenor Place corrected perceptibly the immense inconvenience of London. This inconvenience took for him principally the line of insensibility to Allan Wayworth's literary form. He had a literary form, or he thought he had, and her <b>intelligent</b> <b>recognition</b> of the circumstance was the sweetest consolation Mrs. Alsager could have administered. She was even more literary and more artistic than he, inasmuch as he could often work off his overflow (this was his occupation, his profession), while the generous woman, abounding in happy thoughts, but unedited and unpublished, stood there in the rising tide like the nymph of a fountain in the plash of the marble basin.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Intelligent</b> <b>recognition</b> of {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) signals is {{an important}} means for epilepsy detection. Almost all conventional <b>intelligent</b> <b>recognition</b> methods assume that the training and testing data of EEG signals have identical distribution. However, this assumption may indeed be invalid for practical applications {{due to differences in}} distributions between the training and testing data, making the conventional epilepsy detection algorithms not feasible under such situations. In order to overcome this problem, we proposed a transfer-learning-based <b>intelligent</b> <b>recognition</b> method for epilepsy detection. Methods: We used the large-margin-projected transductive support vector machine method (LMPROJ) to learn the useful knowledge between the training domain and testing domain by calculating the maximal mean discrepancy. The method can effectively learn a model for the testing data with training data of different distributions, thereby relaxing the constraint that the data distribution in the training and testing samples should be identical. Results: The experimental validation is performed over six datasets of electroencephalogram signals with three feature extraction methods. The proposed LMPROJ-based transfer learning method was compared with five conventional classification methods. For the datasets with identical distribution, the performance of these six classification methods was comparable. They all could achieve an accuracy of 90 %. However, the LMPROJ method obviously outperformed the five conventional methods for experimental datasets with different distribution between the training and test data. Regardless of the feature extraction method applied, the mean classification accuracy of the proposed method is above 93 %, which is greater than that of the other five methods with statistical significance. Conclusion: The proposed transfer-learning-based method has better classification accuracy and adaptability than the conventional methods in classifying EEG signals for epilepsy detection.

Doing so not only expands the applications of such systems, but also provide more insight into improvements to neural-based systems. Currently most implementations of graph neural networks are based on vertex filtering on fixed adjacency matrices. Although important for a lot of applications, vertex filtering restricts the applications to vertex focused graphs and cannot be efficiently extended to edge focused graphs like social networks. Applications of current systems are mostly limited to images and document references. Beyond the graph applications, this work also explored the usage of convolutional neural networks for <b>intelligent</b> character <b>recognition</b> in a novel way. Most systems define <b>Intelligent</b> Character <b>Recognition</b> as either a recurrent classification problem or image classification.

40|$|Abstract Target {{detection}} and tracking represent two fundamental steps in automatic video-based surveillance systems where {{the goal is}} to provide <b>intelligent</b> <b>recognition</b> capabilities by analyzing target behavior. This paper presents a framework for video-based surveillance where target detection is integrated with tracking to improve detection results. In contrast to methods that apply target {{detection and}} tracking sequentially and independently from each other, we feed the results of tracking back to the detection stage in order to adaptively optimize the detection threshold and improve system robustness. First, the initial target locations are extracted using background subtraction. To model the background, we employ Support Vector Regression (SVR) which is updated over time using an on-line learning scheme. Target detection is performed by thresholding the outputs of the SVR model. Tracking uses shape projection histograms to iteratively localize the targets and improve the confidence level of detection. For verification, additional information based on size, color and motion information is utilized. Feeding back the result...|$|E
