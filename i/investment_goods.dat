40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of the banking system in the {{economic}} transition process.

There are two production technologies, one for the production of a final good and the other for the production of an <b>investment</b> <b>good.</b> The return of caital invested in the <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> technology is stochastic. Banks collect the saving of households and finance the production of the <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> while respecting some prudential rules. We show that the capital accumulation is constituted of several phases and that the economic transition process depends on the fragility of the financial system defined as the degree of the credit market perfection and the bank’s inefficiency. Hence, efficient banks enables the economy to resist to bad performances of the <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> sector. However, in case of inefficient banks, the situation can degenerate in a confidence crisis in the banking system delaying the economic transition process by several years. We show that this negative impact is more severe when the economy is less developed. ...|$|R

We first show that local indeterminacy {{does not require}} external effects from labor but is fundamentaly based on externalities derived from capital in the <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> sector.

40|$|I offer {{differences}} in {{uncertainty of the}} industry-level investment environment as {{an explanation for the}} observed {{differences in}} the <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> price and output level across countries. I present a model economy where the tax rate on industry investment follows a stochastic process. In this environment, a higher level of uncertainty makes investment more inefficient (i. e. increase the expected cost of producing unit of capital), and this is reflected in higher <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> prices. An investigation of industry-level investment data across countries shows that the patterns of investment dynamics (i. e features or statistics of investment sequence) in relation to output level are consistent with the implication of the model. I assign model parameter values to countries of different output levels so that the simulated investment sequences from the model mimick the actual investment sequences. I find that uncertainty can accout for all of the observed differences in the <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> price, and {{a significant portion of the}} differences in the output level across countries.
