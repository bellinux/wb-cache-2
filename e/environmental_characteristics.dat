5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus <b>environmental</b> <b>characteristics</b> generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E

500|$|The {{route and}} the <b>environmental</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Missouri River in the {{northern}} Great Plains states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from channelization and impoundment prevent upstream migration. The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought {{an end to the}} seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the Fort Peck Dam in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and channelization, the Missouri River has lost over 90% of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than [...] of the Missouri River have been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged. These alterations of the river have had a detrimental impact on a number of native fish species. In the 13 U.S. states where the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered. Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades.|$|E

40|$|Undergraduate Research Exper. Phragmites australis, or common reed, is {{represented}} by several subspecies (haplotypes) in North America. The native haplotypes are important components of wetland ecosystems, while a non-native haplotype introduced {{in the nineteenth century}} has become an aggressive invader. The goals of this study were to characterize the native and invasive haplotype distribution of Phragmites in northern Michigan, to determine which <b>environmental</b> <b>characteristic</b> are correlated with native, invasive, and overall Phragmites success, and to analyze the trends so that local potential predictors of Phragmites variable distribution and success might be identified. Fourteen wetlands were surveyed for native and invasive Phragmites stands. Ten native and four invasive stands were sampled. Environmental variables (including temperature, pH, proximity to human development, surface moisture, water conductivity and DO) and variables related to Phragmites success (stand area and density, height and diameter of the tallest stem, and leaf litter depth) were measured. In addition, each Phragmites site was paired to a similar site with no Phragmites. The data was compared for native, invasive, and control sites using paired T-tests and regressions. Temperature, human development, and, to some extent, water pH were found to be significantly linked to Phragmites haplotype variable distribution and success. Despite the limitation of small sample size, these early trends could be of particular relevance for land managers working to protect wetlands and slow invasive success. Among the <b>environmental</b> <b>characteristic</b> variables, temperature measurements resulted in the most comparisons with significance. Increased temperature seems to be linked to increased invasive success and decreased native success, with potential implications regarding the affects of climate change on wetlands in northern Michigan...|$|R

Leptospirosis cases in Demak district increased for 4 year later. Until April 15 th 2008, there were 62 leptospirosis cases with CFR= 9, 67 %. The {{aim of this}} research was to determine <b>environmental</b> <b>characteristic</b> related to leptospirosis incidence in Demak district. Method: It was an observational research using a case control design with 44 cases and 44 controls. Cases were leptospirosis diagnosed by leptotek dri dot in Demak Health District Agency. Controls were neighbour of leptospirosis cases who didn’t have clinically symptom of leptospirosis, with age and sex appropiate to inclusion criteria. Laboratory diagnosis with leptotek dri dot had done for controls who agreed to sign inform consent. Data were analyzed using chi square test at α= 5 %. Variable with p value< 0, 25 would be continued with multivariat test using Regressi Logistic - Backward Likehood Ratio method. Result: The result of this research showed that there were 10 controls with no clinical diagnosis but positive at leptotek dri dot diagnosis. At statistical analysis 10 cases and 10 controls dropped. Univariat analysis showed controls and cases have environmental risk factor and knowledge, attitude, practice about leptospirosis similarly. Bivariat analysis showed there was no relationship between <b>environmental</b> <b>characteristic</b> and knowledge, attitude, practice with leptospirosis.
