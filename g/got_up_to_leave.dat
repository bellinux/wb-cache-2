500|$|Strindberg was {{susceptible}} to strong, independent career women, {{as well as}} to dainty, delicate-looking young girls; like his first and second wives—Siri von Essen and Frida Uhl—Bosse combined these qualities. He was entranced when he saw the dark, exotic-looking, petite twenty-two-year-old Bosse (who was often cast in sprite roles or what were conceptualized as [...] "Oriental" [...] roles) play her first major part, an impish Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. He immediately picked her out as a suitable actress for the part of The Lady in his coming play To Damascus, and invited [...] her to his bachelor establishment to discuss the role. At this famous first meeting, Strindberg, according to Bosse's narrative of the event, met her at the door all smiles and charm. Offering her wine, flowers, and beautifully arranged fruit, he shared with her his fascination with alchemy, showing her a golden brown mixture he told her was gold he had made. When she <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> Bosse claims Strindberg asked for the feather in her hat to use for writing his plays. [...] Bosse gave it to him, and he used this feather, with a steel nib insert, to write all his dramas during their marriage. [...] It is now in the Strindberg Museum in Stockholm.|$|E

60|$|Marian's {{eyes met}} mine affectionately--I could say no more. My heart was full, my lips were trembling. In spite of myself I {{was in danger}} of {{appealing}} to her pity. I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room. She rose at the same moment, laid her hand gently on my shoulder, and stopped me.|$|E
60|$|She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{take her}} <b>leave.</b> I {{asked if she}} {{proposed}} remaining in London. No; she was returning to her country patients that night.|$|R
60|$|Upon this Clara <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{take her}} <b>leave,</b> and the demonstrative affection of an embrace {{between the two}} women afforded a remedy for the awkwardness of the {{previous}} conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you have}} me betray my trust?" [...] said Robinson. [...] "Would you esteem me the more because I had deceived my partners? If you think that I am to earn your love in that way, you know but little of George Robinson." [...] Then he <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> {{preparing}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room, for his feelings were too many for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you, my child!" [...] said Lady Fitzgerald, as her son <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her. And {{then she}} embraced him with more warmth even than was her wont. [...] "All {{that we can}} do at present is to be gentle with him, and not to {{encourage}} people around him to talk of his illness." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Milborough, who {{had seen}} the angry brow, did not dare to suggest Naples again. But yet, if any word might be spoken to prevent this utter wreck of a home, how good a thing it would be! He had <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her, but she stopped him by holding his hand. [...] "For better, for worse, Louis; {{remember}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he asked}} if {{she thought she could}} be happy in his palace; and Beauty {{answered}} that everything was so beautiful that she would be very hard to please if she could not be happy. And after about an hour's talk Beauty began to think that the Beast was not nearly so terrible as she had supposed at first. Then he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her, and said in his gruff voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{understand}} that kind!" [...] I rejoined. Miss Spencer laid her hand upon her cousin's arm {{with a little}} pleased and fluttered movement; it was delightful to be among people who were on such easy terms with foreign tongues. I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave,</b> and asked Miss Spencer where, in Paris, I might have the honor of waiting upon her. To what hotel would she go? ...|$|R
6000|$|At last he {{said that}} he would think of it, and consult his partner; and then he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take his <b>leave.</b> [...] "For myself," [...] said Miss Stanbury, [...] "I would wish that all animosities might be buried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, aunt; but pray do not. I don't wish it." [...] Miss Baker {{of course}} obeyed, {{as she always}} did. And so George sat there, talking about {{anything}} or nothing, rather lack-a-daisically, till he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take his <b>leave.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I haven't {{consulted}} Nancy, {{or anyone}} else," [...] I replied--a little tartly, perhaps. [...] "You don't seem {{to realize that}} some fashions may have a basis of reason. They are not all silly, as Lucia seems to think. If Lammerton builds satisfactory houses, {{he ought to be}} forgiven for being the fashion, he ought to have a chance." [...] I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> [...] "Let's see what kind of a plan he'll draw up, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Both Lord Rufford and {{his sister}} were very much {{disturbed}} {{as to what they}} should do on the occasion. At half-past six Lord Rufford was told that the Major had recovered his senses, but that the case was almost hopeless. Of course he saw his guest. [...] "I'm all right," [...] said the Major. The Lord sat there by the bedside, holding the man's hand for a few moments, and then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him. [...] "No nonsense about putting off," [...] said the Major in a faint voice; [...] "beastly bosh all that!" ...|$|E
60|$|He was so {{cruel and}} so unjust, that I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him, {{without saying a}} word more. But, oh! he looked so forlorn and so submissive--sitting with his head down, and his hands crossed listlessly over his knees--that I could not find it in my heart to treat him harshly. Was I wrong? I don't know! I have no idea how to manage men--and no Madame Pratolungo now to teach me. Right or wrong, it ended in my sitting down by him again in the place which I had just left.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bungay {{presently}} {{had enough}} of this talk and <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave,</b> whereupon Warrington and Pen rose to depart with the publisher, though the latter {{would have liked to}} stay to make a further acquaintance with this family, who interested him and touched him. He said something about hoping for permission to repeat his visit, upon which Shandon, with a rueful grin, said he was always to be found at home, and should be delighted to see Mr. Pennington.|$|R
60|$|When Miss Harmer spoke, I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> at once <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> {{feeling a}} little ashamed of my own thoughtlessness, for papa had {{particularly}} warned me before I started, not to talk long; but I had quite forgotten his injunction, in the pleasure Mr. Harmer had evidently felt in listening to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd believe {{anything}} if I'd believe in your cousin." [...] Upon this Lefroy laughed, but made no further {{allusion to the}} romance which he had craftily invented {{on the spur of}} the moment. After that the two men sat without a word between them for a quarter of an hour, when the Englishman <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take his <b>leave.</b> [...] "Our business is over now," [...] he said, [...] "and I will bid you good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Countiss on {{my right}} and had shownt symtms of ixtream disgust at the beayvior of my relations, and having called for her carridg, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room, with the most dignified hair. I, of coarse, rose to conduct her to her weakle. Ah, what a {{contrast}} it was! There it stood, with stars and garters hall hover the pannels; the footmin in peach-colored tites; the hosses worth 3 hundred apiece;--and there stood the horrid LINNEN-CART, with 'Mary Blodder, Laundress, Ealing, Middlesex,' wrote on the bord, and waiting till my abandind old parint should come out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it is as}} bad as that. It is {{much worse}} than that, if you knew it all. You cannot {{conceive}} how low we have fallen. And now {{they tell me that}} my father will be found guilty, and will be sent to prison. Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances? What would you think of a girl who would allow herself to be in love in such a position? Had I been ten times engaged to you I would have broken it off." [...] Then she <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} playing the guitar. The miller <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and was {{followed}} by Mrs. Shchapoff. Hardly had she shut the door, when I heard, as though from far off, a deep drawn wail. The voice seemed familiar to me. Overcome with an unaccountable horror I rushed to the door, {{and there in the}} passage I saw a literal pillar of fire, in the middle of which, draped in flame, stood Mrs. Shchapoff. [...] . I rushed to put it out with my hands, but I found it burned them badly, as if they were sticking to burning pitch. A sort of cracking noise came from beneath the floor, which also shook and vibrated violently." [...] Mr. Portnoff and the miller [...] "carried off the unconscious victim".|$|E
6000|$|When Caldigate <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{take his}} <b>leave,</b> Robert Bolton offered {{to walk back}} to the town with him. He had {{expected}} to find his father, but would now look for him at the bank. They started together; and as they went Caldigate told his story to the young lady's half-brother. It occurred to him that of all the family Robert Bolton would be the most reasonable in such a matter; and that of all the family he might perhaps be the best able to give assistance. When Robert Bolton had heard it all, at first he whistled. Then he asked the following question. 'What did she say to you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indifference! Is sixty {{thousand}} pounds in one year, {{and more than}} double within three or four, indifference? I have paid too much to be indifferent. But it is hopeless to pay more. I have no hope for you; you are ruined, and I couldn't redeem you even if I would. I could not set you free and tell you to begin again, even were it wise to do so; and therefore I tell you to go. And now, good night; I have not another word to say to you," [...] and the earl <b>got</b> <b>up</b> as if <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room.|$|R
6000|$|Neither {{the lawyer}} nor his wife {{repeated}} {{any of those}} sententious admonitions, which had almost become rebukes, and which had been so common in their mouths. The fall with which they had threatened Phineas Finn had come upon him, and they were too generous {{to remind him of}} their wisdom and sagacity. Indeed, when he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take his <b>leave,</b> Mrs. Low, who probably might not see him again for years, was quite affectionate in her manners to him, and looked as if she were almost minded to kiss him as she pressed his hand. [...] "We will come and see you," [...] she said, [...] "when you are Master of the Rolls in Dublin." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Dale <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him, but {{she could}} not go without saying some word of {{gratitude}} for all that he had attempted to do for them. She well knew what he meant by the curing of difficulties. He had intended to signify that had they lived together for a week at Guestwick the idea of flitting from Allington might possibly have been abandoned. It seemed now to Mrs Dale as though her brother-in-law were heaping coals of fire on her head in return for that intention. She felt half-ashamed of what she was doing, almost acknowledging to herself that she should have borne with his sternness in return for the benefits he had done to her daughters. Had she not feared their reproaches she would, even now, have given way.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was nothing}} more to be got from her during the whole day than that. He told her in the evening {{that as soon as}} Miss Stanbury was well, he would come again;--that in any case he would come again. She sat quite still as he said this, with a solemn face,--but smiling at heart, {{laughing}} at heart, so happy! When she <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him, and was forced to give him her hand, he seized her in his arms and kissed her. [...] "That is very, very wrong," [...] she said, sobbing, and then ran to her room,--the happiest girl in all Exeter. He was to start early on the following morning, and she knew that she would not be forced to see him again. Thinking of him was so much pleasanter than seeing him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said she, as at her {{instance}} he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her {{and declared}} that he himself would attend upon her wants; [...] "no, no, my friend; I positively put a veto upon your doing so. What, in your own house, with an assemblage round you such as there is here! Do you wish to make every woman hate me and every man stare at me? I lay a positive order on you not to come near me again to-day. Come and see me at home. It is only at home that I can talk, it is only at home that I really can live and enjoy myself. My days of going out, days such as these, are rare indeed. Come and see me at home, Mr. Thorne, and then I will not bid you to leave me." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{member of}} more note was one Hugh Kelly, a second-rate author, who, as {{he became a}} kind of {{competitor}} of Goldsmith's, deserves particular mention. He was an Irishman, about twenty-eight years of age, originally apprenticed to a staymaker in Dublin; then writer to a London attorney; then a Grub Street hack, scribbling for magazines and newspapers. Of late he had set up for theatrical censor and satirist, and, in a paper called Thespis, in emulation of Churchill's Rosciad, had harassed many of the poor actors without mercy, and often without wit; but had lavished his incense on Garrick, who, in consequence, took him into favor. He was the author of several works of superficial merit, but which had sufficient vogue to inflate his vanity. This, however, must have been mortified on his first introduction to Johnson; after sitting a short time he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave,</b> expressing a fear that a longer visit might be troublesome. [...] "Not in the least, sir," [...] said the surly moralist, [...] "I had forgotten you were in the room." [...] Johnson used to speak of him as a man who had written more than he had read.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly, my dear; {{that is just}} it. Put her on her guard--that is {{all that}} is necessary. She is a dear, good, clever girl, and it would be very sad if {{anything}} were to interrupt our comfortable way of getting on with her." [...] Mrs. Robarts knew to a nicety the exact meaning of this threat. If Lucy would persist in securing to herself so much of Lord Lufton's time and attention, her visits to Framley Court must become less frequent. Lady Lufton would do much, very much, indeed, for her friends at the parsonage; but not even for them could she permit her son's prospects in life to be endangered. There was nothing more said between them, and Mrs. Robarts <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take her <b>leave,</b> having promised <b>to</b> speak to Lucy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; {{but there}} is a difference. A sum of money down, if a man is to marry, is better than a widow's dower. If she dies, you know, he looks so foolish. And she is grand and will want to spend everything. Is she much older than you, Mr. Clavering? Of course I know Julie's age, though perhaps you do not. What will you give me to tell?" [...] And the woman leered at him with a smile which made Harry think that she was almost more than mortal. He found himself quite unable to cope with her in conversation, and soon after this <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take his <b>leave.</b> [...] "You will come again," [...] she said. [...] "Do. I like you so much. And when Julie is in town, we shall be able to see her together, and I will be your friend. Believe me." ...|$|R
60|$|I said no more, and <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room. Thoughts were troubling {{me which}} I might {{have told her}} if we had spoken {{together}} longer, and which {{it might have been}} dangerous for her to know. The influence of the terrible dream from which she had awakened me hung darkly and heavily over every fresh impression which the progress of her narrative produced on my mind. I felt the ominous future coming close, chilling me with an unutterable awe, forcing on me the conviction of an unseen design in the long series of complications which had now fastened round us. I thought of Hartright--as I saw him in the body when he said farewell; as I saw him in the spirit in my dream--and I too began to doubt now whether we were not advancing blindfold to an appointed and an inevitable end.|$|E
60|$|But Thomas {{had nothing}} to say beyond what he had said before to Mrs. French. He was very particular, he said, about money; and certain money matters made it {{incumbent}} on him not to marry before the 29th of April. When Camilla suggested to him that as she was to be his wife, she ought to know all about his money matters, he told her that she should,--some day. When they were married, he would tell her all. Camilla talked a great deal, and said some things that were very severe. Mr. Gibson did not enjoy his morning, but he endured the upbraidings of his fair one with more firmness than might perhaps have been expected from him. He left all the talking to Camilla; but when he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her, the 29th of April had been fixed, with some sort of assent from her, as the day on which she was really to become Mrs. Gibson.|$|E
60|$|A Parliament, however, {{was still}} in existence, and {{was not to be}} won. On the twentieth of January, one {{thousand}} six hundred and twenty-nine, SIR JOHN ELIOT, a great man who had been active in the Petition of Right, brought forward other strong resolutions against the King's chief instruments, and called upon the Speaker to put them to the vote. To this the Speaker answered, 'he was commanded otherwise by the King,' and <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the chair--which, according to the rules of the House of Commons would have obliged it to adjourn without doing anything more--when two members, named Mr. HOLLIS and Mr. VALENTINE, held him down. A scene of great confusion arose among the members; and while many swords were drawn and flashing about, the King, who was kept informed of all that was going on, told the captain of his guard {{to go down to the}} House and force the doors. The resolutions were by that time, however, voted, and the House adjourned. Sir John Eliot and those two members who had held the Speaker down, were quickly summoned before the council. As they claimed it to be their privilege not to answer out of Parliament for anything they had said in it, they were committed to the Tower. The King then went down and dissolved the Parliament, in a speech wherein he made mention of these gentlemen as 'Vipers'--which did not do him much good that ever I have heard of.|$|E
6000|$|... "I like you," [...] said Ralph. But {{he did not}} propose on that evening. Lady Eardham {{thought he}} ought to have done so, and was angry with him. It was {{becoming}} almost a matter of necessity with her that young men should not take much time. Emily was twenty-seven, and Josephine was a most difficult child to manage,--not pretty, but yet giving herself airs and expecting everything. She had refused a clergyman with a very good private fortune, greatly to her mother's sorrow. And Gus had already been the source of much weary labour. Four eldest sons had been brought to her feet and been allowed to slip away; and all, as Lady Eardham said, because Gus would [...] "joke" [...] with other young men, while the one man should have received all her pleasantry. Emily was quite of opinion that young Newton should by no means have been allotted to Gus. Lady Eardham, who had played bésique with an energy against which Josephine would have mutinied but that some promise was made as to Marshall and Snelgrove, could see from her little table that young Newton was neither abject nor triumphant in his manner. He had not received nor had he even asked when he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take his <b>leave.</b> Lady Eardham could have boxed his ears; but she smiled upon him ineffably, pressed his hand, and in the most natural way in the world alluded to some former allusion about riding and the park.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the ears}} be too {{delicate}} {{to hear the}} truth, the mind will be too perverse to profit by it." [...] And then Mr. Crawley <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take his <b>leave.</b> But Lady Lufton insisted that he should go with her to luncheon. He hummed and ha'd and would fain have refused, but on this subject she was peremptory. It might be that she was unfit to advise a clergyman as to his duties, but {{in a matter of}} hospitality she did know what she was about. Mr. Crawley should not leave the house without refreshment. As to this, she carried her point; and Mr. Crawley--when the matter before him was cold roast-beef and hot potatoes, instead of the relative position of a parish priest and his parishioner--became humble, submissive, and almost timid. Lady Lufton recommended Madeira instead of sherry, and Mr. Crawley obeyed at once, and was, indeed, perfectly unconscious of the difference. Then there was a basket of seakale in the gig for Mrs. Crawley; that he would have left behind had he dared, but he did not dare. Not a word was said to him as to the marmalade for the children which was hidden under the seakale, Lady Lufton feeling well aware that that would find its way to its proper destination without any necessity for his co-operation. And then Mr. Crawley returned home in the Framley Court gig.|$|R
