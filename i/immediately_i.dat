25|$|When I {{returned}} to IP in 1962 {{as president and}} editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon <b>immediately.</b> <b>I</b> also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll and office expenses, and also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|E

500|$|In April, Dodd campaigned in New Hampshire, Iowa, and {{returned}} to South Carolina. While on the trail Dodd participated in a virtual town hall sponsored by the website MoveOn.org.

[...] he answered, [...] "We ought to start redeploying this evening...We ought to begin <b>immediately.</b> <b>I</b> would not wait any longer." [...] Continuing on the trail, Dodd sponsored what was called by the Washington Post, the [...] "most radical plan" [...] to combat global warming. It included a corporate carbon tax to be levied on corporations to reduce carbon emissions. The plan is part of a larger energy platform of the campaign.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, it was {{revealed}} on Tegan and Sara Quinn's official website that they were writing new material for their seventh studio album: [...] " [...] are back in our home studios working away at more songs. We’re {{really looking forward to}} making a new record now. Our hope is to be in the studio by early 2012." [...] "I'm Not Your Hero" [...] was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she [...] "was haunted by it almost <b>immediately.</b> <b>I</b> found the verses to be quintessential Sara." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and <b>immediately</b> <b>I</b> wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E
2500|$|The son of {{an estate}} agent from a working-class background, Robert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. On Christmas Day 1957, aged 11, he got a [...] "very cheap" [...] guitar from his parents, saying [...] "almost <b>immediately</b> <b>I</b> knew that this guitar {{was going to be}} my life". Fripp took guitar lessons with {{teachers}} Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike, which quickly advanced his skills: at 11 years of age, he was playing rock, moving on to traditional jazz at 13 and modern jazz at 15. At this time he was influenced by such modern jazz players and composers as Charlie Parker and Charlie Mingus.|$|E

2500|$|The {{steamship}} tickets he {{had bought}} that morning for the return to Europe with Caresse were in his pocket. The coroner also found in his pocket a cable from Josephine addressed to Crosby on the Mauretania before they arrived in New York: [...] "CABLE GEORGE WHEN YOU ARRIVE AND WHERE I CAN TELEPHONE YOU <b>IMMEDIATELY.</b> <b>I</b> AM IMPATIENT." [...] A second cable from another girl simply said, [...] "YES." [...] A picture of Zora, the 13-year-old girl {{he had sex with}} in Egypt, was reportedly found in his wallet. The coroner reported that Crosby's toenails were painted red, and that he had a Christian cross tattooed on the sole of one foot and a pagan icon representing the sun on the other. The coroner concluded that Josephine had died at least two hours before Crosby. There was no suicide note, and newspapers ran sensational articles for days about the murder or suicide pact—they could not decide which.|$|E

Benefiting from early detection through a doctor-ordered MRI, the cancer is not life-threatening. Christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery. No further statement will be issued at this time." [...] On August 19, 2008, it was announced that Applegate was cancer free after a double mastectomy, though cancer was found in only one breast. She has an inherited genetic trait, a BRCA1 mutation, which can trigger breast cancer. Her mother, Nancy Priddy, is a breast cancer survivor. Applegate said when she first was diagnosed, [...] "I was just shaking and then also <b>immediately,</b> <b>I</b> had to go into 'take-care-of-business-mode' which included a change to a more healthy diet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The German missionaries Johannes Rebmann of Mombasa and Krapf {{were the}} first Europeans {{to try to reach}} the snowy mountain. According to English {{geographer}} Halford Mackinder and English explorer Harry Johnston, Rebmann in 1848 was the first European to report the existence of Kilimanjaro. Hans Meyer has claimed that Rebmann first arrived in Africa in 1846 and has quoted Rebmann's diary entry of 11 May 1848 as saying, [...] "This morning, at 10 o'clock, we obtained a clearer view of the mountains of Jagga, the summit of one of which was covered by what looked like a beautiful white cloud. When I inquired as to the dazzling whiteness, the guide merely called it 'cold' and at once I knew it could be neither more nor less than snow.... <b>Immediately</b> <b>I</b> understood how to interpret the marvelous tales Dr. Krapf and I had heard at the coast, of a vast mountain of gold and silver in the far interior, the approach to which was guarded by evil spirits." [...] In light of these sources, J. Shearson Hyland's assertion that Rebmann first saw the mountain in 1840 appears to be erroneous.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost <b>immediately</b> <b>I</b> knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
