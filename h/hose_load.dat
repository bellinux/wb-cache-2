50|$|A {{hose lay}} or <b>hose</b> <b>load</b> is a {{preconfigured}} arrangement of fire hose that facilitates deployment under high-stress, high-danger situations.|$|E
5000|$|Generally {{it takes}} several {{individuals}} {{to build a}} <b>hose</b> <b>load,</b> at least one on each end. A third person handing the hose to the two individuals on the ends facilitates the process. After the desired length of hose is connected, and sometimes the air removed from the interior with a fire hose vacuum, it is laid in a compartment or hose bed in a predetermined manner {{depending on the type}} of lay being built. Almost always the nozzle or female end or both are made easily accessible from the exterior. In the case of a [...] "pre-connect", the female coupling is attached to a discharge on the engine, making deployment even faster.|$|E

25|$|Remembering the {{effective}} use of propaganda in the leadup to the second World War, the opposing camps later began berating one another with enormous signs displaying loud political slogans, facing {{each other across the}} border zone. That on the western side was erected first, in direct response to the ban on sales of Western newspapers in East Berlin, and comprised an illuminated display board 30 m wide and 1.5 m deep, facing east, supported on three steel lattice towers 25 m high and topped by the words DIE FREIE BERLINER PRESSE MELDET (The Free Berlin Press Announces). Important messages were spelt out on the display board using up to 2,000 bulbs. The sign was switched on {{for the first time on}} 10 October 1950, watched by a large crowd. A month later, on 18 November, the Communist authorities in the east ordered its destruction using a catapult made from a compressed air <b>hose</b> <b>loaded</b> with pebbles and small pieces of metal. However, the order was not executed and the sign lasted until 1974, an eventual victim of its own high maintenance costs.|$|R
50|$|To load or unload a ship, a <b>hose</b> or <b>loading</b> arm {{is needed}} to follow the {{movement}} of the ship due to the dynamics of changing draft, changing tide, wind and other factors.A Marine Loading Arm offers a significant improvement over a hose in the transfer of liquids between vessel and shore because It provides an easier and more ergonomic operation, gives longer service life and permits Emergency Release Action without any spillage of product and without any pollution.|$|R
50|$|Additional duties include {{communicating}} with the vessel person-in-charge utilizing a portable intrinsically safe two-way radio, spotting the vessel during arrival to ensure the vessel headers are lined up with the dock header, secure and proper placement of the gangway, operating the dock crane while positioning the transfer hose from the dock to the vessel, assisting in connecting the transfer <b>hose</b> or <b>loading</b> arm to the vessel product manifold, and during the transfer monitoring the movement {{on a regular basis}} maintaining an hourly log.|$|R

50|$|A tank {{container}} can be loaded and unloaded {{from the top}} and the bottom. On a standard {{tank container}} there is a manhole {{and at least one}} valve on the top, and there is a valve at the bottom. Loading and unloading is done by connecting <b>hoses</b> of the <b>loading</b> and unloading facility to the valves of the tank. The loading or unloading is often done using a pump. Depending on the installation and regulation of certain products, it is determined how the tank container should be loaded or unloaded.|$|R

5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo <b>hoses</b> or marine <b>loading</b> arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|R
40|$|A generic, {{quantitative}} {{risk assessment}} was carried out according to the standard method in the 'Purple Book' to determine the risks posed by pontoons used for supplying fuel to watercraft. The pontoon {{is assumed to be}} situated in a yacht basin accessible only to pleasure boats, and the tank lorry during unloading assumed to be protected against external impact from passing traffic. The reference system defined consists of a concrete pontoon with a relatively large capacity and a high volume of trade. Applying the reference pontoon system led to individual risk contours of 10 - 5 and 10 - 6 per year, which almost coincide. The distance of these risk contours to both the pontoon and the tank lorry is about 20 metres. The risk posed by the pontoon is largely determined by the pool fire within the pontoon and a rupture in the <b>loading</b> <b>hose,</b> which could take place during transhipment from the tank lorry to the pontoon...|$|R

40|$|Framo Engineering has {{replaced}} tanker loading unit (TLU) by a Framo submerged loading (FSL) system at Draugen, with 257 m water depth, in summer 2012. In recent years {{a lot of}} activities {{of oil and gas}} companies including drilling and exporting of oil and gas have been performed in deep and ultra deep waters. The increasing water depth also means {{that it is necessary to}} develop the riser technology to access these depths. The main purpose of this master thesis was the development of the existing FSL system and considering the feasibility of the system for operating in deep water (1000 m). The first challenging step of this master thesis was to modify the existing FSL system RIFLEX model for deep water. It included modification of the existing steel riser, the buoyancy tank, the <b>loading</b> <b>hose</b> and the pick-up system. Based on DNV-OS-F 201 standard, the thickness of steel riser was selected to resist internal and external overpressure as well as the other design criteria mentioned in DNV standard. The buoyancy tank length was changed in order to provide the required top tension as well as a reasonable offset. The <b>loading</b> <b>hose</b> length was increased as the system offset as well as tanker offset in 1000 m water depth and harsh environment is much larger than in the Draugen with 257 m water depth and moderate environment. After creating the preliminary submerged loading system model, the global analysis of the deep water submerged loading system was conducted in SIMA. Subsequently, the sensitivity studies with respect to different parameters were performed in order to ensure that the theoretical models and numerical approximations represent the real physical behaviour of the submerged loading system model. Finally, based on the obtained results in previous analyses, the deep water submerged loading system was modified and the global analysis results were presented in this report. It must be noted that this design procedure is an iterative process. Therefore, in order to present the final submerged loading system model, fatigue and VIV analyses of the system must be executed that are out of scope of this master thesis. The modified submerged loading system model sustained lower axial tension and bending moment when the buoyancy tank length decreases to 18. 6 m and also the buoyancy tank diameter increases to 7. 5 m compared to the preliminary model when the buoyancy tank had 42. 6 m length and 5 m diameter. Moreover, Catchwheel system was proposed as the pick-up system for the deep water submerged loading system. Although, the Catchwheel system has to be designed and verified in more details, it is a simple and well-performed system which can be easily replaced and repaired because it is located close to the sea surface. Finally, it was concluded that the submerged loading system is feasible for 1000 m water depth. However, more verification as well as fatigue and VIV analyses of the presented system are necessary to obtain the final submerged loading system model. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the work}} to develop the vision system for the Emulsion Loading Automation Project (ELAP) is presented. The ELAP project was a {{collaborative}} effort among various team members to develop an intelligent system to automate the complex task of an emulsion loader used in underground mining operations. The vision system was tasked with the challenging imaging requirements of locating and identifying drill-holes in the rock face of an underground mine, and to provide visual guidance for the <b>hose</b> guide to <b>load</b> the drill-holes with emulsion. The {{first part of this}} thesis outlines the development of image processing algorithms to segment and identify drill-holes present in an image acquired from a video stream. This involved applying thresholding and morphological techniques to preprocess the image to improve contrast, separate touching objects, and fill any holes. A pattern recognition model was then developed using drill-hole feature data to classify segmented objects as either drill-holes or background artifacts. The second part of this thesis presents the work performed for visual guidance to position the robotic boom in front of a drill-hole for loading. Using a camera mounted {{to the end of a}} robotic boom, camera and hand-eye calibration routines were developed to transform the drill-hole image object to both the camera and end-effector reference frames. A visual guidance algorithm was then developed using the calibration parameters to visual servo the robotic boom to a drill-hole for loading. Finally, testing performed in an underground mine after the critical subsystems were integrated and operational, verified the vision system operation as designed...|$|R
40|$|Some {{years ago}} a root cause {{analysis}} was made of a large oil spill caused by a leak in an oil offloading system. It appeared that the leak {{was caused by a}} large pressure pulse initiated by the sudden closure of the bow loading valve at the tanker, called water hammer. The magnitude of the initial pulse was largely amplified by reflections at several diameter changes. Similar phenomena can occur in (offshore) LNG transfer systems with even more serious consequences. In addition to the water hammer "column separation" may cause even larger pressure pulses. This occurs when, due to a passing water hammer wave, the pressure locally drops to the vapor pressure and the liquid starts to boil. As the LNG in a transfer system is close to its boiling conditions, this phenomenon is likely to occur. In order to evaluate to what extent water hammer and column separation can endanger the integrity of the system a computer model has been made of three generic ship-to-ship transfer systems. The peak pressures during an emergency release of the flexible transfer hose at full flow have been calculated. The sensitivity for length of the hose, closure time and wave propagation speed has been evaluated. In spite of the modeling uncertainties the results show that water hammer and column separation can cause shock loads that are an order of magnitude larger than the static loads. Therefore it is recommended to perform an analysis as part of the design and to optimize the layout of the system. It is suggested to include this as a requirement in the applicable design codes. Also it is recommended to test components such as flexible <b>hoses</b> on dynamic <b>loads</b> caused by water hammer...|$|R
40|$|The Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) {{concept is}} a ship shaped {{production}} platform frequently {{used on the}} Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). One of the main advantages of a FPSO is that the produced oil {{can be stored in}} the cargo tanks and offloaded to shuttle tankers by tandem offloading. Tandem offloading means that a <b>loading</b> <b>hose</b> from the stern of the FPSO is connected to the bow of the shuttle tanker. The shuttle tankers will then transport the oil to an oil terminal at shore or directly to the market. Tandem offloading is a safety critical and weather sensitive operation. Adverse weather conditions such as wave heights, polar lows, sea ice, etc., influences the offloading operation considerably. The shuttle tankers will normally be allowed to start the operation, if the significant wave height is below 4, 5 m and stop if the wave height increases to above 5, 5 m. A small storage capacity on the FPSO could lead to multiple offloading operations resulting in low regularity for the shuttle tanker operation and transportation. The storage capacity on the FPSO should allow for a full load for the shuttle tanker and also have some margin in order to include uncertainties in the offloading and transportation chain. Typical shuttle tankers have capacities in the range of 550. 000 – 850. 000 barrels. The oil companies have long experience with tandem loading on the NCS. However, offshore field developments are now moving further north into the Barents Sea and we are in subarctic area. The Goliat and Johan Castberg projects are example on such developments. These new areas have challenges related to sub-arctic climate and weather conditions. There is also a long transportation route, if the oil should be transported directly to the market in Europe. A fleet of dedicated purpose built shuttle tankers may be needed for a field development in this area. The cost related to offloading and transportation of oil is significant and the following three main questions need to be addressed; 1. How large should be the FPSO storage capacity in order to secure sufficient offloading regularity? 2. How many shuttle tankers are needed and what should be the capacity in order to ensure sufficient regularity of the transportation? 3. How significant wave height, sea ice & polar lows influence the FPSO storage capacity? For commercial, safety and efficiency reasons, these three questions need to be considered in early phase of the design. The optimal answer depends on many parameters;  Oil production profile for the FPSO  Actual weather condition and weather limitations criteria  Connecting and disconnecting time  Pump capacity for the oil transfer  Sailing route and distance to the market  Regularity requirements  Shuttle tankers capacity  Cost for FPSO storage Using Johan Castberg oil production rate, typical shuttle tanker capacities, wave limitation criteria, time taken by shuttle tankers to travel on 1. 5 m thick sea ice and 48 hours duration polar lows in the vicinity of FPSO, this dissertation intend to optimize the storage capacity for the FPSO. It is assumed that produced oil from Johan Castberg field is transported using shuttle tankers to Murmansk oil terminal located in Russia. The reason for assuming a specific field and oil terminal is to gather input parameters, such as production rate, hindcast data, maritime distance in ice infested waters etc. The case study is performed with shuttle tanker capacity of 850, 000 bbls. Otherwise, the adopted concept in this dissertation will be general i. e., to serve the wide variety of situations and geographical locations. In conclusion, the entire exercise undergone in this dissertation is presented as a model, in a “User friendly” Excel spread sheet format for future use...|$|R
