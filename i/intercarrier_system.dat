5000|$|Whereas in <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system</b> RF {{amplifiers}} {{are common}} {{for both the}} visual and aural signals, in split sound system visual and aural transmitters have separate RF amplifiers. Thus, all else being equal, the power consumption of the split sound system is more {{than that of the}} <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|This common signal {{processing}} system {{is known as}} <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|In split {{sound system}} a high power {{diplexer}} is {{used at the}} output of the RF amplifiers. Such diplexers are expensive and bulky. In <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system</b> where the combining is achieved at a low level stage no diplexer is used.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes several specific, near-term {{steps that}} will {{accelerate}} broadband investment in unserved areas {{and set the}} Universal Service Fund and <b>Intercarrier</b> Compensation <b>system</b> on a path {{that is consistent with}} the principles the Commission has proposed; the Commission then describes alternatives for completing the reform process over the longer term. The Commission intends to monitor the progress of the near-term reforms and adjust course as necessary as the Commission completes the reform process from among the longer-term options.

5000|$|In TV receivers, the {{received}} {{radio frequency}} signal is converted to IF in tuner and then demodulated. The output of the demodulator consists of a VF and an aural signal which is in fact an FM subcarrier modulated by AF. (The subcarrier is 5.5 MHz in system B and 4.5 MHz in system M [...] ) The aural signal and the VF are separated by a simple filter. The only extra stage needed for AF (other than the loudspeaker) is an FM demodulator. [...] The <b>intercarrier</b> receiver <b>system</b> makes for easier tuning of a TV station. The viewer could fine tune such a set {{to get the best}} picture reception, and not lose sound reception. (Although AF VF signals are combined in the IF stages of the transmitters, they are separated in baseband stages of the receivers.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Intercarrier</b> <b>system</b> : There are two input stages one for AF {{and one for}} VF. But the two {{signals are}} {{combined}} in low power IF circuits (i.e., after modulators) The mixer and the amplifiers are common to both signals and the system needs no high power combiners. So both {{the price of the}} transmitter and the power consumption is considerably lower than that of split sound system of the same power level. But two signals passing through amplifiers produce some intermodulation products. So <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system</b> is not suitable for high power applications and even at lower power transmitters a notch filter to reject the cross modulation products must be used at the output.|$|E
50|$|In <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system</b> the two IF signals may {{interfere}} {{with each other to}} produce interference products out of the operating channel. In order to protect the neighbouring channels a notch filter is used. In split sound no interference products appear at the output, so no filter is needed.|$|E
50|$|Analogue {{television}} receivers using system M: 41.25 MHz (audio) and 45.75 MHz (video). Note, {{the channel}} is flipped {{over in the}} conversion process in an <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system,</b> so the audio IF frequency {{is lower than the}} video IF frequency. Also, there is no audio local oscillator, the injected video carrier serves that purpose.|$|E
50|$|In TV {{broadcasting}} the intermodulation {{products of}} the aural subcarrier and the main carrier appear out of the RF band of the TV channel. However, out of band product means an unwanted transmission in the neighbour TV channels. For example, intermodulation products of channel 7 appear in channel 5,6, 8 and 9. That is why notch filters are used in <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Split {{sound is}} an old system in analog {{television}} transmitters. It has long been superseded, but transmitters working on this principle are still in use. In this system there are two almost independent transmitters, one for sound (aural) and one for picture (visual). The system requires more energy input relative to broadcast energy than the alternative system known as <b>intercarrier</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
