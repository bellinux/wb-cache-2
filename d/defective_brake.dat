50|$|A train whistle {{gets them}} all rushing {{out onto the}} platform, {{but it is a}} slow {{stopping}} train pulling only one coach and one truck. The driver and fireman get off, holding a <b>defective</b> <b>brake</b> wheel, and go to the office to telephone the depot. Whilst there, they make a cup of tea each, and load it with pills from the saccharine bottle.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 another change started, Driver Only Operated (DOO), {{after a short}} {{training}} session on the wagons which basically showed how to isolate a <b>defective</b> <b>brake.</b> MGR trains in the Worksop and Shirebrook areas to West Burton and Cottam started running. These trains initially had a yellow painted tail lamp to identify that the train was DOO. As the system rapidly developed in all areas {{the use of these}} yellow tail lamps was discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|Bus company Lincolnshire RoadCar {{appeared}} {{in court in}} connection with the accident in February 2005, potentially facing a charge of operating a vehicle with <b>defective</b> <b>brakes,</b> which the company denied.|$|R
50|$|Following a trial, {{the coach}} company’s {{contractor}} received a suspended 18-month prison sentence {{and a fine}} of 25,000 French francs. This was because the vehicle {{was found to have}} had seriously <b>defective</b> <b>brakes.</b> One of the drivers received a suspended 6-month prison sentence, his driving licence was suspended and he was fined 2,300 francs. The insurance company had to pay out 12 million francs to the victims’ families.|$|R
25|$|The federal {{government}} offered to provide 80% {{of the funds}} for design and production of the USSLRV {{in exchange for a}} commitment to keep the cars in service for at least 25 years, but the cars, as-delivered, were prone to jammed doors, <b>defective</b> <b>brakes</b> and motors, leaky roofs, mechanical breakdowns, and were involved in several accidents. Muni Metro added 30 more cars to the fleet; these 30 had been rejected by MBTA after suffering numerous breakdowns.|$|R

40|$|The {{friction}} forces generated during braking between brake pads and discs produce high thermal gradients on the rubbing surfaces. These thermal gradients may cause braking {{problems such as}} brake fade, premature wear or hot spotting and the associated hot judder phenomenon in the frequency range below 100 Hz. Further consequences are comfort reductions, a <b>defective</b> <b>braking</b> process, inhomogeneous wear, cutbacks of the brake performance and even damage of brake components. The present paper proposes a modeling concept that is targeted on this field of application and introduces the new Modelica class ThermoelasticPlate, which is implemented in the DLR FlexibleBodies library...|$|R
5000|$|An inquest at Skipton Town Hall, in July 1975, {{recorded}} a verdict of accidental {{death on the}} victims. Jury foreman John Mitchell said the accident {{was caused by the}} inability of the driver to negotiate the bend, owing to deficient brakes on the coach, due to possible lack of care in the maintenance of the braking system. The pathologist reported that the main cause of the loss of life was the crushing of the victims between the seats. The proprietor of the coach company was later fined £75 (...) for running a motor vehicle with <b>defective</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

60|$|When {{they drove}} out of town, in the morning, they found Milt waiting by the road, and he {{followed}} them till noon. By urgent request, he shared a lunch, and lectured upon going down long grades in first or second speed, to save brakes; upon {{the use of the}} retarded spark and the slipped clutch in climbing. His bug was beside the Gomez in the line-up at the Park gate, when the United States Army came to seal one's firearms, and to inquire on which mountain one intended to be killed by <b>defective</b> <b>brakes.</b> He was just behind her all the climb up to Mammoth Hot Springs.|$|R

5000|$|Carr {{claimed that}} when {{examining}} causation in history, historians {{should seek to}} find [...] "rational" [...] causes of historical occurrences, that is causes that can be generalized across time to explain other occurrences in other times and places. For Carr, historical [...] "accidents" [...] can not be generalized, and thus not worth the historian's time. Carr illustrated his theory by telling {{a story of a}} man named Robinson who went out to buy some cigarettes one night, and was killed by an automobile with <b>defective</b> <b>brakes</b> driven by a drunk driver named Jones on a sharp turn of the road. Carr argued one could contend that the [...] "real" [...] reasons for the accident that killed Robinson might be the <b>defective</b> <b>brakes</b> or the sharp turn of the road or the inebriated state of Jones, but that to argue that it was Robinson's wish to buy cigarettes was the cause of his death, that while a factor was not the [...] "real" [...] cause of his death. As such, Carr argued that those who were seeking to prevent a repeat of Robinson's death would do well to pass laws regulating drunk driving, straightening the sharp turn of the road and the quality of automobile brakes, but would be wasting their time passing a law forbidding people to take a walk to buy cigarettes. In a not too subtle dig at critics of determinism like Sir Karl Popper and Sir Isaiah Berlin, Carr spoke of the inquiry into Robinson's death being interrupted by two [...] "distinguished gentlemen" [...] who maintained quite vehemently that it was Robinson's wish to buy cigarettes that caused his death. In the same way, Carr argued that historians needed to find the [...] "real" [...] causes of historical events by finding the general trend which could inspire {{a better understanding of the}} present than by focusing on the role of the accidental and incidental.|$|R
5000|$|... cyclists in Denmark {{can receive}} a fine for cycling without lights {{after a certain}} time of day; using a {{hand-held}} mobile phone while cycling; having <b>defective</b> <b>brakes,</b> reflectors, etc.; cycling against a red light; cycling against the direction of traffic; cycling on a pedestrian crossing; cycling {{on the left side}} of a bicycle path; not respecting traffic signs or arrows; breaking the unconditional right of way; not signaling; cycling with no hands on the handlebars; cycling on the sidewalk or footpath; holding onto another vehicle; cycling with two people on a bicycle that only has one seat (both persons will receive a fine); or positioning oneself in the wrong place before or while making a turn. Cyclists can also receive a warning if their bell does not work. Even though there is no fixed blood alcohol level above which it is illegal to ride a bicycle, cyclists can receive a fine for cycling under the influence if the police assess that doing so would be irresponsible.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2009, {{a junior}} {{transport}} minister, the Gillingham MP Paul Clark, spelt {{out a series}} of concerns to National Express in a letter following a meeting with an employee of National Express East Coast who lives in his constituency. The worker claimed that due to reduced maintenance checks, some trains were in use with <b>defective</b> <b>brakes,</b> an allegation strongly denied by the company, which said it would [...] "never compromise on safety". He wrote: [...] "As a result of reduced maintenance checks, 'some long-haul sets trains are in use with brake defects'. Increasing cuts in staff combined with an increasing pressure to ensure that trains run safely has resulted in fears among staff that a major accident is 'just around the corner'." [...] Passengers, he added, [...] "have been 'poisoned' as a result of coffee machines not being cleaned correctly, with cleaning fluids left in situ". The minister said he was [...] "shocked and appalled at the information with which I've been provided. You will understand that these allegations are exceptionally serious".|$|R

25|$|On 13 March 1935, {{an express}} meat train from Liverpool to London {{was brought to}} a halt at Kings Langley due to a <b>defective</b> vacuum <b>brake.</b> Due to a signalman's error a milk train ran into its rear. Wreckage spread across all four lines, {{with the result that}} a few minutes later the Camden to Holyhead freight {{collided}} with the debris, followed a few seconds later by the Toton to Willesden coal train. All four lines were blocked for some time and the driver of the milk train was killed. Contemporaneous newsreel footage shows the aftermath of the four-fold accident.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to supporting mechanical loads, railroad wheels serve an important function as brake drums in freight car air brake systems. Railway wheel removals in service {{can be caused}} by many factors including tread wear, flange wear, improper use of the handbrake, <b>defective</b> air <b>brakes,</b> manufacturing defects, and various other reasons. Past reviews of Association of American Railroads (AAR) car repair billing (CRB) data show that many North American freight car wheel removals are for wheel/rail sliding-related defects such as spalling, slid flats, built-up-tread and out-of-round. In this paper, year 2001 wheel removal data for a fleet of coal cars owned by a major Midwestern utility are reviewed and compared. Differences between wheel removal data for steel and aluminum cars in the coal car fleet are discussed, with emphasis on possible causes. Also, differences between AAR CRB wheel removal data and wheel removal data for the coal car fleet are discussed, with emphasis on possible causes. Recommendations are also offered...|$|R

All four lines were blocked for some time, William Buckley, the milk train's driver was killed and the guard of the meat train and fireman of the goods train were injured. The signalman of King's Langley Block had accepted the meat train from the previous block at Nash Mills at 23:03, but didn't receive the train and had a phone call with the Nash Mills signalman at 23:05 to ask about the train, in which he believed that the train Nash Mills wanted him to take was a passenger train that passed earlier, so he cleared his signals for the milk train, not realizing that the meat train had entered his section and broken down due to a vacuum brake failure and was only just proceeding when the milk train collided.|$|R
