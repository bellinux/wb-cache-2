40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the {{practical}} issues that the management of container inventory is difficult, time-consuming and overuse of manpower in manufacturing enterprises. A method is presented for the material container inventory management, that is, through radio frequency identification technology to achieve positioning and quantity of material containers. Then, the traditional manual inventory becomes automatic inventory which occurs at <b>each</b> <b>container’s</b> transfer process. The material container inventory management based on RFID is designed in the paper through {{the introduction of the}} applied RFID technology, architecture system design, hardware selection and software design. At last the practicability and superiority of the system is tested by run the system in a factory...|$|R
2500|$|In 1955 {{trucking}} magnate Malcom McLean bought Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, to form {{a container}} shipping enterprise, later known as Sea-Land. The first containers were supplied by Brown, where McLean met Keith Tantlinger, and hired him as vice-president of engineering and research. Under the supervision of Tantlinger, a new [...] x [...] x [...] Sea-Land container was developed, the length determined by the maximum length of trailers then allowed on Pennsylvanian highways. <b>Each</b> <b>container</b> had a frame with eight corner castings that could withstand stacking loads. Tantlinger also designed automatic spreaders for handling the containers, {{as well as the}} twistlock mechanism that connects with the corner castings.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat {{determined}} {{the link between}} previously uncategorized clay [...] "tokens", the oldest {{of which have been}} found in the Zagros region of Iran, and the first known writing, Mesopotamian cuneiform. In approximately 8000 BC, the Mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing these tokens inside large, hollow clay containers (bulla, or globular envelopes) which were then sealed. The quantity of tokens in <b>each</b> <b>container</b> came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces. To avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object (for example: 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats), they 'counted' the objects by using various small marks. In this way the Sumerians added [...] "a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols".|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1965, Project Black Spot was a {{test program}} {{designed}} to give the Air Force a self-contained night attack capability to seek out and destroy targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. After the program {{was approved by the}} Department of Defense in early 1966, E-Systems of Greenville, Texas modified two C-123K Providers which were redesignated NC-123Ks, but were often referred to as AC-123Ks. The aircraft were equipped with a long, 57.75inch nose fairing that housed an X-band forward-looking radar. Below and aft of the extended radome was a turret with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Low-Level Light Television (LLLTV), and a laser range-finder/illuminator. Also, a low-level Doppler navigation radar and weapons release computer were installed. Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispensers (for CBU bomblets) were stacked within the fuselage. <b>Each</b> <b>container</b> housed 12 cells, each cell containing three Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2,664 and 6,372 one pound bomblets. The bomblets were released through 12 openings in the cargo floor that aligned with the cells in the weapons dispenser. The lower fuselage contained 12 inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the cargo floor, forming a chute. Bomblet release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward section of the fuselage. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually. The first aircraft, 54–691, was delivered to Eglin AFB in August 1967 and the second, 54–698, incorporating an AN/ASD-5 Black Crow direction finder set (engine ignition sensor), was delivered in February 1968. The two aircraft were then deployed, first the Republic of Korea, to be evaluated against North Korean high-speed patrol boats used to insert agents, 19 August – 23 October 1968; and then to South Vietnam with operations beginning 15 November 1968. Despite their success, with 70% of all missions completed and in-commission rate of 84%, there were no follow-on NC-123Ks modified. [...] The two aircraft were transferred to the 16th Special Operations Squadron at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, where they continued to serve from late 1969 to June 1970. Both airframes were then returned to standard C-123K configuration to serve again as airlifters.|$|E

30|$|BID-HDD aims {{to avoid}} {{multiplexing}} of I/O requests from different processes running concurrently. To achieve this, we segregate the I/O requests from <b>each</b> process into <b>containers.</b> The {{idea is to}} introduce dynamically adaptable and need-based anticipation time for each process, i.e. “time to wait for adjoining I/O request”. This allows coalescing of the bulky data accesses and avoid starvation of any requests. <b>Each</b> process <b>container</b> has a wait timer, based on inter-arrival time of requests and deadline associated with it. The expiry of either marks the container to be flushed in order to the storage device. This forms a pipeline of large data blocks from adjoining locations in the disk.|$|R
