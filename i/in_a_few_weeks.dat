5|$|Starship Troopers is a {{military}} science fiction novel by U.S. writer Robert A. Heinlein. Written <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> {{in reaction to the}} U.S. suspending nuclear tests, the story was first published as a two-part serial in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction as Starship Soldier, and published as a book by G. P. Putnam's Sons in December 1959.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections to the content of the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016 the Bild {{newspaper}} {{revealed that}} the newsest upgrade of the ASSTA suite to version 3.1, which includes color multifunctional LCD screens in place of monochrome CRT displays, is interferring with helmet-mounted nigh-vision optical displays worn by pilots, rendering German Tornado bombers deployed to Syria useless for night missions. The defense ministry admitted that bright cockpit lights could be a distraction for pilots, and disclosed that the solution will be implemented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> but denied the need to fly night missions in Syria.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} follows at 3 to 5 days, and {{is marked by}} {{complications}} of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.|$|E
5|$|The adult caddisfly is a {{medium-sized}} insect with membranous, hairy wings, which {{are held in}} a tent-wise fashion when the insect is at rest. The antennae are fairly long and threadlike, the mouthparts are reduced in size and the legs have five tarsi (lower leg joints). Adults are nocturnal and are attracted to light. Some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities, but many fly only weakly. Adults are usually short-lived, most being non-feeders and equipped only to breed. Once mated, the female caddisfly lays eggs in a gelatinous mass, attaching them above or below the water surface depending on species. The eggs hatch <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E
