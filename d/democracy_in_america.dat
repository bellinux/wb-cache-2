40|$|In this article, the {{relationship}} between modernization and <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> Latin <b>America</b> from 1945 to 1996 is analyzed {{on the basis of}} quantitative data. Three arguments are made. First, it is shown that the level of development had a modest impact on the likelihood of <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> Latin <b>America</b> from 1945 to 1996. <b>Democracy</b> <b>in</b> Latin <b>America</b> has survived <b>in</b> the face of a low level of development, and it has faltered despite moderately high per capita income. Second, it is shown that per capita income is a markedly worse predictor of <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> Latin <b>America</b> than <b>in</b> other countries with the same income range or in the world as a whole. A distinctive, nonlinear, functional shape is identified for this relationship <b>in</b> Latin <b>America.</b> Third, some potential explanations for this Latin American exceptionalism are addressed. No existing structural explanation suffices, however; this issue merits further exploration in future research...|$|R

25|$|As one of {{the great}} works of the Revolutionary period was written by a Frenchman, so too was a work about America from this generation.

25|$|In <b>Democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> {{published}} in 1835, Tocqueville {{wrote of the}} New World and its burgeoning democratic order. Observing {{from the perspective of}} a detached social scientist, Tocqueville wrote of his travels through America in the early 19th century when the market revolution, Western expansion, and Jacksonian democracy were radically transforming the fabric of American life.|$|E
25|$|One {{purpose of}} writing <b>Democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> {{according}} to Joshua Kaplan, {{was to help}} the people of France get a better understanding of their position between a fading aristocratic order and an emerging democratic order, and to help them sort out the confusion. Tocqueville saw democracy as an equation that balanced liberty and equality, concern for the individual {{as well as for the}} community.|$|E

25|$|The French {{writer and}} {{traveler}} Alexis de Tocqueville, in <b>Democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing {{its effects on}} American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the south, were bringing the white and black populations {{to a state of}} equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.|$|E

That day the group spoke about his death and the pregnant woman who lost her child in the event at Union Square Park for their Dance Your Debt Away event. Billy released an official statement to the press. The following Sunday the group traveled to the Long Island Walmart where the worker died and held a candlelight vigil. Billy appeared on Fox News and Savitri D. later appeared on Democracy Now to discuss the event.|$|E
25|$|But by 1820 {{faith in}} the {{efficacy}} of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect {{on the level of}} crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes. In response, New York developed the Auburn system in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at Auburn State Prison and Sing Sing at Ossining. The aim of this was rehabilitative: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving {{as a model for the}} family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included de Tocqueville who wrote <b>Democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> as a result of his visit.|$|E

25|$|Vartan Gregorian became {{president}} of Brown in 1989. During his tenure, he instituted the President's Lecture Series, which brought prominent scholars, leaders, and authors to campus. He presided over {{the building of a}} residence quadrangle that now bears his name, and taught senior seminars. His last seminar centered on Alexis de Tocqueville's <b>Democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> Each year, he also served as the adviser for nine students. Gregorian led a five-year capital campaign called the Campaign for the Rising Generation, which at the time was the most ambitious capital campaign, not only in Brown’s history, but of the state of Rhode Island, as well. The campaign raised some $534 million. By the end of his presidency, Brown's endowment had grown by about 260 percent, passing the $1 billion mark from just under $400 million. Also during his tenure, some 250 general studies courses were established. He received the Graduate Student Council’s first endowed Wilson-Deblois Award and the faculty’s Rosenberger Medal.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{previous}} liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole {{in which all}} individuals {{have a duty to}} promote the common good. His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and John A. Hobson. In a few years, this New Liberalism had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain, and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand suffrage rights, liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the democratic decision-making process were liable to the tyranny of the majority, a concept explained in Mill's On Liberty and in <b>Democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> (1835) by Alexis de Tocqueville. As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the rights of minorities.|$|E
