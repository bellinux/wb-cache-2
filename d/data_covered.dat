5000|$|A major {{component}} of studies of Microbiomes of the Built Environment involves determining how components of the built environment impact these microbes and microbial communities.

5000|$|The {{first major}} {{research}} project in which Kuznets was involved was {{the study of}} long series of economic dynamics in the USA undertaken in the mid-1920s. The collected <b>data</b> <b>covered</b> the period from 1865 to 1925, and for some indices achieved 1770. Applying {{for the analysis of}} time series approximating Gompertz and logistic curves, Kuznets found that the characteristics of the curves with reasonable accuracy described the majority of economic processes. Fitting trend curves to data and analysis of the time series, comparison of theoretical and empirical levels, allowed him to identify medium-term extended cycles of economic activity, which lasted 15-25 years and had an intermediate position between the Kondratyev “long waves" [...] and short business cycles. Aspiring to determine the nature of these cycles, Kuznets analyzed the dynamics of population, the construction industry performance, capital, national income data and other variables. These movements became known among economists and economic historians as [...] "Kuznets Cycles", and alternatively as [...] "long swings" [...] in the economy's growth rate (following the work of Moses Abramovitz 1912-1999.|$|E
50|$|Josef Prokop Pražák (22 June 1870 - 15 July 1904) was a Bohemian ornithologist. Born in Hořiněves {{he spent}} much of his life in Bohemia but also lived in Vienna, Edinburgh and for some time in Ukraine serving in the army. He {{published}} numerous works in ornithology but a lot of his work has subsequently come to be recognized as fraudulent. He described many fake species of bird including Vanellus grisescens which he claimed was collected by Richard Materna in northern Chile and Trochalopteron hennickei supposedly collected by Jaworowski from the Hunan Province of China. He also contributed a paper on bird migration with arrival dates for species in eastern Bohemia. His <b>data</b> <b>covered</b> {{more than a hundred years}} and this was submitted to the Hungarian journal Aquila but was suspected to be fraudulent and not published. Like Richard Meinertzhagen he too stole specimens from museums and resubmitted them with altered labels. Ernst Bauernfeind, a curator at the Natural History Museum at Vienna (Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, NHMW) found that a Bohemian specimen of Prunella montanella (NHMW 11423) that Pražák submitted matched details to a specimen collected by Dybowski at Kultuk, Lake Baikal, which had gone missing.|$|E

Over 95% of the CRU climate data set had been {{available to the public}} for several years before July 2009, when the university received numerous FOI requests for raw data or details of the confidentiality agreements from Stephen McIntyre and readers of his Climate Audit blog. Phil Jones of CRU announced that requests were being made to all the National Meteorological Organisations for their agreement to waive confidentiality, with the aim of publishing all the data jointly with the Met Office. McIntyre complained that data denied to him had been sent to Jones's colleague Peter Webster at the Georgia Institute of Technology for work on a joint publication, and FOI requests for this data were made by Jonathan A. Jones of the University of Oxford and Don Keiller of Anglia Ruskin University. Both requests were refused by the UEA by 11 September 2009.Though some National Meteorological Organisations gave full or conditional agreement to waive confidentiality, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by Trinidad and Tobago and Poland.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Since {{the advent}} of Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky ####) {{there has been a}} dearth of {{large-scale}} analyses in the vein of The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky & Halle ####) and Spanish Phonology (Harris ####). Optimality Theory arguably has an advantage over rewrite rule phonology in terms of explanatory power, but its complexity makes it di#cult to analyze a large body of data and phonological phenomena in a consistant and demonstrably correct way. The work described here uses computational methods to get around the di#culties posed by ot and points the way to a return of large-scale, whole-language analysis. <b>Data</b> <b>Covered</b> The <b>data</b> <b>covered</b> by this analysis is the phonological pattern of the Merina dialect (the standard dialect) of Malagasy, the primary language of Madagascar.
