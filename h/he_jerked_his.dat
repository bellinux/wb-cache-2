500|$|At 3:20p.m., the {{screwdriver}} {{slipped and}} the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a [...] "prompt critical" [...] reaction and a burst of hard radiation. At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste {{in his mouth and}} an intense burning sensation in his left hand. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation. At the time of the accident, dosimetry badges were in a locked box about [...] from the accident. Realizing {{that no one in the}} room had their film badges on, [...] "immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly". This peculiar response was attributed to [...] "vertigo" [...] and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Moss paused, {{with his}} glass halfway to his lips. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> {{head in the}} {{direction}} of Mr. Parker.|$|E
6000|$|VIRAG: (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming {{over his}} bony epileptic lips) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower. Panther, the Roman centurion, {{polluted}} {{her with his}} genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, {{his hand on his}} fork) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries <b>he</b> <b>jerks</b> <b>his</b> hips in the cynical spasm) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allemachter!" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> pony round. [...] "It's you, Missie Jess, is it? Now {{who would}} have thought of seeing you here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another tap. Now {{see that}} comb {{on the top}} of his head; you {{scarcely}} noticed it before, and now it is bright red. And see his spurs beginning to show--on good thick legs, too. There is a fine young fellow for you! Look how <b>he</b> <b>jerks</b> <b>his</b> head from side to side, like the young prince of a poultry-yard, as he well deserves to be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> {{thumb in}} the {{direction}} of Miss Pilbeam and winked with slow deliberation. [...] "She'll be there, too," [...] he added. [...] "Savvy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There’s no old age for me," [...] he said, sadly; [...] "but you needn’t tell them," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> thumb {{towards the}} forecastle.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean. Why are you here, {{you and that}} {{red-headed}} devil, Spike Mullins?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head {{in the direction of}} the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "All gettee out," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> {{thumb in}} the {{direction}} of the court of mystery. [...] "Eleven devils. Plenty soon come bung'low. What do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Harry {{gave one}} bound. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> on <b>his</b> clothes quicker {{than you could}} say the {{multiplication}} table, and he rushed down stairs and into the front yard.|$|R
6000|$|... "W'y not?" [...] growled Wilson. [...] "Ain't we gotta live? He's dead," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> {{thumb in}} the {{direction}} of the corpse. [...] "He won't care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Depends {{what you}} take the world to mean. Do you mean us in this box, or the crew outside there?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head towards the auditorium.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{all come}} from there," [...] he said. [...] "After a while we go there." [...] And this time <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head toward the north. [...] "Be Galus," [...] he concluded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine {{piece of}} business, {{to run away}} with my horses!" [...] exclaimed the old ranch owner, and <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head in the {{direction}} of the two animals the men had been leading.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> expressively <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> {{pointing}} {{finger in}} the direction the boat had taken, a flush of impatience mounted into Bradley's face, and he looked anxiously up the river.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> in <b>his</b> {{chair with}} a start and a wrench, {{and held out his}} hand for the glass. The mixture, of a rich port-wine colour, frothed at the top.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, certainly,' <b>he</b> replied, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> hand {{towards the}} cab. 'But we mustn't start right here. This thing {{has got to}} be kept dark, don't you see, till the last day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' in a box," [...] Henry answered. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} petulantly {{away from}} the grip of his questioner. [...] "Say, you lemme alone. [...] . I'm jes' plump tuckered out. [...] . Goo' night, everybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} I can't go," [...] said Phil, to Dave. [...] "But, you {{understand}} how it is," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> thumb {{in the direction of}} the supercargo, who was writing in one of his books.|$|E
60|$|They {{settled down}} to listen, Sir Richard bare-headed to the sunshine, dandling the sword in both hands, while the grey horse cropped outside the Ring, and the helmet on the {{saddle-bow}} clinged softly each time <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
60|$|Miss Hobson {{received}} the information {{with a laugh}} of such exceeding bitterness that strong men blanched and Mr. Cracknell started so convulsively that <b>he</b> nearly <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> collar off its stud.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heerd somethin'," [...] <b>he</b> whispered, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> thumb backward. [...] "Rollin' gravel--crackin' of twigs. No deer! ... Reckon it'd {{be a good}} idee for us to slip round acrost this bench." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have made}} one more discovery, la-bas," [...] <b>he</b> observed, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> thumb over his {{shoulder}} {{in the direction of}} Styles. [...] "Mr. Wells told me as we were going upstairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|The man who lay on {{the ledge}} of the grating was even chilled. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> great cloak more heavily upon him by an {{impatient}} movement of one shoulder, and growled, 'To the devil with this Brigand of a Sun that never shines in here!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mother came}} in. She glanced at Sutton, {{standing}} {{planted on the}} hearthrug, his head ducked, the heavy frown hiding his eyes. There was a peculiar braced intensity about him that made the elder woman afraid. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head round to his nephew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said he, [...] "it's mor'n I kin," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> coat {{out of my}} hand, and sprang away. When {{he reached}} {{the other side of}} the road, he turned and shouted at me, as though I had been deaf.|$|E
6000|$|... “No use!” Jimmy {{called after}} him. “There isn’t time.” <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> off <b>his</b> heavy sea-boots as he added: “She’s {{dragging}} her cable {{along the bottom}} now, but it won’t check her long.” ...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{thinking}} so deeply {{of her that}} {{the sound of her}} voice, pronouncing these unexpected words, startled him extremely. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> up <b>his</b> head and looked so bewildered that Freya insisted impatiently: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Turn me {{him to the}} moon," [...] {{said the}} skipper; and taking Dick by the chin, <b>he</b> cruelly <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head into the air. [...] "Blessed Virgin!" [...] he cried, [...] "it is the pirate!" ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{began to}} {{struggle}} again, heaving instinctively against the ropes, taking great, deep breaths. His face, with its golden skin, flushed dark and surcharged, he heaved again. The great veins {{in his neck}} stood out. But it was no good, he went relaxed. Then again, suddenly, <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't a notion," [...] {{answered}} Father Brown. [...] "I {{want you}} to find out; I ask it as a favour. He went down there"--and <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> thumb over his shoulder {{in one of his}} undistinguished gestures--"and can't have passed three lamp-posts yet. I only want to know the direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not a pig! I {{found these}} nuts first and I tell you they're mine!" [...] shrieked Happy Jack, {{so angry that}} every time he spoke <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> tail. And {{all the time he}} was chasing round and round the trunk of the tree trying to prevent Chatterer getting up.|$|E
60|$|For {{a second}} I {{thought he was}} going to run away. Then <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> up <b>his</b> head, and rushed on towards the house. At the foot of the {{staircase}} he gripped me by the shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} in the smoking room there, a few moments ago," [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> head toward the door. [...] "There were some men talking--decent fellows, not dirty scandalmongers. They spoke of Louise Maurel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so far away, Sire. Only {{the light}} was very bad, or I should have had the fourth. I aimed low, Sire, fearing to miss <b>his</b> skull, and <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> up <b>his</b> horse's head to take the arrow." ...|$|R
