Each frame contains {{a part of}} the almanac (in subframes 4 and 5) and the complete almanac is transmitted by each satellite in 25 frames total (requiring 12.5 minutes). The almanac serves several purposes. The first is to assist in the acquisition of satellites at power-up by allowing the receiver to generate a list of visible satellites based on stored position and time, while an ephemeris from each satellite is needed to compute position fixes using that satellite. In older hardware, lack of an almanac in a new receiver would cause long delays before providing a valid position, because the search for each satellite was a slow process. Advances in hardware have made the acquisition process much faster, so not having an almanac is no longer an issue. The second purpose is for relating time derived from the GPS (called GPS time) to the international time standard of UTC. Finally, the almanac allows a single-frequency receiver to correct for ionospheric delay error by using a global ionospheric model. The corrections are not as accurate as GNSS augmentation systems like WAAS or dual-frequency receivers. However, it is often better than no correction, since <b>ionospheric</b> <b>error</b> is the largest error source for a single-frequency GPS receiver.|$|E

Taking advantage of the frequency dispersive property of ionospheric refractivity, the <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>errors</b> can be mitigated in dual-frequency applications {{to a great extent}} by a linear combination of carrier phases or pseudoranges. However, single frequency GNSS operations require additional ionospheric information to apply signal delay or range error corrections. To aid single frequency operations, the Global Positioning System (GPS) broadcasts 8 coefficients as part of the navigation message to drive the Ionospheric Correction Algorithm (ICA) also known as Klobuchar model. We presented here an ionospheric correction algorithm called Neustrelitz TEC model (NTCM) which can be used as complementary to the GPS ICA. Our investigation shows that the NTCM can be driven by Klobuchar model parameters to achieve a significantly better performance than obtained by the mother ICA algorithm. Our research, using post processed reference total electron content (TEC) data from more than one solar cycle, shows that on average the RMS modelled TEC errors are up to 40 % less for the proposed NTCM model compared to the Klobuchar model during high solar activity period, and about 10 % less during low solar activity period.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of GNSS applications uses {{and will continue to}} use single-frequency GNSS receivers. Therefore the precise estimation of the <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>error</b> from single-frequency GNSS data is and remains to be an important issue. We describe a method which allows to autonomously determine the <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>error</b> using single-frequency GNSS data of a single GNSS receiver. The main idea is not to consider each receiver-satellite link individually, but to use all information present in each epoch and between epochs. For the <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>error</b> there is a non-zero correlation, both between different links at a given time and between links at different times. By taking into account all these correlations, we are able to determine the (absolute) <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>error</b> from single-frequency phase and code measurements only. Since the dispersive ionospheric delays affect phase and code measurements with opposite sign, it is possible to extract relative <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>errors</b> by forming the difference of code and phase measurements. Besides the (double) <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>error,</b> this difference contains the code and phase multipath noise, the instrumentation offsets, and the phase ambiguity. In order to suppress the dominant noise contribution, the code multipath noise, we use a Hatch-type filtering with a suitably chosen time constant. Note that there is a new phase ambiguity for each data arc, i. e., a continuous range of receiver-satellite measurements. Hence, we have to determine one new constant for each new data arc in order to calibrate the relative <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>errors</b> obtained from the filtered difference of phase and code observables. We have developed a model-assisted TEC calibration and reconstruction technique, using a simple polynomial model of the ionosphere, which approximates the ionosphere {{in the vicinity of the}} GNSS receiver by a single layer in a local, sun-fixed coordinate system. This technique is capable of calibrating the relative <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>errors</b> in near-realtime by using a Kalman-filter-type weighted-least-squares algorithm with a priori knowledge; the input measurement errors are determined from the Hatch-type filtering, while the initial model covariances may be determined, e. g., by the start-up weighted-least-squares solution. Without using any additional information the warm-up phase is found to be at least one hour. However, it is possible to shorten the warm-up phase by using, e. g., Klobuchar-model derived vertical TEC values as initial information. After the start-up phase, new model and ambiguity estimates are computed every couple of minutes by using both, the new measurements and the last model coefficients to update the model. Along with the model coefficients describing the variation of vertical TEC around the receiver we obtain further statistical information, e. g., the relative chi 2 value of the fit which is a measure of how good the model Ansatz is consistent with the measured data, given the measurement errors and model covariances. By monitoring the chi 2 value, deficiencies in data preprocessing (cycle slips) and, more importantly, extreme ionospheric perturbations can be detected. The comparison of vertical TEC derived from single-station single-frequency data obtained by the proposed method with TEC values obtained from European TEC maps under near-solar-minimum conditions shows a good agreement. This is encouraging, taking into account that we compare TEC valued determined from a single station using single-frequency GNSS data with TEC maps which are produced using dual-frequency phase and code GNSS data from a network of 20 - 30 GNSS receivers. Since the algorithm is able to calibrate <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>errors</b> containing different phase ambiguities for each arc, we have applied the algorithm to the reconstruction of vertical TEC from dual-frequency phase-only GNSS data. Here, the relative chi 2 values are quite high, signaling that the simple single-layer polynomial ionospheric model cannot fully describe the ionospheric information contained in the low-(multipath-) noise GNSS phase observables Nevertheless, calibrated TEC can be obtained with this method. A possible continuation along the lines of this route would be to consider more elaborated ionospheric models, possibly transcending the single-layer approximation. We anticipate that the algorithm will work under other geophysical conditions, too, e. g., low-latitudes and/or high solar activity. The calibrated <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>errors</b> may be used in single-frequency point positioning. We compare the performance of our locally valid, near-real-time ionospheric corrections with the Klobuchar model, whose model coefficients are determined in intervals of days and are valid globally. The proposed algorithm is capable to derive calibrated <b>ionospheric</b> range <b>errors</b> from single-frequency GNSS data. In addition, a model describing the ionosphere in the vicinity of the receiver is provided, along with various statistical quantities. In the context of single-frequency point positioning, e. g. using low-cost GNSS receivers in quasi-static setups, this method is anticipated to provide autonomously determined, near-real-time ionospheric corrections comparable or better than the Klobuchar model.

In this case, the "altitudinal" element of the residual error varies (decreases) by no more than about 25 % between ~ 10 and ~ 100 km for physically reasonable Chapman layer parameters. For other simple model ionospheres the integral can be evaluated exactly, and results are in reasonable agreement with those of an equivalent Chapman layer.

These new methods can be equally applied to the European GALILEO system. In addition, typical effects of the 2 nd and 3 rd order ionospheric effects are also investigated, and a correct formula for the 3 rd order <b>ionospheric</b> <b>error</b> is derived in a simple way for easy implementation. It is anticipated that the proposed refraction correction methods will {{play an important role}} in both the modernized GPS and GALILEO systems. Results show that the proposed triple-frequency methods can correct the ionospheric refraction effects to a millimetre level. Since the models are given in simple forms, these corrections can be easily implemented in many real-time applications and the triple-frequency methods for correcting high-order ionospheric can significantly eliminate the error remained in the current ionospheric models. The method developed will potentially contribute to a better long-range baseline ambiguity resolution and an accuracy improvement in precise point positioning...|$|E
30|$|A major error {{component}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) is the ionospheric delay. Ionopspheric error {{can be reduced}} by a dual frequency receiver using a linear combination technique {{that can not be}} applied with a single frequecy receiver. However, an accurate <b>ionospheric</b> <b>error</b> modeling for single-frequency receiver is required. Due to the nonlinearity of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>error,</b> a highly nonlinear wavelet network (WN) method is proposed in this paper. The main objective of the paper is to develop a short-term prediction model based on a short dataset. Therefore, five GPS stations with five days of ionospheric datasets along with time and location were employed to develop the proposed WN-based ionospheric model. Four days of datasets were employed to develop the model and one day of dataset was employed to test the prediction accuracy. To validate the WN-based ionospheric model, a comparison was made between the developed WN-based ionospheric model and the CODE, JPL and IGS Global Ionospheric Map (GIM) models. It is shown that the Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) errors of the developed WN-based ionospheric model are 2.51 TECU, 2.75 TECU and 2.50 TECU (Total Electronic Content Unit) with percentage errors of about 3.4 %, 3.8 % and 3.4 % when compared with the CODE, JPL and IGS GIM models.|$|E

In general, GPS is mainly used for the position determination when there is a presence of the signal. However, problem occurs during the absence of signal or very low signal, which may be caused by various geophysical and technical aspects. For instance, first order errors like tropospheric and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>errors</b> and second order errors like multipath and interference that may provide unexpected errors to the radio wave signal that is being radiated from one of GPS satellites. In this present paper, a four-element Archimedean antenna array (to receive broad-band satellite coverage) along with an adaptive processor performance will be assessed by using HFSS software. The output results will be presented and the efficiency of this adaptive antenna array will be discussed based on the microwave bands in the radio wave propagation path...|$|R
40|$|High-accuracy Total Electron Content (TEC) {{measurements}} {{are important for}} several applications, including GNSS time transfer with accuracies better than 10 ns. In addition, {{it is important to}} provide uncertainty estimates to algorithms that use the TEC measurements. Dual-frequency TEC errors are dominated by satellite inter-frequency biases, receiver inter-frequency biases, receiver noise and multipath, higher-order <b>ionospheric</b> <b>errors,</b> and receiver inter-code biases for certain receivers. To evaluate different algorithms and error mitigation methods, data were collected from four different GPS receivers in two locations at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Error mitigation methods include receiver hardware bias calibration, comparison with TEC maps provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), receiver comparisons, TEC calibration during low TEC count as determined by the Arecibo radar, and multipath mitigation using the Code Noise Multi-Path (CNMP) algorithm. The CNMP algorithm enables the definition of rigorous multipath error bounds on the TEC bias estimatio...|$|R
40|$|The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) uses {{an array}} of monitor {{stations}} that combine to compute GPS user corrections over the Continental U. S. Preliminary experiments have concluded that ionospheric spatial decorrelation {{is the most significant}} of the WAAS error sources. Recent data on <b>ionospheric</b> <b>errors</b> has been combined into a probability model that describes the likelihood of rare-event ionospheric decorrelations over a range of conditions. Using this model and simpler models for troposphere and other errors, computer simulations of WAAS performance for randomly located users, using the MITRE ionospheric grid algorithm, have been conducted. These simulation studies focused on performance sensitivity to various algorithm parameters and the potential of user-based RAIM algorithms to meet the WAAS availability and integrity requirements. It was found that both standard residual statistics and a new method of projecting spatial decorrelations from the gridpoint estimates show promis [...] ...|$|R
