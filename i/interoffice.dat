25|$|What {{is crucial}} in setting the level of {{formality}} in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An <b>interoffice</b> legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an email message to a friend and client, updating {{the status of a}} legal matter, is appropriately informal.|$|E

The re-titling of the film proved to be unpopular with the filmmakers so much that {{animator}} Ed Gombert wrote a satirical <b>interoffice</b> memo, allegedly by studio executive Peter Schneider, which gave preceding Disney films generic titles such as Seven Little Men Help a Girl, The Wonderful Elephant Who Could Really Fly, The Little Deer Who Grew Up, The Girl with the See-through Shoes, Two Dogs Fall in Love, Puppies Taken Away, and A Boy, a Bear and a Big Black Cat. These generic titles would later become a category on Jeopardy!.|$|E

As a remedy, SS6 and SS7 implemented out-of-band signaling, carried in a separate signaling channel, thus keeping the speech path separate.

50|$|Eventually, {{the phone}} {{companies}} in North America did, in fact, replace all their hardware. They didn't do it to stop the phreaks, but simply {{as a matter of}} course while moving to fully digital switching systems. Unlike the crossbar switch, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate signaling lines which phreaks could not access. This system is known as Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> Signaling. Classic phreaking with the 2600 Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s.|$|E

In December 2004, the FCC released another set of rules which phase out, over a year, all CLEC leasing of ILEC local switching, while preserving access to most copper local loops and some <b>interoffice</b> facilities.|$|E

They carried overflow traffic when the small Junctor Groups of an office with many LN could not cope. Digit transmitters, receivers, other complex service circuits, and some complex trunks including those using E&M signaling, were permanently mounted in relay racks similar to those of 5XB rather than plug-in frames.|$|E
