40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} generating a control signal for a cochlea implant based on an audio signal, comprising a calculation (110) of first information on an activity pattern over time {{of a number of}} <b>internal</b> <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of an auditive model, arising from the audio signal. The method further comprises a filtering (120) of activity events described by the first information based on a recognition of a characteristic pattern in the activity pattern to give corrected information. The corrected information is then used as control signal for the cochlea implant, or the control signal is derived from the corrected information. Said method can be carried out by a computer programme or a corresponding device. By means of the above, for example, the auditive impression for patients with a cochlea implant can be significantly improved. A filtering of activity events, based on the recognition of a characteristic pattern in the activity pattern is particularly suitable to human hearing and permits the control of a cochlea implant such that the best possible speech recognition with the least possible energy use of a cochlea implant is achieved...|$|R
40|$|The cochlea {{is one of}} a large {{class of}} sense organs, the mechano-receptors. This class in-cludes the non-auditory labyrinth, touch corpus-cles, muscle spindles, sensory endings in joints, tendons, the carotid sinus and elsewhere, and also the lateral-line organ of fishes. These or-gans are all stimulated by {{mechanical}} deforma-tion {{in one way or another}} although they differ widely in respect o absolute sensitivity and in respect to adaptation to a continuing steady stimulus. The cochlea seems to represent the extreme development toward great sensitivity. The ques-tions of adaptation and repetitive discharge are largely academic as the organ is mechanically sensitive only to quick transients or to repetitive vibratory stimulation. The equalization of pres-sure through the helicotrema automatically elimi-nates the problem of stimulation by steady pressure. We shall assume that the main features of the anatomy of the cochlea are familiar, including the oval and the round windows that open to the middle ear, the basilar membrane that separates the spiral cochlear canal into scala vestibuli and scala tympani, and the sensory structures of the organ of C 0 rti that lie within the membranous labyrinth (the scala media) in a long ribbon along the basilur membrane. We shall refer to the basi-lar membrane and all of the structures in the scala media, including Reissner's membrane, as the "cochlear partition. " We accept the rather general opinion that dur-ing life the tectorial membrane (attached by one edge to the limbus of the lamina spiralis) fills a large part of the scala media and that the hairs which project from the free ends of the sensory cells (the external and the <b>internal</b> <b>hair</b> <b>cells)</b> are intimately and probably firmly enmeshed in or attached to its substance (de Vries, 1949). By analogy with the corresponding structures in t This work was carried out under Contract N 6 onr...|$|R
50|$|Located {{within the}} {{membranous}} labyrinthine {{walls of the}} vestibular system are approximately 67,000 <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in total.

5000|$|As {{the study}} of the cochlea should {{fundamentally}} be focused at the level of <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> {{it is important to note}} the anatomical and physiological differences between the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of various species. In birds, for instance, instead of outer and inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> there are tall and short <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> There are several similarities of note in regard to this comparative data. For one, the tall <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> is very similar in function to that of the inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell,</b> and the short <b>hair</b> <b>cell,</b> lacking afferent auditory-nerve fiber innervation, resembles the outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell.</b> One unavoidable difference, however, is that while all <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are attached to a tectorial membrane in birds, only the outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are attached to the tectorial membrane in mammals.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> in many nonmammalian {{vertebrates}} are regenerated by the mitotic {{division of}} supporting cell progenitors and the differentiation {{of the resulting}} progeny into new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and supporting cells. Recent {{studies have shown that}} nonmitotic <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> recovery after aminoglycoside-induced damage can also occur in the vestibular organs. Using <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> and supporting cell immunocytochemical markers, we have used confocal and electron microscopy to examine the fate of damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and the origin of immature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after gentamicin treatment in mitotically blocked cultures of the bullfrog saccule. Extruding and fragmenting <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> which undergo apoptotic cell death, are replaced by scar formations. After losing their bundles, sublethally damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> remain in the sensory epithelium for prolonged periods, acquiring supporting cell-like morphology and immunoreactivity. These modes of damage appear to be mutually exclusive, implying that sublethally damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> repair their bundles. Transitional <b>cells,</b> coexpressing <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> and supporting cell markers, are seen near scar formations created by the expansion of neighboring supporting cells. Most of these cells have morphology and immunoreactivity similar to that of sublethally damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Ultrastructural analysis also reveals that most immature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> had autophagic vacuoles, implying that they originated from damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> rather than supporting cells. Some transitional cells are supporting cells participating in scar formations. Supporting cells also decrease in number during <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> recovery, supporting the conclusion that some supporting cells undergo phenotypic conversion into <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> without an intervening mitotic event...|$|R
40|$|Inner {{and outer}} <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were {{mechanically}} {{isolated from the}} guinea pig cochlea and subjected to stimuli known to induce shape changes in outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Depolarization by 70 mM KCl which causes osmotic swelling of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> also swelled inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> by approximately 8 % of their volume. The application of the calcium ionophore ionomycin which induces cortical contractions and elongation of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> {{did not affect the}} shape of inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Since ionomycin increased free intracellular calcium levels in both inner and outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> the results demonstrate that inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> do not possess the mechanisms necessary for a contractile response to calcium. Thus, calcium is a specific regulator of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> motility making this mechanism a likely physiological modulator of a transduction feedback process...|$|R
50|$|The stereocilia (<b>hair</b> <b>cells)</b> of {{the inner}} ear can become {{subjected}} to bending from loud noises. Because they are not regeneratable in humans, any major damage or loss of these <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> leads to permanent hearing impairment and other hearing-related diseases. Outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> serve as acoustic amplifiers for stimulation {{of the inner}} <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> respond primarily to low-intensity sounds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> are {{the sensory}} receptors {{of both the}} {{auditory}} system and the vestibular system in the ears of all vertebrates. Through mechanotransduction, <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> detect movement in their environment. In mammals, the auditory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are located within the spiral organ of Corti on the thin basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear. They derive their name from the tufts of stereocilia called hair bundles that protrude from the apical surface of the cell into the fluid-filled cochlear duct. Mammalian cochlear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are of two anatomically and functionally distinct types, known as outer, and inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Damage to these <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> results in decreased hearing sensitivity, and because the inner ear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> cannot regenerate, this damage is permanent. However, other organisms, such as the frequently studied zebrafish, and birds have <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> that can regenerate.The human cochlea contains {{on the order of}} 3,500 inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and 12,000 outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> at birth.|$|R
40|$|Surface glycoconjugates of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and {{supporting}} {{cells in the}} vestibular endorgans of the bullfrog were identified using biotinylated lectins with different carbohydrate specificities. Lectin binding in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> {{was consistent with the}} presence of glucose and mannose (CON A), galactose (RCA-I), N-acetylgalactosamine (VVA), but not fucose (UEA-I) residues. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the bullfrog sacculus, unlike those in the utriculus and semicircular canals, did not stain for N-acetylglucosamine (WGA) or N-acetylgalactosamine (VVA). By contrast, WGA and, to a lesser extent, VVA, differentially stained utricular and semicircular canal <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> labeling <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> located in peripheral, but not central, regions. In mammals, WGA uniformly labeled Type 1 <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> while labeling, as in the bullfrog, Type 2 <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> only in peripheral regions. These regional variations were retained after enzymatic digestion. We conclude that vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> differ in their surface glycoconjugates and that differences in lectin binding patterns can be used to identify <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> types and to infer the epithelial origin of isolated vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
50|$|Nerve fiber {{innervation}} is much denser for inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> {{than for}} outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> A single inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> is innervated by numerous nerve fibers, whereas a single nerve fiber innervates many outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> nerve fibers {{are also very}} heavily myelinated, which {{is in contrast to}} the unmyelinated outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> nerve fibers. The region of the basilar membrane supplying the inputs to a particular afferent nerve fibre can be considered to be its receptive field.|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of reciprocal synapses {{at the base}} of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the human organ of Corti was studied by electron-microscopic serial section reconstruction.

Fourteen of the 25 outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> (56 %) possessed reciprocal synapses. The {{incidence of}} reciprocal synapses increased from the first to the third rows of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> as determined by the percentage of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and afferent nerve terminals of each row demonstrating reciprocal synapses and the average number of reciprocal synapses per <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> in each row. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> with reciprocal synapses had more afferent and fewer efferent terminals per <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> than <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> without reciprocal synapses...|$|R
40|$|The {{external}} {{location of}} the zebrafish lateral line makes it a powerful model for studying mechanosensory <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration. We have developed a chemical screen to identify FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds that modulate <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration in zebrafish. Of the 1680 compounds evaluated, we identified two enhancers and six inhibitors of regeneration. The two enhancers, dexamethasone and prednisolone, are synthetic glucocorticoids that potentiated <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> numbers during regeneration and also induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> addition {{in the absence of}} damage. BrdU analysis confirmed that the extra <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> arose from mitotic activity. We found that dexamethasone and prednisolone, like other glucocorticoids, suppress zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, indicating that <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration occurs by a distinctly different process. Further analyses of the regeneration inhibitors revealed that two of the six, flubendazole and topotecan, significantly suppress <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration by preventing proliferation of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors. Flubendazole halted support cell division in M-phase, possibly by interfering with normal microtubule activity. Topotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor, killed both <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and proliferating <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors. A third inhibitor, fulvestrant, moderately delayed <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration by reducing support cell proliferation. Our observation that <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> do not regenerate when support cell proliferation is impeded confirms previous observations that cell division is the primary route for <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration after neomycin treatment in zebrafish...|$|R
40|$|Sensory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> die after {{acoustic}} trauma or ototoxic insults, but the signal transduction pathways that mediate <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death are not known. Here we identify several important signaling events that regulate {{the death of}} vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Chick utricles were cultured in media supplemented with the ototoxic antibiotic neomycin and selected pharmacological agents that influence signaling molecules in <b>cell</b> death pathways. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> that were treated with neomycin exhibited classically defined apoptotic morphologies such as condensed nuclei and fragmented DNA. Inhibition of protein synthesis (via treatment with cycloheximide) increased <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival after treatment with neomycin, suggesting that <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death requires de novo protein synthesis. Finally, the inhibition of caspases promoted <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival after neomycin treatment. Sensory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in avian vestibular organs also undergo continual cell death and replacement throughout mature life. It is unclear whether the loss of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> stimulates the proliferation of supporting cells or whether the production of new cells triggers the death of <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> We {{examined the effects of}} caspase inhibition on spontaneous <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death in the chick utricle. Caspase inhibitors reduced the amount of ongoing <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death and ongoing supporting cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In isolated sensory epithelia, however, caspase inhibitors did not affect supporting cell proliferation directly. Our data indicate that ongoing <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death stimulates supporting cell proliferation in the mature utricle...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} {{available on the}} susceptibility of reptilian saccule <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> to ototoxin-induced sensory damage. In this study, we report morphological evidence of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> recovery and regeneration after damage induced by gentamicin in the saccule of a lizard. We perform morphological analysis using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy with actin and calbindin as markers for <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and tubulin as a marker for supporting cells. The data were consistent: gentamicin induced damage in the <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> and the damage increased with increasing duration of treatment. Initially, the saccule appeared unhealthy. Subsequently, the sensory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> became compromised, with fused stereovilli, followed by widespread loss of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> bundles from the <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Finally, numerous <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were lost. Morphologically, the saccule appeared normal 28 days after gentamicin treatment. Using a mitogenic marker, we tested {{whether or not there}} is <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration following administration of gentamicin. We found evidence of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation first in supporting cell nuclei and subsequently in <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei. This indicates that a process of sensory epithelium repair and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration occurred, in both extrastriolar and striolar regions, and that the recovery was due to both the proliferation of supporting cells and, as seems likely, self-repair of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> bundles...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> are {{required}} for hearing and balance. <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> death is caused by multiple environmental insults, such as prolong exposure to loud noises, aminoglycoside antibiotics, some chemotherapeutics, and heavy metals, and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss is irreversible in humans. However, many other vertebrates such as, birds, fish and amphibians {{have the ability to}} replaced lost <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Zebrafish has quickly become an excellent modeled to study <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> biology. Aside from the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> found in the inner ear, zebrafish have externally located <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> on the head and body that allow them to detect changes in water currents. Also, larval zebrafish can quickly regenerate lost <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after traumatic damage. How <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors are replenished or maintained throughout the animal’s life is still unknown. I investigated lateral line <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> and support cell maintenance in adult zebrafish, in which growth is largely complete. I demonstrate that adult zebrafish not only replenish <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after a single instance of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage, but also maintain <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and support cells after multiple rounds of damage and regeneration. I observed that <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> undergo continuous turnover in adult zebrafish in the absence of damage. Mitotically-distinct support cell populations were identified and show that <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> regenerate from underlying support cells in a region-specific manner. Using the transgenic Zebrabow-M fish line, I performed long-term multicolor clonal analysis to discover that lateral line neuromast drift towards clonality. However, I also observe that some neuromasts reach equilibrium and may indicate that multiple progenitors act to maintain the lateral line neuromast. Our results demonstrate that there are distinct support cell populations in the lateral line, which may help explain why zebrafish <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration is extremely robust, retained throughout life, and potentially unlimited in regenerative capacity...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{prevalence}} of hearing loss after {{damage to the}} mammalian cochlea has been thought {{to be due to}} a lack of spontaneous regeneration of <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> the primary receptor cells for sound. Here, we show that supporting <b>cells,</b> which surround <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the normal cochlear epithelium, differentiate into new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the neonatal mouse following ototoxic damage. Using lineage tracing, we show that new <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> predominantly outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> arise from Lgr 5 -expressing inner pillar and third Deiters cells and that new <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> generation is increased by pharmacological inhibition of Notch. These data suggest that the neonatal mammalian cochlea has some capacity for <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration following damage alone and that Lgr 5 -positive <b>cells</b> act as <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> progenitors in the cochlea...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{models are}} {{increasingly}} being used for hearing research investigations. Aminoglycoside antibiotics that are used for damaging the inner ear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> can have systemic side effects leading to death of study animals. This study aimed to compare two methods: (i) systemic (intravenous) and (ii) local (intrasaccular) gentamicin administration for induction of inner ear <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage in the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua (L.). <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage was assessed using scanning electron microscopy; <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> density, prevalence of immature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and kinocilia length were measured. Gentamicin-treated fish were compared with control and sham fish. Intravenous gentamicin led to dose-dependent mortality caused by nephrotoxicity. The only visible effect after treatment was more immature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and shorter kinocilia, the effect on <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> density was equivocal.

40|$|The {{auditory}} epithelium {{in birds}} and mammals consists of a postmitotic population of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and supporting cells. Unlike mammals, birds can regenerate their auditory epithelia after trauma. Recent evidence indicates that supporting cells undergo mitosis after acoustic trauma, suggesting that supporting cells may transdifferentiate into <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The goals {{of this study were}} to (1) characterize the responses of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and supporting cells to acoustic trauma, and (2) determine whether <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss is a prerequisite for generation of new <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Chicks were exposed to an octave-band noise and their inner ears assayed with fluorescence or scanning electron microscopy. In one area of the basilar papilla, defined as the center of the lesion, extensive <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> degeneration occurred. Expanded supporting <b>cells</b> obliterated degenerating <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and invaded spaces normally occupied by <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Aggregates of DNA were found within the basilar papilla, suggesting that <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death and disintegration may occur within the epithelium. The epithelial sheet appeared structurally confluent at all times examined. Supporting cells exhibited altered apical contour in distal regions of the basilar papilla, where <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage was mild or inconspicuous. Four days after noise exposure, newly generated <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were found {{in the center of the}} lesion and in the distal areas, where no <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss could be detected. The results suggest that supporting cells may play an important role in maintenance and repair of the traumatized basilar papilla and raise the possibility that production of new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> is not dependent on <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss in the immediate vicinity...|$|R
40|$|In chickens, nonsensory {{supporting}} cells {{divide and}} regenerate auditory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after injury. Anatomical {{evidence suggests that}} supporting cells can also transdifferentiate into <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> without dividing. In this study, we characterized an organ culture model to study auditory <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration, and we used these cultures to test if direct transdifferentiation alone can lead to significant <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration. Control cultures (organs from posthatch chickens maintained without streptomycin) showed complete <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss in the proximal (high-frequency) region by 5  days. In contrast, a 2 -day treatment with streptomycin induced loss of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> from all regions by 3  days. <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration proceeded in culture, with {{the time course of}} supporting <b>cell</b> division and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation generally resembling in vivo patterns. The degree of supporting cell division depended upon the presence of streptomycin, the epithelial region, the type of culture media, and serum concentration. On average, 87 % of the regenerated <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> lacked the cell division marker BrdU despite its continuous presence, suggesting that most <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were regenerated via direct transdifferentiation. Addition of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin to culture media prevented supporting cell division, but numerous <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were regenerated nonetheless. These <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> showed signs of functional maturation, including stereociliary bundles and rapid uptake of FM 1 - 43.

40|$|Cochlear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and the {{stria vascularis}} are {{critical}} for normal hearing. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, whereas the stria is responsible for generating the endocochlear potential (EP), which {{is the driving force}} for <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> mechanotransduction. We questioned whether <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and the stria interdepend for survival by using two mouse models. Atoh 1 conditional knockout mice, which lose all <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> within four weeks after birth, were used to determine whether the absence of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> would affect function and survival of stria. We showed that stria morphology and EP remained normal for long time despite a complete loss of all <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> We then used a mouse model that has an abnormal stria morphology and function due to mutation of the Mitf gene to determine whether <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are able to survive and transduce sound signals without a normal electrochemical environment in the endolymph. A strial defect, reflected by missing intermediate cells in the stria and by reduction of EP, led to systematic outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death from the base to the apex after postnatal day 18. However, an 18 -mV EP was sufficient for outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Surprisingly, inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival was less vulnerable to reduction of the EP.

40|$|During the {{development}} of the mammalian inner ear, the number of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> produced is highly regulated and remains constant throughout life. The mechanism underlying this regulation is beginning to be understood although many aspects still remain obscure. When late embryonic or early postnatal rat organs of Corti were cultured, the production of supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> was observed. This overproduction of sensory cells could be modulated by the addition of several growth factors. In this study, we examined explants of rat organs of Corti that produced supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> In the supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> region, up to two rows of inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and five rows of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were observed.

In adult Pou 4 f 3 �/DTR mice, DT treatment reduced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> numbers to 6 % of normal by 14 days post-DT.

In aging animals, components for active PI 3 K signaling are present but decrease in <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> In this study, we determined whether activated PI 3 K signaling in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> promotes survival. To activate PI 3 K signaling in <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> we used a small molecule inhibitor of PTEN or genetically ablated PTEN using a conditional knockout animal. <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival was challenged by addition of gentamicin to cochlear cultures. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> with activated PI 3 K signaling were more resistant to aminoglycoside-induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death. These results indicate that increased PI 3 K signaling in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> promote survival and the PI 3 K signaling pathway is a target for preventing aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> {{possess a}} single primary cilium, called the kinocilium, early in development. While the kinocilium {{is lost in}} {{auditory}} <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of most species it is maintained in vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> It has generally been believed that the primary role of the kinocilium and cilia-associated genes in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> is {{in the establishment of}} the polarity of actin-based stereocilia, the <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> mechanotransduction apparatus. Through genetic screening and testing of candidate genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) we have found that mutations in multiple cilia genes implicated in intraflagellar transport (dync 2 h 1, wdr 35, ift 88, and traf 3 ip), and the ciliary transition zone (cc 2 d 2 a, mks 1, and cep 290) lead to resistance to aminoglycoside-induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death. These genes appear to have differing roles in <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> as mutations in intraflagellar transport genes, but not transition zone genes, lead to defects in kinocilia formation and processes dependent upon <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> mechanotransduction activity. These mutants highlight a novel role of cilia-associated genes in <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> and provide powerful tools for further study...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} if {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (TGF alpha) pretreatment protects <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> from aminoglycoside induced injury by modifying their intracellular calcium concentration, we assayed <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> calcium levels in organ of Corti explants {{both before and}} after aminoglycoside (i. e. neomycin, 10 (- 3) M) exposure either with or without growth factor pretreatment. After TGF alpha (500 ng/ml) treatment, the intracellular calcium level of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> showed a five-fold increase as compared to the levels observed in the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of control cultures. After ototoxin exposure, calcium levels in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of control explants showed an increase relative to their baseline levels, while in the presence of growth factors pretreatment, <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> showed a relative reduction in calcium levels. Pretreatment of organ of Corti explants afforded significant protection of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> stereocilia bundle morphology from ototoxic damage when compared to explants exposed to ototoxin alone. This study correlates a rise in <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> calcium levels with the otoprotection of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> by TGF alpha in organ of Corti explants. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|It’s {{known that}} ototoxic {{side effects of}} {{gentamicin}} are caused by an iron-gentamicin complex that produces free radicals. Antioxidants attenuate gentamicin-induced free radical formation. We have previously demonstrated <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration in both the crista ampullaris (organ involved in dynamic balance) and the saccule (organ involved in static balance) of gentamicintreated P. sicula. We now examine the fate of papilla basilaris (organ involved in hearing) <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after exposure to three doses of gentamicin. We want {{to determine whether there}} is any recovery and whether this is due to repair of damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> to regeneration or, most likely, to both. In addition, we investigate whether antioxidants can effectively inhibit gentamicin-induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss by SEM analysis using salicylate to protect against gentamicin ototoxic effects. Moreover, using BrdU, we tested {{whether or not there is}} <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration following somministration of gentamicin. A BrdU immuno-fluorescence protocol was followed to detect BrdU-labelled cells. It was found that Gentamicin induced damage in the <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Three days after the end of gentamicin treatment the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of papilla showed fused or disarrayed stereovilli and there was widespread loss of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> bundles from the <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Subsequently, numerous <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were lost. Conversely, when salicylate was co-administered with gentamicin the damage was moderated. The results suggest that administration of salicylate facilitates the recovery and reduces damage to <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after gentamicin treatment. Finally, we found evidence of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation initially in supporting cell nuclei and then in <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei. This indicates that a process of sensory epithelium repair and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration occurred and that the recovery was due to both the proliferation of supporting cells and, as seems likely, selfrepair of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> bundles in weakly damaged sensory cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} protein pRb {{is required for}} cell-cycle exit of embryonic mammalian <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> but not for their early differentiation. However, its role in postnatal <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> is unknown. To study the function of pRb in mature animals, we created a new conditional mouse model, with the Rb gene deleted primarily in the inner ear. Progeny survive up to 6 months. During early postnatal development, pRb−/− <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> continue to divide and can transduce mechanical stimuli. However, adult pRb−/− mice exhibit profound hearing loss due to progressive degeneration of the organ of Corti. We show that pRb {{is required for the}} full maturation of cochlear outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> likely in a gene-specific manner, and is also essential for their survival. In addition, lack of pRb results in cell division in postnatal auditory supporting cells. In contrast, many pRb−/− vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> survive and continue to divide in adult mice. Significantly, adult pRb−/− vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are functional, and pRb−/− mice maintain partial vestibular function. Therefore, the functional adult vestibular pRb−/− <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> derived from proliferation of postnatal <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> are largely integrated into vestibular pathways. This study reveals essential yet distinct roles of pRb in cochlear and vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> maturation, function, and survival and suggests that transient block of pRb function in mature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> may lead to propagation of functional <b>hair</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{bullfrog}} saccule, {{a sensor}} {{of gravity and}} substrate-borne vibration, is a model system for <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> transduction. Saccular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> also increase in number throughout adult life and rapidly recover after <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage, making this organ an ideal system for studying <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> development, repair, and regeneration. We have used of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> and supporting cell immunocytochemical markers to identify damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors in organotypic cultures of the bullfrog saccule. We then used an innovative combination of confocal, electron, and time-lapse microscopy to study the fate of damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and the origin of new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after gentamicin ototoxicity in normal and mitotically blocked saccular cultures. These {{studies have shown that}} gentamicin ototoxicity produces both lethal and sublethal <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage. They have also shown that <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> recovery in this organ takes place by both the repair of sublethally damaged <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and by the replacement of lost <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> by mitotic regeneration. In parallel studies, we have used biophysical and molecular biological techniques to study the differentiation and innervation of developing, repairing, and regenerating <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> More specifically, we have used RT-PCR to obtain the bullfrog homologues of L-type voltage- gated calcium (L-VGCC) and large-conductance Ca(2 +) -activated potassium (BK) channel genes. We have then obtained probes for these genes and, using in situ hybridization, begun to examine their expression in the bullfrog saccule and amphibian papilla. We have also used fluorescent-labeled channel toxins and channel toxin derivatives to determine the time of appearance of L-type voltage-gated calcium (L-VGCC) and Ca(2 +) -activated potassium (BK) channels and to study dynamic changes in the number, distribution, and co-localization of these proteins in developing, repairing, and regenerating <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Using time-lapse microscopy, we are also studying the dynamic relationship between ion channel clustering and synaptic formation in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and afferent neurons. In future studies, we will determine when <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors acquire electrical tuning, and, using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, identify and characterize their L-VGCC and BK currents. We will also use biophysical techniques to determine the number of L-VGCC and BK channels and the size and gating kinetics of their underlying L-VGCC and BK conductances, correlating these variables with the amplitude and frequency of membrane oscillations produced by intracellular current steps. We expect these studies to determine how <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> regulate ion channel expression to achieve specific physiological responses...|$|R
40|$|Sensory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are {{produced}} in the ears of birds and mammals only during early development, so that a programmed termination of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation leaves adult birds and mammals susceptible to irreversible deafness and balance disorders. This study reports {{that this is not}} an inherent feature of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and is not shared through all the vertebrate classes. In toads (Bufo marinus) <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> accumulate throughout life, increasing in the sacculus from approximately 400 cells at metamorphosis to more than 1600 in adulthood. In both embryonic and postembryonic ears new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> have been identified by scanning electron microscopy and through uptake of radioactively labeled thymidine. In the otic vesicle of postneurulation embryos there is a single primordial sensory epithelium that contains approximately 100 <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Scanning electron microscopy has demonstrated that these newly formed <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> all have stereocilia bundles that are shorter than 1. 5 micron, whereas the majority of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in postembryonic ears have stereocilia bundles that are at least 3 micron long. In the postembryonic sacculus the proliferation of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> never appears to cease, since newly produced <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> identified by their short stereocilia have been found in a distinct peripheral growth zone {{at the edge of the}} sensory epithelium even in specimens from the oldest 1 % of natural populations. This peripheral growth zone is also the site of the most frequent labeling of newly synthesized DNA in <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> It appears that the postembryonic enlargement of the toad sacculus occurs primarily through appositional addition of new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> at its edge, with few <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> added within the existing structure of the epithelium...|$|R
40|$|WSU Vancouver Honors ThesisMany contaminants, such as {{industrial}} pollutants, can {{be found}} in aquatic environments and may affect fish and other aquatic life. Some of these contaminants can also be found in trace amounts in water sources that are used for human consumption. Three of these contaminants are PCB- 95, BPA, and fluoride. In this study we investigated the effect each of these contaminants has on <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration in the larval zebrafish. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> are the mechanosensory receptors that allow sound perception by transducing sound waves and vibrations into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain via stimulation of the auditory nerve. Unlike mammals, birds, fish, and amphibians have the ability to regenerate <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> following a toxic insult. This study looks specifically at <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the lateral line. The lateral line is a system of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> along the exterior of the fish that are homologous to the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> located in the mammalian inner ear. To test if a contaminant is having an effect on <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration, we exposed fish to the <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> toxin neomycin, and then let the fish recover for 24 or 48 hours in variable contaminant concentration. We saw no significant effect of PCB- 95 and fluoride on <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration, but observed that exposure to higher concentrations of BPA resulted in reduced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration. We then asked if <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration occurs after recovery from BPA exposure, as BPA itself can kill <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> We observed reduced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> numbers 48 hrs post-BPA treatment, which suggests BPA continues to kill <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> post-exposure, similar to treatment with the ototoxic antibiotic gentamicin. These findings add to the growing list of harmful effects of BPA for both humans and aquatic life. Future experiments will distinguish if BPA continues to kill <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> while they are trying to regenerate, or if BPA disrupts the proliferative regeneration process...|$|R
40|$|Vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the inner}} ear encode head {{movements}} and mediate the sense of balance. These cells undergo cell death and replacement (turnover) throughout life in non-mammalian vertebrates. However, there is no definitive evidence that this process occurs in mammals. We used fate-mapping and other methods to demonstrate that utricular type II vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> undergo turnover in adult mice under normal conditions. We found that supporting cells phagocytose both type I and II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Plp 1 -CreER(T 2) -expressing supporting cells replace type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Type I <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are not restored by Plp 1 -CreER(T 2) -expressing supporting cells or by Atoh 1 -CreER(TM) -expressing type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Destruction of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> causes supporting cells to generate 6 times as many type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> compared to normal conditions. These findings expand our understanding of sensorineural plasticity in adult vestibular organs and further elucidate the roles that supporting cells serve during homeostasis and after injury...|$|R
