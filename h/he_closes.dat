When he tells Hud to put his half of their inheritance in the bank, his uncle replies that Lonnie now sees him as Homer did. Hud {{goes back into the}} Bannon house alone; as <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> the door, the final fade-out is the window shade's pull-ring swaying.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{initially}} makes {{light of}} the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts to reassert his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> the meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks {{to meet with him}} to have sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and only becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex.|$|E
5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> the door on him.|$|E

25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and {{presents}} the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it [...] "wasn't actually that hard".

500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover how he has ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you. I tell you I am just like you!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Speechless" [...] {{was one of}} {{only two}} songs from Invincible to be written solely by Jackson (the second song being [...] "The Lost Children"). Jeremy Lubbock worked with the {{musician}} in arranging and conducting an orchestra. Instrumentalists on the track included Brad Buxer on keyboards, and Novi Novog and Thomas Tally on violas. The violinists consisted of Peter Kent, Gina Kronstadt, Robin Lorentz, Kirstin Fife and John Wittenberg. The track featured backing vocals from Andraé Crouch and his gospel choir, The Andraé Crouch Singers. [...] "Speechless" [...] was digitally edited by Buxer and Stuart Brawley, and was mixed by Bruce Swedien, who later said, [...] "Everything with Michael is a stand-out moment but an absolutely gorgeous piece of music called 'Speechless' was really an event. Michael sings the first eight bars acappella. At the end, <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> it off acappella– it was Michael's idea to add the acappella parts." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{receptive}} to mating, a female {{blacktip reef shark}} swims slowly in a [...] pattern near the bottom with her head pointed down; observations in the wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them. Once the male finds her, <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> to around [...] and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent. A courting male may also bite the female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins; these mating wounds heal completely after 4–6 weeks. After a period of synchronous swimming, the male pushes the female on her side and positions her so her head is against the bottom and her tail is raised. Once the female is in position, the male inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for several minutes, after which the sharks separate and resume their regular behavior. Off Moorea, individual older females mate and give birth at a consistent time every year, often to within a week's precision, whereas younger females exhibit more variability in their timing. Younger females {{are also more likely}} to fail to become pregnant after mating.|$|E

2500|$|Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's {{encounter}} with {{the man behind the}} counter at the gas station. [...] "Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most you ever saw lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the establishing shot of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth." ...|$|E

He begins saying that Nancy Mitford's article has given rise to much pleasurable discussion. Before pushing on to the less etymological aspects of her theme, he addresses how language evolves and changes naturally, and U-slang, attributing to it a sense of parody. He says interest in the study of U-speech has been arbitrarily awakened and considers this interest unhealthy and contrary to the [...] "national interest". <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> his article hoping (ironically) that the U-young will strive for a clear, classless medium of communication in which all say [...] "Pardon?" [...] and none say [...] "What?", and every ball is a dance and every man's wife is [...] "the" [...] wife, but then saying that he will be surprised and disappointed if they do anything of the sort.|$|E

2500|$|The Eleventh Doctor first {{appears in}} the final scene of The End of Time (2010) when his {{previous}} incarnation regenerates. Smith debuts fully in [...] "The Eleventh Hour", where he first meets Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) as a child while investigating a mysterious crack in her wall. Many years later, Amy joins the Doctor as his travelling companion {{on the eve of}} her marriage to Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). In [...] "Victory of the Daleks", he is tricked into spawning a new generation of Daleks. In [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone", he re-encounters future companion River Song (Alex Kingston) and his enemies the Weeping Angels, and learns that cracks like the one in Amy's wall are erasing individuals entirely from time and space. After Amy attempts to seduce the Doctor, the Doctor recruits Rory as a second companion from [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] up until [...] "Cold Blood", where he is killed protecting the Doctor and is erased from history. The Doctor also confronts his dark side in [...] "Amy's Choice", where he is put through trials by a manifestation of his self-loathing, the Dream Lord (Toby Jones).
