5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis has {{separate}} sexes (i.e. these snails are <b>dioecious).</b> The {{diploid number}} of chromosomes (2n) is 25 in males and 26 in females. There is X0 sex-determination system in Neritidae, {{and it was}} confirmed for this species too.|$|E
5|$|Only Phoronis ovalis {{naturally}} builds colonies by budding or by splitting into top {{and bottom}} sections which then grow into full bodies. In experiments, other species have split successfully, but only when both parts have enough gonadal (reproductive) tissue. All phoronids breed sexually from spring to autumn. Some species are hermaphroditic (have {{both male and female}} reproductive organs) but cross-fertilize (fertilize the eggs of other members), while others are <b>dioecious</b> (have separate sexes). The gametes (sperms and ova) are produced in the swollen gonads, around the stomach. The gametes swim through the metacoelom to the metanephridia. Sperm exit by the nephridiopores and some are captured by the lophophores of individuals of the same species. Species that lay small fertilized eggs release them into the water as plankton, while species with larger eggs brood them either in the body's tube or stuck {{in the center of the}} lophophore by adhesive. The brooded eggs are released to feed on plankton when they develop into larvae.|$|E
5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be <b>dioecious</b> when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are <b>dioecious,</b> individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation is external. Veliger larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft of broad, compound cilia near the mouth. The velum, the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting front end of the foot) develops on about the 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen. A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E
25|$|Elimia virginica is <b>dioecious.</b> It lays its {{eggs from}} spring to summer, in {{particular}} in June and July.|$|E
25|$|Ginkgos are <b>dioecious,</b> with {{separate}} sexes, some trees being female and others being male. Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls, each bearing two microsporangia spirally arranged around a central axis.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive {{advantages}} of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the {{advantages of}} the hermaphrodite forms – in maximum diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to <b>dioecious</b> state leads to a loss of {{at least half of the}} diversity. So, the main question is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + <b>dioecious)</b> over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.|$|E
25|$|Cycadophyta are {{typically}} <b>dioecious</b> (seed strobili and pollen strobili are produced on separate plants). The lateral organs of seed strobili are megasporophylls (modified leaves) that bear two to several marginal ovules. Pollen strobili consist of microsporophylls, {{each of which}} may have dozens or hundreds of abaxial microsporangia.|$|E
25|$|Diospyros virginiana grows through , in well-drained soil. In summer, {{this species}} {{produces}} fragrant flowers which are <b>dioecious,</b> so one must have {{both male and}} female plants to obtain fruit. Most cultivars are parthenocarpic (setting seedless fruit without pollination). The flowers are pollinated by insects and wind. Fruiting typically begins when the tree is about 6 years old.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the plants}} require a male plant to {{pollinate}} a female plant for the female plant to produce fruit (<b>dioecious).</b> For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is required. Other varieties can self pollinate, but they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit vines.|$|E
25|$|Gnetophyta {{consists}} of three genera, Ephedra, Gnetum and Welwitschia. All three are typically <b>dioecious,</b> although some Ephedra species exhibit monoecy. In contrast to the conifers, which have simple pollen strobili and compound seed strobili, gnetophytes have both compound pollen and seed strobili. The seed strobili of Ephedra and Gnetum are reduced, with Ephedra producing only two ovules per strobilus and Gnetum a single ovule.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} sex {{includes}} two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation {{of this information}} into two parts). Depending on {{the presence or absence}} of these phenomena, the existing ways of reproduction can be divided into asexual, hermaphrodite and <b>dioecious</b> forms. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are diametrically opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.|$|E
25|$|Jiaogulan {{belongs to}} the genus Gynostemma, in the family Cucurbitaceae, which {{includes}} cucumbers, gourds, and melons. Its fruit is a small purple inedible gourd. It is a climbing vine, attaching itself to supports using tendrils. The serrated leaflets commonly grow in groups of five (as in G. pentaphyllum) although some species can have groups of three or seven leaflets. The plant is <b>dioecious,</b> meaning each plant exists either as male or female. Therefore, if seeds are desired, both a male and female plant must be grown.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>dioecious</b> (it has two {{distinct}} sexes), iteroparous (reproducing {{more than once}} in a lifetime) and ovoviviparous, laying eggs singly in albumen-filled capsules. Females generally brood eggs for 9–10 months. Fecundity is generally between 4 and 81 young per female, but on average is closer to 11 young/female. Females can brood more than one batch of young at a time, and the number of young in one brood is positively related {{to the size of the}} female. Reproductive females are usually larger than 16mm. Female banded mystery snails live 28 – 48 and males live 18 – 36 months.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} very small, in greenish-white in {{clusters}} {{at the top}} of a long stalk and a rich source or nectar for bees. They are often <b>dioecious</b> so a male and female tree in proximity is required to set seed, however, many trees are also polygamo-dioecious, which means they have both male and female flowers on the same tree. The fruit is a black-blue, ovoid stone fruit, about 10mm long with a thin, oily, bitter-to-sour tasting flesh and very popular with small bird species. There are from one to three fruits together on a long slender stalk. They are a valuable energy food for birds, especially the American robin.|$|E
25|$|The seed cones {{are highly}} modified, each cone {{containing}} a single seed 4–7mm long partly {{surrounded by a}} modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril, 8–15mm long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6–9 months after pollination. The seeds contained in the arils are eaten by thrushes and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2–3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, 3–6mm diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is mostly <b>dioecious,</b> but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or change sex with time.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins are spiky {{echinoderms}} with spherical bodies {{which usually}} contain five gonads. They move slowly, feed mostly on seaweed, and {{are important for}} the diet of sea otters. Sea urchins are <b>dioecious,</b> having separate male and female sexes, although there is generally {{no easy way to}} distinguish the two. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water, where fertilization takes place. Their roe (male and female gonads) is soft and melting, with a colour ranging from orange to pale yellow, and is sought after as a human delicacy {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Most {{nematode}} {{species are}} <b>dioecious,</b> with separate {{male and female}} individuals, though some, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are androdioecious, consisting of hermaphrodites and rare males. Both sexes possess one or two tubular gonads. In males, the sperm are produced {{at the end of}} the gonad and migrate along its length as they mature. The testis opens into a relatively wide seminal vesicle and then during intercourse into a glandular and muscular ejaculatory duct associated with the vas deferens and cloaca. In females, the ovaries each open into an oviduct (in hermaphrodites, the eggs enter a spermatheca first) and then a glandular uterus. The uteri both open into a common vulva/ vagina, usually located in the middle of the morphologically ventral surface.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>dioecious</b> plant, the {{inconspicuous}} pistillate (female) and staminate (male) {{flowers are}} found on different trees. Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in racemes borne on long, slender, drooping peduncles {{developed from the}} axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year. They feature a hairy, four-lobed calyx; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of calyx, on the margin of a thin disk. Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense spherical many-flowered head which appears on a short stout peduncle from the axils of the current year's growth. Each flower has a hairy four-lobed calyx with thick, concave lobes that invest the ovary and enclose the fruit. Ovaries are superior, ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender style covered with white stigmatic hairs. The ovule is solitary.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{original}} description and early {{work on this}} species in the 1990s, other field work has revealed some instances of L. schismatica flowers that were unisexual. The closely related species Triuris brevistylis was discovered to be mostly <b>dioecious</b> but a few individuals were located that had bisexual flowers with the flower arrangement inverted, just {{like that of the}} normal L. schismatica flowers. This discovery led the authors of the study to conclude that the inverted floral morphology evolved before L. schismatica and T. brevistylis diverged. Isolated populations during the Quaternary Period (around five million years ago) when temperatures in the Lacandon lowland rainforest were six to eight °C (10.8 to 14.4 °F) cooler than today. This hypothesis is supported by the geographic distribution where L. schismatica is restricted to the warmer lowlands and T. brevistylis has a distribution in the cooler highlands.|$|E
25|$|Monoecious, {{sometimes}} <b>dioecious</b> herbs, shrubs, or {{trees to}} 6m tall. Thorns or other armature absent. Stipules present, sometimes leaf-like is some Meineckia. Petioles present or absent, not pulvinate. leaves simple, arrangement alternate, subopposite, {{or in some}} Poranthera, opposite. margins entire. Inflorescences axillary, or rarely, apparently terminal. Flowers solitary to fasciculate. Sepals free, greenish, persistent. Petals present or absent, often partly adnate to the nectary disk, equal to the sepals or shorter, white or greenish, usually larger in staminate than in pistillate flowers. Disk present, extrastaminal; annular or divided into alternisepalous segments or glands. Stamens opposite the sepals, free or fused for up to 9/10 of their length. Anthers latrorse, at least in bud, opening by longitudinal slits, or in Poranthera, by pores. Ovary usually divided into three locules. Two ovules in each locule. Styles free to almost completely fused. Fruit explosively dehiscent. Seeds usually two per locule; sometimes one in Actephila and Meineckia.|$|E
25|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} {{are typically}} <b>dioecious,</b> with separate {{male and female}} individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles. Many species fertilise their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile sea cucumber. A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming larva, usually after about three days of development. This larva swims {{by means of a}} long band of cilia wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a barrel-shaped body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins are <b>dioecious,</b> having {{separate}} {{male and}} female sexes, although distinguishing the two is not easy, except for their locations on the sea bottom. Males generally choose elevated and exposed locations, so their milt can be broadcast by sea currents. Females generally choose low-lying locations in sea bottom crevices, presumably so the tiny larvae can have better protection from predators. Indeed, very small sea urchins are found hiding beneath rocks. Regular sea urchins have five gonads, lying underneath the interambulacral regions of the test, while the irregular forms have only four, with the hindmost gonad being absent. Each gonad has a single duct rising from the upper pole to open at a gonopore lying {{in one of the}} genital plates surrounding the anus. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water where fertilization takes place.|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum, {{like all}} other land plants, has an {{alternation}} of generations; like other bryophytes, the haploid gametophyte generation is dominant and persistent. Unlike other mosses, the long-lived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake. Sphagnum species can be unisexual (male or female, <b>dioecious)</b> or bisexual (male and female gametes produced from the same plant; monoecious); In North America, 80% of Sphagnum species are unisexual. Gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation, producing much of the living material in sphagnum peatlands. Swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female gametophyte. The sporophyte is relatively short-lived, and consists almost entirely of a shiny green, spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores. Sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal, but unlike other mosses, Sphagnum stalks are produced by the maternal gametophyte. Tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the sporophyte by meiosis, which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap, called an operculum, and shoots the spores some distance. The spores germinate to produce minute protonemae, which start as filaments, can become thalloid, and can produce a few rhizoids. Soon afterwards the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic, erect, leafy, branched gametophyte with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells. This stage dominates the environment where Sphagnum grows, obliterating and burying the protonema and eventually building up into layers of dead moss called peat. Carpets of living Sphagnum may be attacked by various fungi, and one fungus that is also a mushroom, Sphagnurus paluster, produces conspicuous dead patches. When this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema, Sphagnum is induced to produce non-photosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes. It is unknown whether the leafy stage can produce such gemmae.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} <b>dioecious</b> nature, a hybrid {{involving}} {{a pair of}} Nepenthes species can represent one of two possible crosses, depending on which species was the female and which was the male. When the cross is known, the female (or pod) parent is usually referred to first, followed by the male (or pollen) parent. [...] This is an important distinction, as the hybrid will usually display different morphological features according {{to the type of}} cross; the pod parent is thought to be dominant in most cases and hybrid offspring usually resemble it more than the pollen parent. [...] Most wild plants of N. × kinabaluensis, for example, show a greater affinity to N. rajah than N. villosa and are thus thought to represent the cross N. rajah × N. villosa. [...] However, specimens have been found that seem to be more similar to N. villosa, suggesting that they might be the reverse cross (see [...] ). [...] The same is true for other hybrids involving N. rajah.|$|E
500|$|Nepenthes rajah {{seems to}} flower {{at any time}} of the year. [...] Flowers are {{produced}} in large numbers on inflorescences that arise from the apex of the main stem. [...] N. rajah produces a very large inflorescence that can be 80cm, and sometimes even 120cm [...] tall. [...] The individual flowers of N. rajah are produced on partial peduncles (twin stalks) and so the inflorescence is called a raceme (as opposed to a panicle for multi-flowered bunches). [...] The flowers are reported to give off a strong sugary smell and are brownish-yellow in colour. Sepals are elliptic to oblong and ≤8mm long. Like all Nepenthes species, N. rajah is <b>dioecious,</b> which means that individual plants produce flowers of a single sex. [...] Fruits are orange-brown and 10 to 20mm long (see [...] ). A study of 300 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (J.H.Adam 2443, collected at an altitude of 1930–2320m) found the mean pollen diameter to be 34.7μm (SE = 0.3; CV = 7.0%).|$|E
500|$|Postelsia has two {{distinct}} morphologies: one for its diploid, monoicous sporophyte stage, {{which is the}} dominant portion of the life cycle, and one for its smaller, haploid, <b>dioecious</b> gametophyte stage. [...] Like all seaweeds, the sporophyte stage of Postelsia consists of a thallus, which {{is made up of}} a stem-like stipe topped with possibly over 100 leaf-like blades, and rests on a root-like holdfast. [...] The holdfast anchors the organism to the rocks it lives on. [...] The sea palm has no vascular system; the stipe is only for support of the organism and holds the fronds up over other organisms so they can receive more light. [...] The stipe is merely a firm, hollow tube, able to withstand the open air of low tide conditions as well as the crashing waves of high tide. [...] The blades are grooved, with the sporangia held within these grooves. [...] The gametophyte stage is microscopic, consisting of only a few cells. [...] The gametophytes produce sperm and eggs to create new sporophytes.|$|E
500|$|The {{flowers are}} small and appear in large panicles up to [...] in length {{at the end of}} new shoots. The {{individual}} flowers are yellowish green to reddish in colour, each with five petals and sepals. The sepals are cup-shaped, lobed and united while the petals are valvate (i.e. they meet at the edges without overlapping), white and hairy towards the inside. They appear from mid-April in the south of its range to July in the north. A. altissima is <b>dioecious,</b> with male and female flowers being borne on different individuals. Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the females, making the male flowers more conspicuous. Furthermore, the male plants emit a foul-smelling odour while flowering to attract pollinating insects. Female flowers contain ten (or rarely five through abortion) sterile stamens (stamenoides) with heart-shaped anthers. The pistil is made up of five free carpels (i.e. they are not fused), each containing a single ovule. Their styles are united and slender with star-shaped stigmas. The male flowers are similar in appearance, but they of course lack a pistil and the stamens do function, each being topped with a globular anther and a glandular green disc. [...] The fruits grow in clusters; a fruit cluster may contain hundreds of seeds. The seeds borne on the female trees are 5mm in diameter and each is encapsulated in a samara that is [...] long and [...] broad, appearing July though August, but can persist on the tree until the next spring. The samara is large and twisted at the tips, making it spin as it falls, assisting wind dispersal, and aiding buoyancy for long-distance dispersal through hydrochory. [...] The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, normally around 30,000 per kilogram (14,000/lb) of tree, [...] and fecundity can be estimated non-destructively through measurements of dbh.|$|E
