25|$|It {{was then}} {{a few years later}} that two {{entrepreneurs}} from Chattanooga, Tennessee, namely Benjamin F. Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead, proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that Candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar. Candler never collected his dollar, but in 1899, Chattanooga became the site of the first Coca-Cola bottling company. Candler remained very content just selling his company's syrup. The loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for The Coca-Cola Company for decades to come. Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies, effectively becoming parent bottlers. This contract specified that bottles would be sold at 5¢ each and had no <b>fixed</b> <b>duration,</b> leading to the fixed price of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959.|$|E

The effect of blocking sensory action potentials with stimuli of various durations has been investigated, as well as the blocking of action potentials in motor nerve fibres by voluntary activity. It is concluded that pulses of long duration (1 msec or more) selectively stimulate sensory fibres at threshold, whereas short duration pulses (less than 200 μsec) selectively stimulate motor fibres...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{analysis}} of trajectors (i. e. located entities) in language about <b>fixed</b> <b>durations</b> of TIME. More specifically, trajectors in instances including the English prepositions in or on, or their Swedish equivalents i or på, are analyzed. On {{the structure of the}} inverse Moving Observer/Moving Time metaphors (Lakoff & Johnson 1999) instances such as these should be construed relative to a Moving Observer, and trajectors people that move relative to <b>fixed</b> <b>durations</b> of TIME (as reflected in e. g. when we come to launching the 4 th edition in early 1990). My analysis, however, suggests that our understanding of TIME through SPACE is more nuanced than suggested by these metaphors. In this specific context, trajectors are not typically people in motion, but rather events or processes located in, or on, unit of time landmarks. My study emphasizes the need to test the systematicity of the mappings proposed by Conceptual Metaphor Theory...|$|R
2500|$|Beside {{the length}} of the {{syllable}}s (measured in tenths of seconds), each text syllable was evaluated in terms of its position within the word to which it belongs, defining such variables as [...] "the syllable has or has not the main accent", [...] "the syllable is or is not {{at the end of a}} word", etc., and in terms of the particular sounds produced (for instance, the syllable contains the vowel [...] "i"). The various neume elements were evaluated by attaching different duration values to them, both in terms of semiological propositions (nuanced durations according to the manner of neume writing in Chris Hakkennes’ Graduale Lagal), and in terms of <b>fixed</b> <b>duration</b> values that were based on mensuralistic notions, however with ratios between short and long notes ranging from 1 : 1, via 1 : 1.2, 1 : 1.4, etc. to 1 : 3. To distinguish short and long notes, tables were consulted that were established by Van Kampen in an unpublished comparative study regarding the neume notations according to St Gallen and Laon codices. With some exceptions, these tables confirm the short vs. long distinctions in Cardine’s 'Semiologie Gregorienne'.|$|E
6000|$|In the old prize-ring a round had no <b>fixed</b> <b>duration.</b> It was {{terminated}} {{by the fall}} of one of the combatants (in practice usually both of them), and was followed by an interval of half a minute for recuperation. The practical effect of this was that a combatant could always get a respite of half a minute whenever he wanted it by pretending to be knocked down: [...] "finding the earth the safest place," [...] as the old phrase went. For this the Marquess of Queensberry substituted a rule that a round with the gloves should last a specified time, usually three or four minutes, and that a combatant who did not stand up to his opponent continuously during that time (ten seconds being allowed for rising {{in the event of a}} knock-down) lost the battle. That unobtrusively slipped-in ten seconds limit has produced the modern glove fight. Its practical effect is that a man dazed by a blow or a fall for, say, twelve seconds, which would not have mattered in an old-fashioned fight with its thirty seconds interval,[1] has under the Queensberry rules either to lose or else stagger to his feet in a helpless condition and be eagerly battered into insensibility by his opponent before he can recover his powers of self-defence. The notion that such a battery cannot be inflicted with boxing gloves is only entertained by people who have never used them or seen them used. I may say that I have myself received, in an accident, a blow in the face, involving two macadamized holes in it, more violent than the most formidable pugilist could have given me with his bare knuckles. This blow did not stun or disable me even momentarily. On the other hand, I have seen a man knocked quite silly by a tap from the most luxurious sort of boxing glove made, wielded by a quite unathletic literary man sparring for the first time in his life. The human jaw, like the human elbow, is provided, as every boxer knows, with a [...] "funny bone"; and the pugilist who is lucky enough to jar that funny bone with a blow practically has his opponent at his mercy for at least ten seconds. Such a blow is called a [...] "knock-out." [...] The funny bone and the ten-seconds rule explain the development of Queensberry sparring into the modern knocking-out match or glove fight.|$|E

40|$|Video Games {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular ways for someone to relieve stress or spend their free time. Most of the video game that is {{available}} right now can be played in single player. Unfortunately, most of the times when playing video games in single player, people usually get bored quite easily due to the enemy having static patterns as their actions. To overcome this problem, this thesis will be developing a game with an enemy that is not easily predictable. The genre of the game is Action Role-playing Game (ARPG). The Artificial Intelligence involved is made using the Fuzzy State Automata method. Using the Fuzzy State Automata method, the enemy will have to decide which state that it with enter using the input fuzzy sets and act accordingly. The states of the fuzzy state automata in here also have no <b>fixed</b> <b>durations,</b> therefore adding another unpredictability element for the player to deal with. Based on the testing of the Fuzzy State Automata, the artificial intelligence have the ability to react accordingly to its inputs. The Fuzzy State Automata also manages to successfully exhibit the capability of its states to have no <b>fixed</b> <b>durations</b> to make the enemy actions harder to predict...|$|R

50|$|In a {{study by}} Donaldson and Vollmer, the {{efficacy}} of a <b>fixed</b> <b>duration</b> time-out and a release contingency time-out were compared. In the <b>fixed</b> <b>duration</b> condition, children were sent to time-out {{for a total of}} 4 minutes and were released from time-out whether or not they performed problem behavior during the time-out session. In the release contingency condition, children were not released from time-out if they were performing problem behavior during the last 30 seconds of their time-out. The time-out was extended until there were no occurrences of problem behavior for a total of 30 seconds or until the time-out reached the ten-minute mark. Results showed that both time-out procedures were successful in reducing the problem behavior for the subjects. The subjects in the release contingency did not benefit from staying in time-out {{for an extended period of}} time either. Moreover, the results show that only 4 minutes is necessary for a successful time-out procedure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a software reliability model where the failure rate of each fault {{depends on the}} specific operation performed. The software is tested in a given sequence of test cases for <b>fixed</b> <b>durations</b> of time {{to collect data on}} failure times. We present a Bayesian analysis of software failure data by treating the initial number of faults as a random variable. Our analysis relies on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and is used for developing optimal testing strategies in an adaptive manner. Two different models involving individual and common faults are analyzed. We illustrate an implementation of our approach by using some simulated failure data. c © 2001 Joh...|$|R
