500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene in the}} episode, Hawking and Homer are seen {{discussing}} the universe in Moe's tavern. Scully stated that the scene was included because it [...] "was {{a chance to get}} the world's smartest man and the world's stupidest man in the same place". In the scene, Hawking tells Homer [...] "Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing... <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> steal it." [...] In his book What's science ever done for us?: what The Simpsons can teach us about physics, robots, life and the universe, Paul Halpern wrote that in mathematics, a [...] "donut-shape", the three-dimensional generalization of a ring, is referred to as a torus. The generalization of a torus, any closed curve spun in a circle around an axis, is called a toroid. According to Halpern, Hawking's line references {{the fact that there are}} [...] "genuine" [...] scientific theories that the universe is toroidal.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Stephen Hawking's {{appearance}} in the episode was acclaimed by critics. Although they generally disliked the episode, Martyn and Wood wrote that Hawking's cameo [...] "saves [...] from being very boring". Plath called the performance [...] "very funny", while Jane described it as [...] "great". Hawking reached seventh place in UGO's list of The Simpsonss [...] "Top 11 Guest Stars", and finished in fourteenth place in [...] "The Simpsons 20 best guest voices of all time" [...] by Ryan Stewart of The Boston Phoenix. Stewart wrote that Hawking's line [...] ""Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe intrigues me, Homer. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> steal it" [...] was a [...] "memorable" [...] quote from the episode. Ethan Alter of The Morning Call described Hawking's cameo {{as one of the}} series' ten best, and wrote that Hawking's best line in the episode was [...] "I wanted to see your Utopia, but now I see it is more of a Fruitopia." [...] Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski placed Hawking at number sixteen on their list [...] "Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances". They wrote that he had a [...] "fairly major" [...] role in the episode, and that he had [...] "several great lines".|$|E
500|$|Blaine and Kurt's {{relationship}} has been generally well received. They were named Favorite TV Couple at the 2010 AfterElton.com Visibility Awards, and have been lauded for [...] "leading the way" [...] in representing gay teenagers on television by Entertainment Weekly. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post referred to them as [...] "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium". When they [...] "finally solidified what their relationship actually is" [...] in the episode [...] "Silly Love Songs", IGN Robert Canning noted that his opinion of Blaine improved. He commented: [...] "I love that the [...] blew up in Blaine's face. The character has always come off to me as annoyingly arrogant, but [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] humanized the guy. Guess <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> like him now." [...] Their first kiss, in the episode [...] "Original Song", was met with critical acclaim. Mark Perigard of The Boston Herald wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It's long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story." [...] Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly was so impressed with the scene that she was initially concerned it may be a dream sequence, [...] "because we don't get romantic, unapologetic first kisses like that between young gay characters on network TV." [...] She wrote, [...] "Relationships aren't easy. They’ll make mistakes. But if they stay true to themselves, and continue to be as open and honest with each other, we're in for something special." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Blaine and Kurt. She called the kiss scene a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment", and praised Criss and Colfer for [...] "handl it with dignity and honesty".|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{estimates}} {{are that the}} bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin {{was living in the}} house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: [...] "I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hold an inquest." ...|$|E

In an earlier interview, Erlandson stated: [...] "I've also been doing research for a Hole box set that I'd like to finish as soon as possible. I have tapes galore that need to be digitized. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do the dreaded [...] "kickstarter" [...] campaign to get it all done. It's not easy listening back to old Hole rehearsals. Lemme tellya. The screaming, the anguish, the F-C-G chords over and over again like some sick folk loop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zuo Ci offered Cao Cao {{the books}} if Cao himself became a disciple of Taoism. Cao Cao responded, [...] "Often have I {{reflected}} upon this course and struggled against my fate, {{but what can}} I do? There is no one to maintain the government," [...] when Zuo Ci suggested Liu Bei and threatened Cao Cao, [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> send one of my flying swords after your head one day", Cao accused Zuo {{of being one of}} Liu Bei's agents, and threatened him. Zuo Ci openly mocked Cao Cao in court and Cao had him arrested; the guards beat Zuo cruelly, but the Taoist then fell asleep and slept soundly through the night. This enraged Cao Cao, who ordered Zuo Ci to be starved of food, this also failed as Zuo quite happily went seven days without food or water. After this Cao Cao could think of nothing else to punish Zuo Ci. When Zuo Ci appeared at Cao Cao's banquet, Cao tested him by asking to get, among other things, a dragon's liver, a peony, and perch from the Song River. Zuo Ci accomplished everything, which drew further suspicion from Cao Cao. Zuo Ci then offered a cup of wine to Cao Cao, who said that Zuo should taste first. Zuo Ci took a stick and divided the wine in half, and drank one half. Cao Cao was enraged.|$|E
