[...] Scott D. Pierce of Deseret News reported that Jackson's appearance [...] "takes the focus off the regular characters" [...] while Mark Harris of Entertainment Weekly commented that Jackson's guest spot [...] "was an all-time low".|$|E

Timothy Ferriss recounts what {{he observed}} when roasted his insects without freezing them first: [...] "Suffice it to say, merely sedated crickets make horrible noises if you roast them, {{and the visual}} is far, far worse. <b>Do</b> <b>yourself</b> a favor and freeze them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1998 Brian Mannix (ex-Uncanny X-Men) {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a stage play, Countdown: The Musical Comedy, with Meldrum portrayed by Michael Veitch. McFarlane observed [...] " [...] was a loving and funny tribute to the Countdown era. It may have been shameless nostalgia, but with Veitch perfectly cast as Molly it {{was a hell of}} a lot of fun". It toured Australia through 1998 to 1999 and, in 2009, was revamped as Can't Believe It's not Countdown â€“ It's a Musical Comedy. Meldrum also appeared on the tribute show, Countdown: <b>Do</b> <b>Yourself</b> a Favour, celebrating its 40th anniversary, which was broadcast by ABC in November 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1955 investigation, Moseley {{found other}} flaws in Adamski's story. He interviewed {{several of the}} people that Adamski claimed had been with him in his initial 20 November 1952 meeting with Orthon, and found that these {{witnesses}} contradicted Adamski's claims. One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard [...] "a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc." [...] several days before Adamski's claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski's meeting with Orthon was a [...] "planned operation." [...] Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: [...] "Now you know the [...] picture connected to your name is in the book (Flying Saucers Have Landed) too. And with people knowing that you are connected with flying saucers...you could <b>do</b> <b>yourself</b> a lot of good. You could give lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! You could support yourself by the picture in the book with your name." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show's {{first season}} was well regarded. [...] "One Tree Hill: The Complete First Season is a {{surprisingly}} rewarding experience", said Neal Solon of DVD Verdict. [...] "Throughout its first season, One Tree Hill distinguishes itself from other teen dramas by dealing {{with more than}} just the backstabbing, backbiting, and backwards morals of today's youth," [...] he said. [...] "Certainly, the show contains its fair share of this petty drama, but it also explores the reasons behind it." [...] He gives the effect of the parents' mistakes on the teenagers as an example. Solon felt that the Season 1 finale was strong partly because its creators did not know if the WB would renew the show. [...] "The last few episodes bring some form of closure to the major story arcs, while leaving the door wide open for further development should the show continue. It is an artfully employed strategy that paid off," [...] he said. Also reviewing season 1, Paul Cooke of DVDActive.com stated, [...] "If you take the time to invest some emotional capital {{in the lives of the}} characters, you usually will find yourself absorbed in their trials and tribulations. One Tree Hill is no different, in fact, it may be notch above some of the other teen angst shows." [...] Cooke added, [...] "All of the actors are pleasant to look at, the storylines are interesting and the music is fresh and enjoyable. How could someone not enjoy this show? <b>Do</b> <b>yourself</b> a favour, and visit One Tree Hill." ...|$|E
