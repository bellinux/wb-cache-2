40|$|As an {{essential}} approach to understanding human interactions, <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> {{is a vital}} component of behavioral studies {{as well as being}} important in the design of context-aware systems. Recent studies have shown that speech contains rich information about emotion, and numerous speech-based <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> methods have been proposed.

We present an <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> system using several one-against-all support vector machines with a thresholding fusion mechanism to combine the individual outputs, which provides the functionality to effectively increase the <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> accuracy at the expense of rejecting some samples as unclassified.

40|$|Abstract. In <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> {{of speech}} signals, the popular {{features}} employed are statistics of fundamental frequency, energy contour, duration {{of silence and}} voice quality. However, the performance of systems employing these features degrades substantially when more than two categories of emotion are to be classified.

In healthy individuals, the capacity of visual working memory is enhanced when the material to be retained is emotionally salient, particularly for angry faces. We investigated whether patients with schizophrenia also have an enhanced WM capacity for angry faces. We compared 34 inpatients with schizophrenia and 34 age-, handedness- and gender-matched control participants in three separate tasks. In the WM task, participants saw two faces with angry, happy or neutral emotional expressions for 2 s and had to decide whether a probe face presented after a 1 s delay was identical to one of them. In the <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> task, they had to assign these faces to the appropriate categorical emotion. They also rated faces for valence and arousal. Although patients performed generally worse on the working memory task, they showed the same benefit for angry faces as control participants. However, patients were specifically impaired for angry faces on the <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> task. These results indicate preserved implicit emotion processing in schizophrenia patients, which contrasts with their impairment in explicit <b>emotion</b> <b>classification.</b> With regard to clinical practice, our findings underline the importance of assessing responsiveness to emotions in patients with schizophrenia, with a view possibly to utilize preserved implicit emotion processing in cognitive remediation programs...|$|R

Normally, the pitch value of sad and happy speech signals has a great difference and the frequency value of happy is higher than sad speech.

40|$|Emotion adds an {{important}} element to the discussion of how information is conveyed and processed by humans; indeed, it plays {{an important}} role in the contextual understanding of messages. This research is centered on investigating relevant features for affect classification, along with modeling the multimodal and multitemporal nature of emotion. The use of formant-based features for affect classification is explored. Since linear predictive coding (LPC) based formant estimators often encounter problems with modeling speech elements, such as nasalized phonemes and give inconsistent results for bandwidth estimation, a robust formant-tracking algorithm was introduced to better model the formant and spectral properties of speech. The algorithm utilizes Gaussian mixtures to estimate spectral parameters and refines the estimates using maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation. When the method was used for features extraction applied to <b>emotion</b> <b>classification,</b> the results indicate that an improved formant-tracking method will also provide improved <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> accuracy. Spectral features contain rich information about expressivity and emotion. However, most of the recent work in affective computing has not progressed beyond analyzing the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC’s) and their derivatives. A novel method for characterizing spectral peaks was introduced. The method uses a multi-resolution sinusoidal transform coding (MRSTC). Because of MRSTC’s high precision in representing spectral features, including preservation of high frequency content not present in the MFCC’s, additional resolving power was demonstrated. Facial expressions were analyzed using 53 motion capture (MoCap) markers. Statistical and regression measures of these markers were used for <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> along the voice features. Since different modalities use different sampling frequencies and analysis window lengths, a novel classifier fusion algorithm was introduced. This algorithm is intended to integrate classifiers trained at various analysis lengths, as well as those obtained from other modalities. Classification accuracy was statistically significantly improved using a multimodal-multitemporal approach with the introduced classifier fusion method. A practical application of the techniques for <b>emotion</b> <b>classification</b> was explored using social dyadic plays between a child and an adult. The Multimodal Dyadic Behavior (MMDB) dataset was used to automatically predict young children’s levels of engagement using linguistic and non-linguistic vocal cues along with visual cues, such as direction of a child’s gaze or a child’s gestures.
