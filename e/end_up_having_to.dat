When he goes to the past, he finds himself lying to a pretty girl to impress her, a lie that causes him to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> joust with her potential husband. As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, Chris single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man crazy enough to kill them all.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few drug therapies that are {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since there is no cure for it, the patient will probably <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E

500|$|By October 1997, {{the rising}} {{popularity}} of swing music {{had contributed to}} the consistently steady sales of Zoot Suit Riot, persuading Mojo to issue the album's title track as a single and distribute it among mainstream radio stations. The Daddies, who were beginning work on their next studio album, ardently protested this move, believing that a swing song would never receive major airplay and were concerned that the band would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> recoup the marketing costs. Mojo nevertheless persisted, and to the band's surprise, [...] "Zoot Suit Riot" [...] soon found regular rotation on stations such as Los Angeles' influential KROQ-FM, helping establish swing music in the mainstream and leading to its eventual commercial breakthrough, with the Daddies at the forefront. By mid-1998, the Daddies had {{emerged as one of}} the most successful bands of the swing revival: after climbing to number one on Billboards Top Heatseekers, Zoot Suit Riot became the first album of the swing revival to crack the Top 40 on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 17 and spending an ultimate total of 53 weeks on the charts. In June 1998, the album had sold 500,000 copies in the United States, going on to surpass sales of 1.4 million by August.|$|E
2500|$|As public {{employee}} salary and benefit obligations increase over time, {{particularly with regard}} to pensions and {{public employee}} retiree healthcare, the impacts on the local government budget become more significant and can even lead to bankruptcy. [...] Local politicians <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> reduce public services and/or raise taxes or other revenues such as fees and charges. [...] To the extent that taxes are raised, the tax proceeds will generally either directly or indirectly pay for public employee salary and benefit obligations.

2500|$|Large music {{productions}} {{often use}} a separate stage monitor mixing console which {{is dedicated to}} creating mixes for the performers' on-stage or in-ear monitors. [...] These consoles are typically placed {{at the side of}} the stage so that the operator can communicate with the performers on stage. In cases where performers have to play at a venue that does not have a monitor engineer near the stage, the monitor mixing is done by the FOH engineer from the FOH console, which is located amongst the audience or at the back of the hall. [...] This arrangement can be problematic because the performers <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> request changes to the monitor mixes with [...] "...hand signals and clever cryptic phrases" [...] which may be misunderstood. [...] The engineer also cannot hear the changes that he is applying to the monitors on stage, often resulting in a reduction of the quality of the onstage monitor mix.|$|E
2500|$|A massive {{source of}} profits for Hiram Walker was {{actually}} the Civil War in the United States. [...] The U.S dollar plummeted in this time, and Americans turned to smuggling in Canadian beverages. [...] It is reported that Hiram Walker and Company loaded jug after jug of whiskey onto American ferries, carrying them across the Detroit River, leading to Walker making massive profits. Jealous competitors constructed a story of Walker creating a lead pipe that led right from the distillery, under the Detroit River, and into Detroit. By 1863, Walker had named James Ellis in charge of his mill, William McManus as his distiller, and John McBride in charge of managing. [...] While majority of his business did {{take place on the}} Canadian side of the border, he did prefer to live in Detroit. [...] In 1863, he bought a home within Detroit. [...] Walker also attempted to construct and run a vinegar factory in 1864, but was unsuccessful and closed down two years later due to his other commitments. Up until 1865, Walker’s distillery was the only one to exist in Essex County, however, Walker found himself with competition with Rolph and Melchers. In this time, Walker’s partner McBride was anxious to move up the chain within the company. [...] Two years later, John McBride and two of his friends, bought Rolph and Melchers. After discovering what McBride had done, his employment was terminated, therefore, Walker lost his business partner. [...] Ironically, McBride and his partners would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> sell their property because they were going out of business and would be operated by Hiram Walker as a second plant until 1876. [...] John McBride would go on to become a tax collector and grocery store owner in Detroit.|$|E
