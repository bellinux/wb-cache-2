5|$|Australia Acts commencement, 3 March – The {{anniversary of}} the Australia Acts coming into force has been raised as an option, having been {{referred}} to as Australian Independence Day. These Acts removed the United Kingdom's ability to legislate for the Australian States, the Queen's ability to <b>disallow</b> or suspend State legislation, as well as severing the remaining appeal channels from the State Supreme Courts and the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth II signed a proclamation at Government House in Canberra on 2 March 1986 for the Acts to take effect 5.00am Greenwich Mean Time the next day.|$|E
5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona in the fifteenth century AD who referred to it as the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they <b>disallow</b> that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the ratio}} of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a {{television}} station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which <b>disallow</b> duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require {{that there must be}} eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).|$|E

40|$|In peptide {{and protein}} structures, {{occurrence}} of (phi,psi.) angles in the <b>disallowed</b> {{region of the}} Ramachandran map almost always suggests local regions of error or poor accuracy. However, very rarely genuine <b>disallowed</b> conformations occur {{as noted in the}} current study in proteins of known structure available at ultra-high resolution (<= 1. 2 (A) over circle). In the current work, extent of conservation of genuine <b>disallowed</b> conformations in homologous proteins of known structures has been analyzed. From a dataset of 124 protein domain families, with structure of at least one constituent member in each family available at a resolution of 1. 2 (A) over circle or better, we have analyzed the conservation of 221 <b>disallowed</b> conformations. It is observed that the <b>disallowed</b> conformation is only moderately conservedin protein domain families. In the gross dataset no particular residue type adopting <b>disallowed</b> conformation elicit high conservation of residue type though there are alignment positions in the dataset with complete conservation of both the residue type and the <b>disallowed</b> conformation. Conserved <b>disallowed</b> conformation in protein domain families play biologically significant role in roughly 50 % of the cases. The residues with the <b>disallowed</b> conformation or its flanking residues are often located within or around the functional site of the protein. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. The Air Force was mainly {{concerned that they}} could not reach the easternmost parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This allowed for several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were a radar had been built. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus towards NATO's northern flank, and also to serve as part of the nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by then Norwegian authorities were wanting to delay its construction. They cited lack of personnel to man the station as well as a lack of usability in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to <b>disallow</b> nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The air station was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War, Norway {{enforced}} {{a policy}} to <b>disallow</b> allied aircraft to operate further north than Bardufoss and Andøya, {{in an effort to}} minimize tension with the Soviet Union. Specifically, allied aircraft were not permitted to operate east of the 24th meridian east, which was just west of Banak, thus hindering use of the airfield. This was motivated in part to not unnecessarily provoke the Soviet Union, with which Norway shared a land border, and in part because increased allied military presence could decrease the popular support for NATO membership. The restrictions were strengthened following the 1960 U-2 incident, in which a US spy aircraft en route to Bodø was shot down over Soviet territory. During the mid-1960s, NATO unsuccessfully attempted to convince Norwegian authorities to move the allied operational border from the 24th to the 27th meridian east.|$|E
5|$|The Giants went 8–4–1 in 1926, and {{withstood}} {{a challenge}} from an upstart American football league {{led by a}} team featuring Grange. Grange and his agent had formed the American Football League and placed their flagship team, the Yankees, in New York. According to a story by The New York Times published at the time, the Giants lost over $50,000 during the season. Grange's league lasted one season however, and was subsumed into the NFL. The Giants were so desperate to make money they allowed star Duluth Eskimos running back Ernie Nevers back into a close game after he was injured, even though by the rules they {{had the right to}} <b>disallow</b> his re-entrance, to please fans who had come to see him. The Yankees were subsumed into the NFL the next year and played most of their games on the road to avoid direct competition with the Giants. They folded in 1928, one year after Grange went back to playing for the Bears. The Giants paid a total of $21,000 in player salary in 1926, including paying all player expenses during the season, and player salaries ranged from $1,500 to $3,000. According to March, the attendance for the season was nearly equal to the 274,500 the team reported in their inaugural season. However, home attendance for games at the Polo Grounds dropped from 25,000 to 15,000 a game. The team's attendance on the road was significantly higher in their early history—the team averaged 57,000 in their three road games in 1925.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{data set}} of 454 crystal {{structures}} of peptides and 80 crystal structures of non-homologous proteins solved at ultra high resolution of 1. 2 Å or better we have analyzed {{the occurrence of}} <b>disallowed</b> Ramachandran (Φ, Ψ) angles. Out of 1492 and 13508 non-glycyl residues in peptides and proteins respectively 12 and 76 residues in the two datasets adopt clearly <b>disallowed</b> combinations of Ramachandran angles. These examples include a number of conformational points which are far away {{from any of the}} allowed regions in the Ramachandran map. According to the Ramachandran map a given (Φ, Ψ) combination is considered <b>disallowed</b> when two non-bonded atoms in a system of two-linked peptide units with ideal geometry are prohibitively proximal in space. However, analysis of the <b>disallowed</b> conformations in peptide and protein structures reveals that none of the observations of <b>disallowed</b> conformations in the crystal structures correspond to a short contact between non-bonded atoms. A further analysis of deviations of bond lengths and angles, from the ideal peptide geometry, at the residue positions of <b>disallowed</b> conformations in the crystal structures suggest that individual bond lengths and angles are all within acceptable limits. Thus, it appears that the rare tolerance of <b>disallowed</b> conformations is possible by gentle and acceptable deviations in a number of bond lengths and angles, from ideal geometry, over a series of bonds resulting in a net gross effect of acceptable non-bonded inter-atomic distances...|$|R

5|$|The new England manager Glenn Hoddle {{appointed}} Shearer captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996, and {{the player}} held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and {{twice in the}} following game against Poland. He scored a total of fivegoals in England's successful qualification campaign for the World Cup; adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally. Shearer was sidelined {{for much of the}} 1997–98 season, but recovered to play in the World Cup finals. With Michael Owen replacing Teddy Sheringham as Shearer's strike partner, Shearer's return saw him score England's first goal of the tournament, in a 2–0 win over Tunisia, his only goal in the three group matches. England faced long-time rivals Argentina in the second round. Shearer scored a first-half equaliser from the penalty-spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half. In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in what could have been the winning goal only for the referee to <b>disallow</b> it due to Shearer having elbowed goalkeeper Carlos Roa. The scores tied 2–2, the game went to penalties. Shearer scored again, but England were eliminated after David Batty's shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper. This defeat ended England's participation in what was to be Shearer's only World Cup tournament.|$|E
