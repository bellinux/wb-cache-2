The Government stated that the GRC scheme was primarily <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> enshrine minority representation in Parliament: {{at least one of the}} MPs in a GRC must be a member of the Malay, Indian or another minority community of Singapore. In addition, it was economical for town councils, which manage public housing estates, to handle larger constituencies.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{ability of}} tillage <b>implements</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} surface residue coverage is largely {{dependent on the}} implement’s main active component. Two categories of tillage <b>implements</b> were compared <b>to</b> determine their ability to maintain grain sorghum (non–fragile) surface residue coverage when operating at two different tillage depths for fall and spring tillage. Chisel–type <b>implements</b> were found <b>to</b> bury substantially less crop residue than disk–type implements. Disk–type <b>implements</b> were found <b>to</b> bury increased amounts of crop residue when operating at deeper tillage depths. Fall and spring tillage were also found to leave equivalent amounts of percent residue cover and total mass of crop residue remaining on the soil surface. A more thorough understanding of the ability of tillage <b>implements</b> <b>to</b> maintain adequate amounts of surface residue coverage should enable producers <b>to</b> select appropriate <b>implements</b> <b>to</b> maximize production while minimizing erosion...|$|R

5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Bisley and Henley {{had both}} been {{previously}} used as venues during the 1908 Games. Bisley hosted {{most of the}} shooting events while Henley hosted the rowing competition. Henley continues to host the Royal Regatta, which started in 1839, and remains in use as of 2010 for global competition, including the Diamond Sculls event. The Harringay Arena was built in 1928 and staged sporting events until its demolition in 1958. Built in 1891, the Herne Hill Velodrome hosted track cycling. After falling into disrepair by 2011, a modernization plan was <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> make extensive structural repairs to the site and install a new track surface {{so that it could}} used by British Cycling, the national sport governing body.|$|E

The physical structures that serve millions of individual passengers and flights are among the most complex and interconnected in the world.

The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning {{and the amount of}} fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E

Also on 1 April, Plan Alamo was <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> utilize {{and defend the}} DAO compound and its annex as an evacuee holding area, intended to care for 1,500 evacuees for five days. By 16 April, Alamo was complete: water, C-rations, petroleum, oil and lubricants had been stockpiled, backup electricity generators had been installed, sanitary facilities were completed, and concertina wire protected the perimeter.|$|E

Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engines and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since the hazards of asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> improve passenger conditions.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} power-related {{incident}} than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services {{on both the}} North South and East West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into {{the cause of the}} disruption. The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.|$|E
5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character design {{on the video}} game , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on the stereotypical characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, they developed {{a wide range of}} animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; they removed any animation that did not promote this fluidity or took a large amount of time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was <b>implemented</b> <b>to</b> make Drake a more relatable character.|$|E
