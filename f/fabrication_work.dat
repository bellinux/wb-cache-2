25|$|According to Admiral Robin Dhowan, about 83% of the <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> and 75% of the {{construction}} work had been completed {{at the time of}} launching. He said that 90% of the body work of the aircraft carrier had been designed and made in India, about 50% of the propulsion system, and about 30% of its weaponry. He also said that the ship would be equipped with a long range missile system with multi-function radar and a close-in weapon system (CIWS). After the launch, Vikrant was re-docked for the second phase of construction, in which the ship will be fitted with various weapons and sensors, and the propulsion system, flight deck and the aircraft complex will be integrated. In December 2014 it was reported that Vikrant will be commissioned by 2018.|$|E

50|$|He {{authored}} a 1905 {{report on}} night soil collection by pail, and disposal at sea, which {{was approved by}} the Municipal Commission only to be overturned in favour of a water borne sewage system. In this matter, Peirce showed himself to be conservative and not an early adopter of new technology. At that time a water borne sewage system had been operating for 20 years in Rangoon. The 'Pail' versus 'Sewer' debate is discussed by ''''Brenda Yeoh in Contesting Space in Colonial Singapore''''.However Peirce demonstrated his confidence in new materials and construction methods with his design and approach to the construction of the Anderson Bridge, Singapore's first steel bridge, in 1910. In this case, certain of the <b>fabrication</b> <b>works</b> was done locally, although the main steel structure was imported from Britain.
