40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} junction leakage in heavily doped p+/n <b>germanium</b> <b>junctions,</b> targeted for short-channel transistor fabrication. There exists an optimal p+/n junction condition, with a doping concentration of I X 10 (17) - 5 x 10 (17) cm(- 3), where the area-leakage-current density is minimal. Use of a halo-implant condition optimized for our 125 -nm gate-length pMOS devices shows less than one decade higher area leakage than the optimal p+/n junction. For even higher doping levels, the leakage density increases strongly. Therefore, careful optimization of p+/n junctions is needed for decananometer <b>germanium</b> transistors. The <b>junction</b> leakage shows good agreement with electrical simulations, although for some implant conditions, more adequate implant models are required. Finally, it is shown that the area-junction static-power consumption for the best junctions remains below the power-density specifications for high-performance applications. status: publishe...|$|R

THEORET•EçAL APPROAcH As we pointed out in 1, 2 muitiphotonic absorption takes place through a sequence of jumps by a photon in quariresonance with intermediate state placed within the energy gap. These intermediate states correspond to the known tayl of the density of states, which are found within the energy gap in highly doped semiconductors. The mechanism of the multiphotonic process may be described as follows. In the region N++ the photons are absorbed by free carriers in the conduction band leaving holes in states {{near the bottom of}} this band. The following step is the excite electrons in imurAty states inside the gap to the holes created in the prior step leaving the corresponding empty impurity states.

40|$|Layers of p-type {{germanium}} can {{be produced}} by bombardment of n-type specimens using acceptor ions. Several workers have reported on Rutherford scattering experiments {{as a method of}} investigating the interstitial/substitutional ratio of implanted ions. An investigation for a single-crystal n-type germanium bombarded with B+, Ga+ and In+ ions in a non-channelled direction by means of the determination of the electrical profile is described. For ion-implanted layers sheet resistivity measurements are not suitable for determining the number of active carriers obtained for the implant because neither the depth distribution of carriers nor the influence of lattice disorder on mobility is known. Accordingly, the investigation utilises the Van-der-Pauw method for the measurement of resistivity together with Hall effect measurements combined with an anodic-oxidation layer-removal technique to establish the variation with mobility and carrier concentration/cm 3 with depth and hence enables the determination of total active carriers/cm 2. As part of the investigation the influence of various parameters, such as implantation energy, total dose and subsequent annealing are described together with investigations into the problems of satisfactory ohmic contacts to p-type <b>germanium</b> and <b>junction</b> isolation at the temperature of liquid nitrogen.
