50|$|The fishing {{industry}} in Denmark is a {{main source of}} income to households. While fishing is a practice noted from the Medieval times, particularly in the coastal area of Denmark for eel fishing with woven traps, the earliest innovation in fisheries wasn't recorded until 1849 when the <b>Danish</b> <b>seine</b> or <b>anchor</b> <b>seine</b> technique of fishing was introduced resulting in unprecedented quantities of fish catch from the Limfjord.|$|R
50|$|A Danish seine, also {{occasionally}} {{called an}} <b>anchor</b> <b>seine,</b> {{consists of a}} conical net with two long wings with a bag where the fish collect. Drag lines extend from the wings, and are long so they can surround an area.|$|R
5000|$|... 20 July 1944: Royal Navy {{destroyer}} HMS Isis was mined at <b>anchor</b> in <b>Seine</b> Bay. A German Human Torpedo {{was believed}} responsible.|$|R
5000|$|Danish Pavilion: {{designed}} by Tyge Hvass, {{this was a}} dihedron of reddish wood with a gabled roof, evoking a typical Danish mountain house. The façade showed an embossed <b>Danish</b> flag, <b>anchor,</b> wheat sheaf and cog wheel, typical elements of the Danish economy.|$|R
50|$|At about 9:30 pm, Dictator {{unleashed}} a 15-minute barrage against Najaden that amounted to four tons of ordnance. The barrage broke her main mast almost immediately and caused a {{fire on the}} ship and the <b>Danish</b> brigs <b>anchored</b> nearby. Within 45 minutes, Najaden had sunk, having suffered 133 dead and 82 wounded. Captain Holm survived, only to drown in an accident a few months later.|$|R
50|$|The French {{expedition}} started disastrously, {{the flagship}} Carraquon perishing on 6July in an accidental fire whilst at <b>anchor</b> in the <b>Seine.</b> Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his flag to La Maistresse, which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed {{troops on the}} Isle of Wight.|$|R
50|$|The Observatory of Athens {{foundation}} {{ceremony in}} June 26, 1842, {{the day of}} a Solar Eclipse, is a magnificent official event. Present were the King of Greece Otto, members of the Government and of the Greek Church. A large crowd of people fills up {{the vicinity of the}} place selected for the Observatory, a location on the hill of Nymphs at Thiseio, facing the Acropolis. Following the panegyric speech by professor Bouris, the foundation stone is set under music sounds and cannonade by a <b>Danish</b> frigate <b>anchored</b> at the port of Piraeus.|$|R
50|$|The magazine’s first {{office was}} located {{in a small room}} of the {{publishing}} house Éditions de la Table ronde. Other notable locations of The Paris Review include a Thames River grain carrier <b>anchored</b> on the <b>Seine</b> from 1956 to 1957. The Café de Tournon in the Rue de Tournon on the Rive Gauche was the meeting place for staffers and writers, including du Bois, Plimpton, Matthiessen, Alexander Trocchi, Christopher Logue and Eugene Walter.|$|R
50|$|While at sea the French {{had some}} success at Boulogne but Nelson's Royal Navy {{destroyed}} an <b>anchored</b> <b>Danish</b> and Norwegian fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen (1801) because the Scandinavian kingdoms were against the British blockade of France. The Second Coalition was beaten and peace was settled in two distinct treaties: the Treaty of Lunéville and the Treaty of Amiens. A brief interlude of peace ensued in 1802-3, during which Napoleon sold French Louisiana to the United States because it was indefensible.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{attack was}} {{mounted on the}} night of July 7/8 and was carried out by twenty-one Neger vessels. The Negers were, however, spotted in the moonlit night and were {{attacked}} by aircraft and ships. The Germans managed to sink another minesweeper, [...] and severely damage the Polish cruiser , which later was scuttled. There is a detailed account of the attack on Dragon by Midshipman Potthast. On 20 July 1944, the Royal Navy destroyer [...] was mined while at <b>anchor</b> in the <b>Seine</b> Bay. The loss was not discovered until the following morning; there were twenty survivors and German human torpedoes were suspected of sinking the warship.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 December, Sceptre, Blonde, Thetis, Freya, Castor, Cygnet, , , and [...] {{proceeded}} to attack two French flûtes, Loire and <b>Seine</b> <b>anchored</b> in Anse à la Barque ("Barque Cove"), about nine {{miles to the}} northwest {{of the town of}} Basse-Terre. Blonde, Thetis and the three sloops bore the brunt of the attack but forced the French to abandon their ships and set fire to them. Captain Cameron, who was killed in the attempt, landed with the boats of Hazard and destroyed the shore batteries. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Anse la Barque 18 Decr. 1809", to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} day after they had {{anchored}} they perceived four black specks in the distance, and these the sailors soon declared to be Danish craft. They were rowing rapidly, having ten oars on either side, and at their mast-heads floated the <b>Danish</b> Raven. The <b>anchor</b> was got up, and as the Danes approached, the Golden Dragon, the standard of Wessex, was run up to the mast-head, the sails were hoisted, the oars got out, and the vessel advanced to meet the approaching Danes.|$|R
50|$|As the British navy again {{threatened}} in Danish waters in 1807, {{and the situation}} became fraught, Bille was named as commander of Danish naval defence under the overall command of General Ernst Peymann. Bille's gunboats did good service against the British naval units and against shore batteries, but Peyman performed poorly against the British army that had landed near Svannemølle and capitulation of Copenhagen became unavoidable. Preparations to sink or burn the <b>Danish</b> fleet at <b>anchor</b> were made, but the expected orders were never received.|$|R
40|$|Labour Politics in 1848. The ‘Parisian Craftsmen’ of Copenhagen 1848 saw {{the rise}} {{of one of the}} {{earliest}} Danish examples of a modern labour movement which was expressly based of the activities of the workers themselves. A small group of Copenhagen craftsmen - the ‘Parisian craftsmen’ - were behind this political movement. Their activities during this year demonstrates the  creation of a critical counter-public opinion and the desire for an  alternative social order which at once was foreign to previous <b>Danish</b> experiences and <b>anchored</b> in already prevalent ideals. </p...|$|R
50|$|During {{the reign}} of Ethelred the Unready, the <b>Danish</b> fleet <b>anchored</b> in the River Thames off Greenwich for over three years, with the army being encamped on the hill above. From here they {{attacked}} Kent and, in the year 1012, took the city of Canterbury, making Archbishop Alphege their prisoner for seven months in their camp at Greenwich, at that time within the county of Kent. They stoned him to death for his refusal to allow his ransom (3,000 pieces of silver) to be paid; and kept his body, until the blossoming of a stick that had been immersed in his blood. For this miracle his body was released to his followers, he achieved sainthood for his martyrdom and, in the 12th century, the parish church was dedicated to him. The present church on the site west of the town centre is St Alfege's Church, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1714 and completed in 1718. Some vestiges of the Danish camps may be traced {{in the names of}} Eastcombe and Westcombe, on the borders of nearby Blackheath.|$|R
2500|$|The Battle of Copenhagen 1801 (...) was {{the first}} of two battles which saw the British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker and Horatio Nelson, a vice admiral in 1801, fight a huge <b>Danish</b> fleet <b>anchored</b> just off Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The Danish fleet at the inlet of the Copenhagen harbour formed a {{blockade}} preventing the British fleet from entering the harbour. The Danish mainly used older ships not meant to sail in the sea as blockades. Denmark defended the capital with these ships and bastions on both side of the harbour inlet, Kastellet, Trekroner, Lynetten (which all still exists) as well as Quintus, Sixtus and Strickers. It was the second attempt by the British to scare Denmark, as the British had already entered Øresund with a navy in August 1800, in order to force Denmark to sign an alliance with Britain. Now Britain would have Denmark's entire navy and merchant fleet, so it would not {{fall into the hands of}} the French. The British were not aware that the modern Royal Danish Navy and many merchant ships were well hidden in the Roskilde fjord, a bluff which was never called by the British.|$|R
50|$|The {{fortified}} town of Malmö was {{the only}} Swedish stronghold that had not fallen {{into the hands of}} the Danes and during 1676 and 1677 it was used as a base for Swedish operations in the southwest corner of Skåne. To win the war king Christian V therefore had to capture Malmö. The siege began on June 10, when the <b>Danish</b> navy <b>anchored</b> in the roadstead north of the town and the Danish army camped on the plain south of the town. Danish engineers soon begun digging trenches leading up to the castle in the west and to the eastern and southern gates in the town wall. On the 12 the Danes brought in 28 siege guns and 27 mortars that started bombarding the castle and the town walls. The Swedish administration was not sure about the loyalty of the civilian citizens as they had only been under Swedish rule since 1658. But reports from Kristianstad about how the Danish king Christian V had allowed his soldiers three hours of plunder after the capture of the town in August 1676 ensured the citizens that their best option was to support the Swedes.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Danish</b> fleet weighed <b>anchor</b> {{and sailed}} {{through the fog}} toward the Pomeranians. Bugislaw's fleet saw nothing of the Danes until they were close enough to hear their war cries. Fear swept through the Pomeranians, {{and they tried to}} row away, but they were in such close {{quarters}} that the ships couldn't turn. The men panicked and began jumping from ship to ship which caused eight of them to flounder. The Danes threw themselves onto the ships to plunder them when Absalon shouted that they should leave the goods and go after the ships. Few complied and with just seven ships, Absalon routed the entire Pomeranian fleet, capturing 35 enemy ships. Absalon sent Bugislaw's own great tent to Canute, who was still in Jutland. With Bugislaw's defeat the emperor gave up, for a time, his attempt to rule Denmark.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the railroad, the Seine was still the main artery for the {{delivery}} of goods to Paris; huge rafts of firewood arrived daily for heating and cooking; [...] barges of wine, grain, stone and other products were unloaded at the ports along the river. [...] It also was a place where Parisians bathed. [...] Only the wealthiest Parisians had bathtubs at home. [...] There were numerous public baths, but they had a generally scandalous reputation. [...] With {{the arrival of}} fresh water from the Ourq canal, steam baths became popular; there were sixty-seven in Paris in 1832. But for ordinary Parisians in the 19th century, the most popular bathing places were the floating baths <b>anchored</b> along the <b>Seine</b> between the Pont d'Austerlitz and the Pont d'Iéna. They were composed of a large barge with a basin in the center surrounded by wooden galleries with dressing rooms. There were separate baths for men and women. The price was four sous, or twenty centimes, and bathing costumes could be rented for an additional charge.

2500|$|After a year ashore, Hardy went to Plymouth Dock in December 1800 to take {{command of}} the first-rate , which had just been refitted. He {{transferred}} to the second-rate [...] and became Nelson's flag captain once more in February 1801. Nelson was appointed second in {{command of the}} Baltic fleet, which had been sent to force the Danes to withdraw from the League of Armed Neutrality. On the night of 1 April 1801, Hardy was sent in a boat to take soundings around the <b>anchored</b> <b>Danish</b> fleet. Hardy's ship drew too much water and so took no part in the Battle of Copenhagen the following day. Hardy's work proved to be of great value. The only two ships that went aground, the third-rates [...] and , were taken in by local pilots and did not follow Hardy's recommended route. Hardy stayed on as flag captain to the new fleet commander, Vice-Admiral Charles Pole, until August 1801 when he took command of the fourth-rate HMS Isis.|$|R
2500|$|Lawford took {{command of}} the 64-gun [...] in August 1800, and went out with the fleet sent out under Sir Hyde Parker to compel the Danes to abandon the League of Armed Neutrality. Polyphemus was part of Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's {{squadron}} sent in to attack the <b>Danish</b> fleet at <b>anchor</b> at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. Polyphemus {{was not part of}} Nelson's original plan, but he had to improvise when [...] ran aground on shoals {{at the entrance to the}} harbour, and could not free herself. Polyphemus was signalled to take her place, and she anchored at the south of the line, opposite the Provestenen and engaged for the rest of the battle. She eventually sustained casualties of six killed and twenty-five wounded. Polyphemus returned to Britain and was paid off into ordinary in April 1802, and after being refitted at Chatham Dockyard between March and September 1804, was recommissioned under Lawford. Lawford served with the Channel Fleet and on 7 December 1804 engaged the Spanish 36-gun Santa Gertruyda off Cape St Mary. The Santa Gertruyda was captured, and found to be shipping 1,125,000 dollars of specie from Peru and Mexico to Spain.|$|R
5|$|Lhermitte {{approached}} the anchored ships at 18:00, flying false <b>Danish</b> colours, and <b>anchored</b> nearby. A ship's boat from Camel {{approached the}} new arrival, rapidly realising that Preneuse was a hostile frigate {{and returning to}} their ship. Lieutenant William Fothergill, the most senior officer with the convoy, fired warning shots close to the frigate, which Lhermitte ignored. Both British ships then prepared for action. At 20:30, Preneuse began to approach Rattlesnake and Fothergill opened fire immediately, joined by Camel. Lhermitte returned fire, focusing its broadside on Camel. By midnight Camel had taken several shot in the hull causing widespread flooding, and the crew ceased firing to man the pumps. Lhermitte apparently believed that Camel had abandoned the fight and he switched fire towards Rattlesnake, the engagement continuing until 03:30 at which point Lhermitte slipped his anchor and pulled out of range. Remaining in the bay until 10:00 before standing out to sea. British losses were two killed and twelve wounded, both Camel and Rattlesnake badly damaged. It was later reported in French sources that Lhermitte believed the schooner Surprise to be a well armed naval brig, prompting his withdrawal. Preneuses loss in the action was around 40 killed and wounded, and the frigate {{was reported to be}} badly damaged; messages to this effect were hastily sent to the commander at the Cape, Captain George Losack who sent the 50-gun HMS Jupiter in pursuit.|$|R
60|$|Cut {{off from}} Sweden and the world, the Republic {{must learn to}} make steel for itself; and, by aid of Chemists, she has learnt it. Towns that knew only iron, now know steel: from their new dungeons at Chantilly, Aristocrats may hear the rustle of our new steel furnace there. Do not bells transmute {{themselves}} into cannon; iron stancheons into the white-weapon (arme blanche), by sword-cutlery? The wheels of Langres scream, amid their sputtering fire halo; grinding mere swords. The stithies of Charleville ring with gun-making. What say we, Charleville? Two hundred and fifty-eight Forges stand in the open spaces of Paris itself; a hundred and forty {{of them in the}} Esplanade of the Invalides, fifty-four in the Luxembourg Garden: so many Forges stand; grim Smiths beating and forging at lock and barrel there. The Clockmakers have come, requisitioned, to do the touch-holes, the hard-solder and filework. Five great Barges swing at <b>anchor</b> on the <b>Seine</b> Stream, loud with boring; the great press-drills grating harsh thunder to the general ear and heart. And deft Stock-makers do gouge and rasp; and all men bestir themselves, according to their cunning:--in the language of hope, it is reckoned that a 'thousand finished muskets can be delivered daily.' (Choix des Rapports, xiii. 189.) Chemists of the Republic have taught us miracles of swift tanning; (Ibid. xv. 360.) the cordwainer bores and stitches;--not of 'wood and pasteboard,' or he shall answer it to Tinville! The women sew tents and coats, the children scrape surgeon's-lint, the old men sit in the market-places; able men are on march; all men in requisition: from Town to Town flutters, on the Heaven's winds, this Banner, THE FRENCH PEOPLE RISEN AGAINST TYRANTS.|$|R

Another Seine institution was the bateau-lavoir, or floating laundry, where lavandrieres, or laundry women, came to wash clothing and bed linen. They were mostly located on the right bank, where they profited from the sunshine for drying the laundry. By the Restoration, they were very large, and generally had two levels the lower deck had benches or tables close to the water, where the washing was done, and then clothes were taken to the upper deck to dry in the sun. The lavandrieres paid a charge to the owner of the barge for each visit. The last bateau-lavoir closed in 1937.|$|R
5000|$|Lawford and Romney became {{involved}} in an incident with a convoy of Swedish merchants sailing from the Mediterranean with cargoes of pitch, hemp, iron, deals and tar. Lawford intercepted the convoy in the English Channel on 30 June, suspecting that the supplies were bound for French forces. The convoy resisted, but Lawford brought them to after a short action and took them to a British port. There most of the ships were condemned, though some were allowed to sail to Portugal. The question {{of the right of}} belligerent powers to stop and search neutral merchants on the high seas was firmly upheld by Britain, though incidents such as this strained relations with the northern Kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark and Russia, and was a contributing factor to the formation of the League of Armed Neutrality two years later.
