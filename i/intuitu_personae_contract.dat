Although the interests {{of each of the}} categories of persons affected are protected by national and European norms, employees enjoy a particular attention. In European law, Directive 2001 / 23 /EC regulates the safeguarding of employees ’ right in the case of transfer of undertakings, businesses, and parts of undertakings or businesses. Communitarian dispositions have been transposed in Romanian law by articles 173 - 174 of Law 53 / 2003 - The Labour Code and Law 67 / 2006 regarding the protection of employees’ rights in the event of transfer of undertakings, businesses, or parts of them, which transpose the Communitarian norms in the subject matter. The labour contract is an <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae</b> <b>contract,</b> the relationship between employee and employer being one of subordination. Thus, {{there are at least two}} rationales that justify the lawmaker’s preoccupation for the implications of restructuring operations over employees. Employee protection in case of transfer by merger entails, in substance, the safeguarding of their rights and obligations within the framework of the ceded entity, as they had been set by the labour contract of the cedent entity. The current study critically analyses the national law concerning the transfer of labour contracts in the context of transfer by merger. The paper also contains a number of de lege ferenda proposals, which can contribute to the improving of the existing juridical framework...|$|E

This seems to go against the egalitarian and transparency principles of the European Union for attribution of markets. We show how ??libre administration?? and ?<b>intuitu</b> <b>personae?</b> principles can lead a mayor, who has electoral concerns, to favor a unique manager even though this choice can in fact be inefficient. We also consider the natural limits to this behavior. Classification JEL : D 44, D 72, L 41, L 90. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} market {{rationality}} leads to new fertilizations between economic markets and spiritual markets. The paper adresses the legal challenges {{due to a}} deeper renewal of a pluralism of economic legitimacies linked to reference points such as business “ethics,” “culture,” and “participative management. ” What difference should we see between {{the appearance of a}} fast-food restaurant, Quick’s, that prepares meat in accordance with Islamic law and the secular business culture of Coca-Cola? To what extent can an employer decide and state its own “ethics” or “culture,” which for the employer might be of the order of a principle and not of an exceptional adaptation? This normative business perspective does not imply extreme communitarianism nor extreme <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae.</b> Is it possible to address these issues not as arbitrary claims, but as objective reference to a particular ethical project. This claims are often geared toward benefiting minorities, but not only, as shown by the "spiritual" trend in management"...|$|R
40|$|Forgery by its nature, always harms {{the trust}} {{that people are}} forced to have and need to grant {{one another in the}} {{relations}} among themselves or which they should show for the things usually considered as the expression and evidence of truth. While for the offenses committed by violation of trust, this is the rule applied <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae,</b> taking into account the personal condition of the person to whom trust is granted, in forgery crimes trust is given in rem, meaning to the thing per se perceived as being the expression of truth. Thus, we are not in front of a violation of trust given to certain people, but in front of the trust granted to the thing which is assumed legally the characteristic of expressing the truth, but truth which has been altered. This paper aims to be an interdisciplinary approach, starting from the criminological meaning rendered to public trust and up to its legal effects produced, set into criminal or extra-criminal content, an approach derived from applying the method of observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{administrator}} can be {{delegated to}} represent the company in its relations with third parties. The administrator’s powers are manifested on two levels: internally and externally. Thus, the manager is responsible {{with regard to the}} internal management of the company but also to the representation of the company in dealings with third parties. Basically the mandate is granted to the administrator <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae,</b> which excludes the possibility to be substituted for the exercise of the powers conferred. The powers of the manager are not unlimited, being held primarily by the object of the activity, by the hierarchy of organization of the company, by the social interest, by the decisions of the ordinary general assembly, the decisions of the Board or even by the constitutive document. Within the limits of its mandate, the administrator may enter intoconcluding management, conservation and disposal legal documents, required by the activity of the company. For all companies, the legal documents that the administrator concludes in his position of companyrepresentative in his dealings with third parties employ the company...|$|R
40|$|According to the Romanian law {{the debtor}} that faces {{financial}} difficulties {{of a certain}} extent can be {{the object of the}} insolvency procedure, regulated by Law no. 85 / 2006 concerning the insolvency procedure. Because the insolvent debtor is no longer trustworthy to its contractual partners and cannot execute the assumed obligations, there is a risk that these contracts cease, or the services that are incumbent on contractual parties are not executed. This is why, {{it is very important to}} know within the insolvency procedure and, especially during the judicial reorganization period, what will be the treatment of contracts concluded prior to the opening of this procedure and still not executed, the so-called “contracts under execution”. Also, after clarifying the concept of contract under execution, it is important to establish who has the right to opt between their continuation, or their cancellation. On the other hand, there are presented the special rules provided by Law no. 85 / 2006 for some categories of contracts concluded prior to the opening of the insolvency procedure, such as: labor, lease, commission contracts, master of netting agreement or <b>contracts</b> concluded <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae</b> or by a debtor that is the owner of a leased building, etc...|$|R
40|$|Starting from {{a case of}} the {{jurisprudence}} of the Cluj Court of Appeal, {{this study}} probes into the different aspects of the contract of lease for lands pertaining to the State’s private domain (that is, under the Local Council’s management) through which the lessees, in consideration of certain special criteria, procure the right to employ the land for a fixed term of 99 years, in order to build individual housing units. The fundamental issue {{that needs to be addressed}} is whether the lesser can one-sidedly increase the rent due to the fact that a third party buyer, to whom the initial lessee sold the building, failed to comply with the special conditions that led to the initial abatement of rent. It is reasonable to assume that such a decision would be illegal taking into account that the lease contract has a civil nature and not an administrative one (as a result the lesser cannot unilaterally alter the contract) and, on the other hand, the fact that this type of contract does not retain its <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae</b> nature throughout its period of enforcement (considering the provisions under art. 41 of Law no. 50 / 1991 on construction permits), even though that attribute was essential at the moment when the contract was concluded. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sometimes {{a person}} may enter into a {{contract}} {{as a result of a}} statement made to him which is false. If the statement is a term of the contract he will have a remedy for breach of contract. If the statement is not a term of the contract it is called a mere misrepresentation, and the consequence is rescission of contract. A misrepresentation is an untrue statement of fact which is one of the causes which induces the contract. A misrepresentation is statement, or conduct, which conveys a false or wrong impression. A contract may be rescined on the ground of misrepresentation even if innocent. An innocent misrepresentation is one made with reasonable ground for believing it to be true, as where an honest mistake is made. The types of misrepresentation are various. Acording to the Obligation Act it is not any misrepresentation cause the rescind of contract, but only the importance one. The importance misrepresentations are: the error in supstantia and error in <b>personae</b> if the <b>contract</b> is made bearing in mind intuit <b>personae</b> <b>contract.</b> This paper explanes different kinds of misrepresentation giving some proposal for legal interpretation of the provisions of the Obligation Act. The misrepresentation means an untrue statement of facts, made by one party to the other in the course of negotiating a contract, that induces the other party to enter into the contract. The person making the misrepresentation is called the representor, and the person whom it is made is the representee. A false of fraudulent misrepresentation is one made with knowledge of its falsehood, and intended to deceive. In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation representor did not honestly believe in the truth of his statement, which is not the same as saying that he knew it to be false. A negligent misrepresentation is one made with no reasonable grounds for believing in to be true. An innocent misrepresentation is one made with reasonable grounds for believing in to the true, as where an honest mistake is made. A fraudulent misrepresentation is actionable as a tort. When a person has been induced to {{enter into a contract}} by misrepresentation, he may in general either (1) affirm the contract and insist of the misrepresentation being made good, if that is possible, or (2) rescind the contract if it is still executory, and if all parties can be restored to their original positions, or (3) bring an action for damages, or (4) rely upon the misrepresentation as a defense to an action on the contract. A contract may be rescinded of the ground of misrepresentation even if innocent. Specific performance will not be decreed if a definite untrue representation has been relied on. It is clear that the claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation is a claim in tort. So the general governing rule is that the plaintiff should be restored to the position he would have been in if the representation had not been made. In the article is also analyzed comparative law related on misrepresentaton...|$|R
