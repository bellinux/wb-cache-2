40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{calibrate}} bullock drawn Multi Purpose Tool Seed cum Fertilizer Drill and evaluate field performance of MPT Seed cum Fertilizer Drill. An experiment was conducted in 0. 05 ha to evaluate field performance of MPT Seed cum Fertilizer Drill at FAE, IGKV Raipur (C. G.). During calibration of Seed cum Fertilizer Drill seed rate was observed in different hopper capacities and exposure length of <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> and found 76. 8 kg/ha at 10 mm <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> exposure length. Field performance was evaluated by field capacity, field efficiency, Draft, yield and Power requirement to operate Seed cum Fertilizer Drill and found 0. 0853 ha/h, 73. 9 %, 53. 7 kgf, 44. 3 q/ha and 0. 4 hp respectively. A comparative analysis was composed to determine energy input and output ratio of MPT Seed cum Fertilizer Drill and Conventional Seed cum Fertilizer Drill...|$|E

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} the mass of grain seeds, which flow {{in the shape of}} clumps, was suggested in this paper. The methodology used an off-the-shelf digital fibre sensor to detect the behaviour of the clumps and multiple linear regression modelling {{to estimate the}} mass by the parameters detected by the sensor which were the length and the density of the clumps. An indoor apparatus was used for modelling which resembled the sowing process using the grain drill. A <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> was installed in the apparatus to regulate the flow of seeds. It was rotated by a motor at 2, 4 and 6 rpm to cover all the possible mass flow rates which might occur during actual sowing. Modelling was based on several assumptions, such as the linearity between the sensor parameters and the mass. Although errors were observed while estimating each clump independently, the methodology was able to estimate the mass of a continuous flow of seed clumps. The average difference in estimation at 4 rpm was 0. 9 %, while there was overestimation at 2 rpm and underestimation at 6 rpm resulting in an overall estimation error of 5. 3 %. These results showed that the digital fibre sensor could be used for estimating mass flow of seeds at variable sowing rates within the speed limits of the grain drill. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|The {{development}} of a galvanising process in the 1840s, the fabrication of rolled sections of wrought iron from about 1850, {{and the use of}} grooved or <b>fluted</b> <b>rollers</b> to improve the production of corrugated iron in 1844 enabled construction of this building. It demonstrates the innovative solutions provided by the use of imported prefabricated buildings to cope with housing shortages caused by the gold rushes in Australia and California in the early 1850s.|$|R
50|$|Arkwright {{applied for}} at least 5 patents {{relating}} to spinning. They related to a feeder, a filleted cylinder, a roving can, the crank and comb and roller spinning. These patents were taken out in 1775 but were challenged in the courts on four counts : That the patent was prejudicial to His Majesties subject, they were not a new invention, they were not invented by arkwright, {{and they were not}} sufficiently described. The July 1781 and February 1785 cases were based on intelligibility, not being sufficiently described but in June 1785 the argument of not being original was judged. Highs was a witness at the February 1785 trial, and in his evidence claimed he had made <b>fluted</b> <b>rollers.</b> No mention was made by him of the spinning jenny, but it was mentioned as a statement of fact in Arkwrights submission, that Hargreaves had invented it.|$|R

40|$|The {{cropping}} {{intensity of}} Bangladesh is increasing {{year after year}} because most small holders start growing three or more crops in a year. Over a 5 -year cycle due to changing profitability of crops, farmers cultivate 4 - 6 crops with diverse seed sizes, seed rate, row spacing, fertilizer rates, and seed depth. Hence a planter for such diverse cropping systems needs to have multi-functional capabilities. Service providers {{also need to be}} able to hire out their planter for business all year round to justify the investment cost. There are a number of other criteria and challenges that would need to be satisfied by potential purchasers of a planter. The VMP (Versatile Multi-crop Planter) is such a unique machine for two-wheel tractor which can meet the above criteria and successfully establish a diverse range of crops since 2008 (Haque et al., 2011). It has designed with capability for seeding and fertilizing with <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> or vertical plate meters in lines for single-pass shallow-tillage, strip planting, zero tillage and bed planting. The service providers remove seeding unit from VMP and convert only for high speed rotary tiller (HSRT). Most of the grain seeds like wheat, paddy, maize, jute, pulses, oilseeds etc. can be sown in line using VMP. It owners are using this device for their own land cultivation and earning cash income through custom hiring to other farmers and could improve their livelihood through this machine. Therefore, an attempt was made to assess the profitability of VMP operations at farm level and the impacts of its operations on service providers’ livelihood...|$|E
40|$|Smallholders in Asia and Africa require {{low-cost}} {{seed drill}}s for minimal soil disturbance while establishing various crops. A seed drill {{that can be}} drawn by the widely-available two-wheel tractor (2 WT) is an attractive option for mechanization of no-till in small-sized fields. The Versatile Strip Seed Drill (VSSD) was designed with the capacity to make up to 40 mm wide and 60 mm deep strips in untilled land along with seed and basal fertilizer application in a single-pass operation, while powered by the 8. 95 to 11. 93 kW 2 WT. An important innovation of the VSSD was to fit the seed box with both fluted roller-type seed meters for delivery of sufficient small-size seeds to achieve adequate plant density per unit row length; and vertical disk-type seed meters for precision and spaced row planting of larger seeds. Both incessant seed dropping by <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> seed meters and spaced planting by vertical disk type seed meters provided optimum plant populations that were generally higher than in conventional, full-tillage plots with the same rate of hand broadcasted seed and fertilizers. Time required for crop establishment by VSSD ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 18 ha·h− 1. When the VSSD {{was attached to the}} 2 WT for crop establishment, the diesel fuel consumption varied from 4. 4 to 6. 1 L·ha− 1, which was lower than for most 2 WT-based planters previously used in Bangladesh. In on-farm multi-locations trials, wheat crops established with the VSSD had statistically similar grain yield compared to conventional tillage; however, significantly higher grain yield was obtained from mustard and lentil, by 14 % and 19 %, respectively. The VSSD is a unique, minimum-soil-disturbance multi-crop planter, and can be a platform on which to build conservation agriculture systems for small farms in Asia and Africa...|$|E
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the <b>fluted</b> feed <b>rollers,</b> under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|R
