50|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} factors {{that must be}} determined with regards to righting arm/moment. These are known as the maximum righting arm/moment, the point of deck immersion, the <b>downflooding</b> <b>angle,</b> and the point of vanishing stability. The maximum righting moment is the maximum moment that {{could be applied to}} the vessel without causing it to capsize. The point of deck immersion is the angle at which the main deck will first encounter the sea. Similarly, the <b>downflooding</b> <b>angle</b> is the angle at which water will be able to flood deeper into the vessel. Finally, the point of vanishing stability is a point of unstable equilibrium. Any heel lesser than this angle will allow the vessel to right itself, while any heel greater than this angle will cause a negative righting moment (or heeling moment) and force the vessel to continue to roll over. When a vessel reaches a heel equal to its point of vanishing stability, any external force will cause the vessel to capsize.|$|E
