40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to verify, based on the {{portfolio}} balance exchange rate determination theory, the impact of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>swaps</b> offered by the Central Bank of Brazil on the attributes of the local foreign exchange interest rate term structure.

The results concerning the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>swaps</b> were in accordance with those expected by the theory, and show that they do change the local foreign exchange interest rate term structure. On the other hand, the swaps known as reversal <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>swaps</b> showed results that point out that the offer of this product by the Central Bank had no impact on the level of the local foreign exchange interest rate market.
