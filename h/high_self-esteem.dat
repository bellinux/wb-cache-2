5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
25|$|A {{person can}} have a <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and hold it {{confidently}} where {{they do not need}} reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the study: Main {{purposes}} of conducted {{studies were}} to assess adolescents self-esteem and to recognise the selfesteem role in the expression of anger. Material and method: The study involved 221 people (including 95 girls and  126 boys) aged 15 – 18 years. There {{have been applied}} a Polish adaptation of Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (CSEI) by Z. Juczyński and N. Ogińska-Bulik and Z. Juczyński Anger Expression Scale (SEG) and our own survey. Results: The analysis has revealed that adolescents, who had lower self-esteem in a scholastic me perspective, more often directed their anger inward, were able to control or repress it more efficiently. On the other hand, those with <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> in a scholastic me perspective and overall <b>higher</b> level of their <b>self-esteem</b> more often directed their anger outward, both in an indirect and a direct manner. Discussion: Although the <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> is usually associated with a socially acceptable behaviour, some study results indicate stronger tendency to take an aggressive behaviour among people with the <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Probably, this is due to the fact that people with the <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> seeing themselves as being worth of acceptance and respect, partially “exempt” themselves from their self-control. A satisfaction of their own behaviour might limit the readiness for self-correction of their reactions. Conclusions: Adolescents with <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> are more disposed to manifest their anger, and those with lower more frequently suppress this kind of emotions and control them more thoroughly. Overall self-esteem and one of its aspects – the scholastic me seem to be particularly important. Conviction of your own value and belief in your school success reduce the barrier to express the anger, as if they protect you from losing social attractiveness...|$|R
25|$|Peer-reviewed {{research}} undertaken {{since then}} has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem {{in and of itself}} has no positive effect on grades. Roy Baumeister has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades. The relationship involving self-esteem and academic results does not signify that <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> contributes to high academic results. It simply means that <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.|$|E
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>self-esteem</b> {{has a high}} {{correlation}} to self-reported happiness; {{whether this is a}} causal relationship has not been established. The relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction is stronger in individualistic cultures.|$|E
25|$|During school-aged years, {{academic}} achievement {{is a significant}} contributor to self-esteem development. A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong academic effect on their individual self-esteem. Social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem. As children go through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons {{play an important role}} in shaping the child's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves. As children go through adolescence, peer influence becomes much more important. Adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends. Successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> for children. Social acceptance brings about confidence and produces <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem.|$|E

The majority of participants were Asian (64. 8 %), female (59. 3 %), and graduate students (76. 9 %). Assimilative (adopting host cultural values) and integrative (blending both host and home cultural values) modes of acculturation, less frequency of contact with host culture members, and lower quality of contact predicted <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Less social support and lower English language confidence also predicted <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Also, <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> {{was positively related to}} greater perceived daily hassles (minor stressors faced by students). Furthermore, longer length of stay and greater assimilation and integration scores significantly predicted greater English language confidence.

25|$|Men {{and women}} who are 100 or older tend to have extroverted personalities, {{according}} to Thomas T. Perls, the director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston University.

25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> when engaged in {{supportive}} relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{the rise}} of {{phenomenology}} and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest in self-esteem. Self-esteem then took {{a central role in}} personal self-actualization and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of a person with <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.|$|E

25|$|Experiences in a person's {{life are}} {{a major source of}} how {{self-esteem}} develops. In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have. Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards for their child and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.|$|E
25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the causes}} of {{delusions}} continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the genetic or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder {{are at increased risk}} of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.|$|E

Data came from the Young Adults section of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which includes 8 assessments across a 14 -year period of a national probability sample of 7, 100 individuals age 14 to 30 years. Latent growth curve analyses indicated that self-esteem increases during adolescence and continues to increase more slowly in young adulthood. Women and men {{did not differ in}} their self-esteem trajectories. In adolescence, Hispanics had lower self-esteem than Blacks and Whites, but the self-esteem of Hispanics subsequently increased more strongly, so that at age 30 Blacks and Hispanics had <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> than Whites. At each age, emotionally stable, extraverted, and conscientious individuals experienced <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> than emotionally unstable, introverted, and less conscientious individuals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine child psychosocial {{adjustment}} (i. e., behavioural problems and self-esteem) as a function of maternal well-being, parenting competence, and maternal stress in a sample of children (8 to 16 years) with a chronic physical disorder (CPD) (n = 60) as compared to a sample of non-chronically disabled children (n = 60). While the groups did not differ on either maternal variables or child behavioural problems, CPD children had <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> than comparison group children. For both groups, mothers with high well-being, high competence, and low stress had children with fewer behavioural problems. Furthermore, mothers of older CPD children perceived themselves as more competent parents, which in turn was related to fewer behavioural problems and <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> in the child. Mothers who assessed their child's condition as less stressful also had a higher sense of well-being and/or perceived themselves as more competent mothers.

25|$|Critics {{have argued}} that self-verification {{processes}} are relatively rare, manifesting themselves only among people with terribly negative self views. In support of this viewpoint, critics cite hundreds of studies indicating that people prefer, seek and value positive evaluations more than negative ones. Such skeptical assessments overlook three important points. First, because most people have relatively positive self-views, evidence of a preference for positive evaluations in unselected samples may in reality reflect a preference for evaluations that are self-verifying, because for such individuals self-verification and positivity strivings are indistinguishable. No number of studies of participants with positive self-views can determine whether self-verification or self-enhancement strivings are more common. Second, self-verification strivings {{are not limited to}} people with globally negative self-views; even people with <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem</b> seek negative evaluations about their flaws. Finally, even people with positive self-views appear to be uncomfortable with overly positive evaluations. For example, people with moderately positive self-views withdraw from spouses who evaluate them in an exceptionally positive manner.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that no unique physiological response, {{such as an}} increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits. In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively {{as a threat to}} group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals. On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop <b>high</b> <b>self-esteem.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Hope theory operationalizes meaningfulness {{as having}} {{more to do}} with {{self-control}} that leads to <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> As one lives by societal standards of living, one exercises self-control and it is through this self-control that <b>higher</b> <b>self-esteem</b> is achieved.

He remained in royal favour and early in 1861 he was selected to accompany the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, to inspect Prussian cavalry manoeuvres.

500|$|The {{defining}} {{traits of}} being {{considered one of}} the Rhomaioi were being an Orthodox Christian and more importantly speaking Greek, characteristics which had to be acquired by birth if one was not to be considered an allogenes or even a barbarian. The term mostly used to describe someone who was a foreigner to both the Byzantines and their state was ethnikós (Greek: [...] ), a term which originally described non-Jews or non-Christians, but had lost its religious meaning. In a classicizing vein usually applied to other peoples, Byzantine authors regularly referred to their own people as [...] "Ausones", an ancient name for the inhabitants of Italy. Most historians agree that the defining features of their civilization were: 1) Greek language, culture, literature, and science, 2) Roman law and tradition, 3) Christian faith. The Byzantine Greeks were, and perceived themselves as, heirs to the culture of ancient Greece, the political heirs of imperial Rome, and followers of the Apostles. Thus, their sense of [...] "Romanity" [...] was different from that of their contemporaries in the West. [...] "Romaic" [...] {{was the name of the}} vulgar Greek language, as opposed to [...] "Hellenic" [...] which was its literary or doctrinal form.
