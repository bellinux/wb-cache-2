5000|$|However, New York {{residents}} were {{less willing to}} give blacks equal voting rights. By the constitution of 1777, voting was restricted to free men who could satisfy certain <b>property</b> <b>requirements</b> for value of real estate. This <b>property</b> <b>requirement</b> disfranchised poor men among both blacks and whites. The reformed Constitution of 1821 conditioned suffrage for black men by maintaining the <b>property</b> <b>requirement,</b> which most could not meet, so effectively disfranchised them. The same constitution eliminated the <b>property</b> <b>requirement</b> for white men and expanded their franchise. No women yet had the vote in New York. [...] "As late as 1869, {{a majority of the}} state's voters cast ballots in favor of retaining property qualifications that kept New York's polls closed to many blacks. African-American men did not obtain equal voting rights in New York until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870." ...|$|R

50|$|The First French Republic was {{the second}} nation that adopted {{universal}} male suffrage, doing so in 1792; {{it was one of}} the first national systems that abolished all <b>property</b> <b>requirements</b> as a prerequisite for allowing men to register and vote. Greece recognized full male suffrage in 1830. Spain recognized it in the Constitution of 1869 and France and Switzerland have continuously done so since the 1848 Revolution (for resident male citizens). Upon independence in the 19th century, several Latin American countries and Liberia in Africa initially extended suffrage to all adult males, but subsequently restricted it based on <b>property</b> <b>requirements.</b> The German Empire implemented full male suffrage in 1871. The United States adopted full male suffrage with the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1870, but this was rescinded in the South after 1890 with the reinstitution of <b>property</b> and literacy <b>requirements</b> until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|R
