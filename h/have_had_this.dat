5|$|Thomas Henry Huxley defends in {{an essay}} titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of {{consciousness}} according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies {{the work of a}} locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery”. To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> if it had been efficacious. Karl Popper develops in the book The Self and Its Brain a similar evolutionary argument.|$|E
25|$|To complicate matters, {{there were}} several ships with the name San Juan – at least nine of them. Another {{complication}} {{is that there are}} known to have been at least two men with the name Diego Enríquez in the fleet, though one can be distinguished by the name Tellez. In early accounts of the wreck, the captain was called Diego Manrique, although no officer of the fleet is known to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> name.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} found in an ancient Egyptian mummy from 1000 BC. The Norse king Ivar the Boneless may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> condition, as well. The earliest studies of it began in 1788 with the Swede Olof Jakob Ekman. He described the condition in his doctoral thesis and mentioned cases of it going back to 1678. In 1831, Edmund Axmann described it in himself and two brothers. Jean Lobstein dealt with it in adults in 1833. Willem Vrolik did work on the condition in the 1850s. The idea that the adult and newborn forms were the same came in 1897 with Martin Benno Schmidt.|$|E

25|$|In stage one, pre-industrial society, {{death rates}} and birth rates {{are high and}} roughly in balance. All human populations are {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> balance until the late 18th century, when this balance ended in Western Europe. In fact, growth rates were less than 0.05% {{at least since the}} Agricultural Revolution over 10,000 years ago. Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is constrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new technologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or achieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by death rates.|$|E

500|$|Peter Applebome, {{an editor}} of The New York Times, wrote in 2003 of his {{experience}} as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, [...] "I feel lucky to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> unexpected vehicle to share my son's youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well." [...] He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, [...] "Scouting's core values...are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life. Scouting's genuinely egalitarian goals and instincts are more important now than they've ever been. It's {{one of the only}} things that kids do that's genuinely cooperative, not competitive." ...|$|E

500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believe that}} the [...] "Feast of Unleavened Bread" [...] was an {{agricultural}} festival at which the Israelites celebrated {{the beginning of the}} grain harvest.

2500|$|Third culture kid (TCK) {{or third}} culture {{individual}} (TCI) are terms {{used to refer}} to children raised in a culture other than their parents' (or the culture of the country given on the child's passport, where they are legally considered native) for a significant part of their early development years. They are exposed to a greater variety of cultural influences. For adults who <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> experience as children, another term used is [...] adult third culture kid (ATCK).|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{gentrification}} of gay villages {{may also}} serve to reinforce stereotypes of gays, by pushing out gay {{people who do not}} conform to the prevailing [...] "gay, white, affluent, professional" [...] image. Such people (including gay people of color, low-income/working-class gays, and [...] "undesirable" [...] groups such as gay prostitutes and leathermen) are usually forced out of the [...] "village" [...] due to rising rents or constant harassment at the hands of an increased policing presence. Especially in San Francisco's Polk Gulch neighborhood (the first [...] "gay village" [...] in that city), gentrification seems to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> result.|$|E
2500|$|Four NESCAC {{institutions}} {{are among the}} 39 that founded the NCAA in 1905: Amherst, Tufts, Wesleyan, and Williams. Prior to 1993 NESCAC generally did not allow member schools to send teams to NCAA championships. [...] Since then all sports except football <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> freedom, many excelling in the NCAA Division III championships. The NACDA Directors' Cup, awarded since 1996 to the college or university in each NCAA Division that wins the most college championships, has been claimed at the Division III level by a NESCAC institution every year except 1998. In the 2012–13 season, four of the top ten NACDA Director's Cup institutions were from NESCAC: Williams (1), Middlebury (3), Amherst (6), and Tufts (8).|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Pinzón's {{recurring}} fever was syphilis. [...] The theory that syphilis is of New World origin {{and that it}} was first brought back to Europe by Columbus's crew has been longstanding, and long controversial. Some recent genetic evidence restores credence to the theory. Even so, even if Pinzón contracted it on the voyage, it is extremely unlikely that it was the cause of his death. Tertiary syphilis does not normally show up for 3 to 15 years. There is also a possibility that some historians have confused Martín Alonso Pinzón with his brother Francisco, who is more plausibly (but still controversially) believed to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> particular disease. Conversely, there is the possibility that the first outbreak of syphilis among Europeans with no immunity was much more virulent than subsequently.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Clark criticised the Invasion of Iraq {{without an}} {{explicit}} United Nations mandate, and her government opposed New Zealand {{military action in}} the Iraq War. Her government did not send combat troops to Iraq, although some medical and engineering units were sent. A strong supporter of nuclear disarmament, Clark pursued a policy of peace-making within the Pacific region. Clark's foreign policy reflected the priorities of liberal internationalism, especially the promotion of democracy and human rights; the strengthening {{of the role of}} the United Nations; the advancement of antimilitarism and disarmament; and the encouragement of free-trade. In March 2003, referring to the US-led coalition's actions in Iraq, Clark told the newspaper The Sunday Star-Times that, [...] "I don't think that 11 September under a Gore presidency would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> consequence for Iraq." [...] She later sent a letter to Washington apologising for any offence that her comment may have caused.|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2007, President Bush held a {{press conference}} and was asked about his {{commutation}} of Libby's prison sentence. Bush told reporters: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this,</b> you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course and now we're going to move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Few of {{the portraits}} {{attributed}} to Giorgione appear as straightforward {{records of the}} appearance of a commissioning individual, although it is entirely possible that many are. Many can be read as types designed to express a mood or atmosphere, and certainly many of the examples of the portrait tradition Giorgione initiated appear to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> purpose, and not to have been sold to the sitter. The subjects of his non-religious figure paintings are equally hard to discern. Perhaps the first question to ask is whether there was intended to be a specific meaning to these paintings that ingenious research can hope to recover. Many art historians argue that there is not: [...] "The best evidence, perhaps, that Giorgione's pictures were not particularly esoteric in their meaning is provided by the fact that while his stylistic innovations were widely adopted, the distinguishing feature of virtually all Venetian non-religious painting {{in the first half of}} the 16th century is the lack of learned or literary content".|$|E

2500|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house and}} its design was mostly the work of William Buckland, a carpenter/joiner and indentured servant from England. Buckland later went on to design several notable buildings in Virginia and Maryland. Both he and William Bernard Sears, another indentured servant, are believed to have created the ornate woodwork and interior carving. Gunston's interior design combines elements of rococo, chinoiserie, and Gothic styles, an unusual contrast to the tendency for simple decoration in Virginia at this time. Although chinoiserie was popular in Britain, Gunston Hall is the only house known to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> decoration in colonial America. In 1792, Thomas Jefferson attended George Mason at his death bed at Gunston Hall. After Mason's death later that year, the house continued {{to be used as a}} residence for many years. In 1868, it was purchased by noted abolitionist and civil war Colonel Edward Daniels. [...] It is now a museum owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia and open to the public. [...] The home and grounds were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for their association with Mason.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 January 2008, Lehmann {{appeared}} in Arsenal's second FA Cup {{game of the}} season, keeping his second successive clean sheet as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 3–0. Manager Arsène Wenger later promised Lehmann that, if he stayed at Arsenal, he would play every game in the FA Cup. On 29 January 2008, Lehmann suggested that he will stick with Arsenal until his contract expires {{at the end of}} the season. Lehmann gave his reasons as his relationship with the fans, players, family situations and his chance to still be able to win things at the club; believing he [...] "wouldn’t <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> chance somewhere else." [...] On 2 February 2008, following an injury to Almunia, Lehmann returned in goal for Arsenal in the Premiership for an away fixture against Manchester City, more than five months after his last league appearance; Arsenal won the match 3–1. Due to Almunia catching flu straight after the injury, Lehmann kept his place in goal for the following three matches in February, including the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 against Milan, but also the 4–0 loss to arch rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{evidence}} that the boat's men had known {{they had been in}} trouble was presented to the local county coroner. [...] Men searching the Ottawa County beaches for bodies found a bobbing, splintered plank or piece of board siding. On the wood was written, with pencil, a note: [...] "Worst storm I have ever been in. [...] Can’t stay up much longer. [...] Hope to God we are saved. A.L.A." [...] Albert L. Anderson was the ship's captain. [...] The note was treated as evidence by many, and deprecated by others. [...] Skeptics said that the ship's master, a man with forty years' experience on the Great Lakes (and thirty of them with captain's papers), would have been likely to try to write down the exact time the note was written, the condition of the boat at the time of writing, and the location of the boat as it labored through its final moments. [...] In any case, the coroner's inquiry into the vessel's sinking - which would have very much liked to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> information - did not have it. [...] At the inquest, held September 24 in Grand Haven, the coroner's jury was forced to conclude that the lost boat had sunk for unknown reasons at an unknown location.|$|E
