5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E

25|$|A second, {{nationwide}} observation complex {{was established}} to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated {{along the line of}} the satellite's <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam; Sary-Shagan; Yeniseysk; Klyuchi; Yelizovo; Makat in Guryev Oblast; and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai. Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters. The complex became an early prototype of the Soviet Mission Control Center.|$|E
25|$|Although GOES-3 {{ceased to}} be used for weather {{operations}} in 1989, it spent over 20 years as a critical part of communications between the U.S. and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station before being decommissioned in 2016. Geostationary satellites expend fuel to keep themselves stationary over the equator, and thus cannot normally ordinarily be seen from the poles. When that fuel is depleted, solar and lunar perturbations increase the satellite's inclination so that its <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> begins to describe an analemma (a figure-8 in the north-south direction). This usually ends the satellite's primary mission. However, when the inclination is high enough the satellite may begin to rise above the polar horizons at the extremes of the figure-8, as was the case for GOES-3. A nine-meter dish was constructed at the station, and communication with the satellite could be obtained for about five hours per day. Data rates were around 2.048 megabytes/second (bi-directional) under optimum conditions.|$|E

The RD-10 engine, rated at [...] of thrust, {{was moved to the}} front of the nose and its cowling formed the bottom of the forward fuselage. This position minimized thrust losses due to the length of the intake duct and allowed the engine to be changed much more easily than its predecessor. The cockpit was widened and moved to a position over the mid-set wings, even with the engine's exhaust nozzle. The pilot's seat back was armored and he was protected by an armor plate to his front and a bulletproof windscreen. Three fuel tanks were positioned ahead of the cockpit and one behind it with a total capacity of [...] of fuel. The removable, mid-mounted wings used several different laminar flow airfoils over their span. Each wing had a single spar, slotted flaps and ailerons. The tricycle undercarriage retracted into the fuselage, which meant that the aircraft had a very narrow <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> The aircraft was armed with three [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, two on the starboard side of the aircraft's nose and the other on the port side. Each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition.|$|E

A simulator study has recently been completed at NASA Langley Research Center in which guest pilots from a number of airlines were asked to fly curved <b>ground</b> <b>tracks</b> designed to avoid population centers in four airport communities. Eight two-man crews comprised of commercial line pilots, and three NASA crews each evaluated a total of eight departures and eight approaches on the basis of such factors as workload, safety, passenger acceptance, controllability, and piloting skill.

Half of the trajectories were curved and designed to be population-minimal, and half were designed to represent conventional <b>ground</b> <b>tracks.</b> The objective {{of the study was to}} determine if statistically significant differences could be detected between curved and conventional <b>ground</b> <b>tracks</b> on the basis of these parameters...|$|R
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} supporting a Mercury mission was typically around 18,000, with about 15,000 people associated with recovery.

It collected data from the spacecraft and provided two-way communication between the astronaut and the ground. Each station had a range of [...] and a pass typically lasted 7 minutes. Mercury astronauts on the ground would take part of the Capsule Communicator or CAPCOM who communicated with the astronaut in orbit. Data from the spacecraft was sent to the ground, processed at the Goddard Space Center and relayed to the Mercury Control Center at Cape Canaveral. In the Control Center, the data was displayed on boards on each side of a world map, which showed the position of the spacecraft, its <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> and the place it could land in an emergency within the next 30 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The damaged aircraft, now {{airborne}} with takeoff thrust engaged, {{began to}} bank to the right. The bank angle increased until the flap {{of the right}} wing struck the cab of an excavator 1,500 meters from the runway threshold. [...] The aircraft's bank angle continued to increase {{to the point that}} the right wing began to cut into the ground and taxiways nearby the closed runway; the flight's continuous right bank by now took it on a northward <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> [...] The end of the right wing eventually struck the corner of an aircraft repair hangar, causing damage to the hangar and also fracturing the DC-10's right wing. The aircraft spun around, and impacted into an Eastern Airlines service building north of both runways, 26 seconds after it initially touched down. This final impact caused the structural breakup of the aircraft, heavily damaged the two story reinforced concrete building, and caused a large fire. [...] One part of the DC-10's right wing travelled well off airport grounds, impacting a residential building on Matamoros Street in the Peñón de los Baños colonia and causing a fire there as well.|$|E
