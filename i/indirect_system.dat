25|$|Flight {{has allowed}} the insect to disperse, escape from enemies and {{environmental}} harm, and colonise new habitats. One of the insect’s key adaptations is flight, the mechanics of which {{differ from those of}} other flying animals because their wings are not modified appendages. Fully developed and functional wings occur only in adult insects. To fly, gravity and drag (air resistance to movement) have to be overcome. Most insects fly by beating their wings and to power their flight they have either direct flight muscles attached to the wings, or an <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> where there is no muscle-to-wing connection and instead they are attached to a highly flexible box-like thorax.|$|E

50|$|Following {{independence}} in 1975, {{the outbreak of}} the Angolan Civil War delayed the country's first post-independence elections until 1980. By then, the MPLA had created a one-party state. It organised indirect elections, in which voters elected carefully vetted candidates to electoral colleges, who in turn elected the National Assembly. The next elections were due to be held in 1983, but they were delayed until 1986 due to the ongoing war. When they were held, it was under the same <b>indirect</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

50|$|A drainback {{system is}} an active <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> where the HTF (usually pure water) circulates through the {{collector}}, driven by a pump. The collector piping is not pressurized and includes an open drainback reservoir that is contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space. The HTF remains in the drainback reseervoir unless the pump is operating and returns there (emptying the collector) when the pump is switched off. The collector system, including piping, must drain via gravity into the drainback tank. Drainback systems {{are not subject to}} freezing or overheating. The pump operates only when appropriate for heat collection, but not to protect the HTF, increasing efficiency and reducing pumping costs.|$|E

This heated air is then {{passed over the}} substance to be dried and exits upwards often through a chimney, taking moisture released from the substance with it.

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Bangladesh is a ground for filing writ petitions under Article 102 of the Constitution of Bangladesh. Writ petitions are an <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> {{of judicial review}} in Bangladesh. Legitimate expectation concerns judicial review in administrative law. It {{is based on the}} principles of natural justice and fairness, and seeks to prevent abuse of power and Wednesbury irrationality, by public authorities. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation seeks to protect a procedural or substantive interest when a public authority rescinds from a representation made to a person. A key facet of this doctrine is that a public authority must provide an explanation based on reasonable and fair grounds for its decision. The doctrine was firmly established by the English courts. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh began referring to the doctrine in 1987. It was expressly referred in judgement {{for the first time in}} 2000.|$|E
40|$|In {{oil and gas}} {{processing}} industry, cooling of {{the oil and gas}} is necessary to run processes at optimal temperatures. Cooling the process flow requires large amount of big expensive equipment. The traditional way of cooling the process flow has been to use a cooling medium in a closed loop to do this; the cooling medium is a mixture of TEG and water. Seawater is then again used to cool the cooling medium. In recent years a new way doing it as developed. This method cuts out the closed cooling loop, and uses the seawater directly to cool the process flow, thus the name direct cooling system. The data used in this thesis is form a recent offshore production platform project. The two systems are designed by the use of Aspen s Exchanger Design & Rating and Aspen HYSYS. Exchanger Design & Rating is used to design the plate heat exchangers and the shell and tube heat exchangers, HYSYS is used to create the intermediate cooling medium loop. Three systems have been modeled to meet the process specifications of the said project, these under systems are: 	 24 -HA- 001 A/B/C Wet Gas Cooler 	 26 -HA- 001 Injection Compression Suction Cooler 	 27 -HA- 001 A/B Export Compression Cooler By comparing weight, capital expenses, operational expenses and footprints each system has its advantages and shortcomings. A direct system weighs only 55 % of the total weight of the <b>indirect</b> <b>system,</b> the equipment used costs 31 % more to buy than the equipment used in a <b>indirect</b> <b>system.</b> On offshore platforms there is a shortage on free space to put either equipment or house working staff. Therefore the cooling system that takes up the least space might have an advantage. The <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> s equipment total footprint is 38 % larger that the footprint of the direct system. The <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> also utilizes additional cooling medium pumps to keep the pressure up in the closed loop. Pumps running on electricity produced on the platform increase the yearly operational cost with $ 45 150. An <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> reduces risk for fouling and hydrate-formation inside the heat exchangers and is a well proven system. The direct system reduces the use of toxic substances on the platform, by not using triethylene glycol. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Indirect {{or closed}} loop systems use a heat {{exchanger}} to transfer {{heat from the}} [...] "heat-transfer fluid" [...] (HTF) fluid to the potable water. The most common HTF is an antifreeze/water mix that typically uses non-toxic propylene glycol.

40|$|Direct {{expansion}} (DX) refrigeration {{technology is}} almost exclusively used in multi-temperature transport refrigeration systems. Multi-temperature systems use {{up to three}} evaporators, requiring large refrigerant charges and system pressure control to operate {{over a wide range}} of set-point conditions. Despite incremental design improvements over the past decade, environmental and control issues continue to arise with DX systems. Deployment of indirect refrigeration systems (IDX) offers an alternative approach to address these issues. Indirect systems can however suffer from performance penalties, where reduced cooling capacity and COP occur under certain operating conditions. One strategy, aimed at offsetting the disadvantage of reduced refrigeration capacity, is to incorporate an economiser circuit into the primary cycle of the IDX system. Economiser cycles can enhance the refrigeration effect of the primary refrigerant in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of the <b>indirect</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, for a multi-temperature transport refrigeration system, the performance of an optimised economised <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> is compared with a non-economised <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> and a contemporary direct expansion system. All tests for the economised IDX system were carried out using optimised refrigerant mass flowrate injection ratios, which were established for different operating boundary conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to compare direct and {{indirect}} detectors {{in terms of their}} system linearity, presampled modulation transfer function (MTF), Wiener spectrum (WS), noise equivalent quanta (NEQ), and power spectrum. Measurements were made on two flat-panel detectors, GE Revolution XR/d (indirect) and Shimadzu Safire (direct) radiographic techniques. The system linearity of the systems was measured using a time-scale method. The MTF of the systems was measured using an edge method. The WS of the systems was determined for a variable range of exposure levels by two-dimensional Fourier analysis. The NEQ was assessed from the measured MTF, WS, and estimated ideal signal-to-noise ratios. Power spectrum analyzed the chest phantom within artificial lesions. System linearity was excellent for the direct systems. For the direct system, the MTF was found to be significantly higher than that for the indirect systems. For the direct system, the WS was relatively uniform across all frequencies. In comparison, the <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> exhibited a drop in the WS at high frequencies. At lower frequencies, the NEQ for the <b>indirect</b> <b>system</b> was noticeably higher than for the direct system.
