5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, <b>diamond-like</b> c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another <b>diamond-like</b> boron compound.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of <b>diamond-like</b> carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means <b>diamond-like.</b> Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|The boron {{nitrides}} are {{notable for}} {{the variety of}} structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the <b>diamond-like</b> structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds {{can be viewed as}} a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the existence of}} a hydrocarbon with the C10H16 formula and <b>diamond-like</b> structure of the molecule was suggested by H. Decker at a conference in 1924. Decker called this molecule decaterpene and was surprised that it had not been synthesized yet.|$|E
25|$|Toyota Racing Development F SPORT {{parts for}} Japanese Lexus IS sedan {{included}} front spoiler, side spoiler, rear spoiler, sport muffler and rear diffuser, <b>diamond-like</b> carbon shock absorber, 19-inch aluminium wheel set (19x8.5J front and 19x9J rear rims, 45mm front and 50mm rear insets, 245/35ZR19 front and 265/30ZR19 rear tires), member brace, performance damper.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded with a 43mm Kayaba inverted fork with sliders {{having a}} <b>diamond-like</b> carbon (DLC) coating. The rear shock {{is also a}} Kayaba, and the overall suspension is firmer than the previous model. The swingarm is similar in design to the old one, but was strengthened. Front and rear remain fully adjustable. The transmission was given a heavier-duty, slipper clutch. The final drive ratio was slightly lower, and gears 5-6 were spaced farther apart, and gear ratios 1-2 moved closer together.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{counties}} in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost <b>diamond-like</b> grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} for use as a diamond simulant, a material must possess certain <b>diamond-like</b> properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for those familiar with diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a gemologist, the most important of differential properties are those that foster non-destructive testing; most of these are visual in nature. Non-destructive testing is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in jewelry, and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and softness of non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.|$|E
25|$|In {{dealing with}} the {{emotional}} fallout from {{the murder of her}} sister, Frost travels to the mutant haven island of Genosha, where she teaches at a mutant school until a genocidal Sentinel attack kills most of the island's inhabitants; Frost survives due to the sudden manifestation of her secondary mutation: the power to transform herself into a flexible, near-invulnerable, <b>diamond-like</b> substance. After being rescued Frost joins the X-Men and takes on a teaching position at Xavier Institute. She mentors a group of telepathic quintuplets, the Stepford Cuckoos, who quickly become her prized pupils. Frost and the Cuckoos prove themselves when they help fight and defeat Charles Xavier's evil twin sister Cassandra Nova. As a member of the X-Men, Frost begins counselling Cyclops over his marriage with Jean however, this soon turns into a psychic, non-physical, sexual relationship.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, <b>diamond-like</b> carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the most}} {{thermally}} stable binary silicon compound, only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around 2700°C. It is resistant to most aqueous acids, phosphoric acid being an exception. It forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide {{on the surface and}} hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000°C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl4 and carbon at 100°C and SiCl4 and CCl4 at 1000°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped. In its <b>diamond-like</b> behaviour it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.|$|E
25|$|The {{hardness}} (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low {{material cost}} make CZ {{the most popular}} simulant of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic zirconia. These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige. Most jewelers will use a thermal probe to test all suspected CZs, a test which relies on diamond's superlative thermal conductivity (CZ, like almost all other diamond simulants, is a thermal insulator). CZ is made {{in a number of}} different colors meant to imitate fancy diamonds (e.g., yellow to golden brown, orange, red to pink, green, and opaque black), but most of these do not approximate the real thing. Cubic zirconia can be coated with <b>diamond-like</b> carbon to improve its durability, but will still be detected as CZ by a thermal probe.|$|E
500|$|Coatings are {{increasingly}} {{used to give}} a diamond simulant such as cubic zirconia a more [...] "diamond-like" [...] appearance. One such substance is <b>diamond-like</b> carbon—an amorphous carbonaceous material that has some physical properties {{similar to those of}} the diamond. Advertising suggests that such a coating would transfer some of these <b>diamond-like</b> properties to the coated stone, hence enhancing the diamond simulant. Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy should easily identify such a treatment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} {{manufacturers}} have sought ways of distinguishing their product by supposedly [...] "improving" [...] cubic zirconia. Coating finished CZs {{in a film}} of <b>diamond-like</b> carbon (DLC) is one such innovation, a process using chemical vapor deposition. The resulting material is purportedly harder, more lustrous and more like diamond overall. The coating is thought to quench the excess fire of CZ, while improving its refractive index, thus making it appear more like diamond. Additionally, {{because of the high}} percentage of diamond bonds in the amorphous diamond coating, the finished simulant will show a positive diamond signature in Raman spectra.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coefficient}} of friction of plastics is usually measured against polished steel. PTFE's {{coefficient of}} friction is 0.05 to 0.10, which is the third-lowest of any known solid material (BAM being the first, with a {{coefficient of friction}} of 0.02; <b>diamond-like</b> carbon being second-lowest at 0.05). PTFE's resistance to van der Waals forces means {{that it is the}} only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. [...] In fact, PTFE can be used to prevent insects climbing up surfaces painted with the material. PTFE is so slippery that insects cannot get a grip and tend to fall off. For example, PTFE is used to prevent ants climbing out of formicaria.|$|E
2500|$|Glass has {{the ability}} to refract, reflect, and {{transmit}} light following geometrical optics, without scattering it (due to the absence of grain boundaries). It is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows. Common glass has a refraction index around 1.5. This may be modified by adding low-density materials such as boron, which lowers the index of refraction (see crown glass), or increased (to as much as 1.8) with high-density materials such as (classically) lead oxide (see flint glass and lead glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium. These high-index glasses (inaccurately known as [...] "crystal" [...] when used in glass vessels) cause more chromatic dispersion of light, and are prized for their <b>diamond-like</b> optical properties.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the recent}} past, the {{so-called}} [...] "window pane test" [...] was commonly {{thought to be}} an assured method of identifying diamond. It is a potentially destructive test wherein a suspect diamond gemstone is scraped against a pane of glass, with a positive result being a scratch on the glass and none on the gemstone. The use of hardness points and scratch plates made of corundum (hardness 9) are also used in place of glass. Hardness tests are inadvisable for three reasons: glass is fairly soft (typically 6 or below) and can be scratched by {{a large number of}} materials (including many simulants); diamond has four directions of perfect and easy cleavage (planes of structural weakness along which the diamond could split) which could be triggered by the testing process; and many <b>diamond-like</b> gemstones (including older simulants) are valuable in their own right.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} ended {{and all the}} X-Titles were revamped, in 2001 Frost {{appeared}} in New X-Men as a teacher for the mutant population of Genosha, which was then controlled by Magneto. After a Sentinel strike leveled the island nation, the X-Men found Frost amidst the rubble with a [...] "secondary mutation" [...] which hardened her skin to a <b>diamond-like</b> density. Using Frost as a character was suggested to writer Grant Morrison on his website by a fan. While Morrison initially {{had no plans to}} use her, the death of the character Colossus left Morrison with an opening. He created Emma's secondary mutation – a super strong diamond form – as a replacement for Colossus' powers and added her to the cast. Subsequently, Frost joined the X-Men. This would lead to her instigating an affair with fellow X-Man Cyclops, who was having marital difficulties with Jean Grey. This series also provided further glimpses into her past, introducing her father Winston Frost and her brother Christian.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2017, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fifth generation" [...] or [...] "Gen5". The revisions centered on ergonomics and improving reliability. Many parts of fifth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The two fifth-generation models announced were the Glock 17 and Glock 19, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum. Some conspicuous changes on the fifth-generation models are: ambidextrous slide stop levers, nDLC (<b>Diamond-Like</b> Carbon) surface finish for barrel and slide, a barrel featuring conventional land-and-groove rifling (called the “Glock Marksman Barrel” by Glock) rather than the polygonal rifling used in earlier models, a deeper recessed barrel crown, omission of the finger grooves on the grip, a flared magazine well, and a reintroduction of a (half moon shaped) cutout on the bottom front of the grip. The locking block pin located above the trigger pin that was introduced in the third-generation is omitted. Many internal parts were less conspicuously revised.|$|E
2500|$|The {{teaching}} of a [...] "Buddha nature" [...] (Skt. tathāgatagarbha) may {{be based on}} the [...] "luminous mind" [...] concept found in the Āgamas. The essential idea, articulated in the Buddha nature sūtras, but not accepted by all Mahāyānists, is that no being is without a concealed but indestructible interior link to the awakening of bodhi and that this link is an uncreated element (dhātu) or principle deep inside each being, which constitutes the deathless, <b>diamond-like</b> [...] "essence of the self". The Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra states: [...] "The essence of the Self (ātman) is the subtle Buddha nature..." [...] while the later Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra states that the Buddha nature might be taken to be self (ātman), but it is not. In the sagathakam section of that same sutra, however, the Tathagatagarbha as the Self is not denied, but affirmed: [...] "The Atma [...] characterised with purity is the state of self-realization; this is the Tathagata's Womb (garbha), which does not belong to the realm of the theorisers." [...] In the Buddha nature class of sūtras, the word [...] "self" [...] (ātman) is used in a way defined by and specific to these sūtras. (See Atman (Buddhism).) ...|$|E

6000|$|Berridge {{thought of}} many things while the young Lord thus charged upon him, and it was odd that no {{one of them was}} any {{question}} of the possible worth of the offered achievement--which, for that matter, was certain to be of the quality of all the books, {{to say nothing of the}} plays, and the projects for plays, with which, for some time past, he had seen his daily post-bag distended. He had made out, on looking at these things, no difference at all from one to the other. Here, however, was something more--something that made his fellow-guest's overture independently interesting and, as he might imagine, important. He smiled, he was friendly and vague; said [...] "A work of fiction, I suppose?" [...] and that he didn't pretend ever to pronounce, that he in fact quite hated, always, to have to, not [...] "knowing," [...] as he felt, any better than any one else; but would gladly look at anything, under that demur, if it would give any pleasure. Perhaps the very brightest and most <b>diamond-like</b> twinkle he had yet seen the star of his renown emit was just the light brought into his young Lord's eyes by this so easy consent to oblige. It was easy because the presence before him was from moment to moment, referring itself back to some recent observation or memory; something caught somewhere, within a few weeks or months, as he had moved about, and that seemed to flutter forth at this stir of the folded leaves of his recent experience very much as a gathered, faded flower, placed there for [...] "pressing," [...] might drop from between the pages of a volume opened at hazard.|$|E
60|$|Take any road you please, you {{may depend}} upon it {{you will not}} stay in it half a mile. Your road is {{everything}} that a road ought to be: it is bordered with trees, and with strange plants and flowers; it is shady and pleasant, or sunny and still pleasant; it carries you by the prettiest and peacefulest and most homelike of homes, and through stretches of forest that lie in a deep hush sometimes, and sometimes are alive with the music of birds; it curves always, which is a continual promise, whereas straight roads reveal everything at a glance and kill interest. Your road is all this, and yet you will not stay in it half a mile, {{for the reason that}} little seductive, mysterious roads are always branching out from it on either hand, and as these curve sharply also and hide what is beyond, you cannot resist the temptation to desert your own chosen road and explore them.

There is enough of variety. Sometimes you are in the level open, with marshes thick grown with flag-lances that are ten feet high on the one hand, and potato and onion orchards on the other; next, you are on a hilltop, with the ocean and the islands spread around you; presently the road winds through a deep cut, shut in by perpendicular walls thirty or forty feet high, marked with the oddest and abruptest stratum lines, suggestive of sudden and eccentric old upheavals, and garnished with here and there a clinging adventurous flower, and here and there a dangling vine; and by and by your way is along the sea edge, and you may look down a fathom or two through the transparent water and watch the <b>diamond-like</b> flash and play of the light upon the rocks and sands on the bottom until you are tired of it--if you are so constituted as to be able to get tired of it.|$|E
