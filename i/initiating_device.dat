50|$|In an explosive, {{pyrotechnic}} device, {{or military}} munition, a fuse (or fuze) {{is the part}} of the device that initiates function. In common usage, the word fuse is used indiscriminately. However, when being specific (and in particular in a military context), the term fuse describes a simple pyrotechnic <b>initiating</b> <b>device,</b> like the cord on a firecracker whereas the term fuze is sometimes used when referring to a more sophisticated ignition device incorporating mechanical and/or electronic components, such as a proximity fuze for an M107 artillery shell, magnetic or acoustic fuze on a sea mine, spring-loaded grenade fuze, pencil detonator, or anti-handling device.|$|E

5000|$|A Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP), [...] Fire Alarm Control Unit (FACU), {{or simply}} Fire alarm panel is the {{controlling}} {{component of a}} Fire alarm system. The panel receives information from devices designed to detect and report fires, monitors their operational integrity and provides for automatic control of equipment, and transmission of information necessary to prepare the facility for fire based on a predetermined sequence. The panel may also supply electrical energy to operate any associated <b>initiating</b> <b>device,</b> notification appliance, control, transmitter, or relay. There are four basic types of panels: coded panels, conventional panels, addressable panels, and multiplex systems.|$|E
50|$|This signal {{indicates}} that {{a portion of the}} building's fire protection system has been disabled (such as a fire sprinkler control valve being closed and, consequently, a sprinkler tamper switch being activated), or, less frequently, that a lower priority <b>initiating</b> <b>device</b> has been triggered (such as a duct smoke detector). Depending on the system's design, the supervisory point may be latching, meaning the panel must be reset to clear the supervisory condition, or non-latching, meaning the indicator automatically goes out when the condition has cleared. However, some panels require a reset regardless of whether the supervisory point is latching or non-latching.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system. The type of fire alarm <b>initiating</b> <b>device</b> is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm pull station, which signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|E

5000|$|A {{conventional}} {{fire alarm}} control panel employs {{one or more}} circuits, connected to <b>initiating</b> <b>devices</b> wired in parallel. These sensors are devised to dramatically decrease the circuit resistance when the environmental influence on any sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold. In a conventional fire alarm system, the information density {{is limited to the}} number of such circuits used.|$|R
50|$|This resets {{the panel}} after an alarm condition. All {{initiating}} devices are reset, and {{the panel is}} cleared of any alarm conditions. If an <b>initiating</b> <b>device</b> is still in alarm after the system is reset, such as a smoke detector continuing to sense smoke or a manual pull station still in an activated position, another alarm will be initiated, or in some cases, the panel will refuse to reset until all the alarms have been reset/cleared. A system reset is often required to clear supervisory conditions. A system reset does not usually clear trouble conditions. Most trouble conditions will clear automatically when conditions are returned to normal.|$|E
5000|$|Grid {{computing}} {{is seen as}} {{a solution}} to the rescue issues of PSEs for mobile devices. This is made possible through a [...] "Brokering Service". This service is started by an <b>initiating</b> <b>device</b> that sends the necessary information for PSE to resolve task. The brokering service then breaks this down into subtasks that distributes the information to various subordinate devices that perform these subtasks. The brokering necessitates an Active Agent Repository (AAR) and a Task Allocation Table (TAT) that both work to manage the subtasks. A keep-Alive Server is tapped to handle communication between the brokering service and the subordinate devices. The Keep-Alive server relies on a lightweight client application installed in the participating mobile devices.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{systems and}} {{increasing}} demand for finer diagnostic detail beyond broad area location and control functions expanded the control by zone strategy of conventional systems by providing multiple initiating circuits within a common zone, each exclusively {{connected to a}} particular type of <b>initiating</b> <b>device,</b> or group of devices. This arrangement forms a device type by zone matrix whose information is particularly suited to the Tabular annunciator In multistorey buildings employing a Tabular annunciator, for example; rows of indicators define the floors horizontally in their stacked relationship and the type of device installed on that floor displays as columns of indicators vertically aligned through each floor. The intersection of the floor and device indicators provides the combined information. The density of information however remains a function of the number of circuits employed.|$|E

In 2007, {{as a result of}} the lawsuit, Faraday discontinued its entire line of notification appliances for 8 years in favor of Wheelock's line as part of the agreement. However in 2015, eight years after the lawsuit, Siemens did not restart production of their own notification appliances, sticking with the Wheelock devices.

40|$|To {{overcome}} serious {{weaknesses in}} determining the performance of <b>initiating</b> <b>devices,</b> a novel 'ignitability test method', representing actual design interfaces and ignition materials, has been developed. Ignition device output consists of heat, light, gas an burning particles. Past research methods have evaluated these parameters individually. This paper describes the development and demonstration of an ignitability test method combining all these parameters, and the quantitative assessment of the ignition performance of two widely used percussion primers, the M 42 C 1 -PA 101 and the M 42 C 2 - 793. The ignition materials used for this evaluation were several powder, granule and pellet sizes of black powder and boron-potassium nitrate. This test method should be useful for performance evaluation of all initiator types, quality assurance, evaluation of ignition interfaces, and service life studies of initiators and ignition materials...|$|R

Phases of operation include primary recall (typically the ground level), alternate/secondary recall (typically a floor adjacent to the ground level - used when the initiation occurred on the primary level), illumination of the [...] "fire hat" [...] indicator when an alarm occurs in the elevator hoistway or associated control room, and in some cases shunt trip (disconnect) of elevator power (generally used where the control room or hoistway is protected by fire sprinklers).|$|R

40|$|Electric matches {{are used}} in {{pyrotechnics}} to <b>initiate</b> <b>devices</b> electrically rather than by burning fuses. Fuses have the disadvantage of burning with a long delay before igniting a pyrotechnic device, while electric matches can instantaneously fire a device at a user's command. In addition, electric matches can be fired remotely at a safe distance. Unfortunately, most current commercial electric match compositions contain lead as thiocyanate, nitroresorcinate or tetroxide, which when burned, produces lead-containing smoke. This lead pollutant presents environmental exposure problems to cast, crew, and audience. The reason that these lead containing compounds are used as electric match compositions is that these mixtures have the required thermal stability, yet are simultaneously able to be initiated reliably by a very small thermal stimulus. A possible alternative to lead-containing compounds is nanoscale thermite materials (metastable intermolecular composites or MIC). These superthermite materials can be formulated to be extremely spark sensitive with tunable reaction rate and yield high temperature products. We have formulated and manufactured lead-free electric matches based on nanoscale Al/MoO{sub 3 } mixtures. We have determined that these matches fire reliably and to consistently ignite a sample of black powder. Initial safety, ageing and performance results are presented in this paper...|$|R
