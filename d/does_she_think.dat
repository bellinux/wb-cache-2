25|$|Later, {{the scandal}} behind P.J. {{is that in}} order to receive his trust fund he must marry before he turns 28 years old, and so he proposes to Naomi, unbeknownst to her. Annie finds out about the clause and tells P.J. to come clean to Naomi, which he is about to but {{chickens}} out and ask if she will take his last name instead of saying what he should have.

But as Austin becomes her manager, he also has his eyes set on steering Adrianna away from Dixon.

As a result, Silver decides to side with Navid. Meanwhile, Naomi is the event planner for a young woman named Madison who is enthused by her upcoming nuptials.

2500|$|Despite the UDA women {{having found}} Ogilby guilty, the two UDA men {{present at the}} [...] "trial" [...] couldn't reach a verdict and gave orders that she be released. The women drove her to the Glengall Street bus station where she got on a bus headed for the YWCA hostel she had moved to on the Malone Road. The women then [...] "rearrested" [...] her. It was alleged that this {{decision}} came about after she sarcastically remarked in reference to Douglas, [...] "Who <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> she is? The Queen?" [...] which had freshly infuriated Douglas and the others. Blocking the bus as it {{pulled out of the}} station into the street, Douglas and her [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] then boarded the bus and dragged her off into the waiting car for a further grilling. Minutes later, after being alerted by the bus station staff, the car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although Douglas claimed {{they were on their way}} to a party, the querying policeman told the women about the report of one of them having been forced off the bus. In an attempt to mollify Douglas, Ogilby then spoke up admitting that she was the person who had been removed from the bus but that [...] "It was nothing. Just a couple of us fooling around". The police however remained unconvinced of their claims and the eight women and Ogilby were taken into the RUC Queen Street station for questioning. All of the women were asked for their names and addresses; the majority lived in the Sandy Row area. [...] Fearing the grisly fate that typically befell informers, Ogilby did not say anything to the RUC about the UDA kangaroo court or threats against her. Therefore, she and the eight other women were released without being charged the following morning at 2.00 a.m. Ogilby returned to the police station a few hours later, visibly frightened, but was sent home in a taxi after refusing to give the reason for her distress. That same day inside a Sandy Row pub, Douglas told the other women that Ogilby was a troublemaker who had to die, and she speedily made arrangements to facilitate the murder.|$|E
