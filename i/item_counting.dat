With the rapid rising of data input speeds, the most challenging problem in frequent <b>item</b> <b>counting</b> is to meet the requirement of wire-speed processing. In this paper, we propose a streaming oriented PE-ring framework on FPGA for counting frequent items. Compared with the best existing FPGA implementation, our basic PE-ring framework saves 50 % lookup table resources cost and achieves the same throughput in a more scalable way. Furthermore, we adopt SIMD-like cascaded filter for further performance improvements, which outperforms the previous work by up to 3. 24 times in some data distributions...|$|E
40|$|There are reactor {{types that}} defy the {{traditional}} item accountancy safeguards approach applied to LWRs. Reactors types such as FBRs and PBMRs that prohibit traditional <b>item</b> <b>counting</b> {{fall into a}} safeguards gap between item-counting facilities and bulk facilities. At Fast Reactors and Pebble-Bed HTRs the difficulties associated with traditional <b>item</b> <b>counting</b> {{have given rise to}} safeguard approaches that rely upon maintaining Continuity of Knowledge (CoK) of containment and surveillance (C/S) data throughout the operational lifetime of the reactor. The reliance on CoK represents an inherent weakness in the safeguards approach; if CoK is lost and cannot be re-established, a facility will potentially remain out of compliance for the duration of its operational lifetime. It is evident that new safeguards approaches are required for these reactor types to mitigate the CoK vulnerability. At the present time, {{there are only a few}} reactors worldwide that cannot be readily safeguarded by item accountancy and C/S. However, future nuclear fuel cycles that are being considered around the globe all include a fast reactor component. For example, the Pebble-Bed HTR is a potentially attractive reactor design for countries with little or no existing nuclear infrastructure. It is clear that the number of reactors posing the unique safeguards challenge associated with systems that do not permit traditional item accountancy will increase in the coming years. Now is the time to consider safeguards alternatives that will remove the excessive dependence on C/S continuity of knowledge to provide the safeguards community with viable alternative safeguards approaches for these reactor types...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of cores and the rich instruction sets of modern hardware are opening up new opportunities for optimizing many traditional data mining tasks. In this paper we demonstrate how {{to speed up the}} performance of the computation of frequent items by almost one order of magnitude over the best published results by matching the algorithm to the underlying hardware architecture. We start with the observation that frequent <b>item</b> <b>counting,</b> like other data mining tasks, assumes certain amount of skew in the data. We exploit this skew to design a new algorithm that uses a pre-filtering stage that can be implemented in a highly efficient manner through SIMD instructions. Using pipelining, we then combine this pre-filtering stage with a conventional frequent item algorithm (Space-Saving) that will process the remainder of the data. The resulting operator can be parallelized with a small number of cores, leading to a parallel implementation that does not suffer any of the overheads of existing parallel solutions when querying the results and offers significantly higher throughput. 1...|$|E
40|$|The <b>item</b> <b>count</b> {{method is}} a way of asking {{sensitive}} survey questions which protects the anonymity of the respondents by randomization before the interview. It can be used to estimate the probability of sensitive behaviour and to model how it depends on explanatory variables. We analyse <b>item</b> <b>count</b> survey data on the illegal behaviour of buying stolen goods. The analysis of an <b>item</b> <b>count</b> question is best formulated as an instance of modelling incomplete categorical data. We propose an efficient implementation of the estimation which also provides explicit variance estimates for the parameters. We then suggest pecifications for the model for the control items, which is an auxiliary but unavoidable part of the analysis of <b>item</b> <b>count</b> data. These considerations and the results of our analysis of criminal behaviour highlight the fact that careful design of the questions is crucial for the success of the <b>item</b> <b>count</b> method...|$|R
40|$|The <b>item</b> <b>count</b> technique, used {{often to}} {{investigate}} illegal or socially undesirable behaviors, requires respondents to indicate merely {{the number of}} applicable items from among a list. However, the number of applicable items indicated via the <b>item</b> <b>count</b> question tends to be smaller than when it is calculated from the direct 'applies/ does not apply' responses to each item. Because this inconsistency, which we {{refer to as the}} underreporting effect, often disturbs proper <b>item</b> <b>count</b> estimates, the causes of this effect are explored in this paper. Web survey results revealed that the order of the response alternatives is irrelevant to the underreporting effect, and that the underreporting effect is caused by the response format in which the <b>item</b> <b>count</b> question requests merely the number of applicable items and not the number of non-applicable items. It is also shown that the magnitude of the underreporting effect decreases when the respondents are asked to indicate the numbers of both applicable and non-applicable items, which the authors refer to as elaborate <b>item</b> <b>count</b> questioning.

40|$|Surveys usually yield {{rates of}} voting in {{elections}} that {{are higher than}} official turnout figures, a phenomenon often attributed to intentional misrepresentation by respondents who did not vote and would be embarrassed to admit that. The experiments reported here tested the social desirability response bias hypothesis directly by implementing a technique that allowed respondents to report secretly whether they voted: the “item count technique. ” The <b>item</b> <b>count</b> technique significantly reduced turnout reports in a national telephone survey relative to direct self-reports, suggesting that social desirability response bias influenced direct self-reports in that survey. But in eight national surveys of American adults conducted via the Internet, the <b>item</b> <b>count</b> technique did not significantly reduce turnout reports. This mode difference is consistent with other evidence that the Internet survey mode may be less susceptible to social desirability response bias because of self-administration.

40|$|This article evaluates three {{different}} questioning techniques {{for measuring the}} prevalence of plagiarism in student papers: the randomized response technique (RRT), the <b>item</b> <b>count</b> technique (ICT), and the crosswise model (CM). In three independent experimental surveys with Swiss and German university students as subjects (two web surveys and a survey using paperand- pencil questionnaires in a classroom setting), {{each of the three}} techniques is compared to direct questioning and evaluated based on the “more-is-better” assumption. According to our results the RRTand the ICT failed to reduce social desirability bias in self-reports of plagiarism. In contrast, the CM was more successful in eliciting a significantly higher rate of reported sensitive behavior than direct questioning. One reason for the success of the CM, we believe, is that it overcomes the “self-protective no” bias known from the RRT (and which may also be a potential problem in the ICT). We find rates of up to 22 percent of students who declared that they ever intentionally adopted a passage from someone else’s work without citing it. Severe plagiarism such as handing in someone else’s paper as one’s own, however, seems to be less frequent with rates of about 1 to 2 percent.

40|$|Randomized {{response}} and <b>item</b> <b>count</b> techniques have originally been designed as statistical methods to reduce nonresponse {{as well as}} not reliable answers from the re-spondents. However, understanding how these methods work by the respondents {{could be a very}} difficult task and still sometimes it is possible to obtain a big proportion of people refusing to collaborate in the fear of the protection of their confidentiality. In a particular survey, the elements in the sample are exposed to a specific set of survey operations. In the case of randomized response techniques, an additional stage of intro-ducing the methods to both interviewers and respondents and convincing them how the confidentiality of the former is protected is necessary. In this paper, a simple but pow-erful method is formulated in order to describe the unknown response mechanism for the sample as accurately as possible. This corresponds to the very well-known response homogeneity group. However, as far as the authors know these models have not been applied to randomized response techniques. Data are assumed as missing at random within sample subgroups, conditionally on the sample. This is a substantial improve-ment on assuming that data are missing at random throughout the population. At the end, a simulation study shows the effects of ignoring the nonresponse on the bias and the variance of the estimators obtained under the application of these techniques and in particular to the seminal Warner randomized response model and some <b>item</b> <b>count</b> techniques available in the literature...|$|R

Much ivory, new and old, however, is successfully smuggled into Portugal, often hand-carried through the airports.
