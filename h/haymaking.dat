5|$|The {{breeding}} corn crake {{population had}} begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. <b>Haymaking</b> dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|At the Union of 1707 England {{had about}} five times the {{population}} of Scotland, and about 36 times as much wealth, however, Scotland began to experience the beginnings of economic expansion that would begin {{to allow it to}} close this gap. Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. <b>Haymaking</b> was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved {{the quality of life of}} their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.|$|E

5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands.

5|$|The two Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn crake was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in western Europe, but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. In {{much of the}} western half of the corn crake's breeding range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue. The main cause of the decline is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. <b>Haymaking</b> dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers. Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake. Drained and fertilised silage fields are less suitable for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area.|$|E

25|$|A {{day at the}} National Museum of Rural Life {{gives an}} {{opportunity}} for visitors {{to get back to}} the land and experience the traditional way of life as it was on the rural and partly mechanised Scottish farm of the 1950s. Ploughing, sowing, <b>haymaking</b> and harvesting are all carried out on this working farm. Interpretation guides enable visitors to understand and appreciate the many activities which are part and parcel of the Scottish farming year. Tractor rides take visitors to the farm where they can also see the herd of pedigree Ayrshire cattle which calve from January–March being milked every day at 3.00pm and the Kittochside flock of Scottish blackface ewes (sheep) which lamb in early April.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} of small-scale industries in Birmingham appears from {{as early as}} the 12th century, and the first documentary {{evidence of}} craftsmen in the town comes from 1232, when a group of burgesses negotiating to be released from their obligation to help with the Lord's <b>haymaking</b> are listed as including a smith, a tailor and four weavers. Manufacturing is likely to have been stimulated by the existence of the market, which would have provided a source of raw materials such as hides and wool, as well as a demand for goods from prosperous merchants in the town and from visitors from the countryside selling produce. By 1332 the number of craftsmen in Birmingham was similar to that of other Warwickshire towns associated with industry such as Tamworth, Henley-in-Arden, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Alcester.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haymaking</b> was {{introduced}} {{along with the}} English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lime was put down, marshes were drained, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture, creating the landscape of largely rectangular fields that characterises the Lowland Scottish landscape today. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. There were also organisational changes that would have long term consequences, including the commutation of payments in kind for those in money, the granting of longer leases and the consolidation of smaller holdings.|$|E
25|$|As feudal distinctions {{declined}} in the early modern era, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged {{to form a new}} identifiable group, the lairds. With the yeomen, these heritors were the major landholding orders. Others with property rights included husbandmen and free tenants. Many young people left home to become domestic and agricultural servants. The English invasions of the 1640s {{had a profound impact on}} the Scottish economy. Under the Commonwealth, the country was relatively highly taxed, but gained access to English markets. After the Restoration customs duties with England were re-established. Economic conditions were generally favourable, as land owners promoted better tillage and cattle-raising. After the Union of 1707 there was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Introductions included <b>haymaking,</b> the English plough, foreign grasses, rye grass and clover, turnips and cabbages. Lands were enclosed, displacing the run rig system and free pasture. Marshes were drained, lime was put down, roads built, woods planted, drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. The resulting Lowland Clearances saw hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly removed.|$|E
500|$|Use of {{the steam}} engine {{also began to}} make the horse {{redundant}} in farm work. In a letter to The Farmer's Magazine in 1849, Alderman Kell of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, commented that [...] " ... has been said, although perhaps not mathematically correct, to show that horses are kept at vast expense in comparison with a steam engine that eats only when it works." [...] With {{the invention of the}} portable steam engine in the 1840s, which was promoted by the Royal Agricultural Society, steam-powered machines could be used on small farms. One man could invest in a portable machine, and recoup the cost by hiring it out for <b>haymaking</b> and harvest; the only use for horses here was to move the machine from one place to another. [...] There were about 3.3million horses in late Victorian Britain. In 1900 about a million of these were working horses, but by 1914 this number had dropped to between 20,000 and 25,000.|$|E
500|$|Increasing {{contacts}} with England after the Union of 1707 {{led to a}} conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. [...] The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. <b>Haymaking</b> was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lime was put down to combat soil acidity, marshes were drained, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced.

2500|$|The {{highlights}} of [...] "winning the hay" [...] would be having tea and [...] "fadge" [...] in the meadows, or {{riding on the}} hay if it {{was brought to the}} hay shed. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s the square baler was introduced, which revolutionized <b>haymaking,</b> making it far less labour-intensive. The 1980s–90s saw the introduction {{in the area of the}} circular disk mower which was used to directly transfer freshly cut grass to a silage pit. This changing technology was reflected in sociological changes; hay making was now no longer such a communal activity.|$|E
2500|$|When {{sedentary}} agriculture {{developed in}} the region during the Bronze and Iron Ages, {{the slopes of the}} crests were again the favorite settlement sites, being easier to cultivate and above the floodplain. However, these wetlands were also used for <b>haymaking,</b> giving an important production of good quality. The hay was stocked in nearby barns and carried to the surrounding villages during the winter to feed the animals. Some of these barns are still visible near Torrösundet and atop Västerön. Woodlands were summer granting lands (transhumance) and some cabins (...) were constructed there in order to look after the animals during this time. Fifteen of these cabins are scattered in and around the park, mainly near Tinäset and south of Gysinge. Transhumance ceased {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, Margit met {{her future}} husband Asbjørn Sandemo (19171999) during the <b>haymaking</b> in the West Mountains of Vestre Slidre in Valdres. Asbjørn, a son of Ludvig Andersen (1879–1972) and Hulda Karlsson (1889–1956) came from Idd in Baleen and was a plumber by trade and a WWII veteran. By now, Margit's mother, Elsa Reuterskiöld, had ended her {{wandering}} life style and settled down in Valsberga in Södermanland. [...] Asbjörn and Margit first moved here also, mostly because they didn't have anywhere else to go. They married on 29 March 1946 in Strängnäs. There was seven children, but only three lived; [...] four others were born dead or miscarried. The three children are Henrik (b. 24 December 1945), Tove (b. 1949) and Bjørn (b. 1950). The family moved back to Huldrehaugen in Valdres in 1964. Now Margit Sandemo has seven grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren (2009). Eldest grandchild was born in 1969.|$|E

60|$|This {{time she}} made earlier inquiries, and was {{altogether}} more systematic in her proceedings. Moreover, {{the season was}} summer, between the <b>haymaking</b> and the harvest, and in the leisure thus afforded him {{her husband had been}} holiday-taking away from home.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you've {{got to get}} to the house. You needn't be in a {{tremendous}} hurry, because papa has only just come in from <b>haymaking.</b> They've got up the last load, and there has been the usual ceremony. Emily and I have been looking at them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{it is so}} {{sunny and}} beautiful,' said the bright young bride. 'See the {{sunshine}} on the green meadows, and the <b>haymaking.</b> Oh! I shall always love it.' John heard {{a great deal of}} happiness in those words. 'I never saw a cathedral before,' she added.|$|E

60|$|However, Tess became humanely beneficent {{towards the}} small ones, {{and to help}} them as much as {{possible}} she used, as soon as she left school, to lend a hand at <b>haymaking</b> or harvesting on neighbouring farms; or, by preference, at milking or butter-making processes, which she had learnt when her father had owned cows; and being deft-fingered {{it was a kind of}} work in which she excelled.|$|E
60|$|Bathsheba's {{return from}} a two months' visit to her old aunt at Norcombe afforded the impassioned and yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring {{directly}} after her--now possibly in the ninth month of her widowhood--and endeavouring to get a notion of her state of mind regarding him.
