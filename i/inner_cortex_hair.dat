40|$|Sorption {{isotherm}} {{experiments in}} the high RH range (80 - 100 %) were carried out at 1, 6. 5, 10. 5 and 18. 5 degreesC for different parts (<b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> outer cortex tissues and cuticle) of early and late picked 'Conference' pears after 1 and 6 months of {{storage in controlled atmosphere}} conditions. Experiments were implemented successfully with the pressure-controlled method, in which samples were submitted to an air-flow of very high velocity (similar to 10 m/s) for 48 h. The results showed no significant effect of picking date and storage period. The effect of temperature was evident in the RH range above 91 % for the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> tissue, but much less for the outer cortex tissue. The difference in sorption isotherms of different tissues is quite obvious. The cuticle showed a non-hygroscopic behaviour, while the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>cortex</b> tissues showed the opposite. The <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> tissue had a hi-her water holding capability than the outer cortex tissue, which indicates the more protective properties of the latter against temperature and relative humidity fluctuations during storage. The water content change versus water activity was also stronger in the case of <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> tissue. In an attempt to relate the moisture distribution (water content) to the water status (potential) in pears and, to understand water movement in fresh fruit, a detailed modelling of the cellular structural properties and of the intercellular space is a necessity.

40|$|Background. In {{hypertensive}} nephropathy the mor-phological {{changes and}} albuminuria seem {{to start in}} the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> but the mechanism of proteinuria is unknown. We tested the hypothesis of reduced glomer-ular charge selectivity in the juxtamedullary cortex of old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) {{as a cause of}} proteinuria in rats with hypertensive nephropathy. Methods. The glomerular charge barrier was evaluated in 80 -week-old SHR and age-matched normotensive Wistar–Kyoto rats (WKY) by measuring the glomer-ular clearance of radiolabelled cationic and anionic chymotrypsinogen (Chym and aChym, MW 25 000) accumulated by the proximal tubular cells in the outer, middle and <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> following intravenous injec-tion. The glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in the cortical zones were obtained by aprotinin (MW 6500) and the sieving coefficient (y) of the protein tracers calculated as their glomerular clearance/GFR. Results. The y aChym was similar in SHR and WKY except in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> where it was 35 % higher in SHR (0. 65 ± 0. 05) than in WKY (0. 48 ± 0. 03) (P 0. 01). The ratio of y aChym to y Chym was increased from 0. 55 ± 0. 06 to 0. 77 ± 0. 05 (P< 0. 02) in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> of SHR, whereas y Chym remained the same in all cortical zones. Finally, the percentage of glomeruli with adsorption droplets in podocytes quantified by light microscopy was higher in the inner than the outer cortex of SHR (P< 0. 05). Conclusions. The study supports the theory of a functioning glomerular charge barrier. An increased relative clearance of aChym in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> of SHR indicates impairment of the charge barrier, which, at least in part, could explain the increased protein excretion in SHR with hypertensive nephropathy...|$|R

This is a preliminary study for further investigations of stress influence on the expression of peroxidases in carrot root. In the central cylinder and <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> region peroxidase activity was localised in tracheary elements.

40|$|Partial {{ligation}} of the aorta {{between the}} renal arteries in the rat induces malignant hypertension, metaplasia of smooth-muscle cells of arterioles and arteries into juxtaglomerular cells, and a complex {{series of events}} in tubular cells {{at all levels of}} the ischemic kidney. The tubular cells of the outer cortex, particularly the proximal convoluted cells, show a very rapid and progressive simple atrophy. In contrast, necrosis of individual cells is followed by mitotic activity in atrophic tubular cells of the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex,</b> medulla, and papilla. Subsequently, polyploidy and hyperplasia occur in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> At the same time, hypertrophy of the protein-synthesizing apparatus and an increase in protein, DNA, and RNA, followed by a decrease in the protein content, are seen in the tubular cells of the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> In the medulla and papilla, necrosis of individual cells proceeds side by side with waves of mitotic activity. These events take place, albeit to a lesser degree, even in cases of very mild renal ischemia.

Proximal tubule cells produce dopamine after decarboxylation of L-DOPA via the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). The presence and cellular localization of AADC-like immunoreactivity (-LI) and AADC mRNA were examined during pre- and postnatal development in rat kidney by indirect immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Few scattered condensations of AADC-immunoreactive (-IR) tubule cells forming a lumen were detected on gestational day 18. From gestational day 21, many AADC-IR tubule cells were observed in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex,</b> whereas the outer cortex lacked AADC-LI. Within 24 hours of birth, AADC-IR cells in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> could be identified as proximal tubule cells. During day 3 and 5 there was an increase in number of AADC-IR proximal tubule cells in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex,</b> leaving less amount of AADC-negative cells in the outer cortex. Starting from day 8, AADC-IR cells could be seen in the outer cortex. An apparent decrease in AADC-immunofluorescence intensity was observed at 40 days, and at 80 days virtually no AADC-LI could be demonstrated. Intrarenal levels of dopamine showed a tendency to increase between 3 and 20 days, and showed significant decreases between 20 to 40 days and between 40 to 80 days. AADC mRNA was not detected in the kidney at 18 hours after birth, but could be observed in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> at 6 days. At 12, 19 and 40 days AADC mRNA was seen in the entire cortex.

Admittedly, the specimens were obtained in older women and, therefore, represent a later stage of the disease. The pathologist Hughesdon described the main features of disruption and disorganization of the cortical wall and loss of identity of the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> by smooth muscle cell metaplasia occurring in any of its layer in 86  % of the chocolate cysts. As a result, the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> may become quite unrecognizable by stretching and muscular metaplasia, and in addition, there is no cleavage plane.

40|$|Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that legumes can adjust rapidly the resistance of their root nodules to O 2 diffusion. Here we describe experiments using O 2 specific micro-electrodes and dark field microscopy to study directly the operation of this diffusion barrier. The O 2 concentration sensed by the electrode decreased sharply {{in the region of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> and was less than 1 0 mmol m ~ 3 throughout the infected tissue in nodules of both pea (Pisum sativum) and french bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). In a number of experiments the ambient O 2 concentration was increased to 40 % while the electrode tip was just inside the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> In 13 out of 21 cases the O 2 concentration at this position either remained low and unchanged or increased irreversibly to near ambient values. In the remaining cases the O 2 concentration increased after 1 to 2 - 5 min and then decreased to its former value. These results are ascribed to an increase in resistance of the barrier in response to increased O 2 flux into the nodule. It was shown microscopically that air spaces both at the boundary between the infected zone and the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex,</b> and within the infected zone started to disappear 3 min after nodules were exposed to high ambient O 2 concentrations and had disappeared completely after 8 min.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the structural remodeling in gap junctions associated with cholesterol redistribution during fiber cell maturation {{in the adult}} chicken lens. We also evaluated {{the hypothesis that the}} cleavage of the COOH-terminus of chick Cx 50 (formerly Cx 45. 6) during fiber cell maturation would affect the gap junction remodeling. Methods: Freeze-fracture TEM and filipin cytochemistry were applied to visualize structural remodeling of gap junction connexons associated with cholesterol redistribution during fiber cell maturation in adult leghorn chickens (42 - 62 weeks old). Freeze-fracture immunogold labeling (FRIL) was used to label the specific Cx 50 COOH-terminus antibody in various structural configurations of gap junctions. Results: Cortical fiber cells of the adult lenses contained three subtypes of cholesterol-containing gap junctions (i. e., cholesterol-rich, cholesterol-intermediate, and cholesterol-poor or-free) in both outer and inner cortical zones. Quantitative studies showed that approximately 81 % of gap junctions in the outer cortex were cholesterol-rich gap junctions whereas approximately 78 % of gap junctions in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> were cholesterol-free ones. Interestingly, all cholesterol-rich gap junctions in the outer cortex displayed loosely-packed connexons whereas cholesterol-free gap junctions in the deep zone exhibited tightly, hexagonal crystalline-arranged connexons. Also, while the percentage of membrane area specialized as gap junctions in the outer cortex was measured approximately 5 times higher than that of the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex,</b> the connexon density of the crystalline-packed gap junctions in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> was about 2 times highe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{utility of}} {{definitive}} radiotherapy (RT) for locoregionally advanced {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) of the larynx or hypopharynx {{in the setting of}} thyroid or cricoid cartilage invasion (TCCI) is controversial. A retrospective review of our experience was performed. Methods Our institutional database of patients with SCC {{of the head and neck}} treated with radiotherapy (90 % received concurrent systemic therapy) between 1995 and 2009 was queried. We identified 87 patients with T 3 - 4 laryngeal or T 4 hypopharyngeal cancer for whom initial head and neck imaging was available for review. Imaging of all patients was reviewed by a single radiologist specializing in neuroradiology. The presence and extent of TCCI was determined and used for stratification. Results Median follow-up was 34 months. TCCI was found in 25 (29 %) patients, eight limited to the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> and another 17 involving both cortices. Local control (LC) was not significantly affected by TCCI limited to the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> However, TCCI involving both cortices was correlated with diminished LC at 2 years compared to the group of patients with no or minor invasion (55 % vs. 81 %, p= 0. 045). However, TCCI involving both cortices was not associated with significantly reduced rates of survival with a functional larynx, or overall survival (OS). Conclusions Our results suggest that the rate of LC of T 3 - 4 laryngeal or T 4 hypopharyngeal SCC treated with definitive RT is not affected by TCCI of the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> Although decreased LC was significantly associated with TCCI involving both cortices, this factor did not appear to result in reduced rates of survival with a functional larynx or OS.

Spontaneously hypertensive rats 4 weeks of age were divided into three groups: nontreated, captopril (40 mg/kg/day) -treated, and trichlormethlazide (1 mg/kg/day) with hydralazine (20 mg/kg/day) -treated. Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. At 6 weeks old, the captopril-treated rats showed a lower blood pressure and a larger afferent arteriolar diameter compared with the control rats. At 20 weeks old, the nontreated group exhibited hypertension and a lower arteriolar diameter ratio (afferent to efferent, 0. 89 versus 1. 22 in control group) because of afferent constriction and efferent dilatation, seen equally in the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>cortexes.</b> Glomeruiosderosis was accentuated only in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> of the nontreated group (score, 63 versus 29 in control group).

The typically acataphyllous P. californicum of western North America is controversial because recent phylogenetic work has nested it in the southern cataphyllous clade. Seedling establishment, stem anatomy, and endophytic system structure of this species were studied. Seedling haustorial holdfasts have gland cavities, structures considered absent in the Viscaceae clade of Santalales. The stem epidermis has a thick cuticle, deeply sunken stomata, and branched multicellular trichomes. The stem has an outer cortex of palisade chlorenchyma and an <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> of large isodiametric parenchyma cells. The boundary area between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> contains druses and an unusual ring of small xylic bundles lacking protoxylem fibers and phloem. Sinkers are of two types: uniseriate, with only parenchyma that often has thick-walled transfer cells at its interface with vessels of the host; and multiseriate, with parenchyma and vessel elements that often are in direct contact and share simple perforation plates with vessels of the host. Sinker morphology is also dimorphic in the cataphyllous P. fragile but only unimorphic (multiseriate) in the acataphyllous P. juniperinum and P. serotinum. The dimorphic sinker system of P. californicum may be functionally partitioned, whereas these functions are combined in the unimorphic sinkers of other acataphyllous species.

In order {{to test whether}} acid phosphatase {{is involved in the}} phosphorus use efficiency for N 2 fixation an in situ RT-PCR technology was applied to common bean nodules. The recombinant line 115 of Phaseolus vulgaris, obtained from a cross between BAT 477 and DOR 364, was inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 and grown in hydroponic cultures for 5 weeks under P deficiency. The in situ RT-PCR was carried out with 50 µm nodule sections using specific primers to amplify a 250 bp sequence in the acid phosphatase mRNA. The amplified gene product was visualized with fluorescence microscopy using the ELF- 97 kit which allowed detection of the alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments. The signal corresponding to acid phosphatase could clearly be observed except in samples without RT (control). Transcripts were distributed specifically in: i) non infected cells of the infected zone; ii) the vascular trace localised in the cortex surrounding the infected zone; iii) the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> (i. e. cell-layers localised between the vascular trace and the infected zone); iv) the external cortex (i. e. layers beyond the endodermis).

40|$|Abstract: The microvasculature of rabbit ovaries, {{with special}} {{regard to the}} interstitial-stromal tissue, was studied by {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) of vascular corrosion casts. The casting medium (Mercox) was injected in normal animals and in animals in which ovulation was induced by 100 l. U. of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) i. v. Vascular baskets of different size and architecture related to follicles in various developmental stages were observed in the ovarian cortex. Small (primary) follicles showed thin and thready capillaries. Larger (secondary and antral) follicles showed a progressive increase in number, size and tortuosity of round-meshed capillaries, related to adaptation of the growing follicle to the approaching ovulation. Capillary sprouts, due to the enhanced angiogenesis of growing follicles, were seen. These aspects were more evident in ovulatory follicles. In addition, numerous resin leakages, due to the increased permeability of the sinusoidal net, were seen in the cavities of ovulatory follicles. Interstitial-stromal tissue capillaries were diffusely distributed in the cortex among the follicular baskets. Their morphology remained unchanged after hCG stimulus. In {{the periphery of the}} cortex, the microvascular net showed large (79 - 90 -mu-m) irregularly rounded meshes, with thin, thready capillaries often anastomosed with those of primary follicles. <b>Inner</b> <b>cortex</b> capillaries were thin, thready and arranged in polygonal meshes of 40 - 70 -mu-m.

We conclude that the colour differences between the leaf bases have a chemical basis that can be linked to environmental changes: tannin cells to phenological effects, and naphthalene-derivatives in the vascular core to the passage of fire...|$|R
40|$|Wool fibers are {{composed}} of cuticle and cortex cells, which are of obvious differences in many properties. The development of methods to isolate the two kinds of cells can provide platform to elucidate the roles they play in the characteristics of wool fibers. Here we demonstrate the cuticle can be completely and rapidly removed from the wool fibers {{by the use of}} ionic liquids, with <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> intact. Confocal microscope, SEM and FTIR have been applied to study the wool fibers after cuticle removal. In contrast to the traditional/long physical or chemical separation routes (> 14 h), our method is very rapid (< 1 h). This work demonstrates the ability of ionic liquid as a novel, rapid and efficient media for cuticle/ cortex isolation...|$|R
40|$|Plant hormones, {{especially}} auxin, cytokinin, and ethylene, {{have long}} been implicated in nodule development. In addition, plant hormones {{have been shown to}} have increased concentrations in mycorrhizal associations. We show that the early nodulin (ENOD) genes can be used as indicators for the status of endogenous hormones in symbiotic root tissues. Transcripts for ENOD 2 and ENOD 40 genes are shown to accumulate in uninoculated, cytokinin-treated alfalfa roots, even in roots of the non-nodulating alfalfa mutant MN 1008, which is unresponsive to Rhizobium meliloti inoculation and to Nod factor treatment. Transcripts for these ENOD genes also accumulate in mycorrhizal roots of alfalfa. A model describing the involvement of cytokinin and auxin in stimulating cell divisions in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> which leads to nodule formation is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} DNA, RNA, and protein {{synthesis}} during lateral root initiation in Marsilea quadrifolia L. was monitored by autoradiography of incorporated of 3 H-thymidine, 3 H-uridine, and 3 H-leucine, respectively. DNA synthesis {{was associated with}} the enlargement of the lateral root initial prior to its division. Consistent with histological studies, derivatives of the lateral root initial as well as the cells of the adjacent <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> and pericycle of the parent root also continued to synthesize DNA. RNA and protein synthetic activities were found to be higher in the lateral root initials than in the endodermal initials of the same longitudinal layer. The data suggest a role for nucleic acid and protein synthesis during cytodifferentiation of a potential endodermal cell into a lateral root initial...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to compatible rhizobia, leguminous plants develop unique plant organs, root nodules, in which rhizobia fix nitrogen into ammonia. During nodule invasion, the rhizobia {{gain access to}} newly divided cells, the nodule primordia, in the root <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> through plant-derived cellulose tubes called infection threads. Infection threads begin in curled root hairs and bring rhizobia into the root crossing several cell layers in the process. Ultimately the rhizobia are deposited within nodule primordium cells through a process resembling endocytosis. Plant host mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of the invasion process are not understood. To identify and clone plant genes required for nodule invasion, recent efforts have focused on Medicago truncatula. In a collaborative effort the nodulation defect in the lin (lumpy infections) mutant was characterized. From an EMS-mutagenized population of M. truncatula, two non-allelic mutants nip (numerous infections with polyphenolics) and sli (sluggish infections) were identified with defects in nodule invasion. Infection threads were found to proliferate abnormally in the nip mutant nodules with only very rare deposition of rhizobia within plant host cells. nip nodules were found to accumulate polyphenolic compounds, indicative of a host defense response. Interestingly, nip was also found to have defective lateral root elongation suggesting that NIP has a role in both nodule and lateral root development. NIP was found to map at the upper arm of chromosome 1. In sli, infection threads were observed to bring rhizobia from infection threads to newly divided nodule primordium cells in the roots <b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> Polyphenolic accumulation in sli nodule/bumps was found. Lateral roots in sli {{were found to be}} clustered {{at the top of the}} root, indicating that sli like nip may be defective in lateral root development...|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} type of development, much of the stem’s volume is also parenchyma, and only one {{mucilage}} canal is present, located {{in the center of the}} pith (Fig.  2 e). Approximately ten medullary vascular bundles and a sclerenchymatous ring are in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex,</b> and all the cortical vascular bundles apparently develop. Both medullary vascular bundles and cortical vascular bundles continue to grow (Fig.  2 f), and a ring of sclerenchyma gradually forms (Fig.  2 g). Then, the growth of medullary vascular bundles becomes minimal, while the peripheral vascular bundles continuously grow from a fascicular cambium. The medullary vascular bundles scarcely change while the peripheral vascular bundles soon exceed the medullary vascular bundles (Fig.  2 h), wide rays fully develop, and the sclerenchymatous ring remains continuous. The species P. kadsura belongs to this type.|$|R
40|$|Adrenals {{express a}} high level of neutral cholesteryl ester {{hydrolase}} (CEH) activity, and male rats have greater activity than females; however, the identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for this activity and the basis for the sex differences are unknown. Using mice in which hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was inactivated by homologous recombination (HSL �/�), neutral CEH activity was reduced more than 98 % compared with controls. Female HSL �/ � mice showed a reduction in stimulated corticosterone values. Mechanical separation of rat adrenals revealed less HSL in the outer than the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex.</b> Examination of subfractions of rat adrenals showed that immunoreactive HSL was prominently expressed MOST CELLS, INCLUDING adipose tissue, adrenals, ovaries, testes, and placenta, have been shown to possess a neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) (1 – 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{with the}} electron microprobe {{reveal that the}} movements of Samanea leaflets are correlated with massive redistribution of K within the pulvinus. Evidence is now presented that Cl moves with K, whether plants are in white light or darkness, {{whether or not the}} amplitude of free running oscillations has damped, and whether or not the rhythm has been rephased by phytochrome photoconversion. The mid-extensor to mid-flexor ratio of K + Cl is correlated with leaflet angle under all conditions. Total Cl in both <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> and motor region is approximately 0. 6 as high as K. The stoichiometry between Cl and the migratory fraction of K is close to, but not precisely 1 : 1 in all regions of the pulvinus, suggesting that other ions or systems may also be involved in the balancing of electrical charges...|$|R
40|$|Podaxis africana De Villiers, Eicker & van der Westhuizen and P. rugospora De Villiers, Eicker & van der Westhuizen, two {{new species}} from Transvaal are {{described}} and illustrated. A new section, Umbricorticalis De Villiers, Eicker & van der Westhuizen is {{proposed in the}} genus Podaxis to accommodate P. africana. Morphologically P. africana resembles P. microporus McKnight but it is distinguished by its large globose, subglobose to broadly ovoid spores, {{the absence of a}} ‘pin prick’ pore structure, the black gleba, and the deep orange to strong brown <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> of the stipe. P. rugospora is allied to P. pistillaris (L. ex Pers.) Fr. emend. Morse from which it differs by reason of the hyaline, narrow, flattened, occasionally septate capillitium threads and the grayish-olive, light olive or light to moderate yellowish-brown gleba. The most remarkable character of these new species is the rugose spores...|$|R
40|$|In pea (Pisum sativum) up to 50 {{nodulation}} mutants are known, {{several of}} which are affected in the early steps of the symbiotic interaction with Rhizobium sp. bacteria. Here we describe {{the role of the}} sym 2 gene in nodulation (Nod) factor perception. Our experiments show that the sym 2 A allele from the wild pea variety Afghanistan confers an arrest in infection-thread growth if the Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae strain does not produce Nod factors with a NodX-mediated acetylation at their reducing end. Since the induction of the early nodulin gene ENOD 12 in the epidermis and the formation of a nodule primordium in the <b>inner</b> <b>cortex</b> were not affected, we conclude that more than one Nod factor-perception mechanism is active. Furthermore, we show that sym 2 A-mediated control of infection-thread growth was affected by the bacterial nodulation gene nodO...|$|R
