40|$|BACKGROUND: Akpan is a {{traditional}} ready-to-drink fermented yoghurt-like cereal beverage consumed in {{urban and rural areas}} in Benin. With the aim of adapting the product to new local and export markets, this work maps African and <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> preferences for different types of Akpan. RESULTS: A sensory profile of Akpan was created and consumer tests were conducted with 103 consumers of African origin and 74 <b>consumers</b> of <b>European</b> origin. <b>Consumer</b> acceptance was significantly correlated with fermented odour (r=− 0. 94) and milky taste (r = 0. 92 – 0. 97) attributes. Cluster analysis revealed different behaviour by African and <b>European</b> <b>consumers</b> with respect to acceptability of Akpan; <b>European</b> <b>consumers</b> did not like the sour taste and African consumers liked an intense sweet milky taste. CONCLUSION: This study provides information on how Akpan, and other fermented yoghurt-type cereal products, could be adapted to African and <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> preferences...|$|R

40|$|Price {{comparison}} {{is a basic}} element of competition. For comparison to work, at least prices need to be transparent. Moreover, price is usually a focal point in consumer thinking and deciding on transactions. Hence, obfuscating prices can be detrimental to consumers. Therefore, it is vital for policymakers to know how transparent pricing is in reality. Commercial practices involving price intransparency can be detrimental to consumer decision making and {{may be associated with}} market failure. So, legislative intervention to ensure price transparency is sometimes warranted. Suppliers may disclose and frame pricing information in such ways as to influence consumers. For some suppliers, advantages may be gained by obfuscating price-through practices ranging from the outright hiding of price terms in the small print to subtle ways of throwing in gifts or adding charges during the vending process. Do consumers appreciate the implications of the fact that by framing price in different ways suppliers actually try to influence their demand for products? And how does the law broadly speaking respond to problems of price intransparency? In this article, behavioural science insights are combined with a legal analysis of <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> law in order to chart some of the detrimental influences of price intransparency on the consumer decision-making process and to answer whether and to what extent <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> law addresses these issues. In doing so, this article first reviews research from consumer psychology, marketing, and behavioural law, and economics regarding the influence of presentation, framing, and transparency of price on the consumer decision-making process. Subsequently, it describes and evaluates the legal framework offered by <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> law and how this framework responds to practices of price intransparency. Particular problematic pricing techniques are identified and discussed. In conclusion, attention is drawn to the disadvantages of the increasing full harmonization character of <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> law for combating price intransparency at Member State level...|$|R
