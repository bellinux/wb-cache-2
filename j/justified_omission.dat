40|$|AbstractThe study {{examined}} university students’ plagiarism in completing written assignments. The specific aspects studied were frequency of citation and help-seeking strategies, attitudes towards penalties for plagiarism and rationalisations for omission of citations. Questionnaires were distributed {{at the beginning}} and end of an Academic Reading and Writing course at a Malaysian public university. The analysis of 169 pre- and 126 post-questionnaires indicate that after formal instruction on citation conventions, self-reports of appropriate citation and help-seeking strategies for assignment completion increased. There were no significant changes in self-reports of unethical help-seeking strategies but the respondents reported significantly less use of some unethical citation strategies. Surprisingly, at the end of the semester, fewer students agreed that students caught for plagiarism should fail the assignment, possibly due to heightened awareness of their own assignment completion strategies which run into plagiarism. In the post-questionnaire, fewer respondents <b>justified</b> <b>omission</b> of citations on the grounds of lack of knowledge and non-deduction of marks for omitting citations in assignments. With an increase in appropriate assignment completion strategies and a concomitant decrease in inappropriate strategies, there is a lessened need to resolve the cognitive dissonance arising from inconsistency between maintaining a moral self-image and committing academic misconduct...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study {{attitudes in}} the Danish {{population}} towards treatment of severely handicapped and extremely preterm infants and to define areas of consensus and controversy. DESIGN: Mail-delivered questionnaire. SETTING: Denmark. Survey sample [...] A {{random sample of}} 1080 persons aged from 18 to 45 years. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 68 %. There was strong consensus (more than 75 % agreement) that life-prolonging treatment should be provided for an infant born after 24 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress and, for an infant with myelomeningocele, when the parents were in favour of treatment. Further, there was almost uniform agreement that not all infants should be treated no matter how serious the condition. Major controversies concerned the severity of a condition needed to <b>justify</b> <b>omission</b> of life-prolonging treatment, the role of parental attitude and the options in non-treatment cases. Forty-six per cent thought {{it ought to be}} legal to kill the infant in at least some of these cases. CONCLUSION: Although the study revealed wide divergences of opinion with regard to questions about limits of treatment and about end-of-life decisions it also showed that there was general acceptance both that life-prolonging treatment ought to be provided even in relatively severe cases if this was in accordance with parental wishes, and that life should not be saved at all costs...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: In the {{randomized}} phase III trial, Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol 240, {{the incorporation}} of bevacizumab with chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival (OS) in women with advanced cervical cancer. A major objective of GOG- 240 was to prospectively analyze previously identified pooled clinical prognostic factors known as the Moore criteria. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Potential negative factors included black race, performance status 1, pelvic disease, prior cisplatin, and progression-free interval < 365 days. Risk categories included low-risk (0 - 1 factor), mid-risk (2 - 3 factors), and high-risk (4 - 5 factors). Each test of association was conducted at the 5 % level of significance. Logistic regression and survival {{analysis was used to}} determine whether factors were prognostic or could be used to guide therapy. RESULTS: For the entire population (n = 452), high-risk patients had significantly worse OS (P < 0. 0001). The HRs of death for treating with topotecan in low-risk, mid-risk, and high-risk subsets are 1. 18 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 63 - 2. 24], 1. 11 (95 % CI, 0. 82 - 1. 5), and 0. 84 (95 % CI, 0. 50 - 1. 42), respectively. The HRs of death for treating with bevacizumab in low-risk, mid-risk, and high-risk subsets are 0. 96 (95 % CI, 0. 51 - 1. 83; P = 0. 9087), 0. 673 (95 % CI, 0. 5 - 0. 91; P = 0. 0094), and 0. 536 (95 % CI, 0. 32 - 0. 905; P = 0. 0196), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospectively validated scoring system in cervical cancer. The Moore criteria have real-world clinical applicability. Toxicity concerns may <b>justify</b> <b>omission</b> of bevacizumab in some low-risk patients where survival benefit is small. The benefit to receiving bevacizumab appears to be greatest in the moderate- and high-risk subgroups (5. 8 -month increase in median OS) ...|$|R
50|$|On 18 January 2012, the Federal Railway Authority {{asked the}} Tübingen region {{to conduct an}} {{additional}} consultation process on further changes to the plans. These changes include {{the elimination of the}} originally planned fifth platform in the station, the elimination of Ulm Ost station and modifications to soundproofing and waste water technology. Deutsche Bahn <b>justified</b> the <b>omission</b> of the fifth platform with operational improvements {{as a result of the}} concentration of all train parking in a new vehicle maintenance facility and sidings. The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure doubted whether the platform could actually be eliminated if long-term service improvements (including the planned Danube-Iller Regional S-Bahn) are to be implemented. A critic sees the S-Bahn concept compromised if the fifth platform is not provided from the outset. If a fifth platform is actually necessary, according to the DB, funding would have to be provided for separately. The DB is not aware of formal plans for an S-Bahn.|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{prediction}} of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in esophageal cancer (EC) patients {{is important in}} a more personalized treatment. The current best clinical method to predict pathologic complete response is SUVmax in F- 18 -FDG PET/ CT imaging. To improve the {{prediction of}} response, we constructed a model to predict complete response to nCRT in EC based on pretreatment clinical parameters and F- 18 -FDG PET/CT-derived textural features. Methods: From a prospectively maintained single institution database, we reviewed 97 consecutive patients with locally advanced EC and a pretreatment F- 18 -FDG PET/CT scan between 2009 and 2015. All patients were treated with nCRT (carboplatin/paclitaxe 1 / 41. 4 Gy) followed by esophagectomy. We analyzed clinical, geometric, and pretreatment textural features extracted from both F- 18 -FDG PET and CT. The current most accurate prediction model with SUVmax as a predictor variable was compared with 6 different response prediction models constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized logistic regression. Internal validation was performed to estimate the model's performances. Pathologic response was defined as complete versus incomplete response (Mandard tumor regression grade system 1 vs. 2 - 5). Results: Pathologic examination revealed 19 (19. 6 %) complete and 78 (80. 4 %) incomplete responders. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization selected the clinical parameters: histologic type and clinical T stage, the 18 F-FDG PET-derived textural feature long run low gray level emphasis, and the CT-derived textural feature run percentage. Introducing these variables to a logistic regression analysis showed areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0. 78 compared with 0. 58 in the SUVmax model. The discrimination slopes were 0. 17 compared with 0. 01, respectively. After internal validation, the AUCs decreased to 0. 74 and 0. 54, respectively. Conclusion: The predictive values of the constructed models were superior to the standard method (SUVmax). These results {{can be considered as}} an initial step in predicting tumor re sponse to nCRT in locally advanced EC. Further research in refining the predictive value of these models is needed to <b>justify</b> <b>omission</b> of surgery...|$|R
40|$|Attitude {{controllers}} for spacecraft {{have been}} {{based on the assumption that}} the bodies being controlled are rigid. Future spacecraft, however, may be quite flexible. Many applications require spinning up/down these vehicles. In this work the minimum time control of these maneuvers is considered. The time-optimal control is shown to possess an important symmetry property. Taking advantage of this property, the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are transformed into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations in the control switching times during one half of the maneuver, the maneuver time, and the costates at the mid-maneuver time. These equations can be solved using a homotopy approach. Control spillover measures are introduced and upper bounds on these measures are obtained. For a special case these upper bounds can be expressed in closed form for an infinite dimensional evaluation model. Rotational stiffening effects are ignored in the optimal control analysis. Based on a heuristic argument a simple condition is given which <b>justifies</b> the <b>omission</b> of these nonlinear effects. This condition is validated by numerical simulation...|$|R

Rasch analysis revealed that use of a single sum score (number of suggestions passed) to express hypnotic ability is not sufficiently <b>justified.</b> However, the <b>omission</b> of the mosquito-hallucination and anosmia items (Items 3 and 9) rendered this short 10 -item form of the SHSS:C sufficiently compatible with requirements of one-dimensionality, local stochastic independence, and equi-discriminability.

30|$|Sumsion et al. (2009) {{has invited}} the early {{childhood}} field to engage in ‘critical analysis and debate about directions for its future development’ (p. 11). As the arena of infant-toddler research remains under-represented in {{the early childhood}} field (Berthelsen, 2010), further research is necessary to provide much needed information about how educators could make infants and toddlers ‘visible’ in the EYLF. As Goouch and Powell (2013) argue ‘what is not said in a policy {{may be just as}} important as or even more important and illuminating than what is included’ (p. 114) and the silence in relation to infants and toddlers in the EYLF is an important finding. While <b>justifying</b> their <b>omission</b> of the terms ‘infants’ and ‘toddlers’ the authors concede that this could be a ‘point of tension’ that educators face when using the document (Sumsion et al. 2009). This research has confirmed that such omissions were indeed a ‘point of tension’ for their reported interpretation and practice. This silence may relegate infants and toddlers to a place of irrelevance and this has implications for practice. We argue that Australia should follow other countries such as England, Scotland and New Zealand and provide a curriculum document that is relevant for infants, toddlers and their teachers.|$|R
50|$|Villard {{entered a}} Gymnasium (equivalent of a United States high school) in Zweibrücken in 1848, {{which he had}} to leave because he sympathized with the {{revolutions}} of 1848 in Germany. He had broken up a class by refusing to mention the King of Bavaria in a prayer, <b>justifying</b> his <b>omission</b> by citing his loyalty to the provisional government. Another time, after watching a session of the Frankfurt Parliament, he came home in a Hecker hat with a red feather in it. Two of his uncles were strongly in sympathy with the revolution, but his father was a conservative, and disciplined him by sending the boy to continue his education at the French semi-military academy in Phalsbourg (1849-50).Originally his punishment was to be apprenticed, but his father compromised on the military school. Villard showed up for classes a month early so he could be tutored in the French language beforehand by the novelist Alexandre Chatrian. He later attended the Gymnasium of Speyer in 1850-52, and the universities of Munich and Würzburg in 1852-53. In Munich {{he was a member of}} the student fraternity Corps Franconia. In 1853, having had a disagreement with his father, he emigrated—without his parents' knowledge—to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|However, as {{his review}} of {{historical}} genocide ignited a political debate, Ruhashyankiko took the conservative line {{that it was impossible}} to draw up an exhaustive list and that attempting to do so could reignite old quarrels and be unacceptable to all of the member states of the United Nations. This drew the criticism of one member of the Sub-Commission who complained that [...] "genocide of the Palestinians" [...] had been omitted. But most of the criticism was for a change Ruhashyankiko made between the first draft and the final version of the report. The first draft had cited the Armenian genocide, but that reference was deleted from the final version due to pressure from Turkey, an omission that was supported by only one member. Ruhashyankiko <b>justified</b> his <b>omission</b> of the Armenian genocide and the inclusion of the Jewish genocide by explaining that the Holocaust was universally recognised while the Armenian genocide was not. In the end the Sub-Commission sent the report with some amendments resulting from the debate within the Sub-Commission to the (UNCHR) with a recommendation that it should be widely distributed.

Following its adoption of fair value accounting, UES reported the highest quarterly profit in world corporate history, but it subsequently omitted dividends for all its shareholders. The case analysis suggests that the transitory nature of fair value adjustments and the interaction with the investment policy were important considerations in <b>justifying</b> the dividend <b>omission.</b> The reduction in preferred dividends was not offset by any capital gains, {{and led to a}} wealth transfer from preferred to ordinary shareholders.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{diagnostic}} {{performance of the}} ImmunoCyt test in patients in follow-up for superficial urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) of the bladder. METHODS: Voided urine samples were collected from all included patients. Samples were processed with the ImmunoCyt test. The ImmunoCyt slides were scored under a fluorescence microscope by 3 observers. The ImmunoCyt test was considered positive if one or more observers scored the test positive. Urethrocystoscopy (and additional histologic examination {{in the case of}} suspicious cystoscopic findings) was used as the reference standard. To investigate the validity of ImmunoCyt, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and diagnostic odds ratios were determined. To investigate the reproducibility of ImmunoCyt, kappa values (measure of agreement) were computed. The observers' findings were analyzed in pairs. RESULTS: One hundred four patients in follow-up after primary superficial UCC of the bladder were included. Samples of 18 patients had to be excluded because of low cellularity (ie, insufficient assessable urothelial cells). Tumor recurrence was found in 22 of the remaining 86 patients (17 pTa, 3 pT 1, 1 carcinoma in situ, 1 pT 2 or higher). The test had a sensitivity of 50 %, specificity of 73 %, positive predictive value of 39 %, and negative predictive value of 81 %. The diagnostic odds ratio was 2. 8 (95 % confidence interval 1. 0 to 7. 5). The area under the curve for the different observers varied between 0. 54 and 0. 60. The kappa values were low (0. 05 to 0. 45), representing high interobserver variability. CONCLUSIONS: The promising results from other studies could not be confirmed in this specific group of patients in follow-up for superficial UCC of the bladder. The validity of ImmunoCyt was insufficient to <b>justify</b> the <b>omission</b> of cystoscopy in patients in follow-up for superficial UCC...|$|R
40|$|Frege who stated {{its main}} aim, i. e. the {{investigation}} of the foundations of mathematics, and developed its main tool, i. e. mathematical logic. For Frege, however, {{the investigation of}} the foundations of mathematics was only a means to justify the certainty of mathematics. In view of this, the basic aim of philosophy of mathematics is more adequately described as a search for certainty. That explains the title of Giaquinto’s book, which is an examination of how the search for certainty was carried out within the philosophy of mathematics from the late nineteenth to roughly the mid-twentieth century. More specifically, Giaquinto’s book is a philosophical examination. It is not a history, although it manages to convey some sense of the unfolding story, nor is it a text in mathematical logic, although it includes expositions of some basic results in mathematical logic and of some aspects of their proofs. The period covered by Giaquinto’s book is the golden age in the philosophy of mathematics. The main figures considered are Frege, Russell, Ramsey, Zermelo, Hilbert.

40|$|Citation of the New Testament by the Church Fathers is a {{valuable}} resource in reconstructing {{the early history of}} its text, for the time and place each was writing is known. The Society for Biblical Literature has undertaken a series of studies of the Fathers who wrote in Greek in order to make available this resource and to examine in detail what light it sheds on textual development. Among these, the fourth-century Cappadocian father Gregory of Nazianzus was a prolific writer whose work is largely extant; he made extensive and virtuoso use of Scripture in his orations, poetry and other writings. In this study, Gregory's life and works are outlined; the use he makes of NT citation is described and evaluated from a text-critical perspective; the particular difficulties this entails are discussed; and the sources and method used to identify citation laid out in chapters One to Three. This study aims to retrieve all his references to the Gospels, to match them to their NT source where this can be determined, and to present them with critical apparatus as either citations, adaptations or allusions. Chapters Four to Seven list these references to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. An evaluation of their contribution to our understanding of NT textual development completes the study. Earlier work in the series has attempted to locate the text used by individual Fathers within the main strands of textual tradition by calculating proportional agreement with a carefully selected representative number of manuscripts. These attempts have had mixed results; in this study the small number of uniquely-derived verbatim citations in Gregory's work, the insurmountable difficulties of transmission and definition, and the great loss of material if rigorous criteria for inclusion are applied, <b>justify</b> the <b>omission</b> of this analysis. Instead a more qualitative approach has sought to do justice to the special strengths of Gregory as a witness to the Gospel textual tradition...|$|R

40|$|The {{chapters}} {{in this section}} of the monograph deal with the basic raw material of solar variability, namely the measure-ments themselves. With complete characterization of the spectral components of the irradiance, one might imagine an easy task in putting them all together to determine the energy flux from the Sun. As the length and depth of these chapters shows, however, the simple characterization of a spectral irradiance at the accuracies permitted by the avail-able technology already becomes a sophisticated business. The scope of the problem becomes apparent when one re-alizes that the observed bolometric variability of the total irradiance does not exceed fractions of a percent, and has well-measured components with amplitudes below one part per million (Fröhlich) ! The introductory chapter of this session (Kuhn and Arm-strong) deals with mechanisms; the subsequent chapters continue with reviews of the total-irradiance observations (Frölhich), the ultraviolet (Rottman, Floyd, and Viereck), the extreme ultraviolet (Woods and 13 co-authors). The knowl-edge thus obtained needs a synthesis for further research into causes and effects, and Thuillier et al. discuss the current best such synthesis.
