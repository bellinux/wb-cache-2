25|$|In the United States, the League of American Bicyclists Smart Cycling 101/201 courses, {{based on}} the Effective Cycling program, has modules aimed at all ages from {{children}} to adult beginners to more experienced adults.

Cycle training may also be offered in an attempt to overcome cultural unfamiliarity with cycling or perceived cultural obstacles to bicycle use. In the Netherlands, some cycle training courses are targeted at women from immigrant communities, as a means of overcoming such obstacles to cycling by women from developing countries.|$|E
25|$|During {{his college}} years, La Luz became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Students</b> for a Democratic Society, speaking out {{on issues such}} as the war in Vietnam. He also became involved with local Puerto Rican Farm Workers organizations in the Tobacco Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts. La Luz was one of the key community organizers to secure new rights for migrant workers in the area by putting public pressure on the Labor Department of Puerto Rico and denouncing the deplorable conditions that the migrant workers were working under. He also helped merge the local farm workers with Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers of America. La Luz credits César Chávez and Martin Luther King, Jr. as being his greatest influences in understanding the importance of justice and dignity in the quest for civil and human rights.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 1825, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives met {{to review}} the {{proposed}} charter. The charter was referred to the Committee on Education as Bill Number 12, who intensely debated the bill. After much deliberation, the bill {{was passed by the}} House one month later on January 6, 1826 with three provisions made that limited the power of the college, allowed those practicing any religion {{to be associated with the}} college, and allowed legislature to revoke the charter if deemed necessary. The bill was proposed to the Pennsylvania Senate on January 16, 1826 and again faced opposition. Some senators opposed the teaching of military science, believing it would inspire a war-like attitude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> After two months of discussion, the charter was approved by the Senate on March 7, 1829. Two days later, Governor of Pennsylvania J. Andrew Shulze approved the charter, and Lafayette College came into legal existence.|$|E

25|$|In Bogotá, Galán {{attended}} {{middle school}} in the Colegio Americano in 1950. While a student there and only 8 years old, he joined a rally against Conservative president Laureano Gómez and intended to support the Liberal guerrillas. Two years later he was transferred to another school, the Colegio Antonio Nariño. When {{he was only a}} 14-year-old, Galán participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> protests of 1957 against the dictatorial regime of Gustavo Rojas getting arrested and spending the night in a jail despite his age. In 1960 Galán graduated from High School with honors and began studies of law and economics in the Pontifical Xavierian University in Bogotá, it was then that his liberal radicalism cooled off. While a student in 1963, Galán founded Vértice, a university focused magazine to express his Liberal tendencies in a university that was predominantly Conservative and also became his first experience with journalism. He was able to meet prominent Colombian leaders like former Liberal president Carlos Lleras (who delighted with Galán's work, decided to write articles for Vértice Magazine) and Colombia's main circulation newspaper El Tiempo owner and also former Liberal president of Colombia Eduardo Santos during an interview in which Santos was impressed by Galán's journalist qualities. In 1965 after graduating this same year, he started working for the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo.|$|E

60|$|The best Chinese educationists {{are aware}} of this, and have {{established}} schools and universities which are modern but under Chinese direction. In these, a certain proportion of the teachers are European or American, but {{the spirit of the}} teaching is not that of the Y.M.C.A. One can never rid oneself of the feeling that the education controlled by white men is not disinterested; it seems always designed, unconsciously in the main, to produce convenient tools for the capitalist penetration of China by the merchants and manufacturers of the nation concerned. Modern Chinese schools and universities are singularly different: they are not hotbeds of rabid nationalism as they would be in any other country, but institutions where the student is taught to think freely, and his thoughts are judged by their intelligence, not by their utility to exploiters. The outcome, among the best young men, is a really beautiful intellectual disinterestedness. The discussions which I used to have in my seminar (consisting of students belonging to the Peking Government University) could not have been surpassed anywhere for keenness, candour, and fearlessness. I had the same impression of the Science Society of Nanking, and of all similar bodies wherever I came across them. There is, among the young, a passionate desire to acquire Western knowledge, together with a vivid realization of Western vices. They wish to be scientific but not mechanical, industrial but not capitalistic. To a man they are Socialists, as are most of the best among their Chinese teachers. They respect the knowledge of Europeans, but quietly put aside their arrogance. For the present, the purely Chinese modern educational institutions, such as the Peking Government University, leave much to be desired {{from the point of view}} of instruction; there are no adequate libraries, the teaching of English is not sufficiently thorough, and there is not enough mental discipline. But these are the faults of youth, and are unimportant compared with the profoundly humanistic attitude to life which is formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> Most of the faults may be traced to the lack of funds, because the Government--loved by the Powers on account of its weakness--has to part with all its funds to the military chieftains who fight each other and plunder the country, as in Europe--for China must be compared with Europe, not with any one of the petty States into which Europe is unhappily divided.|$|E
