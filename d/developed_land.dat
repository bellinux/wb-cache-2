5|$|Harveys Lake (also {{known as}} Harvey Lake or Harvey's Lake) {{is a natural}} lake in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. It has a surface area of {{approximately}} 621.5 acres, or nearly a square mile. The lake is situated entirely within the borough of Harveys Lake.

There is also agricultural land, especially in the northwestern and southern parts of {{the watershed}} and small areas of <b>developed</b> <b>land</b> in the watershed's southern section. 64.5 {{percent of the land}} in the watershed upstream of Eyers Grove is forested land and 34.7 percent is agricultural land. 0.7 percent of the land is developed and the remaining 0.2 percent has other uses.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on <b>developed</b> <b>land,</b> and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space. Of the remaining land, most of it is considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000. In general, the topography of the watershed consists of rolling land that is densely settled. A large undeveloped tract of land owned by the Delaware County Industrial Development Authority is located {{at the mouth of the}} creek.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the <b>developed</b> <b>land,</b> turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species.

5|$|Land uses in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Brook include forested land, agricultural land, and <b>developed</b> <b>land</b> such as high-density residential land and downtown commercial land. Abandoned mine land also occurs in {{the watershed}} and wetlands occur in some areas. Major roads in the stream's drainage basin include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. Mills and forges were built along the stream in the late 1700s and early 1800s. During the 19th century, there was a substantial coal and iron industry in the watershed. Several railroads were also built in the stream's vicinity. Numerous bridges, including the Harrison Avenue Bridge (which is on the National Register of Historic Places) have been built across the stream as well. Additionally, sites such as the Scranton Iron Furnaces are in its watershed.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Kettle Creek has {{an area of}} 244 square miles. It {{is located}} in Clinton, Potter, Cameron, and Tioga Counties. Forested land makes up 93.5 percent of the lower Kettle Creek watershed, 2.7 percent is abandoned coal mines and quarries, 2.4 percent is grassland, and 1.4 percent is <b>developed</b> <b>land.</b> This part of the watershed is not densely populated. The {{upper reaches of the}} watershed are also mostly forested, with some riparian meadows and camps. Public lands such as state forest or state park lands occupy 92 percent of the watershed. Most of the private land is located near floodplains. A total of 0.3 percent of the watershed, or 456 acres, (including 15 percent of the private land) is agricultural land. Much of the private and agricultural land is either in the northern reaches of the watershed, near Germania, or in or near the lower Kettle Creek valley. Wetlands make up under 1 percent of the watershed's area; 37 percent of them are on private lands. A total of 47 percent, or 382 acres, of the watershed's wetlands are riverine wetlands. palustrine wetlands cover 299 acres, or 37 percent of the total wetlands, and 133 acres (16 percent) are lacustrine wetlands. Most of the watershed's lacustrine wetlands are located in Kettle Creek's floodplain. Palustrine wetlands are found on the Kettle Creek Lake.|$|E

25|$|To reduce {{phosphorus}} runoff to {{this part}} of the lake, Vermont and Quebec agreed to reduce their inputs by 60% and 40%, respectively, by an agreement signed in 2002. While agricultural sources (manure and fertilizers) are the primary sources of phosphorus (about 70%) in the Missisquoi basin, runoff from <b>developed</b> <b>land</b> and suburbs is estimated to contribute about 46% of the phosphorus runoff basin-wide to Lake Champlain, and agricultural lands contributed about 38%.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} San Francisco, some {{interesting}} negative externalities are being experienced {{due to the}} dredging of land by the Bay.

In response to this engineering travesty, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at. If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the <b>developed</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
