5|$|Jonah Hill {{plays the}} Junior Philosopher, a {{teenager}} Hal meets {{in the library}} while studying for the policy debate with Ginny. Hill had initially auditioned for another role in the film, but was unavailable as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> another film at the same time. Blitz was keen to have him appear, though, and so wrote him a small role as the Junior Philosopher, appearing in only two scenes.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
25|$|Meyer met Tobey Maguire in 2003 while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> {{the movie}} Seabiscuit at Universal Studios, {{and they became}} engaged in April 2006. Their {{daughter}} Ruby Sweetheart Maguire was born November 10, 2006. Ruby's middle name comes from a childhood nickname of Meyer's given to her by her grandmother, who died {{a few months before}} Ruby's birth. Meyer and Maguire married on September 3, 2007, in Kona, Hawaii. Their second child, son Otis Tobias Maguire, was born on May 8, 2009. In October 2016 Maguire and Meyer announced they were separating.|$|E
50|$|A movie {{director}} (Kenan Thompson) {{is convinced}} that the drama <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>shooting</b> will <b>be</b> more powerful and moving if his actors act like they're in a broad 70's sitcom.|$|R

25|$|Other {{returning}} {{cast members}} included Andrew Buchan ("Mark Latimer"), Arthur Darvill ("Rev. Paul Coates"), Jodie Whittaker ("Beth Latimer"), Charlotte Beaumont ("Chloe Latimer"), Joe Sims ("Nigel Carter"), Carolyn Pickles ("Maggie Radcliffe"), Jonathan Bailey ("Olly Stevens"), Pauline Quirke ("Susan Wright"), Tanya Franks ("Lucy Stevens"), Simone McAullay ("Becca Fisher"), and Adam Wilson ("Tom Miller"). Darvill confirmed his casting for series two on 17 September 2013. Buchan and Whittaker's participation was announced on 12 May 2014. Beaumont's return was reported on 30 May 2014 when Metro printed photographs of her filming a scene with other cast members. Sims' casting was finally revealed in late August 2014, {{when the media}} reported <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> scenes for series two. Actor Will Mellor character (alleged psychic Steve Connolly) and actress Vicky McClure character (journalist Karen White) do not return in series two. Actor Matthew Gravelle's return was never confirmed prior to airing.|$|E
25|$|It {{is still}} debated whether Horn {{committed}} the Nickells murder. Historians including Chip Carlson {{believe he did}} not, while others such as Dean Fenton Krakel believe that he did, but had not realized <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> a boy. The consensus is that regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others. Carlson, who extensively researched the Wyoming v. Tom Horn trial, concluded that although Horn could have committed the murder of Willie Nickell, he probably did not. According to Carlson's book, Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon (2001), there was no physical evidence that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day before it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession made it without value as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn's reputation and history made him {{an easy target for}} the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Ford was {{renowned for}} his intense {{personality}} and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark {{glasses and a}} patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker and while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> he would chew on a linen handkerchief—each morning his wife {{would give him a}} dozen fresh handkerchiefs, {{but by the end of}} a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its use, especially in front of a woman, would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on the mantel in his home.|$|E
5000|$|Besides using {{professional}} actors—German, American and otherwise—Herzog {{is known}} for using people from the locality in which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>shooting.</b> Especially in his documentaries, he uses locals to benefit what he calls [...] "ecstatic truth." [...] He uses footage of the non-actors both playing roles and being themselves.|$|R

[...] “Several years back he borrowed three heraldic-style brooches -with crests, crowns, and Maltese crosses- for a poster <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting,</b> and the minute that poster came out, everybody wanted brooches,” says Connie Parente in the Vogue interview. [...] Connie Parente is the popular Los Angeles jewelry collector who gave the pieces for the shoot, close to the photographers and Michael Jackson's personal stylist at the time Jyl Klein.|$|E
500|$|In 1939, {{at the age}} of 19, O'Hara {{secretly}} married Englishman George H. Brown, a film producer, {{production assistant}} and occasional scriptwriter, whom she had met on the set of Jamaica Inn. They married at St Paul's Church in Station Road, Harrow on 13 June, shortly before she left for Hollywood; Brown stayed behind in England as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> a film with Paul Robeson. Brown announced that the couple had kept the marriage an [...] "absolute secret" [...] and that they would have a full marriage ceremony in October 1939, but O'Hara never returned. The marriage was annulled in 1941.|$|E
500|$|American {{actor and}} {{director}} Paul Newman guest starred as {{himself in the}} episode, however he had only one line of dialogue. Newman recorded approximately five or six takes of his line over the phone from the set of a movie <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> at the time. According to Maxtone-Graham, Newman recorded his line with no rigmarole; [...] "He just said, 'Sure, I'll do it', {{and he did it}} instantly." [...] The episode also features Joe Mantegna, who plays a young Fat Tony. Welsh singer-songwriter Judith Owen, wife of Simpsons cast member Harry Shearer, also makes an appearance in the episode.|$|E
50|$|The {{landscape}} {{is described as}} frozen because it's a cold day. The father's behaviour is also cold because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>shooting</b> birds and killing them. The father's inability to understand his son is symbolically expressed by the layer of ice separating him from nature (<b>he</b> <b>is</b> helpless on the icy surface); the same helplessness applies to his relationship to his son.|$|R

500|$|Soderbergh had [...] "conceptual discussions" [...] with Gaghan while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> The Limey in October 1998, {{and they}} {{finished}} the outline {{before he went}} off to shoot Erin Brockovich. After Soderbergh was finished with that film, Gaghan had written a first draft in six weeks that was 165 pages long. After the film was approved for production, Soderbergh and Gaghan met two separate times for three days to reformat the script. The draft they shot with had 163 pages with 135 speaking parts and featured seven cities. The film shortens the storyline of the original mini-series; a major character arc, that of a farmer, is taken out, and the Pakistani plotline is replaced with one set in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Saari also posted another {{video on}} a Finnish social {{networking}} site, {{in which he}} pointed a gun at the camera and said in English [...] "You will die next", followed by firing four shots {{in the direction of}} the camera. This video was not available to the police when Saari was questioned. A police spokesperson commented: [...] "The only video we saw was where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> at the range. It was only afterwards that much more information came out." [...] Police said that Saari would have been detained if they had known about this video at the time of the questioning. Police said that they believed Saari's videos were shot by someone else, and that they were trying to identify who this person was. The Chief Investigator of the case, Jari Neulaniemi, speculated that the cameraman may have been the friend of Saari's who was murdered.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{structure}} of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, his films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène Lourié: [...] "Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting.</b> He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors". In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, [...] "Simplicity is best... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant... The camera should not intrude." [...] This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being [...] "old fashioned", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium. Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent {{would not be enough}} to remain funny on screen if he did not have an [...] "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".|$|E

Details of Banjara's career in Bollywood are revealed primarily in flashback.|$|R
5000|$|Cambot is {{only seen}} during the [...] "Robot Roll Call" [...] {{portion of the}} opening credits, often with his name reversed, presumably to imply <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>shooting</b> his own image in a mirror (this was {{actually}} proven in the Season 2-5 intro, when Joel is seen tapping on a mirror that Cambot is in). His appearance was changed with almost every reshooting of the opening credits.|$|R
500|$|Eric Bana {{commented that}} the shoot was, [...] "Ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid {{in a lot of}} ways." [...] Lee told him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> a Greek tragedy: he would be making a [...] "whole other movie" [...] about the Hulk at Industrial Light & Magic. An example of Lee's art house {{approach}} to the film was taking Bana to watch a bare-knuckle boxing match. Visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren was on the set every day. One of the many visual images in the film that presented an acting challenge for Bana was a split screen technique employed by Lee to cinematically mimic the panels of a comic book page. This required many more takes of individual scenes than normal. Sound design was completed at Skywalker Sound. Muren and other ILM animators used previous technology from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (for the Dobby character) to create the Hulk with computer-generated imagery. Other software used included PowerAnimator, Softimage XSI, and RenderMan Interface Specification. ILM started computer animation work in 2001, and completed in May 2003, just one month before the film's release. Lee provided some motion capture work in post-production.|$|E
500|$|A [...] of the [...] 3:10 to Yuma {{opened in}} theaters on September 7, 2007. [...] Losts co-show runner/executive producer/head writer/co-creator Damon Lindelof enjoyed Kevin Durand's {{supporting}} performance as Tucker and checked {{to see if}} he was available for a role on Lost. [...] The casting director had Durand read a page of dialogue for the new character Keamy; Durand was offered the role in early October and he traveled to Honolulu in Hawaii—where Lost is filmed on location—by October 17, 2007. [...] A former stand-up comic and rapper from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, with the stage name [...] "Kevy D", Durand had seen only around six episodes of Lost by the time that he won the part. [...] When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting,</b> he was confused by the story, later stating [...] "I didn't want to know anything or be attached to anybody. [...] I'm glad I didn't. [...] But now that I'm on it, I'll watch all of it." [...] Durand revealed his appreciation for the cast, crew and scripts and the fact that he had the chance to act as someone with a similar physical appearance to himself, as he had previously done roles that had not prompted recognition from viewers on the street.|$|E
500|$|Tapping's former Stargate SG-1 co-star Michael Shanks guest starred as Jimmy in [...] "Penance". Shanks had an {{interest}} in playing Jimmy because of the edgeness of the character. Shanks also suggested Aleks Paunovic, actor and part-time boxer, for the part as the diacon Duke; being a boxer fit into the character's violent nature. Paul McGillion returns as Wexford in the season finale. McGillion first appeared as Wexford in the original webisodes, and since then the producers wanted him to return. Tapping believed that placing him in the finale was [...] "the perfect place for him." [...] Callum Blue was cast as the finale's antagonist, Edward Forsythe, as the producers believed Blue could portray somebody who is both charming and evil. In the same episode, Sahar Biniaz was cast as Kali; Biniaz was chosen as the producers believed her physical appearance was goddess-like. Balinder Johal played a cult member; she {{was the first person to}} audition for the part, and the producers cast her as she was spiritual, calm, and soft in her appearance. Johal taught the cast how to speak Hindi in parts of the dialogue. The producers were hoping to cast David Hewlett, another Stargate alum, in a guest spot; however, this was met by scheduling issues, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> a film at the time. Despite this the producers were confident they would cast Hewlett [...] "eventually." ...|$|E

500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shooting</b> for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." [...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|E
