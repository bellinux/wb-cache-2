50|$|In {{a series}} stack, the {{deflection}} {{is not exactly}} proportional {{to the number of}} springs. This is because of a bottoming out effect when the springs are compressed to flat as the contact surface area increases once the spring is deflected beyond 95%. This decreases the moment arm and the spring will offer a greater spring resistance. Hysteresis can be used to calculate predicted deflections in a series stack. The number of springs used in a series stack is not as much of an issue as in parallel stacks even if, generally, the stack height should not be greater than three times the outside diameter of the <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> If {{it is not possible to}} avoid a longer stack, then it should be divided into 2 or possibly 3 partial stacks with suitable washers.

40|$|Pulley-based {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) with metal pushing V-belt (V-belt) offers tremendous potentials in the fuel economy of the car due to its wide and continuous ratio coverage. Nevertheless, the existing pulley-based CVTs in automotive markets use electro-hydro-mechanical (EHM) actuation system to vary its ratio and to provide sufficient clamping force on the V-belt. This, unfortunately, leads to a significant high power consumption from the engine of the car which eventually worsens the car’s fuel economy. To address this issue, researchers introduce electro-mechanical CVT (EM CVT) in which {{the application of the}} EHM actuation system is replaced by an electro-mechanical (EM) actuation system. This paper discusses the application of <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> in clamping force mechanism of EM CVT. The selected <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> is analyzed and evaluated to prove its workability for CVT’s application.

40|$|The Minimally Invasive Manipulator (MIM) copies the {{movements}} of the hands of the surgeon to the tip of the instrument inside the operating area. The movement is mechanically copied using cables and pulleys. When the surgeon grasps and holds an object, the friction inside the MIM increases and distorts the force feedback in the remaining degrees of freedom. The increased friction {{is the result of the}} reaction forces on the cables and pulleys due to the required pinch force to hold the object. The goal of this report is to present two designs for a bi-stable compliant grasper. The grasper will have two stable positions: open and closed. In those positions there is no need for an actuation force from the surgeon. When the grasper is closed, it will produce enough pinch force to hold an object. The first design is a compliant grasper combined with bi-stable beam. Both the grasper and bi-stable element will be a planer design. A large scale prototype is presented and evaluated. The prototype showed bi-stable behavior over a range of 8 mm. Using finite element modeling, dimensions for a bi-stable beam suitable for the MIM are found. The second design uses a <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> as bi-stable element. This design is a 3 D design, and is on the scale of the MIM. An ANSYS model and a database were validated. Using the model and database <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> with suitable dimensions for the MIM scale was found. Two disc springs in parallel were needed to make a bi-stable compliant grasper. Both the bi-stable beam and the <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> can be used in the design for a bi-stable grasper. The bi-stable beam is more effectively creating negative stiffness inside a circular space. As a result, it should be able to produce more force and/or stroke in the same volume as a <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> This makes the bi-stable beam more suitable for use in a bi-stable grasper than a <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
