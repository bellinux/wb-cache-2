The main temperature datasets take different approaches to allowing for this: HadCRUT does not extrapolate, and assumes that the global mean applies.

The other datasets <b>interpolate,</b> producing differing trends.

500|$|Khurshid {{was born}} in 734/735, the son of Dadhburzmihr or Dadmihr (died 740) and {{grandson}} of Farrukhan the Great (died ca. 728), the first ruler (ispahbadh) [...] of the Dabuyid dynasty from whose reign coins are known. According to the traditional account, the Dabuyids had established themselves as the quasi-independent rulers of Tabaristan in the 640s, during the tumults of the Muslim conquest of Persia {{and the collapse of}} the Sassanid Empire. They owed only the payment tribute and nominal vassalage to the Arab Caliphate, and managed, despite repeated Muslim attempts at invasion, to maintain their autonomy by exploiting the inaccessible terrain of their country. A more recent interpretation of the sources by P. Pourshariati, however, supports that Farrukhan was the one who actually established the family's rule over Tabaristan, sometime in the 670s. In earlier works on the dynasty, Khurshid is named Khurshid II, due to erroneous interpretation of numismatic evidence, which led earlier scholars to <b>interpolate</b> a first Khurshid before Farrukhan, whose rule was thought to have begun ca. 710.|$|E
