40|$|The {{rainfall}} {{pattern in the}} Sahel is very erratic with a high spatial variability. We tested the often reported hypothesis that the dispersion of farmers’ fields around the village territory helps mitigate agro-climatic risk by increasing yield stability from year to year. We also wished to evaluate whether this strategy {{had an effect on}} the yield disparity among households in a village. Based on a network of approximately 60 rain gauges spread over 500 km 2 in the Fakara region (Southwest Niger), daily rainfall was interpolated at 300 m × 300 m resolution over a 12 -year period. This data was used to compute, by means of the APSIM crop simulation model, millet biomass and grain yields at the pixel scale. Simulated yields were combined with the land tenure map of the Banizoumbou village in a GIS to assess millet yield at field and household level. Agro-climatic risk analysis was performed using linear regression between a spatial dispersion index of household fields and the <b>inter-annual</b> (<b>instability)</b> and inter-household (disparity) millet yield variability of 107 households in the village territory. We find that the spatial variability of annual rainfall induces an even higher spatial variability of millet production at pixel, field and household levels. The dispersion of farm fields reduces moderately but significantly the disparity of millet yield between households each year and increases the inter-annual yield stability of a given household. The less the household fields are scattered, the more the presence of a fertility gradient around the village enhances the inter-annual stability but also the disparity between households. Our results provide evidence that field dispersion is an effective strategy to mitigate agro-climatic risk, as claimed by farmers in the Sahelian Niger. Although the results should be confirmed by further research on longer term rainfall spatial data, it is clearly advisable that any land reforms in the area take into account the benefits of field dispersion to mitigate climatic risk...|$|E
40|$|A large {{quantity}} of land resources {{have been damaged}} due to intense human activities and natural disasters, such as mining operation, infrastructure construction, and landslide. The expectation to restore {{the function of the}} degraded land is increasingly drawing much attention from both publics and governments. After decades 2 ̆ 7 efforts, there is still a heavy task of land reclamation that needs to be finished in China. Due to the strong regional differentiation, the situation of land reclamation in each province is different from others. In order to reduce the regional differences with a purpose of promoting the land reclamation in China, it is essential to explore the spatial-temporal pattern differentiation and influence mechanism of land reclamation. This paper took 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous districts in China as research area to reveal the spatial pattern of the {{quantity of}} land reclamation and its influence factors. The considered factors included the economic, social, technical, institutional and natural conditions. Data were collected from related statistical yearbook, published paper and China national knowledge internet (CNKI). We employed exploratory spatial data analysis to detect the spatial pattern of land reclamation in China. Besides, factor analysis was used to discover the public driving force of land reclamation. Panel data model was used to quantify the influence of different factors on the quantity of land reclamation in different regions. It could be found that: 1) The quantity of land reclamation in China was featured by a weak spatial autocorrelation and three-grade distribution pattern, and it showed a spatial nonstationary process with <b>inter-annual</b> <b>instability</b> from 1999 to 2013. This pattern was partly in accordance with the economic development and affected by some factors such as the distribution of mineral resource and differentiated land reclamation policies; 2) Due to the weak spatial aggregation, only one area with H-H (high-high) clustered reclamation was detected in eastern China (the center was Jiangsu Province), and not any other significant hot area was been found; 3) The 3 public factors mainly affecting land reclamation were mission, drive and support respectively. It can be inferred that the most significant motive force of land reclamation in China is economic driving force, and the second force is mission of land reclamation. This indicates that, to some degree, the insufficient quantity of land reclamation cannot only attribute to the technical problem. Obviously, it is a synthesis problem related to other factors, especially the economy. For eastern China, land reclamation is mainly driven by the pressure of land resource shortage and economic attraction. Central China is also suffering from the pressure of land resource shortage, but its land reclamation is negatively affected by the ongoing mining activity. In western China, there is more mission of land reclamation, but the natural condition acts as a significant limiting factor. Based on the results above, some policy suggestions, such as improving the mission-driving mechanism, reforming the guidance of policy, enhancing the transfer of technology and coordinating land reclamation project, have been proposed. The results and conclusions above are expected to provide reference for the planning and management of land reclamation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} impact of climate change on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) grain yield under different crop residue and nutrient management systems in a smallholder farming system. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used in this scenario analysis. Two crop residue management types (crop residue retention in soil and crop residue removal) and fertiliser management (no fertilisation and application of 40, 30 kg P ha- 1) were the scenarios analysed using climate change (CCD) and historical (HD) weather data to simulate sorghum yield. Comparing grain yield under the two weather conditions, there was a 20 % reduction in grain yield as a result of climate change when no fertiliser was applied compared with a yield increase of 4 % with the application of 40 kg N, 30 kg P ha- 1. The impact of crop residue management on grain yield was lower under climate change weather conditions than under historical weather conditions. This can be attributed to higher soil moisture stress which also contributed to lower rate of soil carbon decomposition in the top soil. <b>Instability</b> (<b>inter-annual</b> standard deviation) in grain yield was higher under climate change (0. 13 to 0. 21) weather conditions than under historical (0. 04 to 0. 11) weather conditions. This was reflected in higher change in yield, thus, making sorghum production under rain-fed agriculture more risky, particularly to the smallholder (low input) farmers...|$|R
