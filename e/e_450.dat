The results show a clear fatigue endurance “trough” in LOC LBE, while no such a strong temperature dependence of the fatigue endurance is observed when the steel is tested in vacuum. The fractographic observations by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that ductile microdimples are prevalent on the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum, whereas the fracture surfaces produced in LOC LBE at all the temperatures are characterized by quasi-cleavage. Interestingly, using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), martensitic laths close to the fatigue crack walls or to the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum are found to have transformed into very fine equiaxed subgrains. Nevertheless, such microstructural modifications do not happen to the specimens tested in LOC LBE at 160 <b>e</b> <b>450</b> C.

40|$|International audienceThe nitroderivatives of {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are potentially important photosensitisers in the atmospheric condensed phase. Here we show that the triplet state of 1 -nitronaphthalene (31 NN*) is able to directly react with phenol, causing its transformation upon irradiation of 1 NN in aqueous solution. Additional but less important processes of phenol degradation are reactions with OH and 1 O 2, both photogenerated by irradiated 1 NN. Dihydroxybiphenyls and phenoxyphenols were detected as main phenol transformation intermediates, likely formed by dimerisation of phenoxy radicals that would be produced upon phenol oxidation by 31 NN*. Very interestingly, irradiation with 1 NN shifted the fluorescence peaks of phenol (Ex/Em ¼ 220 e 230 / 280 e 320 nm and 250 e 275 / 280 e 320 nm, with Ex/ Em ¼ excitation and emission wavelengths) to a region that overlaps with "M-like" fulvic substances (Ex/ Em ¼ 250 e 300 / 330 e 400 nm).

Cell transplantation of human and mouse cells into immune compromised mice has greatly enhanced our understanding of stem cell function, regeneration, and cancer.

By contrast, large-scale cell transplantation of fluorescent blood and cancer cells into syngeneic and irradiated zebrafish has now become routine 1 – 7. However, these approaches require that donor cells are from the same strain of syngeneic zebrafish or that the recipient immune system is transiently ablated by whole body γ-irradiation two-days prior to transplantation. Irradiated recipients eventually recover their immune system by 20 days post-irradiation and kill engrafted cells 1, 2, 6, making long-term engraftment studies difficult.

Levels of cytochromes P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e</b> mRNAs were assessed in proximal and distal hepatocytes by Northern blot hybridization of poly(A+) RNA with a cDNA recognizing sequences of these two cytochromes.

However, consumption of them may not be a hundred percent risk free. Phosphates are allowed to be used in order to increase water holding capacity of meat products. This may lead to consumers feeling they have been cheated since water then can be added to the product, increasing the weight of it.

Based on this approach, architecture is introduced that achieves superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the conventional MMSE FDE. The performance of the proposed design is close to the existing maximum likelihood-post detection processing (ML-PDP) scheme, while achieving a significantly lower complexity, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>450</b> × less Euclidean distance (ED) calculations in 16 -QAM. The ASIC implementation of the proposed architecture, the first ASIC for SC-FDMA detectors to-date, achieves a 3 × higher throughput than the best design reported to-date...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} the coding nucleotide {{sequence of the}} mRNA for a 3 -methylcholanthrene-inducible cytochrome P- 450, P- 450 d, of rat liver by sequence analysis of cloned cDNAs. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cytochrome is composed of 513 amino acids, and its NH 2 -terminal sequence of 30 amino acids completely coincides with that reported from analysis of the purified cytochrome P- 450 d. The amino acid composition of the deduced sequence also agrees well with that determined from the purified protein. Computer-aided analysis was carried out to compare the complete primary structures of five species of cytochrome P- 450, two molecular species of phenobarbital-inducible rat liver cytochrome P- 450 (P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e),</b> phenobarbital-inducible rabbit liver cytochrome P- 450 LM 2, 3 -methylcholanthrene-inducible rat liver cytochrome P- 450 d, and camphor-hydroxylating P- 450 of Pseudomonas putida (P- 450 CAM). It is concluded therefrom that the time of divergence between cytochrome P- 450 b (P- <b>450</b> <b>e)</b> and P- <b>450</b> d is much earlier than that of branching between phenobarbital-inducible cytochromes P- 450 of rat and rabbit. One highly conserved cysteine-containing region that {{is close to the}} COOH terminus is found in all of these cytochrome P- 450 sequences, indicating that the heme-binding site is the cysteine residue in this region...|$|R

Os parâmetros genéticos foram estimados em análises uni e bicaracter, em um modelo animal, por meio da inferência Bayesiana. O modelo utilizado, para todas as características, incluiu o efeito aleatório genético e a idade como covariável assumindo efeito quadrático. Incluiu também sexo, mês, ano de nascimento e {{manejo de}} criação como efeitos ambientais identificáveis para as características de carcaça. Para IPP, PIEP, PE <b>450</b> <b>e</b> PE 550, foram considerados apenas mês e ano de nascimento. As estimativas de herdabilidade de todas as características estudadas foram maiores nas análises bicaracter exceto para IPP e PIEP, que apresentaram 0, 75 e 0, 29, respectivamente, valores semelhantes nas análises unicaracter. As análises bicaracter resultaram em estimativas de herdabilidade a posteriori para as características PESO, AOL, EG, EGP 8, PE <b>450</b> <b>e</b> PE 550 de 0, 49, 0, 66, 0, 74, 0, 68, 0, 66 e 0, 74 respectivamente, sugerindo a possibilidade de ganhos genéticos em curto prazo de tempo. As correlações genéticas entre IPP e as características de carcaça medidas por ultrassom foram próximas de zero. Comportamento semelhante foi encontrado para IPP, PE <b>450</b> <b>e</b> PE 550 dias indicando que a seleção para essas características não promoverá mudanças na IPP. Correlações genéticas altas (0, 92, 0, 93 e 0, 94) foram encontradas entre as características AOL e PESO, EG e EGP 8 <b>e</b> PE <b>450</b> <b>e</b> PE 550, respectivamente. ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the genetic parameters and (co) variance of Nellore animals and to characterize the associations between these characteristics for the following carcass traits: weight (W), longissimus muscle area (LMA), rump fat thickness (RF) and fat thickness between the 12 th and 13 th ribs obtained by ultrasound (BF); also, the following reproductive traits: age at first calving (AFC), first calving interval (FCI), scrotal circumference at 450 and 550 days of age (SC 450 and SC 550). The genetic parameters were estimated by a single-trait and two traits animal model using Bayesian inference. The model used for all of the features included the genetic random effect and age as covariate assuming a quadratic effect. Additionally, sex, month and year of birth and management of creation and environmental effects identified were included for the carcass traits. For AFC, FCI and SC 450 and SC 550, we considered only the month and year of birth. The heritability estimates for all of the traits were higher in the two traits analysis, except for AFC and FCI, which showed 0. 75 and 0. 29, respectively, similar values in the single trait analysis. The two traits analyses resulted in heritability estimates for a posteriori for the features W, LMA, BF, RF, SC 450 and SC 550 of 0. 49, 0. 66, 0. 74, 0. 68 0. 66 and 0. 74, respectively, suggesting the possibility of genetic gains during a short period of time. The genetic correlations between AFC and carcass traits measured by ultrasound were close to zero. A similar trend was found for AFC, SC 450 and SC 550 days, indicating that the selection for these traits does not promote changes in AFC. High genetic correlations (0. 92, 0. 93 and 0. 94) were observed between the characteristics LMA and W, BF and RF, and SC 450 and SC 550, respectively. 201...|$|R
