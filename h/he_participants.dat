3000|$|Marked {{differences}} were seen on “industry-person congeniality” where {{four of the}} independent variables made significant contributions to prediction. Notably, of these three had OR below 1 indicating, for example, that for these items <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> were less likely to agree than VET participants. For these, the level of disagreement of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> can be identified by a reciprocal calculation, thus for the OR of [...]. 54 (thus reciprocal of 1.85), this can be interpreted as the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> being around twice more likely to feel they fit with the job. Similar patterns of findings were found on the three other significant items. For instance, the OR of [...]. 58 (reciprocal of 1.72) recorded for item 6 ‘pleased to satisfy customers’ indicates that the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> being around twice as likely to please tourists.|$|E
30|$|Looking at “commitment to the industry”, the HE and the VET {{participant}} {{groups were}} significantly different on seven out of ten items. Firstly, 65.4 % of the VET participants were in disagreement that a career in hospitality was outweighed with disadvantages, while only 34.9 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> indicated this view. Therefore, hospitality was viewed as being a satisfactory career path by 87.5 % of the VET participants as compared to 59.1 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants,</b> and being a promising vocational future perceived by 81.6 % of the VET participants (M[*] =  2.47) and 48.3 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> (M[*] =  3.36). Whilst many participants in both groups were uncertain about whether they had a definite plan for working in the hospitality industry, 49.5 % of the VET participants expressed the attitude of being keen on a hospitality job as compared to only 15.5 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> displaying a similar attitude.|$|E
30|$|From the findings, marked {{differences}} between {{the views of the}} <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> and the VET participants across all aspects of hospitality workplaces were observed. Notably, on the issues relating to pay/promotion opportunities, management, and commitment to working in the industry, the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> appeared less positive than the VET participants. These three dimensions are discussed below (refer to Appendix for full responses to seven dimensions).|$|E

30|$|Only one {{independent}} variable (‘with no hospitality background’) {{on the model}} on “managers” {{made significant contributions to}} prediction (p[*]=[*]. 006). The predictor recorded an OR of 1.82 suggested that the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> were almost twice as likely to be negative about the educational background in hospitality of managers. For “social status”, only one of the {{independent variable}}s, item 1 ‘family pride’ made a significant contribution to the model (p[*]=[*]. 000, OR[*]=[*] 2.16). This indicates that <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> were around twice as likely to indicate that their family was proud of their hospitality career.|$|E
30|$|Results {{indicated}} marked {{differences between}} {{the views of the}} <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> and the VET participants on several aspects of hospitality workplaces, including the industry-person congeniality, pay and promotion opportunities, co-workers, managers, and commitment to the hospitality industry.|$|E
30|$|The {{dimension}} “pay/promotion opportunities” {{clearly demonstrated}} strong areas {{of difference between}} the two participant groups, with significant differences seen on all eight items of this dimension (p[*]<. 001). The participants, on average, showed contrasting views on four items 2, 4, 5, and 6 among the eight items, recording statistically significant differences. Thus, looking at items where there was a level of difference in the views, on item 2 ‘low pay’, 65.3 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> (M[*] =  2.27) were in agreement that the pay was low for long hours of work, while only 31.4 % of the VET participants indicated this view (M[*] =  3.18). Another differing response pattern was item 6 ‘experience-based promotion’. Whereas 59.1 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> showed agreement (M[*] =  2.32) on the feature of experience-based promotion, i.e., number of years working in the industry taken into consideration for promotion decision making, only 28.1 % of the VET participants expressed a similar view (M[*] =  3.13). The <b>HE</b> <b>participants,</b> on average, showed a higher degree of agreement (M[*] =  2.39) with promotion being limited in the hospitality industry as opposed to the VET counterparts (M[*] =  3.16).|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, among 10 out of 13 items having {{significant}} difference recorded on dimension “managers”, whilst {{the majority of}} the VET participants (80.2 %) showed disagreement towards item 4 with regard to most managers having no educational background in hospitality, almost half of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> expressed uncertainty (45.3 %), and 38.7 % expressed an opposite view. Another different response pattern observed on item 10, indicated that whilst 64 % of the VET participants indicated disagreement towards ‘managers’ not helping employees with personal problems’, only 27.9 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> expressed this attitude. Similarly, 73.5 % of the VET participants indicated managers put great effort into making sure employees were satisfied with their jobs, as compared to 38.6 % of their HE counterparts.|$|E
30|$|The {{analyses}} show marked {{differences in}} views between the HE and VET participants on {{several aspects of}} hospitality workplaces, including pay/promotion opportunities, management, {{and commitment to the}} industry. The <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> appeared less positive, and indicated a lower commitment to a future in the hospitality industry.|$|E
30|$|The {{participants}} were predominantly aged between 18 and 24  years (91.3 %), the typical age range of tertiary students in Vietnam (Do and Do 2014). Whilst only 4 % of the <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> were aged between 25 and 30, {{a slightly higher}} 14.4 % of the VET {{participants were}} in this age group. This representation across age groupings between the two participant groups likely captures participation in tertiary education for both academic preparation (via HE programs), and ongoing vocational development (via VET programs).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{our ability}} to analyse progression rates into UK Higher Education (HE) using a range of data available at the individual and neighbourhood levels. The then Department for Children, Schools and Families has recently released data which {{make it possible to}} profile national patterns of student educational progression from post-compulsory schooling through to university. However, the linked records lack detailed socioeconomic information, and thus a geodemographic classification is used to analyse the flows of students from different sociospatial backgrounds into the HE system. Rates of progression are shown to vary greatly between these groups, and a disaggregation of <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> by courses of study demonstrates that the abilities of institutions to attract students from different backgrounds will be constrained by the mix of their course offerings. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{explored}} women’s experiences {{as participants in}} Highland Games Heavy Events (HGHE) within a Hope and Strengths Perspective, which is underpinned by Duality of Structure. Through 12 semi-structured interviews with eight athletes and four athletic directors, I examined 1) the history of women’s involvement in the sport of HGHE within North America, 2) how female competitors have a) shaped and b) been shaped by their experiences in HGHE and 3) the newspaper coverage of women HGHE athletes as compared to a) their male counterparts (<b>HE</b> <b>participants)</b> and b) other female participants (in piping and dancing) from 1995 - 2015. Participants explained their past and current experiences within the HGHE community and how their strengths (both physical and psychological) linked to necessary human and financial resources. A content analysis of newspaper articles showed that female and male coverage of HGHE was almost equal, and largely positive in tone. A textual analysis of those articles documented patterns of female coverage including gender marking, infantilization and sexualisation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of sulodexide for the treatment of hard exudates (HE) in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Methods This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial involving 130 patients (65 for each group) who had mild-to-moderate NPDR with macular <b>HE.</b> <b>Participants</b> were given a daily dose of either 50 mg sulodexide or a matching dose of placebo orally for 12 months. Main outcome measure was an improvement in HE defined as a decrease in severity by at least two grades on a 10 -grade severity scale. This was evaluated by fundus photography over 12 -month period. Results The sulodexide group showed significantly greater improvement in HE severity than that shown by the placebo group (39. 0 % vs. 19. 3 %; chi square, P= 0. 005). Logistic regression analysis yielded an odds ratio of 2. 790 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 155 - 6. 743; P= 0. 023) for the effect of treatment once adjustments were made for demographic, prognostic and disease confounders. Intention to treat and per-protocol analysis yielded similar results. Sulodexide’s safety was comparable to that of the placebo. Conclusions Oral sulodexide therapy over 12 months im-proved macular HE in patients with mild-to-moderate NPDR, without leading to detectable adverse events.

40|$|Whether the read/write web, or Web 2. 0, {{can enhance}} learner {{engagement}} within {{higher education is}} a central focus of current e-learning research. The implications of the read/write web, for: the personalisation of learning; student motivation and participation with the learning process; and, the relationship between informal and formal learning contexts; are particular foci. In order to develop institutional understanding of these issues, one of the strands of the DMU e-Learning Pathfinder project focused upon the possibilities for extending dialogue with PG Cert <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> and by extension, undergraduate and postgraduate learners. This paper scopes some of the emergent outcomes {{from the use of}} read/write tools and approaches with this cohort of learners. The voices of both learners and tutors are evaluated, drawing upon a triangulation of datasets, including questionnaires, focus groups and wiki-based action plans. The authors investigate ways in which these approaches can be used to enhance: the personalisation of learning; student motivation and participation with the learning process; and, the relationship between informal and formal learning contexts. These headline outcomes underpin recommendations for the development of PG Cert HE curricula, and highlight how read/write approaches open-up dialogues about curriculum design. A critical element of future work is, therefore, whether this strategy empowers those participants to be better placed to engage with their own learner...|$|E
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess the {{efficacy}} of process-based cognitive training (pb-CT) combined with reminiscence therapy (RT) in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mAD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in healthy elderly (HE) subjects. Methods This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involved 348 participants with mAD, MCI, and HE from four European countries. Participants were randomly assigned to two arms of a crossover design: those in arm A underwent 3 [*]months of computerized pb-CT for memory and executive functions combined with RT and 3 [*]months of rest; those in arm B underwent the reverse. The primary outcome was the effect of the training on memory and executive functions performance. The secondary outcome was the effect of the training on functional abilities in mAD assessed with the instrumental activities of daily living. Results We found a significant effect of the training for memory in all three groups on delayed recall of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and for executive functions in HE on the phonological fluency test. MCI and <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> maintained these effects at follow-up. MCI and mAD participants also showed a significant effect of the training on the Mini-mental state examination scale. Participants with mAD showed more stable instrumental activities of daily living during the training versus the rest period. Conclusions Our results corroborate the positive effect of pb-CT and its maintenance primarily on memory in HE and MCI participants that {{did not seem to be}} potentiated by RT. Moreover, our results are very promising for the mAD participants. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The aim of our {{meta-analysis}} is {{to evaluate}} the association between the modifications of the cardiovascular system and chronic exposure to noise in occupationally exposed subjects. We considered the articles published from 1950 to May 2008. Only 15 papers were conforming to the inclusion criteria identified for this meta-analysis. A total of 18, 658 workers were divided in three groups according {{to the level of}} noise exposure as measured in the original studies (High Exposure, HE, Intermediate Exposure, IE. Low Exposure, LE). A preliminary evaluation of the type of data allowed for a classification of the type of performed measurements. Two classes of variables were identified: Class I, composed by continuous variables (systolic blood pressure, SBP, diastolic blood pressure, DBP, and heart rate, HR) and Class II, composed by not continuous variables (prevalence of hypertension and prevalence of ECG abnormalities). For each variable the calculation of heterogeneity was performed. For continuous variables the calculation of ES and its significance were performed while Odds Ratio (OR) and its significance were calculated for not continuous variables. The results show a statistically significant increase of SBP and DBP in HE workers compared to LE and IE workers while HR is statistically higher in <b>HE</b> <b>participants</b> compared to LE participants. The prevalence of both hypertension and ECG abnormalities is statistically higher in HE workers compared to LE and IE workers. Taking into account both the extremely high heterogeneity among studies and the ES/OR values we suggest a particular attention to the measurement and evaluation of SBP, DBP and HR in workers with chronic exposure to noise. Also ECG for workers with chronic exposure to noise is suggested in order to identify and evaluate possible abnormalities noise could be a concurrent cause of. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
