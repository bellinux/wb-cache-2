5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises {{spurred on by}} civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, <b>faculty,</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators,</b> which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was forced by the chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment levels {{held steady}} into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into a mental health institution. Students, <b>faculty</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E

5|$|List of United States {{business}} school rankings is a tabular listing {{of some of}} the {{business school}}s and their affiliated universities located in the United States that are included in {{one or more of the}} rankings of full-time Master of Business Administration programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive list of business schools in the United States. These rankings are a subset of college and university rankings. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a university or college that produces students who attain business administration degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for undergraduate, part-time and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among <b>faculty</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> in American institutions of higher education regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the President's letter.|$|E

25|$|There are {{multiple}} misconceptions {{in regards to}} poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low socioeconomic status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families. It {{is not an issue}} of value, but more so a problem of access. A parent from a lower socioeconomic class is likely to have more factors than a parent from a wealthy socioeconomic class that may affect their involvement with their child’s education. For instance a person living in poverty is more likely to work multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their child’s education. The teachers, <b>faculty,</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> of the schools have to take these real-life factors into consideration.|$|E
25|$|Other {{innovations}} in enrollment practices, included allowing {{colleges and universities}} to admit students with good academic records but relatively low entrance-examination scores. Some colleges were allowed to try an experimental student recommendation system - fixed at 2 {{percent of the total}} enrollment for regular colleges and 5 percent for teachers' colleges - instead of the traditional entrance examination. A minimum national examination score was established for admission to specific departments at specially designated colleges and universities, and the minimum score for admission to other universities was set by provincial-level authorities. Key universities established separate classes for minorities. When several applicants attained the minimum test score, the school had the option of making a selection, a policy that gave university <b>faculty</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> a certain amount of discretion but still protected admission according to academic ability.|$|E
25|$|Emory's {{diversity}} and academic reputation flourished {{under the leadership}} of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney.

On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Kim would go on {{to play a major role}} in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the 8th President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy.

25|$|Criticism {{of college}} and {{university}} rankings (2007 United States) refers to a 2007 movement which developed among <b>faculty</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> in American Institutions of Higher Education. It follows previous movements in the U.S. and Canada (by schools in the 1990s such as Reed College, Stanford University, Alma College, {{as well as a}} number of universities in Canada in 2006) which have criticized the practice of college rankings. The arguments of those who criticize the ranking are that it is not possible to come with a single number that characterizes university performance. Ratings, as argued by academic institutions and their leaders, can be easily manipulated and include such subjective characteristics as the “reputation” determined by surveying university administrators such as chancellors or deans. Methodology of many rankings (e.g., U.S. News and World Report 2015 Best Engineering Schools Rankings) emphasizes research expenditures (such as grants and contracts) as the only measure of scientific accomplishments despite the concern that measuring science by the amount of money spent rather than by the importance and impact of scientific discoveries or the depth of the ideas could encourage costly projects that are not necessary scientifically sound.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s {{there were}} no notable tenure battles, but three were {{outstanding}} in the 1990s. In 1995, the Florida Board of Regents tried to re-evaluate academic tenure, but managed only to institute a weak, post-tenure performance review. Likewise, in 1996 the Arizona Board of Regents attempted to re-evaluate tenure, fearing that few full-time professors actually taught university undergraduate students, mainly because the processes of achieving academic tenure underweighted teaching. However, <b>faculty</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> defended themselves {{and the board of}} trustees dropped its review. Finally, the University of Minnesota Regents tried from 1995 to 1996 to enact 13 proposals, including these policy changes: to allow the regents to cut faculty base- salaries for reasons other than a university financial emergency including poor performance; to fire tenured professors when their programs were eliminated or restructured if the university were unable to retrain or reassign them. In the Minnesota system, 87 percent of university faculty were either tenured or on the tenure track, and the professors vehemently defended themselves. Eventually, the president of the system opposed these changes and weakened a compromise plan by the dean of the law school before it then failed. The board chairman resigned later that year.|$|E

Subject matter experts in education and pedagogy, school faculty, parents, alumni, {{and other members of the}} school community formed the [...] "New City College Task Force". The task force, which combed through two decades of previous improvement plans, academic proposals, and experimental curricula, recommended to the School Board a plan that included stricter admissions and retention standards, a revitalized humanities- and liberal arts-based curriculum, and the autonomy to selectively recruit new, highly qualified <b>faculty</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrators.</b>|$|E
