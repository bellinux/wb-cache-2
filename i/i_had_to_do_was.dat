500|$|The {{majority}} of Lombard's appearances with Fox were bit parts in low-budget Westerns and adventure films. She later commented on her dissatisfaction with these roles: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> simper prettily at the hero and scream with terror when he battled with the villain." [...] She fully enjoyed the {{other aspects of}} film work, however, such as photo shoots, costume fittings, and socializing with actors on the studio set. Lombard embraced the flapper lifestyle and became a regular at the Coconut Grove nightclub, where she won several Charleston dance competitions.|$|E

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> let myself go and {{it was going to}} feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|Ramsey joined Ipswich {{just after}} the club's relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1954–55 season, the team's only year above the third tier up to that point. To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the first thing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to forget my set ideas on how football ought to be played. My experience had been in the First Division. I soon found that what I faced at Ipswich was very different." ...|$|E

Physically, of course, what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now.

500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, {{his first}} {{official}} {{year on the}} track, he won the All American Futurity and eight other stakes races. In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track.

All <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> just sit there and let him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92seconds for [...] The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in the starting gate, false-started, broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.|$|E
500|$|At {{least five}} {{species have been}} given {{scientific}} names honoring Colbert. In 2008 a species of California trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti. The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a {{professor of biology at}} East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, [...] "And all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> shamelessly beg on national television." [...] Other species named for Colbert include a species of Venezuelan diving beetle named Agaporomorphus colberti and a Chilean stonefly named Diamphipnoa colberti, both formally described in 2008. On his 45th birthday, Colbert was sent a framed print of his eponymous beetle by the biologists who named it. In 2014, a species of parasitic wasp from Ecuador, Aleiodes colberti, was named for Colbert, along with newly described species named for celebrities Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira, and in 2016 a rove beetle, Sonoma colberti, was named after Colbert's on-screen persona.|$|E

500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material {{to the point of}} exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1968 he {{ran against}} the 81-year-old {{incumbent}} Democratic Senator Ernest Gruening, a popular {{former governor of}} the Alaska Territory who {{was considered one of}} the fathers of Alaska's statehood, for his party's nomination to the U.S. Senate. Gravel's campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences. He hired Joseph Napolitan, the first self-described political consultant, in late 1966. They spent over {{a year and a half}} planning a short, nine-day primary election campaign that featured the slogans [...] "Alaska first" [...] and [...] "Let's do something about the state we're in", the distribution of a collection of essays entitled Jobs and More Jobs, and the creation of a half-hour, well-produced, glamorized biographical film of Gravel, Man for Alaska. The film was shown twice a day on every television station in Alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of Alaska Native villages. The heavy showings quickly reversed a 2–to–1 Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead. Gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries. Gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and his opposition to President Lyndon B. Johnson's war policies was harming him among the Democratic electorate; according to Gravel, [...] "...all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> stand up and not deal with the subject, and people would assume that I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him." ...|$|E

However, the citizens of Williamsport applauded Bresnahan for his ingenuity, eventually prompting the club to retire his number 59. At the retirement ceremony in 1998, Bresnahan was quoted as saying, [...] "Lou Gehrig had to play in 2,130 consecutive games and hit [...]340 for his number to be retired, and all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> bat [...]140 and throw a potato." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1986 Globe and Mail interview, Shaver {{said that}} she was being {{considered}} for a role in Joshua Then and Now, which would have promoted her career much farther than Desert Hearts. Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to hang up the phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, that was fine [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, and here it was, and all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> say yes.

2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were {{out there in the}} field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
