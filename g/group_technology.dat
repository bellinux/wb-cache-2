By the start of 1983, the KRL had developed around 1500–2900 gas centrifuges loosely based on Urenco <b>Group</b> <b>technology.</b> It was thanks to Abdul Qadeer Khan's effort that on 4 June 1978, scientists working in the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL) succeed in enriching uranium by electromagnetic isotope separation of 238U and 235U isotopes at the then-Pakistan Air Force controlled-Chaklala Air Force Base Centrifuge Laboratory (CACL). Ghulam Dastagir Alam, who co-headed the isotope separation project, informed Abdul Qadeer Khan. Khan immediately went to GHQ to informed General Zia-Ul-Haq.|$|E

The classification and utilization of <b>technology</b> <b>groups</b> is done for livestock activities, but illustrated hereafter for the finishing pigs activities. The research is worked out in three phases: • Organizational aspects of tuning information demand and supply; • Identification of technology groups; • Evolution of <b>technology</b> <b>groups.</b> Following techniques are used to identify the technology groups: Stochastic frontier analysis, cluster analysis and others. The results {{can be used in}} sector models to measure the impact of induced innovation on different <b>technology</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>technology,</b> sector modeling, induced innovation, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
