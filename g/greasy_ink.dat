2500|$|When printing, {{the stone}} is kept wet with water. Naturally {{the water is}} {{attracted}} to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. Printing ink based on drying oils such as linseed oil and varnish loaded with pigment is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the <b>greasy</b> <b>ink</b> but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.|$|E
50|$|These {{plate and}} film {{products}} differed substantially {{only in the}} means used to manufacture the colour mosaic layer and its resulting pattern and fineness. Autochrome's mosaic was a random array of dyed potato starch grains, {{too small to be}} individually visible without a microscope. Most competing products employed a coarser geometric pattern created by one of the many methods devised and patented during that era. Dufaycolor's filter layer was of the geometric type, but its proprietary manufacturing process produced an unusually fine-patterned mosaic. A very thin coating of collodion {{on one side of the}} film base was dyed blue, printed with closely spaced fine lines using a water-repelling <b>greasy</b> <b>ink,</b> and bleached. The clear spaces created were then dyed green. The ink was removed and new ink lines were printed at a 90 degree angle to the blue and green lines. The new gaps were bleached and dyed red, resulting in a colour filter mosaic, known as a réseau, consisting of alternating green and blue squares between red lines, and having roughly one million colour filter elements per square inch.In very early years, different arrangements of the same colours were used, the lines being green or blue instead of red and sometimes intersecting the other colours diagonally. After a final ink removal and the application of an isolating varnish, the same side of the film base was coated with a panchromatic black-and-white photographic emulsion. When exposed to light through the base and its réseau, the bit of emulsion behind each colour element recorded only the amount of light of that primary colour striking the film at that point.|$|E
50|$|Oil Print Process: Made by {{applying}} <b>greasy</b> <b>inks</b> to paper {{coated with a}} solution of gum bichromate and gelatin. When exposed through a negative, the gum-gelatin hardens where light strikes it while unexposed areas remain soft. Artist's inks are then applied by brush, and the inks adhere only to the hardened areas. Through this process a photographer can manipulate the lighter areas of a gum print while the darker areas remain stable. An oil print cannot be enlarged since {{it has to be}} in direct contact with the negative.|$|R
50|$|Problems {{with the}} {{printing}} of his play Mathilde von Altenstein {{caused him to}} fall into debt, and unable to afford to publish a new play he had written, Senefelder experimented with a novel etching technique using a <b>greasy,</b> acid resistant <b>ink</b> as a resist on a smooth fine-grained stone of Solnhofen limestone. He then discovered {{that this could be}} extended to allow printing from the flat surface of the stone alone, the first planographic process in printing.|$|R

"What {{would you}} say now," [...] asked Mr Tippet, seating himself on his bench, or rather {{on the top of}} a number of gimblets and chisels and files and pincers that lay on it; [...] "what {{would you say}} now to sitting from morning till night in a dusty ware-room, where the light is so feeble that it can {{scarcely}} penetrate the dirt that encrusts the windows, writing in books that are so <b>greasy</b> that the <b>ink</b> can hardly be got to mark the paper? How would you like that, William Willders--eh?" ...|$|R
50|$|Lithography is a {{technique}} invented in 1798 by Alois Senefelder {{and based on the}} chemical repulsion of oil and water.A porous surface, normally limestone, is used; the image is drawn on the limestone with a greasy medium.Acid is applied, transferring the grease to the limestone, leaving the image 'burned' into the surface. Gum arabic, a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.The stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a roller covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the <b>greasy</b> parts, perfectly <b>inking</b> the image.A sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.|$|R
6000|$|Or, again, {{you figure}} Kipps with {{something}} of {{the air of a}} young sacristan, handling his brightly virginal account-books, and looking, and looking again, and then still looking, at an unparalleled specimen of copperplate engraving, ruled money below and above, bearing the words [...] "In Account with, ARTHUR KIPPS" [...] (loud flourishes), [...] "The Booksellers' Trading Union" [...] (temperate decoration). You figure Ann sitting and stitching at one point of the circumference of the light of the lamp, stitching queer little garments for some unknown stranger, and over against her sits Kipps. Before him is one of those engraved memorandum forms, a moist pad, wet with some thick and <b>greasy</b> greenish purple <b>ink</b> that is also spreading quietly but steadily over his fingers, a cross-nibbed pen for first-aid surgical assistance to the patient in his hand, a dating rubber stamp. At intervals he brings down this latter with great care and emphasis upon the paper, and when he lifts it there appears a beautiful oval design of which [...] "Paid, Arthur Kipps, The Associated Booksellers' Trading Union," [...] and a date, are the essential ingredients, stamped in purple ink.|$|R
