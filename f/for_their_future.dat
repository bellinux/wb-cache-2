5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E
5|$|Demo {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Night Fishing began {{several days before}} {{the release of the}} band's debut album Go to the Future in May 2007. The band members formally proposed the album concepts to Victor Entertainment staff in June 2007. The album's official studio recording sessions began in September 2007 and concluded in October, and were entirely undertaken at Discovery Studio in the Maruyama Nishi-machi area of Chūō-ku, Sapporo. After the album sessions had finished, however, the band immediately kept on recording <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> projects. The album's track order was not considered until the very final mastering stages of the album. Yamaguchi did much of the album's final mixing himself personally.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} development of Johor Bahru was, however, halted when the Japanese under General Tomoyuki Yamashita invaded the town on 31 January 1942. As the Japanese had reached northwest Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of Batu Pahat, Yong Peng, Kluang and Ayer Hitam. The British and other Allied forces {{were forced to}} retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor.|$|E

5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{education}} {{of girls and}} women began {{in the middle of}} the 19th century and was intimately tied to the conception that society had of the appropriate role for women to assume in life. Republican education prepared girls <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> role as wives and mothers and taught religion, singing, dancing, literature, etcetera. Academic education prepared girls for their role as community leaders and social benefactors and had some elements of the education offered boys. Seminaries educated women for the only socially acceptable occupation: teaching. Only unmarried women could be teachers. Many early women's colleges began as female seminaries and were responsible for producing an important corps of educators.|$|E

25|$|In May 1918, by then in semi-retirement, Leverhulme {{bought the}} Isle of Lewis for £167,000 and in late 1919 {{he bought the}} estate of South Harris for £36,000; both in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. His plans <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> {{prosperity}} centred upon the application of modern science and his own business skills in establishing a large and thriving fishing industry. Although Stornaway had a good harbour, there were many disadvantages to Leverhulme’s plans for the port. Its remoteness led to additional transport costs for ice, fuel, packaging, {{and anything else that}} had to be imported, {{as well as for the}} fish products, almost all of which was sold on the mainland. The place itself was, for various reasons, unpopular with sailors, and the local population’s strict observance of the Sabbath had a negative affect on fishing operations, while catches of varieties of fish other than herring were unfeasibly small.|$|E

25|$|A {{law passed}} in January 1974, {{designed}} to protect members of the supervisory boards of companies who are undergoing training, was aimed at ensuring that the representatives of young workers and youthful members of works councils still undergoing training could perform their duties with greater independence and without fear of disadvantageous consequences <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> careers.

To stem the drain, people urged the British government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs – but this request was never accepted. However, the British did agree to creating the British Nationality Selection Scheme, which granted to a select 50,000 people and their families the ability to obtain full British citizenship without having to fulfill the ordinary requirements, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act, 1990. Under the act, the Home Secretary was required to register any person recommended by the Governor of Hong Kong (as well as the applicant's spouse and minor children) as a British Citizen. Any person who was registered under the act automatically {{ceased to be a}} BDTC upon registration as a British Citizen. No person could be registered under the act after 30 June 1997.|$|E

However, during the summer of 2010, the Suns let superstar Stoudemire go to the New York Knicks since they were guaranteeing him $100 million, and hired player agent Lon Babby as president of basketball operations. The team then paid over $80 million to acquire Hedo Türkoğlu, Josh Childress, and Hakim Warrick to not only replace Stoudemire, but also add bench depth.

On December 19, 2010, the Suns acquired Vince Carter, Mickaël Piétrus, and Marcin Gortat from the Orlando Magic, along with a low draft pick and cash considerations.
