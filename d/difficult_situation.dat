5|$|After Boroughbridge Pembroke {{found himself}} in a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation.</b> The opponents of Hugh Despenser and his father had lost all faith in him, {{but at the same time}} he found himself marginalised at court where the Despensers' power grew more and more complete. On top of this came his {{financial}} problems. On 24 June 1324, while on an embassy to France, he suddenly collapsed and died while lodging somewhere in Picardy.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Wilson {{appointed}} Lane to the Council of National Defense (CND), {{where he}} urged {{cooperation between the}} private and public sectors. He defused a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> for the CND when it decided to merge its male-dominated state and local organizations with the separate Women's Committee into a unified Field Division. Lane headed the Division, leading a board of five men and five women.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E

The search for new members ended with the arrival of guitarist Cris Bonacci and singer and keyboard player Jackie Bodimead, both from the all-female hard rock band She. She were playing in London clubs at the time, trying to get a record contract and attract the attention of the British music press.|$|E

The elimination of Day as a suitor for Honora Sneyd's hand placed Edgeworth in a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> and he resolved to end it by moving to Lyons France, to work, {{in the autumn of}} 1771.|$|E

Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche would {{be looking for a}} goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement.

5|$|Libya's prompt retreat {{took many}} {{observers}} by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire {{to host the}} OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, {{it would have been}} difficult to take the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, Holt's planned {{expansion}} to {{meet the}} military's needs was no longer needed. The company was left in a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation.</b> The types of tractors needed by the military were {{very different from what}} farmers needed. Their situation was worsened as artillery tractors were brought back from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company moved to focus less on agricultural machinery and more on producing road-building equipment. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.|$|E

5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation,</b> such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
5|$|In late September 1943, Morshead {{was summoned}} to New Guinea to relieve Herring by Lieutenant General Sir Iven Mackay, the {{commander}} of New Guinea Force, which he did on 7 October 1943. Morshead found a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation.</b> The Japanese not only held the high ground overlooking the Australian beachhead at Finschhafen, they were rapidly reinforcing their position and were about to mount a major counterattack. Morshead demanded and got critical reinforcements, including Matilda tanks of the 1st Tank Battalion. The Japanese counterattack was crushed. Morshead relieved Brigadier Bernard Evans of command of the 24th Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Selwyn Porter, who had commanded a brigade in the Kokoda Track campaign. Unlike most reliefs of senior officers in SWPA this relief, while controversial at the time, has attracted little attention since.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{found himself}} in a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> during the Indian leg of the tour. The team—mostly made up of RAAF personnel—had been ill with food {{poisoning}} and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent by long train journeys. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and threatened to abandon the tour or replace Hassett, an AIF member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots. However, the standoff was ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane to transport the team. On the playing arena, it was not a happy tour for Johnson and his men. They lost the three-match series against India 1–0 and recorded only one victory, against South Zone, in their nine matches.|$|E

Justinian hoped this would keep open the land route from the Balkans to Italy while containing the Gepids, who he considered a serious menace to Byzantine interests on the Balkan frontier. The Gothic War between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535; Justinian {{wanted to be able to}} rush troops to Italy if they were needed.|$|E
5|$|Once there, Innes becomes acquainted over {{drinks with}} a former boxer named Nelson Byrne.

Innes finds himself in a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> in an unfamiliar city, suffers a gunshot wound and his charge Wooley is involuntarily subdued with medication and kidnapped. Innes becomes the suspect in a murder investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, finds and rescues Wooley and learns that his supposed friend Byrne was the culprit.

5|$|The 162nd Division, {{concentrated}} {{south of}} Tasa, {{had been standing}} by to cross the canal since dawn on October 16. The division advanced towards the canal, but movement was hampered by the massive traffic jams on the roads leading to the canal. When Adan realized that Akavish was closed, he ordered a tank battalion to make a turning maneuver through the desert to reach Deversoir. When it arrived, Sharon contacted Adan, explaining Reshef's <b>difficult</b> <b>situation,</b> and requested that the battalion be placed under his command. Adan accepted, and Sharon in turn authorized Reshef's request to pull back and regroup, replacing his brigade with the tank battalion.|$|E

5|$|The company faced a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> {{again in}} 1967 when {{the total number}} of {{vehicles}} produced was just 381 units. At the beginning of 1968 VAT fired 40 of the 400 employees. Vanaja had its staunch customer base and the vehicles were generally well regarded but the overall market share remained low; in 1963 just 4–5% of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models, which made spare part supply difficult. Moreover, the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work. There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern forward control model B6-76 which was expected to become the next volume model.|$|E
5|$|The post of a Whip {{normally}} required {{silence in}} the chamber of the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand {{was involved in a}} <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his salary to £1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a <b>difficult</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
