Aims & Objective: to study age & sex distribution, to correlate symptoms & pulmonary function, role of HRCT as etiology diagnosis particular in interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, to study ECG & 2 D ECHO changes and to study pulmonary function test pattern. Material and Methods: This was the study of 25 cases of <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> in which various parameters like DLCO, PFT, 2 D ECHO, ECG, identification of etiology, assessment of prognosis & role of immunosuppressant, steroids were studied. The exclusion criteria was age < 12 years. Results: The age distribution was highest in age group of 50 - 70 years. Occupational <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> was more common in male while the connective tissue disorders are common in female which lead to more incidence of <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease.</b> Pulmonary function test is very helpful for prognosis. The patient with high pulmonary artery pressure had worst prognosis. HRCT is a useful tool for diagnosis of IPF without biopsy. Conclusion: <b>Interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> with moderate to severe pulmonary artery hypertension leads to poor prognosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Imatinibmesylate (imatinib) {{is a small}} {{molecule}} {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor administered to patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Although imatinib-associated <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> is uncommon, a few cases have been reported so far. However, in all these cases <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> developed during the use of imatinib. The present case is the first report of imatinib-induced <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> developing after discontinuation of the drug. Case presentation A 51 -year-old woman was administered oral imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Ten weeks later, imatinib was discontinued because of facial edema. On this occasion, chest radiography showed no abnormal findings. However, 2 [*]weeks after discontinuation of imatinib, she developed fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. Chest radiography and computed tomography showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates in both lungs. Examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed an increased proportion of lymphocytes. Imatinib-induced <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> was suspected, because no other cause was evident. After administration of corticosteroids, her clinical condition and chest radiographic findings improved. Conclusion We report a unique case of imatinib-induced <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> that developed 2 [*]weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Physicians should consider occurrence of imatinib-induced <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> even after discontinuation of the drug. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{predicting}} factors and evaluate the prognosis of <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> in dermatomyositis/polymyositis.

Dyspnoea and cough were the two most common initial presentations.

The prognosis of this {{syndrome is}} closely related to the severity of <b>lung</b> <b>disease.</b> Myositis can occur several years after <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> and some patients with <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> associated with anti-Jo 1 antibodies will not suffer from muscle disease.

50|$|Cough {{may also}} be caused by {{conditions}} affecting the lung tissue such as bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> and sarcoidosis. Coughing can also be triggered by benign or malignant lung tumors or mediastinal masses. Through irritation of the nerve, diseases of {{the external auditory canal}} (wax, for example) can also cause cough. Cardiovascular diseases associated with cough are heart failure, pulmonary infarction and aortic aneurysm. Nocturnal cough is associated with heart failure, as the heart does not compensate for the increased volume shift to the pulmonary circulation, in turn causing pulmonary edema and resultant cough. Other causes of nocturnal cough include asthma, post-nasal drip and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Another cause of cough occurring preferentially in supine position is recurrent aspiration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> {{encompasses}} {{a diverse group}} of chronic lung conditions characterised by distressing dyspnoea, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance and poor health-related quality of life. Exercise training {{is one of the few}} treatments to induce positive changes in exercise tolerance and symptoms, however there is marked variability in response. The aetiology and severity of <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> may influence the response to treatment. The aims of this project are to establish the impact of exercise training across the range of disease severity and to identify whether there is an optimal time for patients with <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> to receive exercise training. Methods/Design One hundred and sixteen participants with <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> recruited from three tertiary institutions will be randomised to either an exercise training group (supervised exercise training twice weekly for eight weeks) or a usual care group (weekly telephone support). The 6 -minute walk distance, peripheral muscle strength, health-related quality of life, dyspnoea, anxiety and depression will be measured by a blinded assessor at baseline, immediately following the intervention and at six months following the intervention. The primary outcome will be change in 6 -minute walk distance following the intervention, with planned subgroup analyses for participants with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, dust-related <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease</b> and connective-tissue related <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease.</b> The effects of disease severity on outcomes will be evaluated using important markers of disease severity and survival, such as forced vital capacity, carbon monoxide transfer factor and pulmonary hypertension.

5000|$|IPF {{belongs to}} {{a large group of}} more than 200 lung {{diseases}} known as <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> (ILDs), characterized by the involvement of lung interstitium. The interstitium, the tissue between the air sacs in the lung, is the primary site of injury in ILDs. However, these disorders frequently affect not only the interstitium, but also the airspaces, peripheral airways, and vessels. Lung tissue from people with IPF shows a characteristic histopathologic pattern known as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). UIP is therefore the pathologic counterpart of IPF. [...] The term 'idiopathic' is used because the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is still unknown. IPF usually occurs in adults of between 50 and 70 years of age, particularly those with a history of cigarette smoking, and affects more men than women. The diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of other known causes of ILDs and the presence of a typical radiological pattern identified through high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). In the right clinical setting, it is possible to make the diagnosis of IPF by HRCT alone, obviating the need for surgical lung biopsy.|$|E
