The majority {{have a large}} vertical central flue, with the thimble tubes protruding into it from a surrounding water jacket. These thimble tubes are formed by deep <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> - a process that was not available in Victorian times, but that became a cheap means of production once available. Hot gas enters from beneath and exits {{from the top of}} the boiler. To improve gas flow over the tubes, a series of horizontal disks are lowered into the central space on a rod or chain, forcing gas flow radially outwards, over the tubes. Cleaning these inward-pointing thimbles could be difficult. A 1954 patent by Clarksons describes a boiler shell with a sliding shutter on the outside to access the central flue.|$|E

It includes processes like rolling, drawing, pressing, spinning, extruding and heading, it is carried out below the recrystallization point usually at room temperature.

40|$|Cold <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> wires {{leads to}} an {{increase}} of their mechanical strength and to a drop in their ductility. The increase of their mechanical strength has long been related to {{the reduction of the}} various material scales by an intense plastic deformation. Besides, it was discussed in the companion paper that large plastic deformation leads to the loss of the material hardening capabilities and that, in such a case, residual stresses preserve the elongation to failure of wires. Experimental measurements of residual stresses inside the wire have therefore been undertaken. In this paper, lattice parameters as measured using synchrotron diffraction are compared with those calculated using the residual stress fields as determined by the finite-element method. There is a major disagreement between experimental and numerical results that is too large to be attributed to the errors of the finite-element analyses. Therefore, neutron diffraction experiments have also been performed. These measurements show that there is a significant variation of the lattice parameter with the drawing level, which is not inherited from residual stresses, and that variation is very sensitive to the cooling rate after processing. It is therefore proposed that cold drawing would induce a phase transformation of the steel, possibly a martensitic transformation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental and numerical results of rectangular cup <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> sheets. The {{aim of the}} experimental study was to analyze material behavior under deformation. The received results were further used to verify the results from numerical simulation by taking friction and material anisotropy into consideration. A 3 D parametric finite element (FE) model was built using the FE-package ABAQUS/Standard. ABAQUS allows analyzing physical models of real processes putting special emphasis on geometrical non-linearities caused by large deformations, material non-linearities and complex friction conditions. Frictional properties of the deep drawing quality steel sheet were determined by using the pin-on-disc tribometer. It shows that the friction coefficient value depends on the measured angle from the rolling direction and corresponds to the surface topography. A quadratic Hill anisotropic yield criterion was compared with Huber-Mises yield criterion having isotropic hardening. Plastic anisotropy {{is the result of}} the distortion of the yield surface shape due to the material microstructural state. The sensitivity of constitutive laws to the initial data characterizing material behavior isalso presented. It is found that plastic anisotropy of the matrix in ductile sheet metal has influence on deformation behavior of the material. If the material and friction anisotropy are taken into account in the finite element analysis, this approach undoubtedly gives the most approximate numerical results to real processes. This paper is the first part of the study of numerical investigation using ABAQUS and mainly deals with the most influencing parameters in a forming process to simulate the sheet metal forming of rectangular cup...|$|E

40|$|Large {{shearing}} and/or stretching <b>of</b> pearlitic <b>steel</b> {{leads to}} a re-orientation and alignment of cementite lamellas on the microscopic level. In this paper a macroscopic model formulated for large strains is proposed for pearlitic steel that captures this re-orientation by adopting an areal-affine assumption. The re-orientation of the cementite lamellas influences the macroscopic yield function via homogenization of the normals to the cementite lamellas. Thereby, the re-orientation {{leads to a}} distortional hardening of the yield surface. Additionally, the model is formulated in a large strain setting by using the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient and includes non-linear isotropic as well as kinematic hardening. The proposed model is implemented by using a backward Euler technique for the evolution equations together with the integration on the unit sphere to compute homogenized quantities. Finally, numerical results are evaluated and compared to experimental results for wire <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> pearlitic <b>steel</b> reported in literature...|$|R

For wires drawn with medium single draft (10. 4 %, 15. 5 % and 26. 5 %) the investigation of mechanical-technological properties was performed thereby providing results on yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, contraction, number of twist and number of band.
