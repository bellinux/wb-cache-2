5|$|The Clause {{does not}} require a jury drawn from the <b>judicial</b> {{division}} (a subset of a federal <b>judicial</b> district) within which the crime occurred; rather, the jury may be drawn from any division of the district. Nor does the Clause prevent the jury from being drawn solely from a <b>judicial</b> division, or any other subset of a <b>judicial</b> district (rather than the entire <b>judicial</b> district).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Judicial</b> {{branch is}} headed by the Massachusetts Supreme <b>Judicial</b> Court, which serves {{over a number of}} lower courts. The Supreme <b>Judicial</b> Court is made up of a chief justice and six {{associate}} justices. <b>Judicial</b> appointments are made by the governor and confirmed by the executive council.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong's current legal system, {{independent}} {{of the legal system}} of mainland China and Chinese civil law, inherits from British Common Law established before 1997. The guiding principle is an independent <b>judicial</b> system in which the Rule of Law, as opposed to Rule by Law, safeguards <b>judicial</b> courts from government intervention.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the earl's arrival, <b>judicial</b> {{and police}} powers in territories {{controlled}} by the company were a confusion of differing standards that were also either inconsistently or arbitrarily applied. Part of Cornwallis's work was the introduction of criminal and <b>judicial</b> regulations that to a significant degree still underpin the Indian <b>judicial</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{said that}} he would appoint federal judges in the mold of U.S. Supreme Court justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, and Samuel Alito. He {{advocated}} <b>judicial</b> restraint and strict constructionism as <b>judicial</b> philosophies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include <b>judicial</b> independence, natural justice, the availability of <b>judicial</b> review, and the accessibility of justice. <b>Judicial</b> independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of <b>judicial</b> independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of <b>judicial</b> review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Judicial</b> Nominating Commission is {{responsible}} for recruiting and interviewing applicants to fill vacancies on the Indiana Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court. It then sends three nominees for each vacancy to the governor. The <b>Judicial</b> Qualification Commission investigates complaints of <b>judicial</b> misconduct and files charges where appropriate. Both commissions have the same members and are chaired by the chief justice.|$|E
5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of <b>judicial</b> power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a <b>judicial</b> body involve the exercise of <b>judicial</b> power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a <b>judicial</b> body such as the court, involved the exercise of <b>judicial</b> power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the separation of powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{judiciary}} in {{the state}} consists of the Allahabad High Court in Allahabad, the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court, district courts and session courts in each district or Sessions Division, and lower courts at the tehsil level. The President of India appoints the {{chief justice of the}} High Court of the Uttar Pradesh judiciary on the advice of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India as well as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh. Other judges are appointed by the President of India on the advice of the Chief Justice of the High Court. Subordinate <b>Judicial</b> Service, categorized into two divisions viz. Uttar Pradesh civil <b>judicial</b> services and Uttar Pradesh higher <b>judicial</b> service is another vital part of the judiciary of Uttar Pradesh. While the Uttar Pradesh civil <b>judicial</b> services comprise the Civil Judges (Junior Division)/Judicial Magistrates and civil judges (Senior Division)/Chief <b>Judicial</b> Magistrate, the Uttar Pradesh higher <b>judicial</b> service comprises civil and sessions judges. The Subordinate <b>judicial</b> service (viz. The district court of Etawah and the district court of Kanpur Dehat) of the judiciary at Uttar Pradesh is controlled by the District Judge.|$|E
5|$|A <b>judicial</b> {{review of}} the {{development}} was launched in October 2016 by Vue Cinemas, who objected to an extra screen being approved at the site. Later that year, principal contractor ISG withdrew, citing rising costs and the <b>judicial</b> review, which was settled in the City of York's favour in January 2017. By May that year, construction had not yet began nor had a new contractor been found.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} <b>judicial</b> review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of <b>judicial</b> review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and <b>judicial</b> expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a decree}} from 1972, the Ministry of Justice {{prepared}} proposals for the codification of law; it carried out methodological management of legal {{work in the}} national economy. The Ministry directed and coordinated the work of state bodies and public organisations to promote legal knowledge and to clarify the law among the population about the <b>judicial</b> agencies, as well as general management of the civil registry, state, and legal profession. The Ministry was liable to the Party, the state, and the people. The Ministry's main goal was to strengthen socialist legality {{and the rule of}} law within Soviet <b>judicial</b> institutions.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton {{appointed}} 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 <b>judicial</b> appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of <b>judicial</b> appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive {{a vote in the}} Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84percent of his nominees were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law of <b>judicial</b> review. Instead, they borrowed from the common law by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits of <b>judicial</b> power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E

5|$|Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution {{governs the}} term length of Supreme Court Justices. When {{there is a}} vacancy on the Court, a new justice is {{nominated}} using {{a variation of the}} Missouri Plan. First, the <b>Judicial</b> Nominating Commission submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor. The governor then selects the new Justice from the list. If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days, the chief justice or the acting chief justice must do so. The <b>Judicial</b> Nomination Commission Chief Justice selects the chief justice from the sitting associate justices for a five-year term. The chief justice presides over the Court. When the position of chief justice becomes vacant, the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting chief justice until a new one is chosen by the <b>Judicial</b> Nominating Commission. The chief justice also serves as chairman of the <b>Judicial</b> Nominating Commission.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Ginsburg did answer {{questions}} about some potentially controversial issues. For instance, she affirmed her belief in {{a constitutional right to}} privacy and explained at some length her personal <b>judicial</b> philosophy and thoughts regarding gender equality. Ginsburg was more forthright in discussing her views on topics about which she had previously written. The U.S. Senate confirmed her by a 96 to 3 vote and she took her <b>judicial</b> oath on August 10, 1993.|$|E

5|$|Certain <b>judicial</b> {{functions}} are also {{performed by the}} Queen-in-Council, although in practice its actual work of hearing and deciding upon cases is carried out day-to-day by the <b>Judicial</b> Committee of the Privy Council. The <b>Judicial</b> Committee consists of senior judges appointed as Privy Counsellors: predominantly Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and senior judges from the Commonwealth. The Privy Council formerly acted as the High Court of Appeal for the entire British Empire (other than for the United Kingdom itself), and continues to hear appeals from the Crown Dependencies, the British Overseas Territories, and some independent Commonwealth states.|$|E
5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding <b>judicial</b> review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of <b>judicial</b> review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a complex}} <b>judicial</b> organisation, as a {{consequence}} of its status of county capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of Justice is the local <b>judicial</b> institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of Dej, Gherla, Turda and Huedin. Appeals from these tribunals' verdicts, and more serious cases, are directed to the Cluj Court of Appeals. The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals.|$|E
5|$|Customs, {{traditions and}} moral {{principles}} based on Buddhism {{were used as}} the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. Samantapasadika, a 5th-century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief <b>judicial</b> officer was known as viniccayamacca and there were several <b>judicial</b> officers under him, known as vinicchayaka. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue judgments. The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all cases against {{members of the royal}} family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power with care and after consulting with his advisers. Udaya I recorded judgments that were regarded as important precedents in the royal library in order to maintain uniformity in <b>judicial</b> decisions.|$|E
5|$|Delta County's {{government}} {{consists of}} a county judge and four county commissioners, representing four county precincts. The current Delta County judge is Herbert Brookshire, and the four commissioners are B. V. Templeton, David Moody, Wayne Poole, and Mark Brantley. The current county sheriff is Gerald W. Teague. In addition, Cooper is served by two Texas <b>judicial</b> districts. Judge Scott McDowell serves as judge of the 62nd Texas <b>Judicial</b> District, a position he has held since 2000. However, McDowell has announced {{that he will not}} be seeking another term. Cooper is also part of Texas' 8th <b>Judicial</b> District, which is served by Judge Robert Newsom. Newsom has served as 8th district judge since his election in 1997, but has also announced that he will not be seeking another term.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form of <b>judicial</b> review {{available}} under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately {{in a manner that}} cripples lawful democratic opposition, the absence of <b>judicial</b> review would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|Each {{state is}} divided into <b>judicial</b> districts presided over by a District and Sessions Judge. He {{is known as a}} District Judge when he presides over a civil case, and a Sessions Judge when he presides over a {{criminal}} case. He is the highest <b>judicial</b> authority below a High Court judge. Below him, there are courts of civil jurisdiction, known by different names in different states. Under Article 141 of the Constitution, all courts in India (which includes High Courts) are bound by the judgments and orders of the Supreme Court of India by precedence.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of <b>judicial</b> review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in <b>judicial</b> review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|Flournoy {{was present}} at the first meeting of the West Virginia Bar Association held on the date of its {{organization}} on July 8, 1886, in Grafton.

5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues that it would be difficult to explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of <b>judicial</b> review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified <b>judicial</b> review procedure.|$|E
