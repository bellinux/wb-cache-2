50|$|Fungal species {{within the}} phylum Basidiomycetes, {{including}} mushroom-forming species, experience {{a more complex}} reproductive cycle. They contain the ability to self-fertilize (homothallism) or more commonly require hyphae from two individuals of different mating types to make contact and fertilize (heterothallism). Heterothallic fertilization occurs once two haploid mycelia (homokaryons) of different mating types have made contact. They then exchange nuclei and migrate to form a dikaryotic hyphae (heterokaryon) containing two separate haploid nuclei, one from each parent. The dikaryon then grows and may produce a diploid fruiting body that immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid mycelia which can then be fertilized by another nucleus. The dikaryon can also simultaneously fertilize again by donating a nucleus to another <b>homokaryon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mushroom-forming fungi within Basidiomycetes produce sexually by the {{reciprocal}} migration of nuclei {{and have a}} male-biased OSR which aids in supporting that sexual selection is present within fungi. Although there are no traditional males present, there is variation between the mating types responsible for acting as the male or female sex role. Receiving mycelia act as the female gametes while the donating nucleus acts as the male gamete. Sexual selection might occur through male-male competition or by female choice. A study demonstrated that sexual selection does occur between the donating nucleus of the heterokaryon and the receiving <b>homokaryon</b> through the two nuclear types within the heterkaryon. These two nuclear types are in competition {{with each other to}} fertilize the <b>homokaryon.</b> Female choice between the nuclear types is also possible as there is a strong bias for one of the two nuclei. However, it is more supported that competition between the donating nuclei is more responsible as {{it has been shown that}} there is a variation in the success of various nuclei independent of the receiving mycelium. Some factors that may affect the nuclei’s success include faster mitotic division, increased migration, and possibly a mechanism that suppresses mitotic division in the competition. Most Basidiomycetes consist of two mating types, A and B, which are unlinked. However, the B locus codes for a larger amount of pheromones through subloci. Each subloci can produce many pheromones yet codes only one receptor resulting in a high redundancy of these pheromones. Although only one pheromone is necessary to fertilize, the presence of such a high amount increases the likelihood of that individual’s pheromones to be received. This characteristic is hypothesized to have evolved as a result of sexual selection.|$|E
30|$|When tuft {{formation}} {{was used}} to identify the karyotic nature of single protoplast regenerants (SPRs) of Rhizoctonia solani AG 1 -IC isolate CH- 1, one <b>homokaryon</b> type designated as A type and the parental heterokaryon designated as AB type were obtained. The <b>homokaryon</b> B type was not found. Various approaches were used to obtain SPRs, including from fast or slow growing protoplast regenerants, and from regenerants of protoplasts released from mycelia grown in different nutrient broths or at different temperatures. Without exception, all these SPRs were either <b>homokaryon</b> A or heterokaryon AB. Moreover, the SPRs obtained from different generations of SPRs, and from different generations of SPRs treated with lytic enzymes 3 to 4 times also were invariably either <b>homokaryon</b> A or heterokaryon AB. When single hyphal isolates {{were obtained from the}} tuft resulting from the pairing between <b>homokaryon</b> A and heterokaryon AB, only the heterokaryon and a variant were obtained. The variant did not form tuft when paired with parental heterokaryon AB or <b>homokaryon</b> A. Its protoplast regenerants gave rise to heterokaryon AB, <b>homokaryon</b> A and the variant, indicating that it is a new kind of heterokaryon.|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for the production}} of hybrid strains of the cultivated mushroom Agaricus brunnescens is described. <b>Homokaryons</b> were recovered from regenerated protoplasts obtained from several heterokaryotic strains. A total of 16 novel hybrids were produced in 63 attempted crosses between paired <b>homokaryons.</b> Recovery of both <b>homokaryons</b> and hybrids was verified by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Three of four hybrids fruited in small-scale tests, further confirming that the isolates were true hybrids. Colony morphology alone was found to be a poor indicator of hybrid status. In two instances, three <b>homokaryons</b> crossed successfully in all combinations, suggesting that {{there are at least three}} alleles at the putative mating-type locus. Crosses between <b>homokaryons</b> from commercial and wild-collected isolates indicated that these strains belong to the same biological species...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of fibronectin, a cell surface-associated transformation- sensitive glycoprotein, was studied in hetero- and <b>homokaryons</b> of normal and SV 40 -transformed human fibroblasts. In immunofluorescence, fibroblast <b>homokaryons</b> had an intense surface-associated and intracelluar fibronectin fluorescence {{similar to that}} of normal fibroblasts. Transformed cells and their <b>homokaryons</b> had a minimal surface-associated and a weak intracellular fibronectin fluorescence. In heterokaryons formed between transformed and normal fibroblasts, the {{expression of}} fibronectin fell within 24 h {{to the level of the}} transformed cell <b>homokaryons.</b> The change was detectable already at 3 h after fusion and was gene-dose dependent. These results show that the transformed genotype determines fibronectin expression in the heterokaryons...|$|R
40|$|Fusion {{of cells}} by {{polyethylene}} glycol results in <b>homokaryons</b> with lower membrane input resistances than their parental cells, but otherwise unchanged membrane properties. With these large cells, long lasting intracellular recordings {{can be realized}} which are impossible with single parental cells. <b>Homokaryons</b> often display hyperpolarizing (up to 50 mV) oscillations of their membrane potentials. In electrically non-coupled cell lines (HeLa, L, Cl- 1 D) the frequencies of these endogenous signals are 3 oscillations per min. Trypsinized <b>homokaryons</b> of electrically coupled cell lines (BICR/M 1 R-K, 3 T 3, BT 5 C 2) have frequencies of 0. 3 oscillations per min. By recording the membrane potential oscillations of two contacting <b>homokaryons,</b> the formation of low resistance junctions was followed - without applying exogenous signals - by a superposition of the individual oscillations. Our electronmicroscopical investigations revealed that the intercellular coupling through the membranes of <b>homokaryons</b> {{can be attributed to}} gap junctions...|$|R
30|$|Karyotic {{nature of}} SPRs or single hyphal {{isolates}} was identified by tuft formation. At the initial test, 10 SPRs were each paired with the parental isolate on PDCYA consisting of PDA amended with 0.1 % charcoal and 0.5 % yeast extract modified from the medium described by Butler and Bolkan ([1973]), and incubated at 24 °C under light for 4 days. Six SPRs did not form tuft {{indicating that they}} were heterokaryons just like the parental isolate, while 4 SPRs formed tuft indicating that they were homokaryons. When one of the homokaryons was paired separately with the other three homokaryons, none of the parings showed tuft formation, indicating {{that all of them}} belonged to the same type of <b>homokaryon.</b> Since R. solani AG 1 -IC has been reported to produce two types of homokaryons (Ou et al. [2008]), this type of <b>homokaryon</b> was designated as A, while the other not yet found <b>homokaryon</b> type was designated as B. The heterokaryon was designated as AB. Subsequently in search for the B type <b>homokaryon,</b> the karyotic nature of SPRs was determined by paring each SPR with an A type <b>homokaryon</b> and the parental heterokaryon AB. The B type <b>homokaryon</b> should form tuft when paired with A type <b>homokaryon</b> and heterokaryon AB.|$|E
30|$|When the heterokaryotic parent was {{paired with}} the <b>homokaryon</b> A, a variant was {{isolated}} from the tuft. The variant isolates did not form tuft when paired with the heterokaryotic parent or <b>homokaryon</b> A. The mechanism leading to such phenomenon remains to be investigated. When protoplasts {{were obtained from the}} variant isolates, the regenerants gave rise to heterokaryotic parent, <b>homokaryon</b> A or the variant, indicating that they belong to a new kind of heterokaryon.|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of complex}} gene {{families}} in the lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been hampered by the dikaryotic nuclear condition. To facilitate genetic investigations in P. chrysosporium strain BKM-F- 1767, we isolated a <b>homokaryon</b> from regenerated protoplasts. The nuclear condition was established by PCR amplification of five unlinked genes followed by probing with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Under standard nitrogen-limited culture conditions, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and glyoxal oxidase activities of the <b>homokaryon</b> were equivalent {{to those of the}} parental dikaryon. We used the <b>homokaryon</b> to determine the genomic organization and to assess transcriptional effects of a family of repetitive elements. Previous studies had identified an insertional mutation, Pce 1, within lignin peroxidase allele lipI 2. The element resembled nonautonomous class II transposons and was present in multiple copies in strain BKM-F- 1767. In the present study, three additional copies of the Pce 1 -like element were cloned and sequenced. The distribution of elements was nonrandom; all localized to the same 3. 7 -Mb chromosome, as assessed by segregation analysis and Southern blot analysis of the <b>homokaryon.</b> Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) showed that Pce 1 was not spliced from the lipI 2 transcript in either the <b>homokaryon</b> or the parental dikaryon. However, both strains had equivalent lignin peroxidase activity, suggesting that some lip genes may be redundant...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Phellinus arctostaphyli (Long) Niemela, P. igniarius (L. ex Fr.) Quel., and P. tremulae (Bond.) Bond. et Boriss., heartrotting hymenomycetes in {{the family}} Hymenochaetaceae (Aphyllophorales), all conform to a multi-allelic heterothallic mating system. Both {{compatible}} and incompatible reactions result from pairings of <b>homokaryons</b> from the same basidiocarp. <b>Homokaryons</b> isolated from different basidiocarps, but the same species, are fully compatible. Cultural characteristics are not useful in distinguishing between <b>homokaryons</b> and heterokaryons. However, heterokaryons exhibit significantly faster growth rate in culture than <b>homokaryons.</b> Antagonistic responses between paired homokaryotic isolates serve {{as an indicator of}} sexual incompatibility; sexually compatible pairs acquire the faster growth rate of heterokaryons. Antagonistic characteristics similar in appearance to sexual incompatibility occur between paired heterokaryotic isolates displaying vegetative incompatibility. These three species are similar in the variation of the nuclear condition throughout their life cycles. Basidiospores are produced with one nucleus, but are ordinarily binucleate prior to germination. Both <b>homokaryons</b> and heterokaryons have a variable number of unpaired nuclei between septa. The dikaryophase is delayed until basidiocarp formation, when the dikaryon can be found in young basidia and mycelium underlying basidia. Incompatible reactions in hybridization attempts support the segregation of these three closely related species...|$|R
40|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{was observed in}} the commercial button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, by examining two laboratory populations. The outbred population consisted of 20 compatible pairings, 10 <b>homokaryons</b> {{with each of the}} <b>homokaryons</b> Ag 1 - 1 and Ag 89 - 65. The inbred population consisted of 104 backcrosses (among which 52 were expected to be sexually compatible) obtained from the pairings of two progenitor <b>homokaryons,</b> Ag 1 - 1 and Ag 89 - 65, with 52 progeny <b>homokaryons</b> derived from the mating between Ag 1 - 1 and Ag 89 - 65. The eight fitness components examined for these two populations were successful matings as identified by the analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, positive mycelial interaction in these successful matings, heterokaryon growth rate, primordium formation by the successful matings, fertile fruiting body formation, time to first break, average number of fruiting bodies per square foot, and average weight per fruiting body. The outcrossed population showed a significant advantage over the inbred population in three of eight fitness components. Two pairs of traits were significantly correlated. The multiplicative fitness ratio of the inbred to the outcrossed population was 0. 18. The relevance of inbreeding depression to the evolution of fungal mating systems and to mushroom breeding is discussed...|$|R
30|$|As in plants, fungal {{lines with}} {{contrasting}} performance are commonly crossed to generate segregating populations {{and used to}} map genomic regions involved in traits and to identify candidate genes (Foulongne-Oriol 2012). This is usually done by protoplasting the heterokaryotic parental lines and recovering the constituent nuclei as <b>homokaryons</b> which are subsequently used for outcrossing. In the button mushroom, mating between <b>homokaryons</b> is controlled by one mating type locus (MTA) (Xu et al. 1993). Homokaryotic offspring can be used directly as a segregating population for genetic linkage mapping (haplotyping). Since <b>homokaryons</b> are infertile {{they have to be}} crossed with a compatible homokaryotic tester line to produce mushrooms for QTL mapping. Genetic linkage maps have been generated so far in both bisporic populations of var. bisporus and intervarietal populations (Foulongne-Oriol et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2015; Kerrigan et al. 1993). The- haploid genome size of A. bisporus is 30.4  Mb, it contains 13 chromosomes and has been sequenced completely (Morin et al. 2012).|$|R

30|$|Rhizoctonia solani Kühn is a {{widespread}} soil-borne plant pathogen causing economically important diseases {{in a wide range}} of crops (Anderson [1982]; Adams [1988]). It is desirable to apply organelle transfer to the studies of pathogenicity and genetics of this important fungal plant pathogen. A project was, therefore, initiated for the study of organelle transfer of the isolate CH- 1 of Rhizoctonia solani AG 1 -IC commonly used in our research (Liu et al. [2010], [2011]; Tsai et al. [2012]). For organelle transfer, it is preferable to use homokaryotic isolates. In R. solani, homokaryotic isolates are normally derived from single basidiospores (Whitney and Parmeter [1963]) or protoplasts (Phillips [1993]). Since R. solani AG 1 -IC is heterothallic (Qu et al. [2008]) and our numerous attempts to induce basidiospore formation of isolate CH- 1 also were not successful, protoplasts were used for preparation of homokaryons. In the process of <b>homokaryon</b> preparation, it was found that colonies derived from protoplasts of isolate CH- 1 consisted of heterokaryon and one type of <b>homokaryon</b> only. The other type of <b>homokaryon</b> was assumed to be defective and not viable. Moreover, a new colony type variant was obtained from the tuft resulting from the pairings between the <b>homokaryon</b> and the heterokaryotic parent. Details of the study are reported herein.|$|E
40|$|High {{yields of}} mouse macrophage-melanocyte heterokaryons and macrophage-macrophage <b>homokaryons</b> were {{obtained}} through the virus-induced fusion of cells spread on a glass surface. After fusion {{there was a}} striking reorganization of cellular architecture {{by means of a}} colcemid-sensitive process. Heterokaryons were isolated through the use of differential trypsinization and many underwent division to form melanocyte-like hybrids. The selective uptake of dextran sulfate by macrophages served as a useful cytoplasmic marker in identifying hybrids. Many characteristic macrophage properties were altered in the heterokaryons. Within an hour of fusion macrophage nuclei became swollen, nucleoli were more prominent, and increased nuclear RNA synthesis occurred. 3 hr after fusion, a wave of DNA synthesis took place in the previously dormant macrophage nuclei. The fate of typical macrophage markers was examined in both heterokaryons and <b>homokaryons.</b> Macrophage <b>homokaryons</b> continued to exhibit active phagocytosis of sensitized erythrocytes, whereas this capacity was lost irreversibly in heterokaryons. The loss of phagocytic activity of heterokaryons occurred at an exponential rate and was accelerated by high concentrations of calf serum. Another macrophage surface marker, a divalent cation-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), could be demonstrated histochemically on heterokaryons. Shortly after fusion, it was present in discrete regions, but it became more diffuse and disappeared within a day. Acid phosphatase-positive secondary lysosomes and retractile lipid droplets disappeared from heterokaryons but continued to accumulate in macrophage <b>homokaryons.</b> These observations indicate that typical macrophage properties cease to be expressed in heterokaryons, and melanocyte functions presumably predominate in heterokaryons and hybrids...|$|R
40|$|Field {{isolates}} of Rhizoctonia solani {{obtained from}} three discrete bare patches in a wheat field in Western Australia {{were characterized by}} pectic zymogram grouping. The genetic background of pectic enzymes was analysed by comparing the zymograms of asexual <b>homokaryons</b> and sexual progenies derived from field isolates. The 170 field isolates obtained from the field site produced indistinguishable pectic zymograms. However, variations among field isolates of the same zymogram group were detected, {{on the basis of}} zymograms of their resultant protoplast‐regenerated cultures. Asexual sibling <b>homokaryons</b> derived from each of the field isolates were heterogeneous for their pectic enzymes. <b>Homokaryons</b> with a common heterokary on incompatibility factor, obtained from a field isolates were homogeneous for pectic enzymes. Basidiospore progenies of a field isolate segregated widely in pectic zymograms. It appeared that the expression of pectic enzymes by field isolates involved multiple genetic factors. The variation of zymograms among homokaryotic strains suggests that each field isolate of R. solani contains two types of nuclei, although cells of vegetative hyphae are multinucleate...|$|R
40|$|Phellinus weirianus (Aphyllophorales: Hymenochaetaceae) {{causes a}} white heartrot of living Juglans {{and is the}} major cause of decay in Arizona black walnut. Infection is caused by germinating basidiospores. Tissue {{isolates}} fruit in culture, but single basidiospore isolates do not. The growth of tissue and single-spore isolates is slow to very slow. Cultural morphology is quite variable even among single-spore isolates derived from a single, culturally produced basidiocarp. Single-spore isolates, presumed to be homokaryotic, are derived from uninucleate spores that germinate and develop hyphae with paired nuclei. Lack of fruiting in <b>homokaryons</b> suggests that P. weirianus is heterothallic. Tissue isolates derived from basidiocarps produced in nature {{are assumed to be}} heterokaryotic. Hyphae of tissue isolates have nuclei that are not paired and are more numerous than those in single-spore isolates. Interaction zones are formed in pairings of heterokaryons, pairings of <b>homokaryons,</b> and pairings of <b>homokaryons</b> with the parent heterokaryon. Homozygous matings do not form an interaction zone. Agar-block decay tests show that single-spore isolates exhibit no appreciable differences in decay capacity from tissue isolates.

In this study, ability of RAPD markers, compared to morphological characters for identification of <b>homokaryon</b> isolates, was investigated. Based on morphological characters, 42 isolates were screened and exposed to RAPD markers. The results showed that RAPD markers could discriminate homokaryons from heterokaryons, based on number of bands generated. The numbers of band in homokaryons were significantly less than those of heterokaryons. Results also showed that cluster analysis, based on average of band number generated, could separate <b>homokaryon</b> from heterokaryon isolates.

40|$|Background - We {{investigate}} the scope for selection {{at the level}} of nuclei within fungal individuals (mycelia) of the mutualistic Termitomyces cultivated by fungus-growing termites. Whereas in most basidiomycete fungi the number and kind of nuclei is strictly regulated to be two per cell, in Termitomyces mycelia the number of nuclei per cell is highly variable. We hypothesised that natural selection on these fungi not only occurs between mycelia, but also {{at the level of}} nuclei within the mycelium. We test this hypothesis using in vitro tests with five nuclear haplotypes of a Termitomyces species. Results - First, we studied the transition from a mixture of five <b>homokaryons</b> (mycelia with identical nuclei) each with a different nuclear haplotype to heterokaryons (mycelia with genetically different nuclei). In vitro cultivation of this mixture for multiple asexual transfers {{led to the formation of}} multiple heterokaryotic mycelia, and a reduction of mycelial diversity over time. All heterokaryotic mycelia contained exactly two types of nucleus. The success of a heterokaryon during in vitro cultivation was mainly determined by spore production and to a lesser extent by mycelial growth rate. Second, heterokaryons invariably produced more spores than <b>homokaryons</b> implying that <b>homokaryons</b> will be outcompeted. Third, no homokaryotic ‘escapes’ from a heterokaryon via the formation of homokaryotic spores were found, despite extensive spore genotyping. Fourth, in contrast to most studied basidiomycete fungi, in Termitomyces sp. no nuclear migration occurs during mating, limiting the scope for nuclear competition within the mycelium. Conclusions - Our experiments demonstrate that in this species of Termitomyces the scope for selection at the level of the nucleus within an established mycelium is limited. Although ‘mate choice’ of a particular nuclear haplotype is possible during mating, we infer that selection primarily occurs between mycelia with two types of nucleus (heterokaryons) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} homokaryons of Schizophyllum commune, which carry various {{mutations}} affecting the incompatibility system, and a wild-type <b>homokaryon</b> were grown and examined {{for differences in}} the net synthesis of the cell-wall polysaccharides S-glucan, R-glucan, and chitin and in the activity of an enzyme hydrolyzing R-glucan (R-glucanase) in mycelial extracts and culture media. Only slight differences were observed for the accumulation of S-glucan and chitin. In comparison with the wild-type <b>homokaryon,</b> a very high S-glucan/R-glucan ratio {{was found in a}} primary B-factor mutant strain. Essentially, wild-type S-glucan/R-glucan ratios were restored in two strains in which additional mutations restored normal morphology: a strain carrying a secondary B-factor mutation and a strain carrying a modifier mutation in addition to the primary B-factor mutation. The S-glucan/R-glucan ratios in three A-factor mutants were intermediate between those of the wild-type <b>homokaryon</b> and the primary B-factor mutant. In young, growing cultures of the various homokaryons, except for the A-factor mutants, a correlation was found between the S-glucan/R-glucan ratios in the cell wall and the activities of R-glucanase in mycelial extracts. A certain specificity of the effect of the studied mutations on enzyme activities was indicated by the fact that, in young cultures, changes in R-glucanase activities were not paralleled by similar changes in the activities of laminarinase and maltase. The results can be correlated with particular morphological features of the homokaryons and, together with earlier results obtained with heterokaryons, indicate the activity of R-glucanase as an integral component of sexual morphogenesis regulated by the incompatibility factors...|$|E

In wild populations, pseudohomothallism was thought previously to play a major role, but recent analyses have found that significant outcrossing also may occur. We inoculated a standard substrate for A. bisporus cultivation simultaneously with homokaryotic mycelium from one parent and spores from a second parent. Culture trays produced numerous sporocarps that could theoretically have resulted from five different reproductive modes (pseudohomothallism, selfing or outcrossing via heterothallism, and selfing or outcrossing via the Buller phenomenon [i. e., between a <b>homokaryon</b> and a heterokaryon]). Most or all of the sporocarps resulted from outcrossing between the inoculated <b>homokaryon</b> and the inoculated heterokaryotic spores (or mycelia that grew from them).

Examination of the mt genotype of each individual fruit body for mt-specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms further confirmed that the mt genome was inherited uniparentally. The vegetative radial growth and the fruiting activity of two pairs of intraspecific heterokaryons, each pair carrying the same combination of nuclear genomes but different mt genotypes, were compared. Our results suggested that the mt genotype did not appreciably affect radial growth or fruiting activity. The failure to recover both heterokaryons, each carrying either parental mt genotype in any given cross, therefore clearly indicated that in matings of A. bisporus, the mt genome {{from one of the}} parental <b>homokaryons</b> is either selectively excluded in the newly formed heterokaryon or selectively eliminated in the immediate heterokaryotic mitotic progeny of the newly formed heterokaryon...|$|R
40|$|Multinucleated giant cells, {{characteristic}} of granulomatous infections, originate from fusion of macrophages, however, {{little is known}} about the underlying mechanism. Alternative activation of macrophages by exposure to IL- 4 and IL- 13 induces macrophage <b>homokaryon</b> formation. We have established a new quantitative bifluorescent system to study IL- 4 -induced fusion of primary murine macrophages in vitro. Using this assay, we could show that macrophage fusion is not mediated by a single molecule, but involves multiple functional components. Although several murine macrophage populations were not competent to form giant cells, indicating that they fail to display the full fusion machinery, these non-fusogenic macrophages could fuse with fusion-competent macrophages in a heterophilic manner. Since IL- 4 induced molecules were needed on both fusion partners, we conclude that at least two functionally distinct molecules mediate macrophage <b>homokaryon</b> formation with each present on one fusion partner. In addition, though IL- 4 treatment led to induction of a fusogenic status, macrophages could only fuse efficiently when adherent to a permissive substratum. Based on our findings, we conclude that macrophage fusion is a multistage process involving multiple target molecules. The model we describe will allow analysis of the molecular basis of membrane fusion and possible insight into alternative activation of macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Monokaryotic mycelia {{of several}} {{wild-type}} {{strains of the}} homobasidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea form abundant numbers of oidia both in the light and dark due to the regulation of oidia production by the A and B mating type genes. Nevertheless, {{little is known about}} whether and how the mating type loci and light signal regulate the oidiation in C. cinerea. Herein, the experimental results demonstrated that the self-compatible <b>homokaryon</b> AmutBmut strain, the mycelia whose nuclei carry mutations in both the A and B loci, can produce only a few oidia in the dark, whereas the formation of numerous numbers of oidia is induced by the light. The semi-compatible <b>homokaryon</b> AmutB, but not ABmut, has the production and behavior of oidia formation similar to those of AmutBmut. These findings indicated that in AmutBmut strain the mutation at the A locus results in repression of oidiation in the dark and the blue light alleviates this effect, whereas the mutated B genes function has no effects. Since, the oidia production relies on both A and light signal, it is possible that A locus might be linked to the blue light receptor genes. The present results demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the secondary hyphal knot formation(skn 1), fruiting body maturation (mat) and basidiospore formation (bad) genes which are essential in the C. cinerea fruiting pathway are not involved in the regulation of asexual sporulation. In addition, the positive light effect on oidiation could also occur in C. cinerea dikaryons...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{analyses}} of the lignin-degrading fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora is complicated by a dikaryotic nuclear condition {{and the absence of}} spore forms. Previous investigations had identified a family of closely related sequences encoding manganese peroxidase (MnP), but the relationship between genes and allelic variants could not be experimentally established. Addressing this issue, homokaryotic derivatives of C. subvermipora strain FP 105752 were isolated from regenerated protoplasts. Designated CsA and CsB, their homokaryotic nature was established by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the allelic variants of three MnP genes. Isoelectrofocusing revealed fewer MnP isoenzymes in filtrates of <b>homokaryon</b> cultures relative to the parental strain. The homokaryoti...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{expression}} of intermediate filaments of the keratin- and the vimentin-type was studied in heterokaryons of human fibroblasts and amnion epithelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fibroblasts and their <b>homokaryons</b> showed a fibrillar, vimentin-specific fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm but were negative when stained for keratin. Amnion epithelial cells and their <b>homokaryons,</b> {{on the other}} hand, showed a keratin-specific fibrillar staining, and only some of them contained also detectable vimentin. When suspended epithelial cells were fused with adherent fibroblasts, keratin fibrils spread within 3 h into the fibroblasts, intermixing with the vimentin fibrils. 1 - 3 d after fusion, both vimentin and keratin filaments were expressed as typical fibrillar cytoplasmic arrays, {{and the distribution of}} keratin in heterokaryons resembled closely that of vimentin. A typical cell-to-cell arrangement of keratin fibrils, seen in cultures of amnion epithelial cells, could also be found between heterokaryons. Treatment of the cultures with vinblastine sulphate induced coiling of the vimentin filaments in both homo- and heterokaryons, whereas the keratin organization was only slightly affected. Our results show that both vimentin and keratin filaments are incorporated into the cytoskeleton of heterokaryons formed between fibroblasts and epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Protoplast-regenerated {{cultures}} {{derived from}} mycelia of cereal-infecting field isolates of Rhizoctonia solani exhibited major variations in cultural morphology and in pathogenicity. Each field isplate yielded {{three of four}} distinct morphological types of protoplast cultures. The presence of the new morphological phenotypes was attributed to the selection of <b>homokaryons</b> arising from protoplasts with single nuclei. Highly pathogenic field isolates produced protoplast cultures with higher virulence than those from weakly virulent pathogenic isolates, and homokaryotic strains were generally less pathogenic than the parental field isolate...|$|R
