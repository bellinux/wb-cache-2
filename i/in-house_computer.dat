50|$|Keydata used a UNIVAC 490 {{computer}} to provide commercial {{applications such as}} inventory management and accounting applications on a network basis to slow Teletype-based terminals in customer locations and replaced <b>in-house</b> <b>computers</b> and other services with its highly customized parameter-driven distribution and manufacturing applications.|$|R
50|$|By {{the year}} 2000, this {{industry}} segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design {{on their own}} <b>in-house</b> <b>computers.</b> Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists.|$|R
50|$|The company {{objectives}} were twofold: to provide <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> processing support to Golden United Life Insurance; {{and to develop}} as an independent business in the computer time-sharing industry, by renting time on its PDP-10 midrange computers during business hours. It was spun off as a separate company in 1975, trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol CMPU.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st Century, the {{mainstream}} American comics companies moved almost exclusively to <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> lettering, effectively ending the era of the freelance letterer. Chris Eliopoulos designed the fonts for Marvel's in-house lettering unit, and Ken Lopez did the same at DC. Since then the trend has swung the other way, with most comics publishers once again using freelance letterers rather than in-house staff. Nearly all use computer and digital comic book fonts.|$|E
50|$|The 1980s were a {{time when}} the {{hospital}} continued to grow. A surgical wing was added in 1980, the entire inside of the hospital received a facelift in 1982 and the business office and data processing center was remodeled to accommodate a new <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> system. In 1985, a wing of the hospital was converted into an Emergency Urgent Care facility, including new state-of-the-art treatment facilities.

50|$|It {{is alleged}} that Scott Bloch erased the files {{on his office}} {{personal}} computer in 2007, and that the FBI tried {{to determine whether the}} emails were deleted improperly. The inspector general of the Office of Personnel Management examined the case at the urging of the White House. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2007 that Bloch called the tech support service Geeks on Call for help deleting computer files instead of using his agency's own <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> technicians. Bloch confirmed that he contacted Geeks on Call, but insisted that it was to remove a computer virus.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to complete an air waybill through a computerised system. Agents {{all over the world}} are now using their own <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> systems to issue airlines' and freight forwarders' own air waybills. IATA cargo agents usually hold air waybills of several carriers. However, it gradually became difficult to accommodate these pre-numbered air waybills with the printed identification in the computer system. Therefore a neutral air waybill was created.Both types of air waybills have the same format and layout. However, the neutral air waybill does not bear any pre-printed individual name, head office address, logo and serial number.|$|E

5000|$|IPSA sold time on its {{mainframes}} by {{the minute}} to customers across Canada, and rapidly developed into a major time sharing service in the 1970s. Long before the Internet, IPSA developed IPSANET to provide cheap telecommunications between the Toronto data center and IPSA clients across North America and Europe. Packet-switching also made their transatlantic links much more usable, since on previous equipment, frequent [...] "line hits" [...] would produce user-visible errors. As the network grew, and as Sharp APL was available on <b>in-house</b> <b>computers,</b> Sharp clients with their own mainframes could join the network, access their own or the Toronto mainframe from anywhere on IPSANET, and transfer data accordingly. The network eventually provided [...] "Network Shared Variables" [...] that allowed programs running on one mainframe to communicate in realtime with programs on another mainframe. This was used for file transfer and email services.|$|R
50|$|Pertec's final <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> {{design was}} a {{complete}} departure, the MC68000-based Series 3200. The primary operating system was an in-house developed multi-tasking, multi-user operating system, {{but it could also}} run Unix. As with the XL40, Triumph-Adler marketed the system in Europe under their own brand with the model name MSX 3200 (There were four models, eventually, in the Triumph-Adler series: 3200, 3220, 3230 and 3240). The key to disk application from the XL40 was re-implemented on the 3200. The other main application was a BASIC language driven database, similar to the ones used by MAI Basic Four or Pick operating system. These BASIC database business systems would be purchased by outside companies that bundled the PCC 3200 with their software to provide a complete small business package (accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll, inventory, sales tracking, taxes, etc.) customized for specific businesses.|$|E
50|$|Link Young was {{the product}} {{marketer}} that developed the total system approach for the M6800 family release. In addition to releasing {{a full set of}} support chips with the 6800 microprocessor, Motorola offered a software and hardware development system. The software development tools were available on remote time-sharing computers or the source code was available so the customer could use an <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> system. The software that would run on a microprocessor system was typically written in assembly language. The development system consisted of a text editor, assembler and a simulator. This allowed the developer to test the software before the target system was complete. The hardware development was a desktop computer built with M6800 family CPU and peripherals known as the EXORcisor. Motorola offered a three- to five-day microprocessor design course for the 6800 hardware and software. This systems-oriented approach became the standard way new microprocessor were introduced.|$|E
50|$|Joining IFT in 1961, Willey {{would start}} making changes within the Institute to {{consolidate}} the activities and services provided to its members. In 1966, publishing was reorganized and centralized in Chicago with a publications director being created that year. A Field Services director position was created in 1968 {{to act as a}} liaison between IFT sections and divisions. To assist in growth of IFT membership and circulation, IFT started using computer bureaus in 1972 and had developed an <b>in-house</b> <b>computer</b> system in 1982 that has been continuously upgraded. In 1973, IFT created the Director of Public Information which evolved into the Office of Scientific Public Affairs, then Science Communications, and is now known as of 2006 as the Science Communications and Government Relations with offices in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. IFT created the Marketing and Membership director position in 1979 and added sales staff in 1980. During his 26 year reign as Executive Director, changed from Executive Secretary in 1966, IFT's membership increased from 6,000 members with a $200,000 budget and a staff of Willey and his secretary in 1961 to 23,000 members with a $5 million budget and a staff of over 30 employees.|$|E
