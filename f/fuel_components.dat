25|$|Bioethanol is {{an alcohol}} made by fermentation, mostly from {{carbohydrates}} produced in sugar or starch {{crops such as}} corn or sugarcane. Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol {{can be used as}} a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the USA and in Brazil.

40|$|The {{effects of}} E 10 and E 17 on legacy <b>fuel</b> system <b>components</b> from three common mid- 1990 s vintage vehicle models (Ford, GM, and Toyota) were studied. The fuel systems {{comprised}} a fuel sending unit with pump, a fuel rail and integrated pressure regulator, and the fuel injectors. The <b>fuel</b> system <b>components</b> were characterized and then {{installed and tested}} in sample aging test rigs to simulate the exposure and operation of the <b>fuel</b> system <b>components</b> in an operating vehicle. The fuel injectors were cycled with varying pulse widths during pump operation. Operational performance, such as fuel flow and pressure, was monitored during the aging tests. Both of the Toyota fuel pumps demonstrated some degradation in performance during testing. Six injectors were tested in each aging rig. The Ford and GM injectors showed little change over the aging tests. Overall, {{based on the results}} of both the fuel pump testing and the fuel injector testing, no major failures were observed that could be attributed to E 17 exposure. The unknown <b>fuel</b> <b>component</b> histories add a large uncertainty to the aging tests. Acquiring <b>fuel</b> system <b>components</b> from operational legacy vehicles would reduce the uncertainty...|$|R
