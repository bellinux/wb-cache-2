Consequently, fraudster detection is crucial to ensure the continued success of online auctions. This paper proposes an approach to detect fraudsters based {{on the concept of}} neighbor diversity. The neighbor diversity of an <b>auction</b> <b>account</b> quantifies the diversity of all traders that have transactions with this account. Based on four different features of each trader (i. e., the number of received ratings, the number of cancelled transactions, k-core, and the joined date), four measurements of neighbor diversity are proposed to discern fraudsters from legitimate traders. An experiment is conducted using data gathered from a real world auction website. The results show that, although the use of neighbor diversity on k-core or on the joined date shows little or no improvement in detecting fraudsters, both the neighbor diversity on the number of received ratings and the neighbor diversity on the number of cancelled transactions improve classification accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art methods that use k-core and center weight...|$|R

40|$|A key {{trend in}} (electronic) {{commerce}} is {{a demand for}} higher levels of expressiveness in the mechanisms that mediate interactions. Recent results indicate the increase in expressiveness tends to lead to increased efficiency. Online advertisement (ad) <b>auctions</b> <b>account</b> for {{tens of billions of}} dollars in revenue annually and are some of the fastest growing mechanisms on the Internet. However, the most frequent variant of these mechanisms does not allow bidders (agents) to offer a separate bid for each ad position, and is thus inexpressive on a fundamental level. In this paper we attempt to characterize the cost of this inexpressiveness. We adapt a theoretical framework to show that the commonly used generalized second price (GSP) mechanism is arbitrarily inefficient for some distributions over agent preferences. We then describe a search technique that computes an upper bound on the expected efficiency of the GSP mechanism for a given distribution over agent preferences. We report the results of running our search technique on synthetic preference distributions. Our results demonstrate that the cost of inexpressiveness is most severe when agents have diverse preferences and relatively low profit margins. Our results also show that designating one or more positions as “premium ” and soliciting an extra bid for these positions eliminates almost all of the inefficiency. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study European banks’ demand for {{short-term}} funds (liquidity) {{during the summer}} 2007 subprime market crisis. We use bidding data from the European Central Bank’s auctions for one-week loans, their main channel of monetary policy implementation. Through a model of bidding, we show that banks’ behavior reflects their cost of obtaining short-term funds elsewhere (i. e., in the interbank market) {{as well as a}} strategic response to other bidders. We find considerable heterogeneity across banks in their willingness to pay for short-term funds supplied in these <b>auctions.</b> <b>Accounting</b> for the strategic component is important: while a naive interpretation of the raw bidding data may suggest that virtually all banks suffered a dramatic increase in the cost of obtaining funds in the interbank market, we find that for about one third of the banks, the change in bidding behavior was simply a strategic response. Using a complementary data set, we also find that banks’ pre-turmoil liquidity costs, as estimated by our model, are predictive of their post-turmoil liquidity costs, and that there is considerable heterogeneity in these costs with respect to the country-of-origin. Finally, among the publicly traded banks, the willingness to pay for short-term funds {{in the second half of}} 2007 are predictive of stock prices in late 2008. ...|$|R

40|$|Online {{feedback}} mechanisms {{have become}} {{an important component of}} electronic business, helping to elicit good behavior and cooperation among loosely connected and geographically dispersed economic agents (Del-larocas 2003). For example, eBay’s feedback mechanism is the primary means through which eBay elicits honest behavior and, thus, facilitates transactions among strangers over the Internet (Resnick and Zeckhauser 2002). Since most details of commercial transactions are unobservable to the market authority, the majority of online feedback mechanisms rely on voluntary self-reporting of transaction outcomes by one or both parties involved. As a consequence, not every transaction receives feedback. More importantly, self-reporting opens the door to several forms of reporting bias: traders may strategically misreport some outcomes, or may selectively choose to report certain types of outcomes and not others. If reporting bias is severe enough, posted feedback provides a distorted view of the risks that are associated with trading in a given market. Its usefulness, both in deterring fraud and in informing buyers, then becomes severely diminished. There are important indications that reporting bias is present in online feedback: Posted feedback in most systems is overwhelmingly positive. For example, more than 99 % of all feedback posted on eBay is positive (Resnick and Zeckhauser, 2002). A naïve reading of this empirical fact may lead one to conclude that more than 99 % of eBay transactions result in satisfactory outcomes. Such a conclusion runs against wide-spread reports of consumer fraud in online <b>auctions.</b> Internet <b>Auctions</b> <b>accounted</b> for 16 % of all consumer fraud complaints received by the Federal Trade Commission in 2004, the highest level of fraud of any Internet transaction type (se...|$|R

Another distinctive feature of this study is the implementation of a theoretically appropriate auction format for the primary allocation of emission permits. Our experimental results indicate that the EU ETS has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions, achieving targets considerably more restrictive than the current ones at high efficiency levels, both with auctioned and free emission permits.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{exchange}} renewable electricity (RES-e) capacity between EU member states improves {{the welfare of}} all member states since potentials and demands for RES-e capacity vary across the EU. This notion {{is reflected in the}} promotion of so-called cooperation mechanisms by the European Commission. The existing mechanisms appear, unfortunately, to be insufficient to facilitate an efficient level of trade in capacity across the EU; only a small quantity of energy is expected to be subject to cooperation mechanisms (Klessmann et al. 2010). In order to address these challenges, in this paper we propose a new mechanism for cross-border support of renewable electricity in EU. The guiding idea is that the cross-border mechanism allocates new RES-e generating capacity across EU Member States to where it is most valuable. This can, but need not, coincide with the most cost efficient allocation. The mechanism consists of two main elements. Firstly, a cross-border impact matrix that indicates the spill-over of benefits between member states induced from the power injection of additional RES-e generating capacity. Secondly, an <b>EU</b> wide <b>auction</b> in which member states and generators of RES-e bid prices indicating their willingness to pay for additional RES-e generating capacity. Then for given parameters the auctioneer selects the set of bids that maximizes an EU-wide surplus. We find that the mechanism leads to a decentralized optimization of RES-e support in the EU, by matching high willingness to pay of member states with low cost potentials of RES-e generation, but only if the benefits of RES-e are actually delivered for the member state paying for it. Moreover, the mechanism offers the potential to significantly reduce the barriers of the current cooperation mechanism, such as transaction costs or uncertainty about costs and benefits...|$|R

40|$|Bundling and pricing {{trucking}} {{services is}} an important strategic decision for carriers. This is helpful when they consider the incorporation of new businesses to their networks, look for economic and optimal operations, and develop revenue management strategies. Reverse combinatorial auctions for trucking services are real-world examples that illustrate the necessity of such strategies. In these auctions, a shipper asks carriers for quotes to serve combinations of lanes and the carriers have to bundle demand and price it properly. This dissertation explores several dimensions of the problem employing state-of-the-art analytical tools. These dimensions include: Truckload (TL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) operations, behavioral attributes driving the selection of trucking services, and consideration of deterministic and stochastic demand. Analytical tools include: advanced econometrics, network modeling, statistical network analysis, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic optimization. The dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter 1 introduces the problem and related concepts. Chapter 2 studies the attributes driving the selection of trucking services and proposes an econometric model to quantify the shipper willingness to pay using data from a discrete choice experiment. Chapter 3 proposes an algorithm for demand clustering in freight logistics networks using historical data from TL carriers. Chapter 4 develops an algorithmic approach for pricing and demand segmentation of bundles in TL combinatorial auctions. Chapter 5 expands the latter framework to consider stochastic demand. Chapter 6 uses an analytical approach to demonstrate the benefits of in-vehicle consolidation for LTL carriers. Finally, Chapter 7 proposes an algorithm for pricing and demand segmentation of bundles in LTL combinatorial <b>auctions</b> that <b>accounts</b> for stochastic demand. This research provides meaningful negotiation guidance for shippers and carriers, which is supported by quantitative methods. Likewise, numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits and efficiencies of the proposed algorithms, which are transportation modeling contributions. ...|$|R

These mechanisms minimize {{the cost of}} procurement {{and at the same}} time achieve desirable properties such as truthful bidding by the suppliers. In this paper, we investigate the design of truthful procurement <b>auctions</b> taking into <b>account</b> an additional important issue namely carbon emissions. In particular, we focus on the following procurement problem: A buyer wishes to source multiple units of a homogeneous item from several competing suppliers who offer volume discount bids and who also provide emission curves that specify the cost of emissions as a function of volume of supply. We assume that emission curves are reported truthfully since that information is easily verifiable through standard sources. First we formulate the volume discount procurement auction problem with emission constraints under the assumption that the suppliers are honest (that is they report production costs truthfully). Next we describe a mechanism design formulation for green procurement with strategic suppliers. Our numerical experimentation shows that emission constraints can significantly alter sourcing decisions and affect the procurement costs dramatically.

Our auction employs a novel clinching technique with a clean geometric description and only needs an oracle access to the submodular function defining the polymatroid. As a result, this auction not only simplifies and generalizes all previous results, it applies to several new applications including AdWords Auctions, bandwidth markets, and video on demand.

Estimation of BDM and kth price <b>auction</b> models that <b>account</b> for censoring of bids at the market price for maize (kenkey) and estimation of a conditional logit (CLM) model for the choice experiment that accounts for lexicographic references yield estimates of average WTP that are similar in magnitude across the three elicitation mechanisms. Variation in participation fee has no effect on estimated WTP in the two mechanisms that varied participation fee, suggesting that people did not have a higher propensity to spend out of windfall income. In the absence of information on the nutrient density of the new maize variety, subjects are willing to pay less for it than the existing varieties; however, nutrition information transforms this discount into a substantial premium...|$|R
5000|$|With Fouquet dismissed, Colbert {{reduced the}} {{national}} debt through more efficient taxation. The principal taxes included the aides and douanes (both customs duties), the gabelle (a tax on salt), and the taille (a tax on land).The taille was reduced at first; financial officials were forced to keep regular <b>accounts,</b> <b>auctioning</b> certain taxes instead of selling them privately to a favored few, revising inventories and removing unauthorized exemptions (for example, in 1661 only 10 per cent from the royal domain reached the King). Reform proved difficult because the taille was levied by officers of the Crown who had purchased their post at a high price: punishment of abuses necessarily lowered {{the value of the}} post. Nevertheless, excellent results were achieved: the deficit of 1661 turned into a surplus in 1666. The interest on the debt was reduced from 52 million to 24 million livres. The taille was reduced to 42 million in 1661 and 35 million in 1665; finally the revenue from indirect taxation progressed from 26 million to 55 million. The revenues of the royal domain were raised from 80,000 livres in 1661 to 5,5 million livres in 1671. In 1661, the receipts were equivalent to 26 million British pounds, of which 10 million reached the treasury. The expenditure was around 18 million pounds, leaving a deficit of 8 million. In 1667, the net receipts had risen to 20 million pounds sterling, while expenditure had fallen to 11 million, leaving a surplus of 9 million pounds.|$|R
