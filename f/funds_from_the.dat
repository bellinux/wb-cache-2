5|$|From 1833 to 1834, Jackson {{was engaged}} in {{removing}} federal <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War.

5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in rural areas. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but {{only a small number}} operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.|$|E

5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.

One-fourth of the money would support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E

The project was then transferred to a court-appointed receiver and later stripped of its EB-5 eligibility. In May 2016, the presiding judge approved a plan by two firms to buy out Dargey's share {{of the project and}} restart construction, pending approval from EB-5 investors; in October, the two companies signed an agreement to restart construction and re-brand the project.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to reduced}} demand for coal, {{resulting}} {{from an economic}} downturn, many of CF's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|E
