5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax <b>increase</b> <b>that</b> added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would <b>increase</b> <b>that</b> number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E

5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly. On 26 September 1995, {{the train station}} in Trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses, coaches and trains. The investment cost NOK50 million. In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if funding was not increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail. The 20% <b>increase</b> <b>that</b> year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in the country with the largest growth.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Reds {{talked to}} St. Louis about {{acquiring}} Chamberlain in 1889, but Cincinnati balked when St. Louis asked $8,000 for him. That year, Chamberlain pitched in a career-high 53 games {{and finished with}} 32 wins; his win total was the third highest in the league. Following the 1889 season, a new major league was forming known as the Players' League. A players association known as the Brotherhood of Professional Ball Players {{had served as a}} union and bargaining agent since the mid-1880s; now the group's new league was attempting to compete with established baseball. Browns owner Chris von der Ahe was afraid that Chamberlain would jump to the Chicago team in the new league; the manager of the Browns from the previous season, Charles Comiskey, had been hired there. Von der Ahe agreed to match the $800 pay <b>increase</b> <b>that</b> Chamberlain would have gotten in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Tickets to {{the game}} sold quickly at first, but trailed off as the game approached. Virginia Tech sold 5,000 tickets {{in the first three}} days after the Hokies were selected, but one week later, Tech managed to <b>increase</b> <b>that</b> total to just 8,300. In an effort to spur sales at the school, Virginia Tech {{athletic}} director Jim Weaver asked fans to buy tickets even if they did not plan on attending the game. The tickets could then be donated to charity. As an incentive for Gator Bowl officials to select Virginia Tech, the school agreed to sell 18,000 tickets—more than the minimum 11,500 North Carolina agreed to sell. When a shortfall resulted in Tech selling just 11,000 tickets, the school was forced to purchase the remaining 7,000, costing Virginia Tech $245,000. At North Carolina, tickets sales were even slower, with about 6,000 having been sold through the school two weeks after the matchup was announced. The Gator Bowl ticket office sold approximately 22,000 tickets directly to fans in the same timeframe, and Gator Bowl officials predicted a crowd of between 50,000 and 55,000 people at the game.|$|E
