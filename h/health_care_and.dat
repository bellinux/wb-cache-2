40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of unmet <b>health</b> <b>care</b> demands among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and to determine if these unmet demands indicate underuse. Methods. A total of 679 patients with RA participated in a questionnaire survey and clinical examination. Unmet <b>health</b> <b>care</b> demands <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> use were assessed for orthopedic <b>care,</b> allied <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> home <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>care.</b> Indications for underuse were determined by comparing health outcomes of patients with unmet <b>health</b> <b>care</b> demands <b>and</b> of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> users. Results. Of the 679 patients, 28. 7 % had an unmet demand for 1 of the 4 services: 13. 4 % for allied <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> 9. 7 % for orthopedic care, 9. 4 % for home <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> 6. 2 % for psychosocial care.

Unmet demands for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> are frequent among RA patients.
