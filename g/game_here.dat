[...] Also in 2013, she portrayed the title role in Oliver Hirschbiegel's Diana, a biographical drama about the last two years of the life of Diana, Princess of Wales.

The menus in particular are elegantly designed. The music and graphics are even great in creating a world that reminds us that {{the old and new}} can coexist, and do so with aplomb". Justin Davis of IGN criticized the episodic structure of the game however [...] "Players can't fully explore the game world until they're almost at the end – over 30 hours in!", however also praises the gameplay stating, [...] "What Dimensions lacks in scenario & story flexibility it makes up for with sheer depth and flexibility in its job system. Players can assign any party member to any available job on-the-fly, with more opening up as the story progresses." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer praised the gameplay but criticized the lack of fanfare stating, [...] "Despite the fun job system and classic vibe to the combat, Dimensions seems like it was set up to fail. It released to little fanfare at a prohibitive price point for mobile games." [...] Tof Eklund of TouchArcade praised the games features stating, [...] "There's an epic, high fantasy plot with lots of twists, a large cast of characters whose appearance and abilities vary wildly, tons of random combat, lots of leveling-up and abilities to unlock, a gradual opening up of the world, secret items, bonus dungeons, and a lot of looking inside pots and barrels in order to pilfer the worldly goods of the townspeople you run across." [...] GamesTM praised the game for resembling previous Final Fantasy games.|$|E

[...] Pocketgamer strongly criticized the gameplay and in-app purchase system stating, [...] "There's hardly a <b>game</b> <b>here</b> to begin with - it's more a series of flashing lights to try and entice you to throw some cash down, cross your fingers, and hope {{you end up with a}} character you like." [...] Slide to Play criticized the game for having [...] "No rhyme, reason, or strategy to gameplay; the game is a thinly-disguised piggy bank for in-app purchases." [...] Digital Spy echoed the criticisms on the method of in-app purchases and poor gameplay, stating that it was [...] "almost a parody of the worst examples of free-to-play games" [...] and criticizing [...] "its reliance on predatory in-app purchases that exist solely to make loyal fans waste their money. As a free-to-play cash grab it would have still held some appeal, but the core gameplay is just too shallow without significant rewards to make it even worth the price of admission." [...] 1UP.com also stated, [...] "ATB is essentially a narrow tunnel you blindly run down, and where games typically have choices for you to make -- whether it be what skill to choose, what weapon to pick up, what player to substitute in, what kind of unit to build, or whatever else -- there is nothing here." [...] In a rare move, IGN issued a public service announcement not to buy the game, and later cited the game for making money despite bad reviews and high prices. Pocket Tactics also gave a similar public service announcement to not buy the game stating, [...] "I have been an apologist in the past for Square Enix’s unusually high price points for its Final Fantasy iOS ports. [...] Developers have to make money, and no one should begrudge that. But the way that All The Bravest goes about it is so gauche, so ill-mannered, that it can only be interpreted as a measure of Square Enix’s disdain for its own fans." [...] Kotaku stated that the game is emblematic of Square Enix's lack of respect for fans, and a desire to milk the franchise for money. GamesRadar ranked it as the 44th worst game ever made. The staff accused its developers of cashing in on the Final Fantasy brand. US Gamer cited the game as being the most notable misstep Square Enix had done since CEO Yosuke Matsuda took over, though it also noted that the project had begun under the previous CEO Yoichi Wada.|$|E
