MethodsAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes (N= 40) and healthy controls (C; N= 43) were studied during the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles. C-Reactive protein, <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> and lipid levels were measured. ResultsAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes exhibited higher C-reactive protein levels than the Cgroup during the follicular (P 3 mg/l) in the luteal phase {{than in the}} follicular phase (37. 5 % and 17. 5 %, respectively); half of the overweight adolescents with Type 1 diabetes in the luteal phase reached this level. BMI was the only significant factor affecting follicular and luteal phase C-reactive protein levels in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. Lower <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> levels were observed during both phases of the menstrual cycle in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes compared with controls. An elevation in <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> levels in the luteal phase relative to the follicular phase was observed in controls, but not in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. Luteal <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> and C-reactive protein exhibited an inverse correlation (r=- 0. 4, P= 0. 01). ConclusionsAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes have higher C-reactive protein levels and lower <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> levels relative to controls, especially during the luteal phase. Type 1 diabetes diminishes the natural elevation in <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> levels observed during the luteal phase in controls.

40|$|A unique {{computational}} {{approach was}} undertaken to identify targets of miR- 17 - 3 p that impart an oncogenic potential to {{the cells of}} the prostate. Utilizing this approach, we identified <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor <b>1</b> (IGF 1 R) as a potential target of miR- 17 - 3 p.

IGF- 1 is a well-known growth factor associated with tumor growth. In glioma cells, IGF- 1 induced TLR 9 through HIF- 1 α signaling, mediated by Ras and calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMK II). Enhanced expression of TLR 9 induced by IGF- 1 resulted in the secretion of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and the elevation of CXCR- 4, a receptor that {{plays an important role in}} cell migration. CXCR- 4 may thus underlie the mechanism for TLR 9 enhancement of the metastatic potential of glioma cells (Sinha et al., 2011).|$|E

The IGF- 1 /Akt pathway has a dual effect on huntingtin-induced toxicity, since activation of this pathway also results in {{a decrease in the}} formation of intranuclear inclusions of mutant huntingtin. We demonstrate that huntingtin is a substrate of Akt and that phosphorylation of huntingtin by Akt is crucial to mediate the neuroprotective effects of IGF- 1.

The {{improved}} survival {{of even the most}} vulnerable low body weight preterm infants has, despite improving health outcomes, led to the resurgence in preterm complications including one of the major causes for blindness in children, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The current mainstay in ROP therapy is laser photocoagulation and the injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies in the late stages of the disease after the onset of neovascularization. Both are proven options for ophthalmologists to treat the severe forms of late ROP. However, laser photocoagulation destroys major parts of the retina, and the injection of VEGF antibodies, although rather simple to administer, may cause a systemic suppression of normal vascularization, which has not been studied in sufficient depth. However, the use of neither VEGF antibody nor laser treatment prevents ROP, which should be the long-term goal. It should be possible to prevent ROP by more closely mimicking the intrauterine environment after preterm birth. Such preventive measures include preventing the toxic postbirth influences (eg, oxygen excess) as well as providing the missing intrauterine factors (eg, <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1)</b> and are likely to also reduce other complications of premature birth as well as ROP.

40|$|In neurons, serum {{response}} factor (SRF) -directed transcription regulates migration, axon pathfinding and synapse function. We found that forebrain-specific, neuron-restricted SRF ablation in mice elevated oligodendrocyte precursors while inhibiting terminal oligodendrocyte differentiation. Myelin gene and protein expression were downregulated and we observed {{a lack of}} oligodendrocytes in mixed neuron/glia and oligodendrocyte-enriched cultures derived from Srf-/- mutants. Ultrastructural inspection revealed myelination defects and axonal degeneration in Srf-/- mutants. Consistent with our finding that neuronal SRF depletion impaired oligodendrocyte fate in a non–cell autonomous manner, neuron-restricted expression of constitutively active SRF-VP 16 affected neighboring oligodendrocyte maturation. Genome-wide transcriptomics identified candidate genes for paracrine regulation of oligodendrocyte development, including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), whose expression is repressed by SRF. Adenovirus-mediated CTGF expression in vivo revealed that CTGF blocks excessive oligodendrocyte differentiation.

These phosphorylations will cause the heterodimer to fall apart, and prevent it from deactivating Rheb, which keeps mTORC1 active.|$|R
40|$|Injury to muscles is very common. We have {{previously}} observed that basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (b-FGF), <b>insulin</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> type <b>1</b> (IGF- <b>1)</b> and nerve <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (NGF) are potent stimulators of the proliferation and fusion of myoblasts in vitro. We therefore injected these <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> into mice with lacerations of the gastrocnemius muscle. The muscle regeneration was evaluated at one week by histological staining and quantitative histology. Muscle healing was assessed histologically and the contractile properties were measured {{one month after}} injury. Our findings showed that b-FGF, IGF and {{to a less extent}} NGF enhanced muscle regeneration in vivo compared with control muscle. At one month, muscles treated with IGF- 1 and b-FGF showed improved healing and significantly increased fast-twitch and tetanus strengths. Our results suggest that b-FGF and IGF- 1 stimulated muscle healing and may have a considerable effect on the treatment of muscle injuries...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with increased risk and poor prognosis of many types of cancers. Several obesity-related host factors involved in systemic metabolism can influence tumor initiation, progression, and/or response to therapy, and these have been implicated as key contributors to the complex effects of obesity on cancer incidence and outcomes. Such host factors include systemic metabolic regulators including <b>insulin,</b> insulin-like <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1,</b> adipokines, inflammation-related molecules, and steroid hormones, {{as well as the}} cellular and structural components of the tumor microenvironment, particularly adipose tissue. These secreted and structural host factors are extrinsic to, and interact with, the intrinsic metabolic characteristics of cancer cells to influence their growth and spread. This review will focus on the interplay of these tumor cell–intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the context of energy balance, with the objective of identifying new intervention targets for preventing obesity-associated cancer...|$|R
