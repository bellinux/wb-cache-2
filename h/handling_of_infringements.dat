40|$|The {{infringement}} process {{contained in}} Article 258 TFEU {{and the related}} financial sanction in Article 260 TFEU have undergone some {{significant changes in the}} last decade. Although the relevant case law of the Court of Justice has remained static, the Commission has brought about changes in policy and administrative practice in its <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> files. Further, changes to Article 260 TFEU made the imposition of financial penalities more efficient. However, familiar questions remain. There is concern over legitimacy, transparency, and accountability in relation Commission’s role as ‘guardian of the Treaty’ with respect to the infringement process. The sanction process has been more dynamic but raises questions as to its efficacy and flexibility. This chapter discusses the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> and sanction processes over the last decade, examining the changes in theoretical approach and the administrative operation and policy choices of the Commission, and looking to their future evolution...|$|R

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} European Commissions {{policy on the}} {{centralised}} enforce- ment mechanism (contained in Art. 226 EC) {{in the light of}} its espoused commitment to good governance and legitimacy within the European Union. The Commissions ini- tial efforts in 2002 to reform its <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> process in the light of its own principles of good governance (openness, participation, effectiveness, coherence and accountability) were an interesting, although incomplete, attempt to reconcile the traditionally closed and secretive process of enforcement of Member States obli- gations with the twin agenda of good governance and bringing the European Union closer to its citizens. As a unique space of interaction for a multitude of actors, Art. 226 EC presents a valuable opportunity for the perceived unaccountable EU institutions to deliver valuable inter-institutional accountability. The glaring omission from the Commission s initial Communication was an indication of its strategy for coping with an enlarged European Union. The recent Communication (September 2007) from the Commission attempts to deal with this omission. Instead of continuing with its com- mitment to good governance, it is argued that the Communication could be seen as the final blow to any hope that the Commission s <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> process could be legitimised in its own good governance terms. The strategy seems to have turned inexorably toward outsourcing the responsibility of dealing with complainants to the Member States, not as a way of dealing with a vast increase in numbers of complaints, but in order to circumvent administrative controls being placed on the Commissions discretion...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{enforcement}} of competition policy and the activities of Turkish Competition Authority during 1997 - 2000. Descriptive statistics are provided on the caseload handled, such as types of anti-competitive behavior investigated, breakdown of investigations by industry, violations found, and penalties imposed. Competition Authority has been stretched in terms of manpower as it has faced a flood of applications {{in addition to having}} to develop the necessary secondary legislation. The most salient cases <b>handled</b> concerned <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> competition, while a rather lenient position was taken in authorizing mergers and acquisitions. The silence of the Turkish Competition Law regarding public undertakings is a potential source of problem for aligning competition policies with those of EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{cases of}} divided patent infringement: {{those in which}} two or more parties collectively perform all the steps of a patented claim, but where no single party acting alone has completed the entire patented invention. Despite the increasing frequency with which such cases appear to be arising, courts have struggled to equitably resolve these lawsuits under {{the constraints of the}} existing statutory framework because of the competing policy concerns they present. On the one hand, any standard that holds two or more parties strictly liable whenever their combined actions infringe a patent risks imposing liability on countless seemingly innocent actors who are unaware that their activities are being combined with those of another party to infringe a patent. On the other hand, any attempts to establish more restrictive conditions for the imposition <b>of</b> divided <b>infringement</b> liability have inevitably created loopholes through which parties can easily structure their activities to avoid incurring infringement liability. While scholars have previously recognized the difficulties presented by divided infringement lawsuits, this Article offers a novel explanation for why these cases have proven to be particularly challenging for courts to resolve. Specifically, although courts were historically well equipped to <b>handle</b> cases <b>of</b> divided <b>infringement</b> at common law through the imposition of contributory tort liability, Congress’s shortsighted codification of the law <b>of</b> patent <b>infringement</b> in the Patent Act of 1952 —and its narrow formulation of the doctrine <b>of</b> contributory patent <b>infringement</b> in particular—currently prevents the judiciary from relying on this common law doctrine to its full historic extent. This Article asserts that Congress should correct this mistake by enacting a new statutory provision to govern cases <b>of</b> divided patent <b>infringement.</b> By allowing courts to impose liability on any party who knowingly collaborates with another to infringe a patent, Congress can prevent would-be infringers from intentionally circumventing patent protection, {{while at the same time}} ensuring that innocent actors who may unwittingly contribute to an infringement are not unfairly exposed to liability...|$|R

It aims to analyze the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In the introduction the document compares unfair competition within the parameters of civil and criminal law. The following chapters examine in detail the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and further, separate chapters are devoted to specific facts of unfair competition. An additional goal of this thesis is the introduction and brief analysis of other offenses that may qualify as unfair competition, and compare them with the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Not only due to the possibility of criminal sanctions for unfair competition when all of the elements of the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code are not completely fulfilled, but also because of a possible single concurrent act with this offense. Based on the above, the text concludes by asking and answering the question whether the current legal regulation of unfair competition in the Criminal Code is appropriate and sufficient...|$|R

40|$|Studies on EU {{policy-making}} generally {{disregard the}} key {{role played by}} the Commission as an enforcement agent responsible for the instigation and continuation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> cases. Furthermore, the Commission employs both amicable (‘management’) and coercive means (‘enforcement’) to induce compliance by member states, which are reflected in the different stages <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> proceeding. In contrast to current research, this study incorporates the perspective of the Commission on non-compliance. Based on assumptions about the relation between the Commission and member states, it is assumed that different mechanisms drive the instigation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> proceedings and their escalation to later stages. Thus, it is predicted that conflict in the Council and member state low level of acceptance for EU policies increase the probability <b>of</b> instigating <b>infringement</b> cases. However, the same factors are expected to make escalations <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> to ECJ referrals less likely, because the Commission dependence on the cooperation of member states. The hypotheses are tested using a dataset on the policy preferences of the Commission and 15 member states with regards to 18 EU directives.
