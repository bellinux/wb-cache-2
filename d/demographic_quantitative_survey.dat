40|$|Though {{counselor}} {{education has}} always acknowledged {{the importance of}} work in the lives of individuals, there is a dearth of information concerning the worklives of counselor education faculty. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore work and life variables that impact the work experiences of faculty members in counselor education. This study examined demographic or life variables including gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, relationship status, and parenting status; and work-related variables including rank, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, salary equity, mentoring, teaching activities, service activities, publication for collaboration, and decision-making representation. Three hundred and twenty-eight counselor education faculty members across the United States participated in the study. Participants completed a mailed questionnaire including <b>demographic</b> information, <b>quantitative</b> <b>survey</b> questions, and related qualitative items designed to investigate work and life factors impacting the subjective work experiences of counselor educators. Chi-square analyses and analysis of qualitative responses related to four research hypotheses indicated that experience of the work environment for counselor educators is impacted by gender, tenure rank, age, and relationship status. Post-hoc analysis indicated that work experiences are also impacted by ethnicity, sexual orientation, and parenting status. Results also indicated a need for continuing attention to the effects of rank, salary equity, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and decision-making representation in counselor education programs. Results of this study suggested implications for future research in counselor education and counseling...|$|R

I will consider three ways of distinguishing interpretive research—in terms of its objectives, epistemological assumptions, and modes for analyzing empirical materials. My question, thus, becomes, Is <b>quantitative</b> <b>survey</b> research, as ordinarily practiced, capable of achieving interpretive research objectives, reflecting interpretive epistemological assumptions, and enabling interpretive modes of analysis? And, To what extent can survey research practices be modified to incorporate an interpretivist project? I offer these comments as a <b>quantitative</b> <b>survey</b> researcher who is struggling to understand the challenges posed to survey research by interpretive approaches...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this presentation is to emphasize the absence of sensory disabled people in <b>quantitative</b> <b>surveys,</b> among which the European Social Survey which {{will be used as}} an example. We will focus our examples on the case of the Deaf in the Belgium ESS round 6. Sensory disabled people represent a rather big population (around 4 % of Belgian population) but they are nearly absent in general <b>quantitative</b> <b>surveys.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} present and discuss some mixed-mode techniques to reach sensory disabled people and try to include them in general opinion surveys. Because every deaf cannot read texts, we couldn’t opt for a “classic” web based questionnaire, so an adapted version of the questionnaire has been set up. It is a web-based version that integrated videos of the translation of every question in sign language. We will show some results of the round 6 experiments that we did and show how our specific mixed-mode adapted procedures tend to prove that, with reasonable costs, it is possible to include deaf people in the general <b>quantitative</b> <b>surveys</b> and to reduce one of the specific non-response bias. The ethical issue is also at the center of our concern and the proposed techniques should contribute to a fairer use of the <b>quantitative</b> <b>surveys</b> and of inference. We will also focus on the translation procedures (from French into Sign Language) and on the associated risk of measurement error...|$|R

This follow-up survey was conducted as face-to-face semi-structured interviews undertaken by qualitative interviewers from the Centre for Housing Policy, University of York in late 2014 (November & December).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the way in}} which members of Generation X (those born between 1966 and 1976) and Generation Next (those born after 1976) talk about their experiences of the performing arts. I became interested in this topic after reading a recent National Endowment for the Arts study which revealed that members of these age 2 ̆ 2 cohorts 2 ̆ 2 attend the arts less frequently than any previous generation. This study called for more qualitative research, at the community level, on why young people do or do not attend the performing arts. While reviewing previous arts attendance research, it became apparent to me that the methods utilized in past studies, <b>quantitative</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>surveys,</b> have revealed little information about what motivates individuals to patronize the arts. The one exception to these demographic surveys was a qualitative study, conducted in Australia by Susan Kippax, which utilized in depth interviews to explore how arts attendance shapes the identities of regular patrons. This thesis examines how college students in an arts survey course feel about their experiences at nine different performing arts events through an analysis of their class journals. The study is framed by Pierre Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s theory of cultural capital, and examines how the students prior arts experiences (as determined by a questionnaire), and their knowledge of the set of codes and competences that are unique to each individual art form, impacted their appreciation of the events they attended. It is my hope that this thesis will generate interest in more qualitative studies of why people do or do not attend the arts, and will provide some insight for those who work in the arts on how to attract and retain young audiences...|$|R

Methodology: We used a sequential mix methods approach.
