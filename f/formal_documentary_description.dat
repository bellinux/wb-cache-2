Its reconstruction would also require the destruction of the city's oldest tree, a 370-year-old linden.On 3 February 2005, the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, signed a decree on the restoration of the Tithe Church, to which the state budget provides nearly 90 million hryvnia ($18 million).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} initial {{findings from}} an ongoing research project studying {{the social and}} organizational practices of technical reviews at NASA. Technical reviews are a ubiquitous part of organizational life in most technical organizations, {{and one of the}} most consequential in terms of risk and innovation management. At NASA, a series of formal technical reviews are conducted across the mission lifecycle, including preliminary and critical design reviews in conceptual design as well as launch and flight readiness reviews in mission operations. Additionally, less formal engineering peer reviews are often conducted as pre-cursors to formal reviews. While recent reports at NASA–most prominent the Columbia investigation report–criticize the inadequate practice of technical reviews, little is known about the specific behavioral impacts of review processes. The objective of this research project is to systematically collect much needed empirical data to model the functional and dysfunctional effects of formal and informal technical reviews on work practices, managerial decision making, and organizational culture. We introduce a novel conceptual framework distinguishing <b>formal,</b> <b>documentary</b> reviews and informal, discursive reviews as two substantially different sets of practices.

Copper {{production}} in southwest England peaked at 15, 255 tonnes of metal in 1860, while c. 12, 794 tonnes of tin metal represented its peak production in 1870. Technologies of varied efficiency were employed in the mining industry, which produced large quantities of unwanted material. Waste was frequently disposed of by flushing sediments into localwater courses. Much of this material was subsequently transported to the coastal zone. Coastal and river floodplain stratigraphi es indicate the presence of mine waste deposits. These are visually distinctive, consisting of finely laminated minerogenic-dominated strata which frequently exhibit a red-brown or grey-green coloration. The structure and text ure of these materials corresponds closely with <b>documentary</b> <b>descriptions</b> of mine 'tailings' or 'slimes'. Geochemical analysis of sedimentary cores from selected sites shows that coastal sediment sequences display concentrations of heavy metals in excess of that which may be expected from normal precipitation and weathering.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the current state of an investigation which aim is the construction of a <b>documentary</b> <b>description</b> model based on the object paradigm. The choice of this paradigm responds to the fact that its use allows the uncoupling between the logic model and its physical implementations; it autonomizes the model (the coherent and robust component of the system) of the computer supports, always varying and heterogeneus. In addition, this paradigm allows the invertion of the traditional methodology that makes the decision on what tools to use (support, software, operative system, databases) and then allows to compose an ad hoc model based on these tools. The language used is Smalltalk. Traditional methodology has derived in a proliferation of bibliographical formats adapted to different database models and the consequent applications that each one supports, and made necessary the creation of countless tools that allow the migration from ones to others. To start from the logic model, on the other hand, secures the coherence and consistence of information, for it frees it from instrumental conditionings. Although the proposed model is basically descriptive in this phase, this modellization configures a framework that will allow to use the objects in other contexts and environments to satisfy ends that go beyond the sole description. Despite the fact that this proposal surpasses the traditional approaches, it contemplates and takes advantages of the guidelines, precisions and possibilities studied and perfected over the years by different specialists, materialized today in different norms (AACR 2, MARC, Vaticanas, Dublin Core, ISBD, TEI) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{book is a}} {{monograph}} on the Chinese text Gaoseng-Faxian-zhuan (also called Foguo-ji, "Report on Buddhist Kindgoms") by the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian (last half of the 4 th - {{first quarter}} of the 5 th century), written {{at the beginning of the}} fifth century. It is the oldest 'travelogue' of a Chinese Buddhist monk, describing his journey through Central Asia to India and back to China by the maritime route via South-East Asia. The importance of this text was recognised at an early stage of the Western interest in Buddhism, as shown by the translation by the French Sinologist Abel Rémusat in 1836. Along with the other Chinese pilgrims' records, of which Xuanzang's is the most important, it is used as a primary source on Buddhist Central Asia and India. The 19 th century translations by Samuel Beal and H. A. Giles are now seriously inadequate, as is Li Yongxi's translation (without notes or commentary) from 1957, so there is a major need for a translation which takes account of the latest results of Buddhist Studies, Indian Studies, of archaeology and history of art. Deeg's book presents such a translation (into German), and includes a critical edition of the Chinese text, a historical introduction and an extensive commentary. An important feature of this monograph is that it incorporates the results of the latest Chinese and Japanese research. Unlike earlier scholarship on the Chinese pilgrim records, which read the texts as pure <b>documentary</b> <b>descriptions,</b> Deeg develops a method and an approach to the text which takes account of its Chinese context and evaluates its descriptive value in relation to Buddhist India. He also examines the genre of pilgrim records, and the cult of stupas and relics, thus putting the Gaoseng-Faxian-zhuan into its true historical context within the history of Asian religions...|$|R
40|$|In Aotearoa New Zealand, {{television}} documentary {{is a particularly}} significant genre through which Māori stories can be told from Māori perspectives. Additionally, the wide reach of mainstream television makes it an ideal platform for communicating Māori stories {{in a way that}} can advance inter-iwi and cross-cultural dialogue in Aotearoa. However, for decades, the ability for Māori documentary producers to have their stories told on mainstream television has been a very difficult task. This {{stems from the fact that}} te Ao Māori presents a different worldview from that of mainstream – predominantly Pākehā – audiences. Opportunities for Māori programming on State-owned broadcaster Television New Zealand (TVNZ) have been limited further since the advent of the Māori Television Service (MTS) in 2004. Focusing on the period 2000 – 2010, this study draws from interviews conducted with Māori documentary producers about the nature of their work and the challenges they have faced within the context of New Zealand television broadcasting. Further analysis situates producers’ experiences within relevant institutional and political contexts. Focus group sessions with young Māori media students supplement discussions about {{television documentary}} representations of Māori, and a <b>formal</b> <b>documentary</b> analysis of Hīkoi: Inside Out seeks to demonstrate the possibilities for kaupapa Māori documentary on mainstream television. Māori documentary producers understand their main role to be that of ‘storyteller’, a role that entails specific responsibilities to Māori. Challenges of access to mainstream television were mainly due to the increasing commercialization of networks and the disparate requirements of funders and broadcasters. Although policy initiatives have improved issues of access, variance between stakeholder demands limited the extent to which practices of tikanga Māori can be incorporated into production processes, further inhibiting the development of distinctly Māori narratives. While this study recognizes that the increased presence of Māori documentary across Tier 2 channels may be a future way forward, it also sees value in further discussion regarding the significance of TVNZ’s Treaty obligations alongside those of MTS to ensure adequate provisions are made for the inclusion of Māori documentary storytelling on mainstream television...|$|R

Nevertheless, over time, there is a gradual conquest of the city. Stepan settles down in the suburbs where life is not much different from rural. Later he moves closer to the center, rents a separate apartment. At the end of the novel, he feels himself the owner of the city: [...] "It lies humbly beneath wavy rocks, marked by points of fire, and stretches him from the darkness of the hills sharp stone fingers."In short, it is Impressionism: from fragments of things, people and sounds author makes a portrait of the city. As Stepan assimilates in Kyiv, it changes his perception.Changing of the clothes accompanies his becoming a proletarian. At the beginning, secretary of the bureau advises Radchenko to change clothes: [...] "All the Ukrainian woes are because of dressing badly." [...] Before the store with fashionable and expensive clothes Stepan still believes that it should only change his appearance and he can create something extraordinary. When he moves to a new house, Stepan burns his old clothes. During the novel one canobserve that Stephen rises the ladder of the city life. In Kyiv he becomes interested in literature, begins writing, and eventually, he becomes a famous writer. He was convinced that he went to conquer the city. Stepan thought the city needed [...] "fresh blood of the village" [...] that will change [...] "its appearance and being. And {{he is one of the}} changes which must win."

30|$|Given {{that there}} are about 6000 {{languages}} spoken {{in the world today}} (Lewis et al. 2015; Hammarström 2015), the quantitative coverage of SFL language description is infinitesimal and needs to be expanded. The need to expand the description base of linguistic science is, however, not limited to SFL. It has been noted in the literature that many of the worlds languages are either undescribed or have not been sufficiently described to warrant inclusion in samples for language comparison and typology (see Caffarel et al. 2004 : 60 – 61, Teruya and Matthiessen 2015 for discussions on language sampling). The need to describe more languages has become even more important since many minority languages are increasingly being displaced by dominant and regional ones (see Gikandi 2015; Hammarström 2015). Comprehensive language description, particularly from a functional linguistic perspective of the kind pursued by systemic linguists, is crucial for application in linguistic revitalisation. The inadequacy of <b>formal</b> syntax and <b>documentary</b> linguistics in revitalising critically endangered languages has been lamented (Austin 2015). SFL’s text-oriented approach to language, defined as a semiotic resource, can produce useful resources on endangered languages for revitalisation projects.|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{turbulence}} {{still remains}} one of the great mysteries of classical physics, its reputation for a chaotic lack of structure is under intense scrutiny. Research now points to the existence of highly organized large-scale structures within turbulent flows. Much of this research have almost exclusively been carried out within a so called fully-developed region of flow. This region is downstream of a point beyond which the flow field’s behavior is invariant. However, it has not been conclusively proven that a fully developed region actually exists. A literature survey found that most facilities are cited as being ‘sufficiently long’, yet no <b>formal</b> definition or <b>documentary</b> evidence of the fully developed condition is widely accepted.
