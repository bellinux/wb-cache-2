30|$|From Table  2, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the {{conventional}} TMR and QMR systems feature high FOM than the other TMR and QMR system implementations. This is expected because the basic TMR and QMR systems feature only the function modules and the majority voters, while TMR_WV, TMR_SHM and QMR_SHM incorporate extra error signalling logic or the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor.</b> More logic implies more area and consequently more power dissipation, and is found to be the cause for more propagation delay as well. Compared to TMR_WV, the proposed TMR_SHM exhibits a 22.6  % reduction in FOM; nevertheless, the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> is more advanced, robust, and can provide an early fault warning signal compared to the TMR_WV which embeds only the error signalling logic. Also, the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> is generic and can be tailored to suit any NMR system. In comparison with the basic QMR system, the QMR_SHM reports less FOM by 2.7 ×.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>health</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{is a key}} aspect {{of the field of}} {{medicine}} that has been practiced for a long time. A commonly used diagnostic and <b>health</b> <b>monitoring</b> practice is pulse diagnosis, which can be traced back approximately five thousand years in the recorded history of China.

In this paper, the basic concepts and theories of the two monitoring methods are first discussed. Similarities are then summarized and commented upon.

30|$|Referring to {{the chart}} shown in Fig.  7, {{it can be}} seen that the {{function}} modules dissipate extra power in the case of TMR_WV, TMR_SHM and QMR_SHM compared to those of their traditional TMR and QMR system counterparts. This is because in case of the latter, the function modules outputs are solely processed by the majority voters, while in the case of the former, the function modules outputs are additionally processed by the error signalling logic or the system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> and hence extra power is dissipated. Of the total power dissipated by the TMR_SHM, the proportion of power dissipated by the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> is 20.8  %.
