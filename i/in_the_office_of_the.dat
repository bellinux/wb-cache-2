5|$|The {{original}} constitution made {{no provision}} for a vacancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lieutenant governor; {{in the event of}} the lieutenant governor's death or resignation, the lieutenant governorship usually remained vacant {{until the end of the}} term.

In 1979 the constitution was amended to explicitly allow this: in the event of a vacancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lieutenant governor, the governor nominates a candidate who becomes lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term upon his approval by the Wisconsin Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate.|$|E
