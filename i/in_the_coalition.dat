5|$|Many of {{the troops}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> armies were inexperienced. The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, {{following}} the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With {{the exception of the}} British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.|$|E
5|$|He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 {{to discuss}} Musharraf's removal and the {{constitutional}} amendments, which the PML-N viewed as not going {{far enough to}} fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition {{did not have the}} two-thirds majority in both legislative bodies—National Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. The coalition criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the coalition could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 he {{returned}} to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences. There, representatives of KANU and KADU met with British officials to establish {{the nature of a}} new constitution. It was agreed that Kenya would be divided into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but that there would also be a strong central government and both an upper and lower house. At the time, Kenyatta was willing to make concessions to KADU on issues like regional authority, aware that he would amend these aspects of the constitution when in office. On his return, he accepted a minor post <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> government, that of the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs and Economic Planning.|$|E
50|$|The PT enjoyed strong {{representation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinets it led {{for most}} of the time that it was <b>in</b> office. <b>The</b> PT held the majority of cabinet positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first two <b>coalitions,</b> with its occupation of ministerial positions comprising 60% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>coalition,</b> 54.8% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>coalition,</b> and 46.5% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third <b>coalition.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 23 November 2009, the Coalition's {{climate change}} {{spokesman}} Ian Macfarlane {{agreed to a}} deal with the government to amend the ETS legislation. The amendments provided industry with substantial compensation and exemptions from the ETS. Turnbull took the deal to Liberal MPs for formal approval, but a majority of backbenchers opposed it. Turnbull nonetheless claimed he had the Coalition's support, by counting as supporters the 20 members of the Coalition Shadow Cabinet who he argued should be presumed to support the deal. This claim was met with rancour by his opponents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas {{formed a}} {{powerful}} coalition with the Samogitians, the Livonian Order, Daniel of Galicia (Tautvilas and Edivydas' brother-in-law), and Vasilko of Volhynia {{in opposition to}} Mindaugas. Only Poles, invited by Daniel, declined to take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> against the Lithuanians. The dukes of Galicia and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, an area ruled by Mindaugas' son Vaišvilkas. Tautvilas traveled to Riga, where he was baptized by the Archbishop. In 1250, the Order organized two major raids, one against Nalša land and the other against the domains of Mindaugas and those parts of Samogitia that still supported him.|$|E
5|$|The pope's new envoy, Alessandro Cumuleo, came to Transylvania to urge Sigismund Báthory to {{join the}} Holy League that the pope had set up against the Ottomans. The prince was ready {{to join the}} alliance, but Andrew and Balthasar {{emphasized}} that Transylvania could not secede from the Ottoman Empire without the participation of Poland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition.</b> Most of Sigismund's advisors supported their proposal, but his confessor, the Jesuit Alfonso Carillo, convinced him to continue the negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II. Carillo prevented Andrew from {{taking part in the}} negotiations in Prague. Before long, Andrew left Transylvania for Poland.|$|E

5|$|Cross {{served his}} {{first of three}} tours in the Balkans, {{attached}} to the Implementation Force (IFOR), in 1995–1996. His second was in 1997, with the Stabilisation Force (SFOR), where he commanded 101 Logistic Brigade, and his third in 1999 with the Kosovo Force (KFOR).

Cross was promoted to major general (two-star rank in NATO terms) in 2000 and served as Director General, Defence Supply Chain until 2002, when he became involved in planning for the forthcoming invasion of Iraq. He was the most senior British officer involved in the planning and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> Provisional Authority.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{agreement}} was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu and held them for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's Vũ Hồng Khanh became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement {{turned out to be}} a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused to approve a decree, the Vietminh official would do so. Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle. Meanwhile, Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events.|$|E
5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> government, Bruxner formed a good working {{relationship}} and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant {{problem was that}} Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E

5|$|Not long after, on 13 May Governor Sir Philip Game {{dismissed}} the Lang government and called upon the Leader of the Opposition and UAP Leader Bertram Stevens {{to form a}} caretaker government. Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and immediately called an election. Lang's NSW Labor Party was heavily defeated and the Country Party gained eleven seats and held five seats on the cabinet. Bruxner retained his seat again unopposed (he would be elected unopposed {{a total of five}} times during his term). This time, the Country Party was an equal partner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Sworn in on 16 May 1932 as Minister for Transport, Bruxner also briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio during the caretaker period until 17 June 1932.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 2013, the South African Press Association {{reported}} that five opposition parties, namely COPE, the IFP, the African Christian Democratic Party, the United Christian Democratic Party and the Freedom Front Plus, {{had formed a}} coalition with 20 specific priorities. The parties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition,</b> named the Collective for Democracy (CD) and chaired by COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota, will retain their own identity and contest the election individually. The IFP denied {{being part of the}} coalition, saying they were wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections. Three days later, the 20th, COSATU's largest affiliate National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) announced that they would not endorse the ANC or any other political party in 2014. NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective {{along the lines of the}} defunct United Democratic Front, with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election. An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU, with significant implications for the country's labour and political landscape.|$|E
5|$|The Rhondda {{also has}} a strong history of {{communist}} sympathy, with the Rhondda Socialist Society being a key element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> that founded the Communist Party of Great Britain. By 1936 there were seven Communists on the Rhondda Urban District Council and was publishing its own Communist newspaper The Vanguard. In the 1930s Maerdy became such a hotspot of Communist support it was known as Little Moscow producing left wing activists such as Merthyr born Arthur Horner and Marxist writer Lewis Jones. The Rhondda miners were also active in socialist activities outside the valleys. In the 1920s and 1930s the Rhondda and the surrounding valleys provided the principal support {{of some of the}} largest hunger marches, while in 1936 more Rhondda Federation members were serving in Spain as part of the International Brigades than the total number of volunteers from all the English coalfields.|$|E

5|$|Greece– November 2011– After intense {{criticism}} from {{within his own}} party, the opposition and other EU governments, for his proposal to hold {{a referendum on the}} austerity and bailout measures, PM George Papandreou of the PASOK party announced his resignation in favour of a national unity government between three parties, of which only two currently remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition.</b> Following the vote in the Greek parliament on the austerity and bailout measures, which both leading parties supported but many MPs of these two parties voted against, Papandreou and Antonis Samaras expelled a total of 44 MPs from their respective parliamentary groups, leading to PASOK losing its parliamentary majority. The early Greek legislative election, 2012 were {{the first time in the}} history of the country, at which the bipartisanship (consisted of PASOK and New Democracy parties), which ruled the country for over 40 years, collapsed in votes as a punishment for their support to the strict measures proposed by the country's foreign lenders and the Troika (consisted of the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank). The popularity of PASOK dropped from 42.5% in 2010 to as low as 7% in some polls in 2012. The radical right-wing, extreme left-wing, communist and populist political parties that have opposed the policy of strict measures, won the majority of the votes.|$|E
5|$|The {{summer and}} fall {{included}} various conflicts throughout the southern territories of the German states as the armies of the Coalition and the armies of the Directory sought to flank each other. By mid-summer, the situation looked grim for the Coalition: Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east-northeast despite Charles' orders to unite with him. It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would succeed in flanking Charles or driving a wedge between his force and that of Wartensleben. At Neresheim on 11 August, Moreau crushed Charles' force, forcing him to withdraw further east. At last, however, Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction, moving his corps to join at Charles' northern flank. At Amberg on 24 August, Charles inflicted a defeat on the French; that same day, his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg. Regardless, the tide had turned in the Coalition's favor. Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines, moving far into the German states, and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security. The Coalition's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau, similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben. As the French withdrew toward the Rhine, Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward. On 3 September at Würzburg, Jourdan attempted unsuccessfully to halt the retreat; subsequently at the Battle of Limburg, Charles pushed {{him back to the}} Rhine. Once Moreau received word of this defeat, he had to withdraw from southern Germany. He pulled his troops back through the Black Forest, with Ferino supervising the rear guard. The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4,000 prisoners, some standards and artillery, and Latour followed at a more sensible distance. The two armies clashed again at Emmendingen, where Wartensleben was mortally wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> victory. After Emmendingen, the French withdrew to the south and west, and formed for battle by Schliengen.|$|E
25|$|This opportunist {{alliance}} {{not only}} has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> partners themselves, can very easily result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> partner withdrawing its support from the government.|$|E
