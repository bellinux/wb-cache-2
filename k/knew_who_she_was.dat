5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of April 19, 2013, while in Atlanta, Georgia filming The Good Lie, Witherspoon and Toth were pulled over after the car in which they were {{traveling}} was seen weaving across a double line on Peachtree Street. Toth, who was driving, was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.139 and {{was arrested and charged with}} driving under the influence and failing to maintain a lane. Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E
500|$|Feige {{revealed}} that Captain Marvel, who {{is scheduled to}} appear in her own MCU film in 2019, appeared in an early draft of the screenplay, but was removed since the character {{had not yet been}} cast, saying, [...] "It didn't feel like the time. We didn't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> or how she came to be." [...] Whedon {{went so far as to}} shoot visual effects plates for Captain Marvel to fly into Avengers Tower at the end of the film; those shots were reused, however, for Scarlet Witch instead. Feige also {{revealed that}} an early draft of the script had Hulk's Quinjet detected near Saturn at the end of the film, but it was finally decided to keep it Earth-based and leave his fate ambiguous in order to dispel rumors that a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] comic storyline was in development, which Marvel Studios had no plans to adapt at the time. Marvel would later decide to adapt [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] for the film , in which the Hulk does end up leaving Earth.|$|E
500|$|Margaret's {{professional}} music {{career began}} during her final school year as singer-songwriter {{in the band}} oNieboLepiej (Much Better, formed in early January 2009), with whom she performed sung poetry. In 2009, she won the 254th episode of the Polish talent show Szansa na sukces (A Chance for Success), performing [...] "Znam Cię na pamięć" [...] ("I Know You by Heart", originally sung by Monika Brodka). After the win, she performed in the Szansa na sukces annual concert at Congress Hall in Warsaw. Margaret had appeared before on one of show's episodes in 2006, singing Stenia Kozłowska's song [...] "Będę czekać" [...] ("I'll Be Waiting"), and earned distinction In 2010, she appeared in Rent at the Szczecin Opera in the Castle. That year she became a singer-songwriter for the Margaret J. Project (also known as the Gosia Jamroży Project), a six-piece electropop band with R and hip hop influences which she created with music producer and bassist Adam Kabaciński. They performed in the semifinals of the 2010 Coke Live Fresh Noise competition. Although the group disbanded in November 2012, when Margaret decided to focus on her solo career, their [...] studio album was released online in 2013. In 2011, Margaret produced a fashion blog with music videos. In a 2013 interview with Gala, Margaret said that her manager discovered her through the blog. As her music career progressed, her blogging waned. Margaret recorded soundtracks for Polish television commercials early in her career, including [...] "Moments" [...] and [...] "It Will Be Lovely Day", which received radio airplay. According to Polish music manager Maja Sablewska, nobody <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> but her voice was [...] "ubiquitous". Margaret provided vocals for the 2012 biopic Bokser (Boxer) and the 2012 documentary Beauty and the Breast.|$|E
60|$|Ursula darted {{a sudden}} shy look at him. Obviously he was {{conveying}} the truth; {{he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
60|$|Perhaps Christina would know. Perhaps Christina would <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and how <b>she</b> got there. Nicholas {{climbed the}} stairs, {{swearing}} {{at them for}} creaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{not asking}} for your confidence. I'm simply asking you {{to explain why the}} sight of that young lady should be a matter of emotion to you. You <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> I am convinced. What else?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, Allen {{was signed}} to Regal Recordings; {{they gave her}} £25,000 to produce an album, though {{they were unable to}} provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other {{releases}} such as X (Coldplay) and Demon Days (Gorillaz). Allen then created an account on MySpace and began posting demos that she recorded in November 2005. The demos attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of [...] "LDN" [...] were rush-released, reselling for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes – My First Mixtape and My Second Mixtape – to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly (OMM), a magazine published in The Observer, took interest in March 2006. Few people outside of her label's A department <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> so the label was slow in responding to publications wanting to report about her. She received her first major mainstream coverage, appearing in the magazine's cover story two months later.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she did not}} {{use those}} words, at least, not that I can remember; {{but it was not}} necessary, I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> I have seen the {{sketches}} in your book, and there were several of them on the walls of your room. Of course I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> speaking of, though she did not, so far as I can remember, use your name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word. I don't {{think he}} quite <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> then. I fancy he has inquired since, by {{something}} he said yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said a girl--he did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> <b>Who</b> {{came out}} from the Council House crying aloud, and told the men at work among the ruins." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{wanted him}} to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> If he feared an enemy in her, there was yet time {{enough for him to}} close his doors against her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which shows my wisdom. The men in our {{garrison}} are mercenaries, all {{attached to}} us {{only because we}} pay them. They all <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> and what her wealth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She left nothing," [...] said Gabriel, simply, [...] "but her clothes. You {{know she}} put on a boy's suit--Johnny's clothes--when she left. Thet's how it allus puzzles me thet they <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> when they came across the poor child dead." ...|$|E
60|$|He followed, to find Lucy gone. His {{father was}} smiling, {{and his mother}} had wide-open hopeful eyes. A slim young girl, with freckles, grave sweet eyes and curly hair was {{standing}} by a window. She turned and devoured him with those shy eyes. From that look he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Amedroz shuddered at the {{expressions}} used. It was grievous {{to him to}} hear his daughter spoken of as one respecting whom some one <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and whence she came. Such knowledge respecting the daughter of such a family was, {{as a matter of}} course, common to all polite persons. [...] "Yes," [...] said Mr. Amedroz, stiffly: [...] "you know as much as that about her, certainly." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This {{piece is}} all about happy accidents. I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> when I found the recording. I bought it because it looked interesting. And it was very, very expensive." ...|$|R
50|$|Some aboriginals steal a {{child in}} rural Australia. Fifteen years later {{the father of the}} girl discovers her {{although}} he does not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> at first. Eventually the two are reunited.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much {{doubt about}} that," [...] he answered; [...] "look at her guns. The odd {{part of it}} <b>is,</b> too, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> flying no flag. We shall <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in a minute or two, though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... and to {{feel that}} he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> He usually sang this refrain to Lemuel {{when he came in}} late at night after a little supper with some of the fellows that had left traces of its cheer on his bated breath. Once he came downstairs alone in the elevator, in his shirt-sleeves and stocking-feet, for the purpose of singing it after Lemuel had thought him in bed.|$|E
60|$|I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> then, and Madame de Montausier told me I was right; {{but that}} I must keep the secret; and so I did, till after Queen Anne of Austria was dead. She {{would not let}} her rank deprive her of the {{privilege}} of waiting on the poor, unknown and unthanked; and many hours, when those who blamed her for indolence supposed her to be in bed, she was attending the hospital.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she glanced}} up as Ida came in. Clare had seen Ida {{in the street and}} <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> but she studied her with keen curiosity as she advanced. Her dress was tasteful, she was pretty, and had a certain stamp of {{refinement}} and composure that Clare knew came from social training; but she felt antagonistic. For all that, she indicated a chair and waited until her visitor sat down. Then she asked with a level glance: [...] "Why have you come to see me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] I protested, [...] "it {{is absurd}} {{for him to}} speak to her. Does he <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is?</b> The Princess Isobel of Waldenburg! Their little kingdom is small enough, but they play at royalty there." ...|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 {{appearance}} by Bret Easton Ellis received mixed coverage following his remarks, {{both at the}} festival and through Twitter, about Australian singer Delta Goodrem, commenting [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> but God <b>she's</b> really hot".|$|R
6000|$|... "Against her! well; I {{will not}} say that, for I {{do not wish to}} say {{anything}} against any young woman. But do you <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> Luke; and <b>who</b> her mother is? They are quite poor people." ...|$|R
60|$|Then there arose a dispute, which {{divided the}} company into nearly equal parties; {{as to whether}} the Ashwoods had got home from Europe yet. But it all ended in {{bringing}} the talk back to Phyllis Desmond's piano again, and in urging its pursuit upon Gaites, as something he owed to romance; at least he ought to do it for their sake, for now they should all be upon pins and needles till they <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> and what she could be doing at Lower Merritt, N. H.|$|E
60|$|Then, I looked {{round and}} saw the {{disturbed}} beetles and spiders running away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> or why we had struggled, or {{that she had been}} in flames, or that the flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.|$|E
60|$|I {{left the}} chamber, and {{presently}} {{stood in the}} garden. Although it was autumn time, the night in this mild climate was very warm and pleasant, and the moonlight threw black shadows of the trees across the paths. Under one of these trees, an ancient, green-leaved oak, the largest of a little grove, I saw a woman sitting. Perchance I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> perchance I had come thither to meet her, I cannot say. At least, this was not our first meeting by many, for as I came she rose, lifting her flower-like face towards my own, and next moment was in my arms.|$|E
50|$|Mia, another ghostly character, whose {{identity}} is never clearly revealed; Tecumseh's mother, grandmother and aunt Cassie <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> but the narrator never finds out; {{there are strong}} indications (e.g. Cassie's tattoo AIM - MIA), that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> Cassie's lost or abandoned daughter.|$|R
50|$|A {{woman is}} {{thrown out of}} her home by her jealous husband and sinks into depravity. Twenty years later, she finds herself accused of murder for saving her {{daughter}} (it was her son in all other versions) <b>who</b> does not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R

60|$|Now {{after that}} and while Sir Gawaine was still unarmed, he was {{suddenly}} aware that several people were coming thitherward toward him through the yellow woodlands, and when they had come pretty near he beheld that those who approached were a company in attendance upon a lady. And he beheld that {{the company and the}} lady who rode in the midst of that company were clad all in flame-colored satin, so that the entire woodland was illuminated, as it were, by a great shining, flaming fire. And when that lady had come pretty nigh to Sir Gawaine, he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and wist that she was the Lady Vivien.|$|E
60|$|It {{was easy}} to explain to Scatcherd that the child had not lived. There was a parting {{interview}} between the brother and sister in the jail, during which, with real tears and unaffected sorrow, the mother thus accounted for the offspring of her shame. Then she started, fortunate in her coming fortunes; and the doctor took with him his charge to the new country {{in which they were}} both to live. There he found for her a fitting home till she should be old enough to sit at his table and live in his bachelor house; and no one but old Mr Gresham <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> or whence she had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't {{tell her}} the truth," [...] he said, [...] "without {{awakening}} painful recollections of her stay at Aldborough, into which I am {{not at liberty to}} enter. Don't acknowledge just yet that Mr. Kirke only knew her as Miss Bygrave of North Shingles when he found her in this house. Tell her boldly that he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> and that he felt (what she must feel) that he had a hereditary right to help and protect her as his father's son. I am, as I have already told you," [...] continued the captain, sticking fast to his old assertion, [...] "a distant relative of the Combe-Raven family; and, if there is nobody else at hand to help you through this difficulty, my services are freely at your disposal." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{last time}} she saw him, he looked quite bewildered. Around that time, Margaret Doughty, née McKechnie met him a last time, walking on the Edinburgh streets. During the conversation, Margaret {{realised}} he did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{and that he had}} very much mentally declined.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{begins with}} the words [...] "There's been an accident! Something's wrong!" [...] - and {{something}} is. There <b>is</b> a ghost. <b>She</b> does not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> or how <b>she</b> died, or quite where <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> All <b>she</b> knows <b>is</b> {{that there has been}} a terrible accident.|$|R
6000|$|Schwartz laughed. [...] "Quite right, little man, {{how should}} you <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is?</b> My sister's the nurse. She's hired by Doctor Dormann, and she'll {{be here in}} an hour's time. I say! that's a pretty bottle you're hiding there under your coat. Is there any wine in it?" ...|$|R
