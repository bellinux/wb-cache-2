5|$|Many {{contemporary}} uses {{of uranium}} exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 {{is the only}} naturally occurring <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope,</b> which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope,</b> uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 {{and to a lesser}} degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography.|$|E
25|$|Natural uranium {{contains}} only 0.7% of the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> uranium-235. Most {{of the remaining}} 99.3% is uranium-238 which is not fissile but can be converted in a reactor to the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> plutonium-239. Heavy water (deuterium oxide, D2O) is used as moderator and coolant.|$|E
25|$|Such {{reactors}} can {{no longer}} form on Earth in its present geologic period. Radioactive decay of formerly abundant uranium-235 over the time span of {{hundreds of millions of}} years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction.|$|E
50|$|Only <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> {{of certain}} {{elements}} {{have the potential}} for use in nuclear weapons. For such use, the concentration of <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> uranium-235 and plutonium-239 in the element used must be sufficiently high. Uranium from natural sources is enriched by isotope separation, and plutonium is produced in a suitable nuclear reactor.|$|R
50|$|Fission chain {{reactions}} {{occur because}} of interactions between neutrons and <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> (such as 235U). The chain reaction requires both {{the release of}} neutrons from <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> undergoing nuclear fission and the subsequent absorption {{of some of these}} neutrons in <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes.</b> When an atom undergoes nuclear fission, a few neutrons (the exact number depends on several factors) are ejected from the reaction. These free neutrons will then interact with the surrounding medium, and if more fissile fuel is present, some may be absorbed and cause more fissions. Thus, the cycle repeats to give a reaction that is self-sustaining.|$|R

25|$|The Corps' Manhattan Engineer District (MED) {{managed the}} {{acquisition}} and clearing. The K-25, S-50, and Y-12 plants were each built in Oak Ridge {{to separate the}} <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> uranium-235 from natural uranium, which consists almost entirely of the isotope uranium-238. During construction of the magnets, which were required for the process that would separate the uranium at the Y-12 site, a shortage of copper forced the MED to borrow 14,700 tons of silver bullion from the United States Treasury {{to be used for}} electrical conductors for the electromagnet coils as a substitute. The X-10 site, now the location of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was established as a pilot plant for production of plutonium using the Graphite Reactor.|$|E
25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power reactor, {{there are two types}} of fuel. The first is fissile material, which splits when hit by neutrons, {{releasing}} a large amount of energy and also releasing two or three new neutrons. These can split more fissile material, resulting in a continued chain reaction. Examples of fissile fuels are U-233, U-235 and Pu-239. The second type of fuel is called fertile. Examples of fertile fuel are Th-232 (mined thorium) and U-238 (mined uranium). Often the amount of fertile fuel in the reactor is far greater than the amount of fissile, but it cannot be fissioned directly. It must first absorb one of the 2 or 3 neutrons produced in the fission process, which is called neutron capture, then it becomes a <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> by radioactive decay. This process is called breeding.|$|E
25|$|Criticality {{in nature}} is uncommon. At three ore {{deposits}} at Oklo in Gabon, sixteen sites (the so-called Oklo Fossil Reactors) {{have been discovered}} at which self-sustaining nuclear fission took place approximately 2billion years ago. Unknown until 1972 (but postulated by Paul Kuroda in 1956), when French physicist Francis Perrin discovered the Oklo Fossil Reactors, it was realized that nature had beaten humans to the punch. Large-scale natural uranium fission chain reactions, moderated by normal water, had occurred far {{in the past and}} would not be possible now. This ancient process was able to use normal water as a moderator only because 2billion years before the present, natural uranium was richer in the shorter-lived <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> 235U (about 3%), than natural uranium available today (which is only 0.7%, and must be enriched to 3% to be usable in light-water reactors).|$|E

5000|$|Some {{reactors}} {{do not use}} moderators to {{slow the}} neutrons. Like nuclear weapons, which also use unmoderated or [...] "fast" [...] neutrons, these fast-neutron reactors require much higher concentrations of <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> in order to sustain a chain reaction. They are also capable of breeding <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> from fertile materials; a breeder reactor is one that generates more fissile material in this way than it consumes.|$|R

500|$|Uranium-238 is not fissile, but is {{a fertile}} isotope, because after neutron {{activation}} it can produce plutonium-239, another <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope.</b> Indeed, the 238U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium-239. 239U decays by beta emission to neptunium-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, {{within a few days}} into plutonium-239. 239Pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the [...] "Trinity test" [...] on 15 July 1945 in New Mexico.|$|E
500|$|In September 1941, Oliphant {{met with}} Lawrence and Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where they {{showed him the}} site for the new [...] cyclotron. Oliphant in turn took the Americans to task for not {{following}} up the recommendations of the British MAUD Committee, which advocated a program to develop an atomic bomb. Lawrence had already thought about the problem of separating the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> uranium-235 from uranium-238, a process known today as uranium enrichment. Separating uranium isotopes was difficult because the two isotopes have very nearly identical chemical properties, and could only be separated gradually using their small mass differences. [...] Separating isotopes with a mass spectrometer was a technique Oliphant had pioneered with lithium in 1934.|$|E
500|$|Even at such long odds, {{the danger}} was {{sufficiently}} {{great to be}} taken seriously. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying {{out a series of}} experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing. But at Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a strikingly different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on the University's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, the only <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> found in significant quantity in nature, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as [...] would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.|$|E

To be considered <b>fissile,</b> an <b>isotope's</b> atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei.|$|R

2500|$|... breeder {{reactors}} {{are intended}} to produce nuclear fuels in bulk from more abundant isotopes. The better known fast breeder reactor makes 239Pu (a nuclear fuel) from the naturally very abundant 238U (not a nuclear fuel). Thermal breeder reactors previously tested using 232Th to breed the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> 233U (thorium fuel cycle) continue to be studied and developed.|$|E
2500|$|In England, James Chadwick {{proposed}} {{an atomic bomb}} utilizing natural uranium, based on a paper by Rudolf Peierls with the mass needed for critical state being 30–40tons. In America, J.Robert Oppenheimer thought that a cube of uranium deuteride 10cm on a side (about 11kg of uranium) might [...] "blow itself to hell." [...] In this design it was still thought that a moderator {{would need to be}} used for nuclear bomb fission (this {{turned out not to be}} the case if the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> was separated). In December, Werner Heisenberg delivered a report to the German Ministry of War on the possibility of a uranium bomb. Most of these models were still under the assumption that the bombs would be powered by slow neutron reactions—and thus be similar to a reactor undergoing a meltdown.|$|E
2500|$|Fissionable, non-fissile {{isotopes}} {{can be used}} as {{fission energy}} source even without a chain reaction. Bombarding 238U with fast neutrons induces fissions, releasing energy as long as the external neutron source is present. This is an important effect in all reactors where fast neutrons from the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> can cause the fission of nearby 238U nuclei, which means that some small part of the 238U is [...] "burned-up" [...] in all nuclear fuels, especially in fast breeder reactors that operate with higher-energy neutrons. That same fast-fission effect is used to augment the energy released by modern thermonuclear weapons, by jacketing the weapon with 238U to react with neutrons released by nuclear fusion {{at the center of the}} device. But the explosive effects of nuclear fission chain reactions can be reduced by using substances like moderators which slow down the speed of secondary neutrons.|$|E

50|$|During {{the nuclear}} {{reaction}} inside a reactor, the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> in nuclear fuel are consumed, producing {{more and more}} fission products, {{most of which are}} considered radioactive waste. The buildup of fission products and consumption of <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> eventually stop the nuclear reaction, causing the fuel to become a spent nuclear fuel. When 3% enriched LEU fuel is used, the spent fuel typically consists of roughly 1% U-235, 95% U-238, 1% plutonium and 3% fission products. Spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste is extremely hazardous, although nuclear reactors produce relatively small volumes of waste compared to other power plants because of the high energy density of nuclear fuel. Safe management of these byproducts of nuclear power, including their storage and disposal, is a difficult problem for any country using nuclear power.|$|R
2500|$|Startup fuel - Unlike mined uranium, mined thorium {{does not}} have a <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope.</b> Thorium {{reactors}} breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium, but require a small amount of fissile material for initial start up. There is relatively little of this material available. This raises {{the problem of how to}} start the reactors in a short time frame. One option is to produce U-233 [...] in today's solid fueled reactors, then reprocess it out of the solid waste. An LFTR can also be started by other fissile isotopes, enriched uranium or plutonium from reactors or decommissioned bombs. For enriched uranium startup, high enrichment is needed. Decommissioned uranium bombs have enough enrichment, but not enough is available to start many LFTRs. It is difficult to separate plutonium fluoride from lanthanide fission products. One option for a two-fluid reactor is to operate with plutonium or enriched uranium in the fuel salt, breed U-233 in the blanket, and store it instead of returning it to the core. Instead, add plutonium or enriched uranium to continue the chain reaction, similar to today's solid fuel reactors. When enough U-233 is bred, replace the fuel with new fuel, retaining the U-233 for other startups. A similar option exists for a single-fluid reactor operating as a converter. Such a reactor would not reprocess fuel while operating. Instead the reactor would start on plutonium with thorium as the fertile and add plutonium. The plutonium eventually burns out and U-233 is produced in situ. At the end of the reactor fuel life, the spent fuel salt can be reprocessed to recover the bred U-233 to start up new LFTRs.|$|E

50|$|Pu-239, a <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> that is {{the second}} most used nuclear fuel in nuclear {{reactors}} after U-235, and the most used fuel in the fission portion of nuclear weapons, is produced from U-238 by neutron capture followed by two beta decays.|$|E
5000|$|In {{nuclear weapon}} development, {{the main problem}} is {{securing}} sufficient [...] "weapons grade" [...] material. In particular, {{it is difficult to}} acquire either <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> of uranium-235 (235U) or of 239Pu. Weapons grade uranium requires mining, extracting and enriching natural ore. Alternatively, plutonium can be [...] "bred" [...] in reactors fueled by unenriched uranium, which requires chemical separation of the 239Pu produced.|$|R
50|$|U-234 has {{a neutron}} capture {{cross-section}} of about 100 barns for thermal neutrons, and about 700 barns for its resonance integral—the average over neutrons having various intermediate energies. In {{a nuclear reactor}} non-fissile isotopes capture a neutron breeding <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes.</b> U-234 is converted to U-235 more easily and therefore at a greater rate than U-238 is to Pu-239 (via neptunium-239) because U-238 has a much smaller neutron-capture cross-section of just 2.7 barns.|$|R
50|$|The {{content of}} un-burnt {{plutonium}} in spent MOX fuel from thermal reactors is significant - greater than 50% {{of the initial}} plutonium loading. However, during the burning of MOX the ratio of <b>fissile</b> (odd numbered) <b>isotopes</b> to non-fissile (even) drops from around 65% to 20%, depending on burn up. This makes any attempt to recover the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> difficult and any bulk Pu recovered would require such a high fraction of Pu in any second generation MOX {{that it would be}} impractical. This means that such a spent fuel would be difficult to reprocess for further reuse (burning) of plutonium. Regular reprocessing of biphasic spent MOX is difficult because of the low solubility of PuO2 in nitric acid.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} stage of the programme, natural uranium fuelled {{pressurised}} heavy water reactors (PHWR) produce electricity while generating plutonium-239 as by-product. PHWRs was a natural choice for implementing {{the first stage}} because it had the most efficient reactor design in terms of uranium utilisation, and the existing Indian infrastructure in the 1960s allowed for quick adoption of the PHWR technology.India correctly calculated that {{it would be easier to}} create heavy water production facilities (required for PHWRs) than uranium enrichment facilities (required for LWRs).Natural uranium contains only 0.7% of the <b>fissile</b> <b>isotope</b> uranium-235.

50|$|Uranium-235 is an isotope {{of uranium}} making up about 0.72% of natural uranium. Unlike the {{predominant}} isotope uranium-238, it is fissile, i.e., it can sustain a fission chain reaction.

40|$|It is now {{well-known}} that, from {{a physics}} standpoint, Pu, or even TRU (i. e. Pu+M. A.), originating from LEU fuel irradiated in PWRs can be multirecycled also in PWRs using MOX fuel.

The study is related to another possible utilization of the excess Pu produced in the blanket of a LMFBR, namely in a PWR(MOX). In this case the more Pu is bred in the LMFBR, the more PWR(MOX) it can sustain. The important difference between the Pu coming from the blanket of a LMFBR and that coming from a PWR(LEU) is its isotopic composition. The first one contains about 95 % of <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes</b> whereas the second one contains only about 65 % of <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes.</b> As it will be shown later, this difference allows the PWR fed by Pu from the LMFBR blanket to operate with natural U instead of enriched U when it is fed by Pu from PWR(LEU...|$|R

The cermet contains 2 DUO{sub 2 } imbedded in a steel matrix. The WPs are filled with spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and placed 2 in a geological repository. The WP provides a handling container for placement of SNF in the repository and is an engineered barrier to delay SNF degradation and subsequent release of radionuclides. SNF and other fissile wastes contain enriched uranium and transuranic fissile isotopes; thus, the potential for nuclear criticality exists. Most of the transuranic <b>fissile</b> <b>isotopes,</b> such as {sup 239 }Pu, will have decayed to {sup 233 }U or {sup 235 }U before significant fissile-isotope migration from the degraded SNF or other fissile waste forms has occurred.
