5|$|Persoonia lanceolata {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable,</b> and cuttings have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable,</b> and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable.</b> The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc —a disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the Sun to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable,</b> as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|Inconsistent {{inheritance}} of myostatin mutations (for example, F94L in Limousins, nt821 in Angus, and Q204X in Charolais) by progeny {{is expected to}} result in possible BLUP prediction errors for EBVs and EPDs equalling or exceeding worst case standard errors of prediction. For example, average rib eye area for Limousins in US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) trials during the 1980s and early 1990s {{is reported to be}} 12.3in2, and the reported possible difference in rib eye area in progeny arising from {{inheritance of}} either two F94L mutations or two normal myostatin genes from heterozygous parents is estimated to be 1.8in2 (12.3in2 x 15%). This difference, which <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable</b> without DNA testing, is nearly four times the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy, reported to be 0.46in2 for the rib eye EPD.|$|E

5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable</b> and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E

25|$|There is {{only one}} legal border {{crossing}} point, with stations on both sides, at Storskog in Norway and Borisoglebsky in Russia, located on the E105 highway some 15km east of Kirkenes. Crossing time at both stations <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable</b> and depends {{of the amount of}} traffic. The crossing is open between 07:00 and 21:00 Norwegian time. Immigration control at Storskog is carried out by Eastern Finnmark Police District, while customs are carried out by the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. The Norwegian Border Commissioner also has representatives at the checkpoint. It is the only of Norway's land border crossings which does not border the Schengen Area and thus the only one manned by the police.|$|E
25|$|The exemplar-based {{approaches}} claim listeners {{store information}} for both word- and talker-recognition. According to this theory, particular instances of speech sounds {{are stored in}} the memory of a listener. In the process of speech perception, the remembered instances of e.g. a syllable stored in the listener's memory are compared with the incoming stimulus so that the stimulus can be categorized. Similarly, when recognizing a talker, all the memory traces of utterances produced by that talker are activated and the talker's identity is determined. Supporting this theory are several experiments reported by Johnson that suggest that our signal identification is more accurate when we are familiar with the talker or when we have visual representation of the talker's gender. When the talker <b>is</b> <b>unpredictable</b> or the sex misidentified, the error rate in word-identification is much higher.|$|E
