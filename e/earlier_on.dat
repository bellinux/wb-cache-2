5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year <b>earlier,</b> <b>on</b> the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E

5|$|Ana was the {{earliest}} Atlantic subtropical or tropical cyclone since 2003's Tropical Storm Ana, which formed on April20. It was also {{the earliest}} tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in the United States. A storm in 1952 was thought to have made landfall as a tropical system much <b>earlier,</b> <b>on</b> February 3, but recent reanalysis efforts revealed that the storm was not fully tropical until after clearing Florida.|$|E
5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning {{the lights on}} in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were switched on <b>earlier,</b> <b>on</b> Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E

The Voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks <b>earlier,</b> <b>on</b> August 20, 1977.

50|$|On March 28, the JTWC {{issued a}} TCFA on the {{tropical}} depression, as its LLCC began to consolidate more. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> March 29, the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, and named it Pakhar, because the storm's convection had completely {{wrapped around the}} circulation center. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> March 30, the JTWC upgraded Pakhar to a Category 1 typhoon, as a banding eye formed. Because of land interaction and colder sea surface temperatures, the JTWC downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm, <b>early</b> <b>on</b> March 31. On April 1, Pakhar made landfall near Vũng Tàu, Vietnam, and began to weaken. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> April 2, the JMA reported that Pakhar had weakened into a tropical depression, before they reported later that day that the system had dissipated over Cambodia.|$|R
5|$|The 1903 Jamaica {{hurricane}} devastated Martinique, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands in August1903. The second {{tropical cyclone}} of the season, {{the storm was}} first observed well east of the Windward Islands on August6. The system moved generally west-northwestward and strengthened into a hurricane on August7. It struck Martinique <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August9, shortly before reaching the Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm became a major hurricane. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> August11, it made landfall near Morant Point, Jamaica, with winds of 120mph (195km/h), with would be the hurricane's maximum sustained wind speed. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> the following day, the storm brushed Grand Cayman at the same intensity. The system weakened before landfall near Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August13, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). The system emerging into the Gulf of Mexico <b>early</b> <b>on</b> August14 after weakening while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, but failed to re-strengthen. Around 00:00UTC on August16, the cyclone made landfall north of Tampico, Tamaulipas, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). The hurricane soon weakened to a tropical storm and dissipated over San Luis Potosí late on August16.|$|R
50|$|Typhoon Phanfone passed {{near the}} {{southern}} coast of Kii Peninsula around 03:00 JST on October 6 (18:00 UTC on October 5). The eye immediately dissipated, {{as well as the}} system started to undergo extratropical transition right before making landfall near Hamamatsu of the Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan after 08:00 JST (23:00 UTC on October 5). The JTWC issued the final warning to Phanfone <b>early</b> <b>on</b> October 6, and the system completely became extratropical at noon. The storm stopped weakening and began to deepen again <b>early</b> <b>on</b> October 7, and it crossed the International Date Line as a powerful extratropical cyclone early the next day. Post-Tropical Cyclone Phanfone, which was located about 890 km (555 mi) southwest of Unalaska, Alaska, reached peak intensity of its extratropical period at noon on October 8, with a barometric pressure of 948 hPa (27.99 inHg) and hurricane-force winds. The system started to weaken again <b>early</b> <b>on</b> October 9, and it turned northward <b>early</b> <b>on</b> October 11. The system eventually moved inland over Southcentral Alaska <b>early</b> <b>on</b> October 12 and dissipated later that day.|$|R

5|$|Cochrane, by now a Vice Admiral, assumed his {{position}} as Commander-in-Chief of British forces on the North Atlantic station in April 1814 and ordered the recruitment of a body of Colonial Marines {{as he had done}} six years <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> Marie Galante. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command on the Atlantic coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines.

Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|<b>Earlier</b> <b>on</b> {{the day of}} the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner.

Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tondó's death) to honor him, while other members of the team grieved with Tondó's family. In {{the final days of the}} race, many fans wrote signs memorializing Tondó as they had with Weylandt <b>earlier</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
