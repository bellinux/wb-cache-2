50|$|Driven wells may be {{very simply}} created in unconsolidated {{material}} with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> and a screen (perforated pipe). The point is simply hammered into the ground, usually with a tripod and driver, with pipe sections added as needed. A driver is a weighted pipe that slides over the pipe being driven and is repeatedly dropped on it. When groundwater is encountered, the well is washed of sediment and a pump installed.|$|E

50|$|Wells {{have been}} {{traditionally}} sunk by hand digging {{as is the}} case in rural developing areas. These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds. A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole. Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water. Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole. Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic. Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 June 1980, South Africa {{launched}} Operation Sceptic, {{its largest}} armoured operation since World War II, against an insurgent command centre at Chifufua, Angola, {{as well as}} smaller SWAPO encampments at Mulola and Chitumbo. An Eland squadron (designated Combat Team 3) backed by four Ratel sections and a sapper unit was drawn from 61 Mechanised to <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> during the SADFs advance on Objective [...] "Smokeshell". As Eland-90s retained the poorest momentum and left much narrower tracks than Ratels, their crews led the convoy the 250 kilometres to Chifuafua. From there, Combat Team 3 was tasked with providing fire support for the assault on SWAPOs main headquarters complex and engaging any stragglers attempting to withdraw northwards. Again, the Elands cross-country inferiority became evident as the column advanced only at a maximum speed of 20 km/h. When progressing through thick vegetation this slowed to an unacceptable 10 km/h, Sceptic experiencing further delays as cars repeatedly bogged down in the sand. Due to their limited range, many ran out of fuel {{and had to be}} towed behind Ratels.|$|E
50|$|On November 25, 2015, the Suns {{would sign}} Tucson, Arizona native Bryce Cotton to a one-year deal as {{insurance}} {{in the event}} either Ronnie Price or Eric Bledsoe {{would be out of}} commission. He would make his debut, though, over a month later due to an injury involving Eric Bledsoe instead. Cotton would previously play point guard for the Austin Spurs in the D-League (twice) and the Utah Jazz before signing his deal to play for the Suns. On January 6, 2016, after winning at home against the Charlotte Hornets, the Suns decided to waive both Cory Jefferson and Bryce Cotton's non-guaranteed deals. To make up for these moves, they announced that Grand Rapids <b>Drive</b> <b>point</b> guard Lorenzo Brown would sign a 10-day contract to determine his future value to the team, especially as a backup point guard since Eric Bledsoe would not play {{for the rest of the}} season. Brown would end up performing just well enough to sign a second 10-day contract with the team, especially with Ronnie Price out around that timeline. On January 21, 2016, the Suns decided to have Cory Jefferson return to the roster for a 10-day contract due to the team's power forwards all being out of commission during the January 19 game against the Indiana Pacers. However, on January 28, 2016, Phoenix decided to sign former Philadelphia 76ers selection Jordan McRae to a 10-day contract in order to replace Lorenzo Brown after his second 10-day contract expired. In the meantime, the Suns decided to not extend Cory Jefferson's deal (again) after most of the team's power forwards returned healthy on January 31, 2016.|$|E

40|$|The use of antiresonances in test-analysis {{correlation}} {{and dynamic}} model updating is considered in this paper. Antiresonances are not independent from modal data, {{and the related}} information is alternative and not additional to modal information. Several reasons exist to prefer antiresonances to mode shapes. First, antiresonances are quite important in deciding whether analytical and experimental FRFs are well correlated or not. Furthermore, antiresonances can be easily computed from the FE model, and identified from experimental FRFs with much less error than mode shapes. Two procedures for dynamic model updating are considered: one based on inverse sensitivity, and a second one based on multiobjective optimization. Problems connected with using antiresonances of transfer FRFs, as opposed to <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> FRFs, are also highlighted. Numerical results show that both the inverse sensitivity and the optimization approach work well with <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> FRFs...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{complete}} methodology for vibration based damage identification in important buildings in seismically active areas is investigated. In {{the first phase}} of the study, the buildings are instrumented with sensors and their modal parameters are determined using system identification techniques. These modal properties belong to the damaged state of the structure. In the second step, a detailed finite element (FE) model of the structure is developed. This initial FE model is then updated iteratively by minimizing the differences between the modal parameters obtained from the possibly damaged structure and the modal parameters obtained from the FE model with respect to the unknown model parameters which are the stiffness reduction factors. This is an ongoing study. The system identification and the model updating part of this study is published separately. In this paper, the focus will be on the optimal sensor placement (OSP) techniques and their aplication in civil engineering structures. This paper addresses the application of six different optimal sensor placement (OSP) techniques on building type structures with flexible joints. Different techniques that are implemented are the Effective Independence Method (EFI), Optimal <b>Driving</b> <b>Point</b> (ODP) based method, Non-Optimal <b>Driving</b> <b>Point</b> (NODP) based method, the Effective Independence <b>Driving</b> <b>Point</b> Residue Method and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method.

40|$|The {{electro-mechanical}} (E/M) {{impedance method}} for structural health monitoring, damage detection and failure prevention {{is a new}} technology utilizing the emitter-detector properties of active material sensors and the structural <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> mechanical impedance. In previous work, the authors showed that changes in the <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> mechanical impedance of a structure or machinery can be sensed {{in the form of}} changes in the apparent E/M impedance of the active material sensor.

40|$|Disclosed are a {{nondestructive}} {{method and}} apparatus {{for determining the}} structural integrity of materials by combining laser vibrometry with damping analysis to determine the damping loss factor. The method comprises the steps of vibrating the area being tested over a known frequency range and measuring vibrational force and velocity vs time over the known frequency range. Vibrational velocity is preferably measured by a laser vibrometer. Measurement of the vibrational force depends on the vibration method: if an electromagnetic coil is used to vibrate a magnet secured to the area being tested, then the vibrational force {{is determined by the}} coil current. If a reciprocating transducer is used, the vibrational force is determined by a force gauge in the transducer. Using vibrational analysis, a plot of the <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> mobility of the material over the preselected frequency range is generated from the vibrational force and velocity data.

40|$|The contact {{mechanism}} of bimodal standing wave ultrasonic motors {{is characterized by}} a coupled interplay of normal and tangential stresses. Both stresses oscillate at high frequency, and therefore a complex (sub-) surface stress variation is invoked in both the <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> and the slider strip. This stress variation causes the tribopair to deteriorate by fatigue. A combined-property failure mechanics approach is proposed to study this multiaxial fatigue process, and to theoretically support the preselection of contact materials able to withstand ultrasonic motor operation. A combination of Hertz theory and the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is implemented to serve this goal. The outcome is extensively assessed by durability tests. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{attractive}} features, {{the pace}} of integrating ultrasonic motors into applications remains slow. Two main causes hinder a swift transition from lab environment to industrial application. The first is the high sensitivity of the eigenfrequencies of the resonance modes used to realize both maximum speed and force. The second is the inherently present friction drive mechanism that converts the mesoscopic elliptic vibration of the <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> into the envisioned macroscopic slider motion. Friction is well-known to introduce nonlinear behavior and wear, and therefore causes challenging control, and questionable reliability and lifetime. This paper proposes and validates a novel portfolio of models that allows studying the phenomena discussed above. It therefore supports the robustification of future ultrasonic motors and their drive electronics. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{suspension}} for a multi-mode piezomotor is discussed. The first mode {{is a direct}} drive mode {{which is used to}} achieve high precision movements while the second mode is a resonant mode which supports high speed movements. To support the operation of both modes, {{a suspension}} with appropriate specifications is required. The suspension needs to fulfill the following criteria: high stiffness in the driving direction (to support the direct drive mode), and high flexibility in the normal direction to the slider (to maintain contact when the <b>drive</b> <b>point</b> wears out and to have a low variation on the preload due to non-straightness of the guide ways). Both finite element and analytic structural models have been used to develop a suspension that fulfills these demands.

During the shipbuilding process on land or in a drydock, {{it would be}} highly advantageous to determine which of these modes have a potential for strong sound radiation when the ship is waterborne. This research employs an experimental model of a submarine hull and foundation. Small masses are placed on the foundation and hull, and the effects on the vibration spectra of the structure are studied. Based on spectra response, modes are classified as hull modes, foundation modes, or "global" modes. Global modes are well coupled hull and foundation mode pairs which are closely spaced in frequency. Waterbome testing reveals that global mode pairs are strong waterbome sound radiators. Additionally, the application of small masses is shown to perturb the coupling between the global mode pairs and yield {{dramatic changes in the}} radiated sound.
