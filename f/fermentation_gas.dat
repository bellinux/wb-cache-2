40|$|ABSTRACT Bacteria, fungi and {{protozoa}} inhabiting the rumen – {{the largest}} {{chamber of the}} ruminants’ stomach, release large quantities of hydrogen during the fermentation of carbohydrates. The hydrogen is used by coexisting methanogens to produce methane in energy-yielding processes. This work shows, for the first time, a fundamental possibility of using a hydrogen-rich <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> produced by selected rumen ciliates to feed a low-temperature hydrogen fuel cell. A biohydrogen fuel cell (BHFC) was constructed consisting of (i) a bioreactor, in which a hydrogen-rich gas was produced from glucose by rumen ciliates, mainly of the Isotrichidae family, deprived of intra- and extracellular bacteria, methanogens, and fungi, and (ii) a chemical fuel cell of the polymer-electrolyte type (PEFC). The fuel cell {{was used as a}} tester of the technical applicability of the <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> produced by the rumen ciliates for power generation. The average estimated hydrogen yield was ca. 1. 15 mol H 2 per mol of fermented glucose. The BHFC performance was equal to the performance of the PEFC running on pure hydrogen. No fuel cell poisoning effects were detected. A maximum power density of 1. 66 kW/m 2 (PEFC geometric area) was obtained at room temperature.

These effects were investigated in an experiment from two perspectives, either by using such forages as a substrate for incubation or as feed for a rumen fluid donor cow. In total, six 24 -h in vitro batch culture runs were performed. Rumen fluid was collected from a non-lactating donor cow after having grazed pastures at ∼ 2000 m above sea level for 2, 6 and 10 weeks. These ‘alpine runs' were compared with three lowland samplings from before and 2 and 6 weeks after the alpine grazing where a silage-concentrate mix was fed. In each run, nine replicates of four forages each were incubated. These forages differed in type and origin (alpine hay, lowland ryegrass hay, grass-maize silage mix, pure hemicellulose) {{as well as in}} the content of nutrients. Concentrations of phenolic compounds in the incubated forages were (g/kg dry matter (DM)) : 20 (tannin proportion: 0. 47), 8 (0. 27), 15 (0. 52) and 0 (0), respectively. Crude protein was highest in the silage mix and lowest with hemicellulose, whereas the opposite was the case for fiber. The total phenol contents (g/kg DM) for the high altitude and the lowland diet of the donor cow were 27 (tannins: 0. 50 of phenols) and 12 (0. 27), respectively. Independent of the origin of the rumen fluid, the incubation with alpine hay decreased (P < 0. 05) bacterial counts, <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> amount, volatile fatty acid (VFA) production as well as ammonia and methane concentrations in <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> (the latter two being not lower when compared with hemicellulose). Alpine grazing of the cow in turn increased (P < 0. 001) bacterial counts and, to a lesser extent, acetate proportion compared with lowland feeding. Further, alpine grazing decreased protozoal count (P < 0. 05) and VFA production (P < 0. 001) to a small extent, whereas methane remained widely unchanged. There were interactions (P < 0. 05) between forage type incubated and feeding period of the donor cow in protozoal counts, acetate:propionate ratio, <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> production and its content of methane, in vitro organic matter digestibility and metabolizable energy. Although increased phenolic compounds were the most consistent common property of the applied alpine forages, a clear attribution to certain effects was not possible in this study.

Women and men (both n = 5) expelled equivalent amounts. The median daily flatus hydrogen volume was 361 ml/ 24 h (range 42 - 1060) and the carbon dioxide volume 68 ml/ 24 h (range 25 - 116), three volunteers produced methane (3, 26, and 120 ml/ 24 h), and the remaining unidentified gas (presumably nitrogen) or gases contributed a median 213 ml/ 24 h (range 61 - 476).

Anaerobe, 8, (4), 216 - 222. Sponsorship: Danish Research AcademyThe growth characteristics of 17 isolates of anaerobic fungi from various animal hosts were investigated relative {{to their ability to}} degrade wheat straw. The isolates consisted of 11 Neocallimastix isolates from Malaysia, twoPiromyces isolates from Australia and Neocallimastix hurleyensis, two polycentric isolates and aCaecomyces isolate, all from the U. K. These fungi were grown on wheat straw in batch culture and their characteristics determined from the wheat straw apparent dry matter (DM) loss data and a mathematical description of their <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> production profiles as measured using a pressure transducer. On the basis of the apparent DM loss data, isolates were divided into three groups, viz., good (Malaysian and Australian isolates), moderate (U. K. isolates) and poor (U. K. and Australian isolates) degraders of wheat straw. From their gas production profiles, the majority of the Neocallimastix isolates had similar lag times, specific growth rates and <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> pool sizes. However, when isolates were grouped according to their geographical location, the gas pool size and final DM loss for the U. K. isolate, N. hurleyensis, was significantly lower than those of the Malaysian Neocallimastix isolates. The apparent DM loss and gas production data for all isolates were subjected to multivariance analysis and this confirmed similarity between the Malaysian isolates. The resulting hierarchical cluster tree separated the good degraders into two distinct groups consisting of the Malaysian and Australian isolates. This research confirms that the gut fungi exhibit isolate-dependent differences in their activity towards recalcitrant substrates like wheat straw. The work also demonstrates the precision of the pressure transducer and associated modelling procedures in determining the kinetics of gut fungal growth on particulate substrates, enabling distinctions to be made between apparently similar fungal isolates.

To determine rheofermentation properties Rheofermentometer Rhea F 4 was used, by means of which the dough development, the production of fermentation gases, retention ability of dough and the activity of used baking yeast were analysed. The best ability to retain formed <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas</b> had wheat flour (control) and composite flour with the addition of spelt flour. The composite flour with addition of amaranth flour showed a retention coefficient compared to the control lower by 13 %, and the composite flour with addition of buckwheat flour showed a retention coefficient compared to the control reduced by 20 %. Control flour and composite flours were then processed in the baking experiment. Based on its results it was possible to evaluate the effect of the addition and retention capacity of dough {{on the quality of the}} final products (experimental loaves). The biggest loaf volume (200 cm 3) and the optimal vaulting (0. 65) were found in the control and a loaf made of composite flour with addition of spelt. Loaf volume, produced from composite flours with the addition of amaranth, and buckwheat was compared to control lower by 18. 7 %, and 16. 3 % respectively.

The influence of protein fermentation on gas-production profiles was studied by incubation of mixtures of casein with glucose, Zutkovsky starch and/or potato starch. After prolonged incubation, the fermentation of casein produced only 32 % gas compared with carbohydrates and it was calculated that each percentage of protein caused a reduction in gas production of 2. 48 ml g- 1 organic matter. Relative to potato starch, casein was fermented in an earlier stage of incubation. After correction for the influence of protein <b>fermentation,</b> <b>gas</b> production of the youngest grass sample was the highest and of the oldest sample the lowest. It showed that protein fermentation influenced gas production mainly in the initial hours of incubation, because the major part of protein {{is part of the}} soluble fraction. It is concluded that a comparison of gas-production profiles of feed samples differing largely in protein content may lead to a misinterpretation, which necessitates correction for protein fermentation...|$|E

Objective: Strategies for amplification and long-term gut microbiota preservation from fecal samples would favor sample sharing, help comparisons and reproducibility over time and between laboratories, and improve the safety and ethical issues surrounding fecal microbiota transplantations. Design: Taking advantage of in vitro gut-simulating systems, we amplified the microbial repertoire of a fresh fecal sample and assessed the viability and resuscitation of microbes after preservation with some common intracellular and extracellular acting cryoprotective agents (CPAs), alone and in different combinations. Preservation efficiencies were determined after 3 and 6 months and compared with the fresh initial microbiota diversity and metabolic activity, using the chemostat-based Environmental Control System for Intestinal Microbiota (ECSIM) in vitro model of the gut environment. Microbial populations were tested for <b>fermentation</b> <b>gas,</b> short-chain fatty acids, and composition of amplified and resuscitated microbiota, encompassing methanogenic archaea. Results: Amplification of the microbial repertoire from a fresh fecal sample was achieved with high fidelity. Dimethylsulfoxide, alone or mixed with other CPAs, showed the best efficiency for functional preservation, and the duration of preservation had little effect. Conclusions: The amplification and resuscitation of fecal microbiota can be performed using specialized in vitro gut models. Correct amplification of the initial microbes should ease the sharing of clinical samples and improve the safety of fecal microbiota transplantation...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{immediate}} need to drastically reduce the emissions associated with global {{fossil fuel consumption}} in order to limit climate change. However, carbon-based materials, chemicals, and transportation fuels are predominantly made from fossil sources and currently {{there is no alternative}} source available to adequately displace them. Gas-fermenting microorganisms that fix carbon dioxide (CO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) can break this dependence as they are capable of converting gaseous carbon to fuels and chemicals. As such, the technology can utilize a wide range of feedstocks including gasified organic matter of any sort (e. g., municipal solid waste, industrial waste, biomass, and agricultural waste residues) or industrial off gasses (e. g., from steel mills or processing plants). Gas fermentation has matured to the point that large-scale production of ethanol from gas has been demonstrated by two companies. This review gives an overview of the <b>gas</b> <b>fermentation</b> process, focusing specifically on anaerobic acetogens. Applications of synthetic biology and coupling <b>gas</b> <b>fermentation</b> to additional processes are discussed in detail. Both of these strategies, demonstrated at bench-scale, have abundant potential to rapidly expand the commercial product spectrum of <b>gas</b> <b>fermentation</b> and further improve efficiencies and yields...|$|R

40|$|Lower {{levels of}} monogalactosyl {{diglyceride}} (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) {{have been found}} in tetraploid wheats as compared with those in hexaploid wheats. The same difference has been found between hexaploid cultivars and tetraploid lines derived from them by D genome extraction. A lower level of MGDG and DGDG is also present in Triticum carthlicum (AABB) as compared with Aegilops squarrosa (DD) or with the synthetic T. spelta (AABBDD) obtained from them. Analysis of the appropriate nullitetrasomic and ditelosomic lines indicates that a gene or genes located in the short arm of chromosome 5 D are responsible for the observed difference and that group 5 chromosomes can be ranked as to their influence on the MGDG and DGDG levels in the order 5 B > 5 D > 5 A and 5 D > 5 B > 5 A, respectively. These results further support our previous identification of DGDG as the lipid factor responsible for petroleum ether solubility of lipopurothionins. Since DGDG contributes to baking quality by improving the retention of <b>fermentation</b> <b>gases,</b> the present observations imply that the difference in bread-making quality between the two types of wheat is not due only to proteins contributed by the D genom...|$|R
