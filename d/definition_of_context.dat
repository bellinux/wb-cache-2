40|$|INTRODUCTION One {{can speak}} about context only with {{reference}} to something (no <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> out of context) : {{the context of an}} object, the context of interaction, the context of a problem solving, etc. However, only the context of interaction between agents seems of interest because it is in this context that other contexts are referenced or evolve. For example, if an object, as a telephone, could provide you {{the context in which the}} called person is (free, in meeting, phone on voice recorder), you could balance your wish to establish your communication versus the availability of the called person. Several domains have already elaborated their own working <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>context.</b> In human-machine interaction, a context is a set of information that could be used to define and interpret a situation in which interact agents.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} how to develop a conceptualization of context that can support the development of technology-rich learning activities. The term technology-rich encompasses mobile, hybrid and on-line learning approaches and the work reported here is intended to bridge these different approaches. In this paper we suggest that a learner-specific <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> can ground research across mobile, hybrid and on-line learning. We discuss a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> that is theoretically grounded in the socio-cultural approach to learning and that has been used to develop the Ecology of Resources model. This model is an abstraction that can be shared between social and technical researchers and practitioners to support analysis and to generate technology design. An example that demonstrates the way that the Ecology of Resources model is empirically as well as theoretically grounded is presented. This example is used to support the proposal that the Ecology of Resources model can be used as a design tool to sensitize designers to the importance of each learner’s context...|$|E
