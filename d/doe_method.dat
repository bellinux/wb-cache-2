40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine various <b>DoE</b> <b>methods</b> for {{uncertainty}} quantification of production forecast during reservoir management. Considering all uncertainties for analysis can be time consuming and expensive. Uncertainty screening using experimental design methods helps reducing number of parameters to manageable sizes. However, adoption of various methods is more often based on experimenter discretions or company practices. This is mostly done with no or little attention been paid to the risks associated with decisions that emanated from that exercise. The consequence is the underperformance of the project when compared with the actual value of the project. This study presents the analysis of the three families of designs used for screening and four <b>DoE</b> <b>methods</b> used for response surface modeling during uncertainty analysis. The screening methods (sensitivity by one factor at-a-time, fractional experiment, and Plackett-Burman design) were critically examined and analyzed using numerical flow simulation. The modeling methods (Box-Behnken, central composite, D-optima, and full factorial) were programmed and analyzed for capabilities to reproduce actual forecast figures.

This tool was {{very helpful to}} see how much effect of a change in a suspension parameter influences lateral car body acceleration and lateral car body displacement (outputs). Besides, <b>doe</b> <b>method</b> allows observation of relative effects of different parameters on the outputs. In this study, the doe design variables are limited to secondary lateral damping and stiffness only. For example, in this analysis mass and inertia properties of the vehicle {{as well as the other}} remaining suspension properties are assumed to be constant. However, in a general doe analysis these constants can be assumed as variables to be included to the parameter study.

30|$|The optimum {{suspension}} properties {{could also}} be calculated by a full optimization method. However, this {{requires a lot of}} computation times {{because of the nature of}} long random track input. That is the main reason of using <b>doe</b> <b>method</b> in this study. The division of time to very small increments by ode 45 function causes long calculation times. Therefore, it was impossible to do all the calculations for all of the suspension combinations with the 31 dof model. For this reason, variation of only the three important suspension parameters is investigated in this work, while keeping the remaining other suspension parameters as constants. Accordingly, the optimization problem is simplified dramatically using <b>doe</b> <b>method</b> instead.|$|E

Accelerated ageing tests are usually undertaken {{in order to develop}} a theory to describe the electrical ageing process and to determine a lifetime model of these materials.

Calibration quality depends largely on its setup factors. An evaluation criterion is thus required to test the quality of the compensation deduced from these setup factors.
