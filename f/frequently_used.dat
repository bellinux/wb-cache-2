5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are <b>frequently</b> <b>used</b> as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less <b>frequently</b> <b>used</b> in industry.

However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
