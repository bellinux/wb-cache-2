40|$|Abstract. The main {{alkaline}} fluxes are sodium feldspar, {{potash feldspar}} while alkaline earth auxiliary fluxes are calcite, magnesite, dolomite, sepiolite, palygorskite and talc. The {{objective of the}} first part of study is to discover firing behavior of magnesite-rich clay within the Ca-rich ceramic bodies. The physical properties, including water adsorption (WA), <b>firing</b> <b>shrinkage</b> (FS) and firing-bending strength (BS) were determined. Replacing the opening materials (grog, sand and marble) with magnesite rich clay (Eskişehir clay) at the ratios of 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15 % has effect on <b>firing</b> <b>shrinkage</b> water absorption and bending strength.

As the peak temperature is raised within the range of 980 ºC- 1250 ºC, the crystalline constituents were identified as quartz, anorthite, gehlenite, diopside and cristobalite.

40|$|The use of {{magnesium}} silicates as sintering promoters in porcelain stoneware tiles {{was investigated in}} order to understand their effect on technological properties and firing behaviour. Three formulations were designed, replacing sodic feldspar with 3 % wt talc or chlorite in a reference porcelain stoneware body, and experimented at a laboratory scale simulating the industrial tilemaking cycle. The occurrence {{of magnesium}} silicates does not affect the technological properties of semi-finished products, but it influences remarkably the firing behaviour. Bodies containing talc or chlorite exhibit a faster densification kinetics, with slightly larger <b>firing</b> <b>shrinkages,</b> due to their larger amount of glassy phase, which appears to be less viscous than the reference one. On the other hand, the addition of magnesium silicates brings about a slightly lower bulk density, basically due to a larger amount of closed porosity, being water absorption negligible over 1160 ?C. Notwithstanding the different porosity, porcelain stoneware bodies containing talc or chlorite present just a moderate decrease of mechanical strength...|$|R

They {{are located in}} the region of Nile Valley and Delta, {{as well as in the}} Western and Eastern Desert of Egypt. Most of these deposits are used for the applications in many ceramic industries, for example, whiteware, refractories, heavy clay products, and Portland cement (Hanna and Stoops 1977; Said 1990; Youssef 2008). Clays are classified according to their particle size, mineral and chemical compositions, and other properties (Grim 1962, 1968; Grimshaw 1971; Norton 1969; Konta 1979, Burst 1991). Many authors indicated that kaolinite-rich clay materials are refractory with a high vitrification range, low plasticity, white-to-buff burning colour and a low-drying and <b>firing</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> Moreover, montmorillonite-rich clays are non-refractory with low vitrification ranges, high plasticity, buff-to-red burning colour, and a high-drying and <b>firing</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> In contrast, illite-rich clays are falling between kaolinitic and montmorillonitic clays and exhibit wide variations. Lightweight clay aggregates may be produced by firing pellets of low-grade montmorillonite-rich clays with or without adding to the vitrification range. After firing, the clay pellets swell or bloat owing to gas releases within the firing bodies during the liquid phase. On cooling, these low-grade montmorillonite clays conserve the cellular texture, and lightweight aggregate is obtained (Serry et al. 1985; Konta 1995; Karaman et al. 2006; Bernhardt et al. 2013; Ismail et al. 2016, Ismail et al. 2018; Risdanareni et al. 2017).|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for bonding blocks of Si 3 N 4 has been {{developed}} that produces bonds whose maximum service temperature {{is equal to the}} temperature used during the bonding process. In this work a system consisting of the blocks of Si 3 N 4, which had been coated with a preceramic film containing a fine dispersion of silicon and a thin layer of germanium powder, were investigated to determine the effect of the thickness of the germanium film. The maximum service temperature is not determined by the melting point of the germanium since the germanium forms a higher melting point solid solution with the silicon in the film. Control of the thickness of the germanium film is critical as it was shown that thicker layers result in lower strength bonds due to differences in thermal expansion and the maximum service temperature is lower due to the lower liquidus temperature of the leaner Ge-Si solid solution. This technique has potential applications in fuel cells due to the small differences in thermal expansion coefficients and <b>firing</b> <b>shrinkages</b> among the fuel cell materials, thus allowing successful fabrication and joining process of the monolithic solid oxide fuel cell (MSOFC) with few defects...|$|R

The particle size analysis indicates low impurity and a very high proportion of clay-sized materials. The plasticity index ranges from 10. 6 % to 12. 6 % which falls within the characteristic plasticity range for Kaolin(10 - 60 %) and therefore falls into the class of plastic Kaolinites.

The power density achievable with the MSOFC {{is expected to be}} about 8 kW/kg or 4 kW/L, at fuel efficienceis over 50 percent, because of small cell size and low resistive losses in the materials. The MSOFC operates in the range of 700 to 1000 C, at which temperatures rapid reform of hydrocarbon fuels is expected within the nickel-YSZ fuel channels. Tape casting and hot roll calendering are used to fabricate the MSOFC structure. The performance of the MSOFC has improved significantly during the course of development. The limitation of this system, based on materials resistance alone without interfacial resistances, is 0. 093 ohm-sq cm area-specific resistance (ASR).

30|$|Wood {{preservation}} {{with either}} oil-borne or water-borne preservatives can eliminate biological attack by fungi, insects and termites and can increase mechanical strength [8]. However, no single preservative is available {{that can provide}} all the desired kinds of protection. Though the natural durability of wood offers {{a certain degree of}} resistance to wood degrading agents, there is evidently no ideal wood species that can be used universally in any application without eventual break-down [9]. As a result, a wide range of techniques and methods have been developed for wood preservation [10 – 13]. Preservation {{is an important part of}} wood technology, encompassing every process of chemical or physical treatment that is undertaken to extend the service life of wood by optimizing its resistance to biological attack, <b>fire,</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and swelling due to changes in MC. One of the greatest advantages of wood treatment is that it reduces the ability of wood to absorb moisture and thus improves its dimensional stability. Water repelling characteristics have been shown to increase after the impregnation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapwood with linseed oil [14], coconut oil and various tall oils [15]. Even though the decreased hygroscopicity in heat-treated wood is reported to increase decay resistance [16 – 18], thermally modified wood is not found to be suitable for ground contact outdoor applications [3, 19]. The decay resistance depends on several factors, such as wood species, treatment method and exposure conditions. For example, a noticeably lower mass loss due to fungal attack is observed for oil–heat-treated wood compared with air–heat-treated wood [20]. Nevertheless, heat-treated wood is found to be susceptible to termites as well as marine borers [21, 22]. No single method has been shown to protect wood from all types of biodegradation. Thus, heat treatment in combination with oil can provide more effective protection than single treatment methods alone [13, 20].|$|R

The objectives of this research is to compare between local product which is traditional Mambong pottery and technology product which is slip casted Mambong pottery. Then to characterize their density, strength, physical appearance, shrinkage and phase. Traditional Mambong pottery has been brought from the potter at Mambnog village and slip casted Mambong pottery is made by using slip casting method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to identify the difference phase between raw Mambong clay and fired Mambong clay also for traditional Mambong pottery and slip casted Mambong pottery. Density of sample is measured by using Archimedes Principle. Modulus of rupture (MOR) is used to measure a specimen’s strength before it ruptures. In this review, phases of the raw and fired Mambong clay shows a bit changes but for traditional Mambong pottery and slip casted Mambong pottery shows a very huge changes in XRD pattern. Due to the presence of iron in clay, the colour of Mambong pottery changes from brown to reddish-brown after firing process.

Slip casted Mambong pottery has higher strength compared to traditional Mambong pottery. In conclusion, by using slip casting technique, density, strength, physical appearance, shrinkage and phase of Mambong pottery can be improved...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of marine clay at Olotu in Ilaje local government of Ondo State, Nigeria were investigated. Some of the physical properties investigated include plasticity index, linear <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>firing</b> characteristics (<b>firing</b> colour, <b>shrinkage</b> percentage, and water absorption capacity). The physical properties were determined using X-ray diffractometry method. The chemical composition was determined using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) method. All tests were carried out according to procedures specified by relevant British and American Standards. It was established that the {{physical and}} chemical properties were adequate to qualify it as pozzolanic material for cement production when compared with other pozzolanic materials and measured against relevant standards. The cement produced was tested for compressive strength and setting times and the results confirmed the appropriateness of the use of the clay as a pozzolana...|$|R
