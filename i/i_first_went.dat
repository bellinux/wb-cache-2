25|$|Western Australia Police {{supported}} {{the fight against}} take-away liquor and a strategic partnership was formed. The campaign was strengthened by this partnership, though it didn’t effect how it was managed. Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O’Callaghan said, “When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> up to Fitzroy Crossing, looking down from the air I saw what looked like green emeralds on the ground”, “They {{turned out to be}} thousands and thousands of cans of VB beer, where people had sat around drunk”. Fitzroy Crossing Police were spending much of their time on alcohol-related crime. When Oscar received threats and slander while running the campaign, commissioner O’Callaghan gave her his personal phone number and said “ring me anytime”.|$|E
500|$|She called Betsey Johnson {{a fashion}} inspiration: [...] " [...] {{is a free}} spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{poster for}} the film {{included}} the statement: [...] "Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and gave you the wonder of King Kong, now brings you his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E

[...] "If this wind holds, we shall {{be able to make}} our course round the {{southern}} point of Greece, and then on to Candia, which is our <b>first</b> port. <b>I</b> always like a light breeze when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>go</b> out of port, it gives time for everyone to get at home and have things shipshape before we begin to get lively." ...|$|R
500|$|Little {{is known}} of Coke's early career in Parliament; he spoke {{relatively}} infrequently, and the parliamentary session was dissolved soon after his election. During that summer, however, he struck up a relationship with Charles James Fox, a soon to be famous Whig politician noted for his outspoken and flamboyant lifestyle. Coke later recounted that [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> into Parliament I attached myself to Fox and clung to him through life. I lived in the closest bond of friendship with him." [...] The period was one of economic stability and political calm under Lord North, which ended due to the American Revolution and resulting American Revolutionary War. Coke was noted for his support of the American colonists; as {{a strong supporter of}} the 1688 Glorious Revolution and the resulting Bill of Rights 1689, he felt that the support of the espoused principles of justice and tolerance in Britain and overseas was his duty as a British subject, and saw no conflict between his position as a supporter of the colonists and his patriotism. Following the Battles of Saratoga, it became clear that any victory in America would be long and expensive, and in an attempt to raise funds King George III asked subjects to donate. In Norwich, a meeting was held in January 1778 for this purpose; it raised £4,500 in less than an hour. Windham and Coke attended this meeting, Windham making an impassioned speech pointing out that the campaign had so far resulted only in [...] "disappointment, shame and dishonour", and that [...] "peace and reconciliation with America" [...] was the only option. Windham, Coke and their supporters then withdrew to a nearby pub, where they drafted a petition to the king from [...] "the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, Freeholders and Inhabitants of the County of Norfolk". This was presented to Parliament by Coke on 17 February 1778, signed by 5,400 people from Norfolk. George III took this as a personal insult, and as a result disliked Coke until his death.|$|E

2500|$|Brinkman ran for Congress in 2005 {{to replace}} Portman, announcing his {{candidacy}} outside {{the post office}} in Anderson Township on April 14 [...] Brinkman told the press [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> to Columbus, I promised my constituents that I would fight for lower taxes, limited government, and to end abortion. I {{will do the same}} in Washington." [...] An early poll found Pat DeWine, a member of the Hamilton County Commission and the son of U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, with a significant lead: 42 percent for DeWine, 6 percent for Brinkman.|$|E

2500|$|Sacks {{would later}} {{describe}} his {{experience on the}} kibbutz as an [...] "anodyne to the lonely, torturing months in Sinclair's lab". He said he lost [...] from his previously overweight body, {{as a result of}} the healthy, hard physical labour he performed there. He spent time traveling around the country, with time scuba diving at the Red Sea port city of Eilat, and began to reconsider his future: [...] "I wondered again, as I had wondered when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> to Oxford, whether I really wanted to become a doctor. I had become very interested in neurophysiology, but I also loved marine biology; [...] [...] [...] But I was 'cured' now; it was time to return to medicine, to start clinical work, seeing patients in London." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the strangeness}} of the concept, some historians have doubted {{the reality of the}} {{exchange}} of goods and suggested that the exchange was really a transfer of the liturgy itself. [...] For contrary evidence, others [...] look to Demosthenes' speech [...] "Against Phaenippus", where an exchange of property is explicitly mentioned by the litigant: [...] "For I made this offer before to Phaenippus, and now again, men of the jury, I tender it freely:—I will surrender to him all my property including the mines, if he will hand over to me the farm alone free from all encumbrances as it was when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> to it with witnesses, and will replace as they were before the grain and wine and the other things which he has carried away from the buildings after removing the seals from the doors." [...] However, it is possible that placing seals on the property was done solely to assess the respective fortunes of the owners.|$|E
