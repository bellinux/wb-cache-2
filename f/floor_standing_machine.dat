30|$|The most {{important}} {{difference is the}} nature of the audio content used for the evaluations. In MediaEval evaluations, the speech is typically telephone speech, either conversational or read and elicited speech, or speech recorded with in-room microphones. In ALBAYZIN evaluations, the audio contains microphone recordings of real talks in real workshops, in large conference rooms with the public. Microphones, conference rooms, and even recording conditions change from one recording to another. Microphones are not close talking microphones but table top and <b>floor</b> <b>standing</b> microphones mainly.|$|R

These cabinets had tinplate inserts in the doors and sometimes in the sides, punched out by the homeowner, cabinetmaker or a tinsmith in varying designs to allow for air circulation while excluding flies.

5000|$|Mansart's design, of 1685, {{articulated}} the square's unified façades {{according to a}} formula utilised in some Parisian hôtels particuliers, (palatial private homes). Mansart chose colossal pilasters linking two <b>floors,</b> <b>standing</b> on a high arcaded base with rustication of the pilasters; the façades were capped with sloping slate [...] "mansard roofs", punctuated by dormer windows. However, because the building work was incomplete {{at the time of}} the unveiling of the monument, the envisioned façades were painted on canvas. By 1692, the Place des Victoires was pierced by six streets, and the circular plan functioned as a flexible joint to harmonize their various axes.|$|R

The exhibits explain the events that necessitated their construction, and the reasons for the choice of the path followed. The panels also describe the building techniques and the types of gate. There is also a panel dedicated to military equipment used both by defenders and attackers.|$|R

Memory expansion was via proprietary cards (1 MB or 4 MB cards, 16 MB total) and initially there was no support for 1.44 MB High Density (HD) floppy drives, although a hardware modification to the clock lines on the floppy disk controller meant that later versions of the PWS could be upgraded. The ENGA (EGA compatible video) controller, displayed standard EGA graphics and text with an additional line reserved on the bottom row for multitasking and communications task messages.|$|R

500|$|Some users add a {{subwoofer}} because {{high levels}} of low bass are desired, even beyond {{what is in the}} original recording, {{as in the case of}} house music enthusiasts. Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some <b>floor</b> <b>standing</b> tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and [...] "satellite" [...] speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since sub-bass frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation 'modes'), the best position for the subwoofer is not likely to be where the [...] "satellite" [...] speakers are located.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhether you {{are walking}} on a {{concrete}} <b>floor,</b> <b>standing</b> on a carpet, or sitting on a soft chair, your entire body continuously controls the posture and the contact forces that are produced by acting on rigid and compliant surfaces. Sometimes, like when reaching for a distant object or standing inside a moving bus that suddenly brakes, humans plan intentionally new contacts to preserve their balance and avoid falling. For humanoid robots to act in unstructured natural environments as humans do, contacts and physical interactions are necessary and unavoidable. This special issue of the Autonomous Robots journal aims at presenting the advances in whole-body control of real robots, focusing on control and learning techniques applied to estimation, control and adaptation of whole-body dynamics movement and contact forces that go beyond basic balancing abilities...|$|R
