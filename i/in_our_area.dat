2500|$|Prehistory can {{be divided}} into the Palaeolithic – Old Stone Age and the Neolithic – New Stone Age. In Zrenjanin's regions no archaeological sites of the Palaeolithic have been found. The only {{exception}} makes the discovery of mammoth’s head and other bones found on the banks of Tisa River near Novi Bečej in the year 1952. The discovered archaeological sites, however, indicate that these regions had already been inhabited in the early Neolithic period about 5000 years BC. The most important archaeological site from this period is so-called Krstić tumulus, near Mužlja, about [...] away from Zrenjanin. Here were found the ceramics, with interesting ornaments. Beside the brewery ground have been found rough, with coloured fine ceramics, ornaments (Starčevo culture). The middle Neolithic appeared <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>area</b> as Vinča and Potisje culture, in the down course of the Tisa River. What makes this area important {{is the fact that the}} influence of two parallel cultures flew through it at the same time. The Iron Age has not been enough explored yet. A few regions with some archaeological materials from the Iron Age have been found: in the residential area Šumica a tip of a spear was found and near the oil factory, pieces of ceramics from the Bronze Age were discovered.|$|E
2500|$|After a few days, however, this stance {{was changed}} and terror was introduced. The change was also {{spurred by the}} actions of the peasants themselves, who had become more radical. SL activists created groups of 4 - 10 mostly young men, who were armed with sticks, and watched all roads. They did not {{hesitate}} to use force against the strikebreaker, beating them, killing their horses, destroying produce, and overturning their wagons. In some cases, radical activists attacked houses of the strikebreakers. In the course of the time, the strike turned into an uprising, which was noticed by activists of the Polish Communist Party, who appeared in the area, with their propaganda (in their appeal to the nation, the communist stated [...] "Let the cities and villages die! Long live the nationwide strike! They will not arrest millions"). First skirmishes took place in the area of Jarosław on August 17, where members of the Peasants' Order Guard fought the police. On the same day, in Grebow near Tarnobrzeg, first peasant was killed. In response, the peasants blocked the main road of southern Poland, route Kraków - Lwów (in the area of Brzesko), where transport of all goods was halted. Local police commandant wrote in his report: [...] "On the roads and in their vicinity there are gangs of peasants armed with knives, sticks, perhaps guns. We are defenseless against them. Today, they have formed a march of around 500, which started from Wielka Wies. On the way, more people joined them. Economy <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>area</b> has been completely paralyzed. We are requesting help and awaiting orders". General Marian Kukiel wrote to Wladyslaw Sikorski: [...] "The police are completely exhausted. There are losses. There are no police units in Kraków. If the communists were a significant force, they would be taking advantage of this situation".|$|E

60|$|We thus {{see that}} the last glacial epoch was the climax of a great process of {{continental}} development which {{had been going on}} throughout long geological ages; and that it was the direct consequence of the north temperate and polar land having attained a great extension and a considerable altitude just at the time when a phase of very high excentricity was coming on. Throughout earlier Tertiary and Secondary times an equally high excentricity often occurred, but it never produced a glacial epoch, because the north temperate and polar areas had less high land, and were more freely open to the influx of warm oceanic currents. But wherever great plateaux with lofty mountains occurred in the temperate zone a considerable local glaciation might be produced, which would be specially intense during periods of high excentricity; and it is to such causes we must impute the indications of ice-action {{in the vicinity of the}} Alps during the Tertiary period. The Permian glaciation appears to have been more extensive, and it is quite possible that at this remote epoch a sufficient mass of high land existed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>area</b> and northwards towards the pole, to have brought on a true glacial period comparable with that which has so recently passed away.|$|E

60|$|We {{found this}} noble room divided, by a low railing, into three compartments. The centre, {{an area of}} some thirty feet by forty, {{contained}} the table, and was otherwise prepared for the reception of the court. On one side of it were raised benches for the ladies, who were allowed to be seated; and, on the other, a vacant space for the gentlemen, who stood. All these, you will understand, were considered merely as spectators, not being {{supposed to be in}} the presence of the king. The mere spectators were dressed as usual, or in common evening dress, and not all the women even in that; while those within the railings, being deemed to be in the royal presence, were in high court dresses. Thus I stood for an hour within five-and-twenty feet of the king, and part of the time much nearer, while, by a fiction of etiquette, I was not understood to be there at all. I was a good while within ten feet of the Duchesse de Berri, while, by convention, I was nowhere. There was abundance of room <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>area,</b> and every facility of moving about, many coming and going, as they saw fit. Behind us, but at a little distance, were other rows of raised seats, filled with the best instrumental musicians of Paris. Along the wall, facing the table, was a narrow raised platform, wide enough to allow of two or three to walk abreast, separated from the rest of the room by a railing, and extending from a door at one end of the gallery, to a door at the other. This was the place designed for the passage of the public during the dinner; no one, however, being admitted, even here, without a ticket.|$|E

40|$|This study {{set out to}} test three {{hypotheses}} {{explaining the}} existence of closed canopied versus open ecosystems in the same landscape and on the same parent rocks. Our data lent no support to the first hypothesis that forests are ancient and grasslands are anthropogenically derived through deforestation. Carbon isotope data suggests the opposite; both open and closed vegetation had C₄ isotope signals in deeper soils, indicating that grasslands are the ancient system. The second hypothesis is that closed forests require nutrient rich soils and are replaced by open vegetation on nutrient poor soils. Despite open vegetation frequently having lower nutrient concentrations than closed vegetation <b>in</b> <b>our</b> study <b>area,</b> nutrient stocks to 1 m far exceeded threshold requirements to build a forest at all our sites. We suggest that vegetation patterns <b>in</b> <b>our</b> study <b>area</b> {{are a result of}} a third hypothesis, that forests and savannas are alternative stable states each subject to different ecological processes with positive feedbacks maintaining each state. Fire in open grassy vegetation is a key disturbance maintaining the boundaries between the two states. Frequent fires may deplete nutrients in the surface layers of the soil, thereby slowing tree growth and further maintaining the open state of the vegetation. However, our data on the vertical distribution of nutrients show strikingly similar nutrient patterns in the alternative biome states, with high nutrient concentrations in the open sites, suggesting that nutrient limitation is not an important feedback helping to maintain open ecosystems <b>in</b> <b>our</b> study <b>area.</b> <b>Our</b> results suggest that, rather than being drivers of vegetation patterns <b>in</b> <b>our</b> study <b>area,</b> soil nutrients are responding to dynamic vegetation changes caused by other factors. 7 page(s...|$|R
