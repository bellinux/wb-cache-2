500|$|In 1997, {{the governments}} of the Republic of Croatia and the German state of Bavaria made a joint {{declaration}} regarding their future transport infrastructure development cooperation. The cooperation primarily dealt with the construction of the remaining A2 motorway sections and the Franjo Tuđman Bridge, and the two issues were formally settled between the Croatian government and Walter Bau AG. In 2003, the Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj company was established by the Croatian government and was awarded a concession contract to operate the motorway. Furthermore, a <b>joint</b> <b>investment</b> agreement with Walter Bau AG was signed by the government, effectively securing the financial assets required to resume construction. In 2004, Strabag replaced Walter Bau AG as a contract partner and construction finally resumed. In 2006, the section between Jankomir and Zaprešić was upgraded to dual-carriage motorway, and the motorway was extended to Krapina itself. In 2007, after 33 months of construction defined by the contracts, the motorway was completed along its entire length, except for a short segment near Krapina which, as of July 2011, is still a single-carriageway road. The total cost of the motorway was approximately 372 million euros. The largest portion of the total pertains to the northernmost [...] section between Krapina and Macelj, which was reported to cost 235 million euros.|$|E

40|$|Cohabiters {{have been}} shown to invest less in their {{relationship}} than married couples. This study investigated the role of legal and interpersonal commitment by examining heterogeneity within marital and cohabiting unions. Going beyond the dichotomy of cohabitation versus marriage, different union types were distinguished by their level of legal and interpersonal commitment, followed by an assessment of their association with <b>joint</b> <b>investments</b> (specialization, having children together, purchasing a home). Using panel data from The Netherlands (N = 2, 362), the authors found considerable heterogeneity within marital and cohabiting unions. <b>Joint</b> <b>investments</b> increased as interpersonal commitment increased, with cohabiters without marriage plans investing the least and couples who directly married without prior cohabitation investing the most. The relationship between investments and legal union types was less straightforward and often challenged expectations, prompting the authors to elaborate on alternative explanations for their findings...|$|R
