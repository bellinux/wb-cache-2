Dunya had been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family until this point, but was {{forced out of the}} {{position}} by the head of the family, Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, a married man, was attracted to Dunya's physical beauty and her feminine qualities, and offered her riches and elopement. Mortified, Dunya fled the Svidrigaïlov family and lost her source of income, only to meet Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, a man of modest income and rank. Luzhin proposes to marry Dunya, thereby securing her and her mother's financial safety, provided she accept <b>him</b> <b>quickly</b> and without question. It is for these very reasons {{that the two of them}} come to Saint Petersburg, both to meet Luzhin there and to obtain Raskolnikov's approval. Luzhin, however, calls on Raskolnikov while he is in a delirious state and presents himself as a foolish, self-righteous and presumptuous man. Raskolnikov dismisses him immediately as a potential husband for his sister, and realizes that she only accepted him to help her family.|$|E

[...] This will often also come with a scene of the villain explaining his master plan to Bond. Goldfinger chained Bond to a nuclear bomb in the vault, while Alec Trevelyan tied an unconscious Bond to a helicopter that was programmed to fire its own missiles at itself. Francisco Scaramanga gave Bond lunch and then proposed a duel in his [...] "fun room", while Hugo Drax trapped Bond beneath the exhaust of a rocket to burn to death.

500|$|Banquo's {{status as}} a {{contrast}} to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ("Hold, take my sword... Take thee that too"). He also explains {{that he has been}} having trouble sleeping due to [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to <b>him</b> <b>quickly.</b> Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true, but is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 26, 1910. It states: [...] "Frank Wilson {{is the son of}} an inventor who has perfected an airship model in which Jack is greatly interested, but which neither of them have the money to finance. Wilson tries to interest his wealthy employer, Fisher, but is unsuccessful in the attempt. However he gains the support of his employer's beautiful daughter, Rose. The old inventor suggests to his son that if he marries Rose they could secure the money to perfect the invention. But Jack spurns the idea, as he is already engaged to marry a country girl, Daisy Lane, who, he believes, loves him devotedly. Upon learning that Daisy is a heartless coquette, Jack is heartbroken, and goes west to seek a fortune and forget her conduct. Success comes to <b>him</b> <b>quickly,</b> and he returns to tell his father that now, unaided, they can finance the invention. On the aviation field, Jack once more meets Rose, and confesses to her that it was the memory of her kindness that helped him achieve success. Jack makes a successful flight in the invention – a new style of aeroplane – and in offering her congratulations Rose confesses that she has loved him from the first." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to <b>him</b> <b>quickly.</b> Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure he does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} {{for the first}} issue, David Pepose of Newsarama wrote, [...] "The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, and care about <b>him</b> <b>quickly.</b> Even though we're still {{scratching}} the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher. But that kind of Parker-style guilt—that neurotic, nearly masochistic tendency for self-sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility—is still intact." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that [...] "Miles still feels like {{a bit of an}} outsider in his own book. Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles—his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." [...] Schedeen also opined that [...] "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's". James Hunt of CBR.com rated the issue #1 four and a half out of five stars, lauding Bendis for emphasizing Morales' character and his supporting cast instead of rushing him into costume. The first issue holds a score of 7.8 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on 11 reviews, while the final issue, #28, holds a score of 8.3, based on 9 reviews, and the series overall holds an average issue rating of 8.3.|$|E

500|$|When Brady Hoke {{took over}} as Michigan head coach for the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS {{football}} season, Kovacs impressed <b>him</b> <b>quickly.</b> Kovacs {{was one of the}} first five players named as a starter for the 2011 team. In the September 3, 2011 season opener against Western Michigan at Michigan Stadium, Kovacs forced a fumble that was recovered and advanced for a touchdown. Although the game was ended by mutual agreement in the third quarter due to inclement weather, Kovacs recorded 10 tackles, including two sacks. He was named the Lott Trophy impact player of the week. [...] At first, the stats for the game were considered official by the Big Ten Conference and the University of Michigan, but the NCAA has vacated the statistics for this game because three quarters were not completed. However, at the conclusion of the regular season, the NCAA reversed course and ruled that since the game is counting for win-loss record, the statistics will be counted by the NCAA. On September 10, against Notre Dame, during the first night game ever played at Michigan Stadium, he talied an interception, and eight tackles. [...] When it became evident that the defense had improved markedly from the prior season, he and fellow safety Thomas Gordon were credited as being the [...] "leaders of the defense". [...] On October 8, against Northwestern, Kovacs posted two solo tackles for a loss, both on fourth down. Kovacs suffered a knee injury that sidelined him for the October 29 game against Purdue. Kovacs had been one of twenty quarterfinalists for the Lott impact player of the year. Kovacs was named as one of 10 semifinalists for the 2011 Burlsworth Trophy on November 22. Following the 2011 Big Ten Conference football season, he earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention recognition from the media and was selected as the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award recipient for the Michigan program. Kovacs earned 2011 Fall Academic All-Big Ten recognition along with 10 teammates. In the January 3, 2012 Sugar Bowl 23–20 overtime victory against Virginia Tech, he led the team with 11 tackles. Kovacs finished among the conference leaders in several statistics: sacks/game (.33, 17th), tackles/game (6.2, 30th) and fumbles forced/game (.17, t-9th).|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past <b>him</b> <b>quickly</b> and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{formation}} lap, Rosberg {{appeared to have}} an issue with his car, when {{he stopped at the}} end of pit lane {{on the way to the}} start grid. However, his mechanics were able to rectify the problem, described by Niki Lauda as [...] "a glitch", and he made it to the grid. With everyone starting on the super-soft tyre compound, a race with two pit stops was expected for most drivers. At the start, all drivers at the front of the field held their positions, while further back, Nico Hülkenberg, who had a good start, and Sergio Pérez nearly collided while fighting for position. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso STR10 stalled on the grid and was pushed back to the pit lane, only to start his race shortly after, more than one lap down on the leaders. Vettel was able to build a gap to Ricciardo behind <b>him</b> <b>quickly,</b> leading the Red Bull by three seconds after the first lap. Fernando Alonso, who had enjoyed a decent start to move up into eleventh, came under pressure from Sainz by lap four, followed by Grosjean, who lost places at the start because he had to move around the stationary Verstappen. While Vettel's lead was about five seconds on lap five, Verstappen unlapped himself by lap six and posted fast lap times. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg held off the two Williams cars of Bottas and Massa, while Lewis Hamilton in front was able to move clear of the pack fighting for sixth place. Kimi Räikkönen in third place was held at a distance by Ricciardo, trailing him by 1.6 seconds on lap nine. A lap later, Grosjean became the first driver to pit. More cars came in on lap eleven, leading to heavy traffic that prevented Sainz and Alonso from leaving their pit boxes, costing time. Alonso emerged from pit lane ahead of Grosjean, who moved past him into thirteenth. Felipe Massa had a slow stop of 4.8 seconds when he made a pit stop at the end of lap 13. When he emerged from pit lane, Nico Hülkenberg was approaching on the racing line. Both drivers collided, with Hülkenberg being catapulted off Massa's front right tyre, causing him to retire from the race. A Virtual Safety Car period ensued, that saw all drivers pit that had not done so before. Since Kvyat had made a pit stop shortly before the safety car was deployed, both Mercedes cars were able to move in front of him, leaving Kvyat in sixth place. Jenson Button's stop took a long time, dropping him to 16th place. By lap 16, the virtual was replaced by the actual safety car, which stayed out until the end of lap 18.|$|E

[...] His trademark move– looking {{one way and}} passing the other– fooled countless opponents during his career. The Laudrup dribble, a feint {{also known as the}} croqueta, was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved <b>him</b> <b>quickly</b> moving the ball {{from one foot to the}} other away from the defender.
