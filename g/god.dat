In <b>God</b> of War, Aphrodite helped Kratos by {{empowering}} {{the head of}} the slain Medusa and giving it to Kratos as a magical weapon. In <b>God</b> of War III, she offered advice regarding the architect Daedalus. After seducing Kratos, Aphrodite directed him to her estranged husband.

5|$|Ares– The former <b>God</b> of War {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of <b>God</b> of War. Ares captured Kratos' brother Deimos {{and had him}} imprisoned and tortured due to a misinterpreted prophecy, and later chose Kratos as his champion during a successful wager with other Olympian Gods in the <b>God</b> of War comic series. Early on, Ares wanted to overthrow Zeus and entered into an alliance with the Furies to help him do so. Years later, as he deemed his own son Orkos unworthy, Ares saw an opportunity to create a warrior to help him. During a battle, Kratos called on the <b>God</b> of War, and pledged his life in servitude if Ares spared him from his foes and provided the power to destroy them. Ares granted Kratos' wish and empowered his new servant with the Blades of Chaos. A victorious Kratos eventually renounced his servitude to Ares when the <b>god</b> tricked Kratos into accidentally killing his own wife and child. In <b>God</b> of War, while Ares waged war on the city of Athens, Kratos was tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box, an artifact capable of destroying Ares. Ultimately successful, Kratos ascended to Mount Olympus and replaced Ares as the new <b>God</b> of War. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Ares {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Steven Blum in <b>God</b> of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Ascension. Fred Tatasciore provided Ares' voice in <b>God</b> of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

The Manifestations of <b>God,</b> as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of <b>God,</b> but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations.

5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} <b>God</b> {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of <b>God</b> is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, <b>God</b> {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that <b>God</b> is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to <b>God</b> are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping <b>God</b> to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love <b>God</b> through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E
