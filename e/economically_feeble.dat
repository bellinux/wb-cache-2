Husseini, who according to his biographer was an [...] "authoritarian who could not tolerate opposition", feared the recommended merger with Transjordan {{under the rule of}} King Abdullah. The latter stood to gain much from partition; reaching an accord with the Nashashibis could have consolidated his rule and left Husseini powerless. The Palestinians also opposed being consigned to the far more <b>economically</b> <b>feeble</b> society of the Transjordan.|$|E

Hydrogen fuel, produced by alkaline water electrolysis is fulfilling all these demands, however the technology is <b>economically</b> <b>feeble,</b> limited by the slow rate of oxygen evolution reaction. Complex metal oxides were suggested to overcome this problem being low-cost efficient catalysts. However, the insufficient long-term stability, degradation of structure and electrocatalytic activity are restricting their utilization. Here we report on a new perovskite-based self-assembling material BaCo 0. 98 Ti 0. 02 O 3 -Î´:Co 3 O 4 with superior performance, showing outstanding properties compared to current state-of-the-art materials without degeneration of its properties even at 353 K. By chemical and structural analysis the degradation mechanism was identified and modified by selective doping. Short-range order and chemical composition rather than long-range order are factors determining the outstanding performance. The derived general design rules {{can be used for}} further development of oxide-based electrocatalytic materials.
