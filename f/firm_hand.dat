Although the Ancient Egyptians did not consider striped hyenas sacred, they supposedly tamed them for use in hunting. When raised with a <b>firm</b> <b>hand,</b> they may eventually become affectionate and as amenable as well trained dogs, though they emit a strong odour which no amount of bathing will cover. Although they kill dogs in the wild, striped hyenas raised in captivity can form bonds with them.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the Kenyon report in February 1918, {{the following month}} Ware appointed Reginald Blomfield {{to be one of}} the senior architects overseeing the design of British war cemeteries. Blomfield was chosen on the recommendation of Kenyon. Blomfield was an expert in both British and French architecture, and had written extensively on garden planning. Blomfield was greatly experienced in serving on committees, commissions, and government advisory bodies, and Ware hoped that Blomfield would use his age, experience, and dominance in the field of architecture to help rein in Baker and Lutyens. Ware also hoped that Blomfield's amiable nature and <b>firm</b> <b>hand</b> would keep the disagreements between Baker and Lutyens from getting out of hand. Furthermore, Blomfield was a widely acknowledged expert in generating highly accurate cost estimates and in crafting excellent contracts. Blomfield was paid £400 per year in 1918, which was raised to £600 per year in 1919.|$|E
25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a <b>firm</b> <b>hand,</b> for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E

25|$|Keane's {{first two}} games as manager could not have gone much better; first coming from behind to beat Derby County 2–1, {{followed}} by an easy 3–0 victory over Leeds United. Sunderland began to steadily creep up the league standings under Keane's management, and {{by the turn of}} the year they had escaped the bottom half of the league. Five further players were signed during the January 2007 transfer window, three (Anthony Stokes, Carlos Edwards and Stern John) on permanent contracts and two (Jonny Evans and Danny Simpson) on loan from Manchester United, Keane's old club. Results continued to improve, and Keane was rewarded with the February and March Manager of the Month awards, while his team began to challenge for the automatic promotion places. Meanwhile, Keane tackled his players' non-professional approach with a <b>firm</b> <b>hand.</b> When three players were late for the team coach to a trip to Barnsley, in March 2007, he simply left them behind.|$|E

In later years I have found him ever more charming". According to The Independent, Bellew enjoyed creating colourful grants of arms, drew inspiration from medieval heraldry and allowed multi-coloured wreaths to be used and adorned with badges {{for the first time}} in English heraldry. As Garter, he managed the financial affairs of the College well, maintaining [...] "a <b>firm</b> <b>hand</b> on the tiller", and, when faced with the task of organising the Coronation, his knowledge of tradition was complemented by his eye for design: [...] "At heart he was a designer, an artist and a perfectionist in all things", remarks his obituary in The Times.|$|E

In 1726, his father left {{military}} service and moved the family to Schwedt, where he became a forestry master in East Prussia; the senior Seydlitz died in 1728, leaving a widow and children in restricted financial circumstances. Limited schooling was available to young Seydlitz; sources differ whether {{he knew how to}} speak and write in French, the lingua franca of Frederick the Great's Court. One biographer, Bernhard von Poten, maintained that his German was good, and if he knew French, he preferred German and wrote it with a [...] "fine, <b>firm</b> <b>hand,</b> unusually correct, in well-formed sentences and with apt expression," [...] and he knew enough Latin to express himself well. [...] His future sovereign, Frederick, always addressed him in German.|$|E
500|$|Ross rebuked Nogueira for {{allowing}} the broadcast, saying its content was insidious and goading. Nogueira agreed that Reedman's words were provocative, but said Portugal {{could not be}} blamed as it did not censor public broadcasts. Britain considered withdrawing Ross in protest, but its Foreign Office ruled this out, saying Britain {{could not afford to}} be without an ambassador in Lisbon to influence Portugal's actions in the event of UDI. British Cabinet Secretary Burke Trend rejected this view, pointing to Lisbon's conduct regarding Reedman, which he said showed the Portuguese [...] "ha very clearly made up their minds" [...] to support a Rhodesian UDI. The British ambassador {{would not be able to}} affect matters, he surmised, and British interests would be better served by immediately taking a <b>firm</b> <b>hand</b> against Portugal, in the hope that this would send a strong message to Rhodesia. Ross then protested to the Portuguese about Reedman's calling himself [...] "head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission" [...] on the radio; Lisbon replied impassively that this was a private expression of views by Reedman, and not Portugal's responsibility.|$|E

But he was aware of the consequences and he demonstrated genuine concern for the plight of destitute native people increasingly threatened with extinction. Clark's expeditions and frontier settlement gave him unique views and feelings toward Native Americans.

Locals began warning each other with the saying, [...] "Watch yourself, or you'll end up in Kemna!" [...] With rumors about the camp spreading, the Nazis emptied and closed the camp just six months after it opened, fearing the risk to their image at home and abroad. Although the Third Reich wanted the public to become familiar with the term [...] "concentration camp" [...] (in German, Konzentrationslager) and understand its implications enough to dread it, it was concerned about the consequences of public awareness of the practice of torture at Kemna and the other early concentration camps.|$|E
