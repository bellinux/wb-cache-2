5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including <b>Eurocorps,</b> I.

This French-German cooperation also was vital for important European projects, like the Treaty of Maastricht and the Euro.|$|E

25|$|Other bodies {{based in}} the city, most of them {{unrelated}} either to the Council of Europe or the European Union but working in more or less close association with them, are: International Commission on Civil Status, <b>Eurocorps</b> (created in 1963), the International Institute of Human Rights (founded in 1969), the European Science Foundation (founded in 1974), EuroScience (founded in 1997), the Assembly of European Regions (established in 1985) and the Human Frontier Science Program (conceived in 1986, launched in 1989).

2500|$|France has {{encouraged}} military cooperation at an EU level, {{starting with the}} formation of the Franco-German Brigade in 1987 and <b>Eurocorps</b> in 1992, based in Strasbourg. In 2009 a battalion of German light infantry was moved to Alsace, the first time German troops had been stationed in France since the Nazi occupation of World War II. This process has not been immune to budget cuts – in October 2013 France announced the closure of her last infantry regiment in Germany, thus marking the end of a major presence across the Rhine although both countries will maintain around 500 troops on each other's territory. The UK has always preferred cooperation through NATO rather than the EU, but as fellow members of the UN Security Council with many interests and problems in common, the two countries {{have a long history of}} bilateral collaboration. This has occurred both at government level and in industrial programmes like the SEPECAT Jaguar whilst corporate mergers have seen Thales and MBDA emerge as major defence companies spanning both countries. The financial crisis of 2007–08 led to renewed pressure on military budgets and the [...] "austerity alliance" [...] enshrined in the Lancaster House Treaties of 2010. These promised close integration in both procurement and at an operational level, reaching into the most sensitive areas such as nuclear warheads.|$|E
