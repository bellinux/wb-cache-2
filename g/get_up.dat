5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap.

Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E

When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.|$|E

5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} <b>get</b> <b>up</b> underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine.

The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E
