500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|She [...] {{gave me a}} call, and she was like, [...] "I {{would love}} to do a duet with you. Come by the studio." [...] When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> she played the song for me. I didn't expect to record the song, but when I heard it, I said, [...] "Man, there's no way I'm going to leave this studio without my voice being on that record." [...] Everything just {{happened}} so fast. I didn't expect for it to be a single or a video. Everything was just great.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E

500|$|The gates {{were opened}} at 11:30am as advertised, {{three and a}} half hours before the match was due to begin, and until 1:00pm the flow of people into the stadium was orderly. By 1:00pm, however, a vast number of people were pouring into the stadium, and after an {{inspection}} by the stadium authorities, the decision was made to close the gates at 1:45pm. [...] Spectator William Rose said later that Olympic Way was [...] "seething with people" [...] and that [...] "the nearer I got to the stadium the worse it got, by the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> the turnstiles had been closed". Although the information was relayed to various railway stations, thousands of people continued to arrive and mass outside the gates. [...] Organisation within the stadium was poor, and in his report on the match the correspondent for the Daily Mail described the stewarding as [...] "useless" [...] and stated that officials in and around the stadium [...] "seemed to know nothing". Fans were not directed to any specific area, and the tiers in the lower half of the stadium filled up much faster than those higher up.|$|E
500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
2500|$|Forrest {{is often}} erroneously {{quoted as saying}} his {{strategy}} was to [...] "git thar fustest with the mostest". Now often recast as [...] "Getting there firstest with the mostest", this misquote first appeared in print in a New York Tribune article written to provide colorful comments in reaction to European interest in Civil War generals. The aphorism was addressed and corrected by a New York Times story in 1918 to be: [...] "Ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> first with the most men". Though a novel and succinct condensation of the military principles of mass and maneuver, Bruce Catton writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{was charged}} with {{investigating}} a detailed letter by 11th Light Infantry Brigade soldier Tom Glen, which backed up rumored allegations of the My Lai Massacre. He wrote: [...] "In direct refutation of this portrayal {{is the fact that}} relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." [...] Later, Powell's assessment would be described as whitewashing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 Powell said to television and radio host Larry King, [...] "I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{current and}} former congressional {{employees}} recalled Foley approaching young male pages at parties, going back many years, and say that warnings about him were commonly passed around. Generally speaking, he was [...] "known to be extraordinarily friendly {{in a way that}} made some [...] uncomfortable." [...] According to Mark Beck-Heyman, who served as a Republican page in summer 1995, [...] "Almost the first day <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> I was warned. It was no secret that Foley had a special interest in male pages." [...] He alleged that many people on Capitol Hill, including Republican staffers, [...] "have known for over 11 years about what was going on and chose to do nothing." [...] Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said on MSNBC that [...] "I‘ve had people now on staff that used to be pages, and it was widely known to watch out for him, that he liked boys ... so pages were warned to watch out for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reiss {{studied at}} Harvard University. Reiss has stated that, as an institution, he hates Harvard, {{explaining}} that [...] "I had an epiphany on my third day there: This place {{would be just}} as good as a summer camp where you met other people, networked, and learned from them. I feel the education <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> was distant and useless and uncaring. I feel they sort of squandered my youth and my father’s savings." [...] Reiss studied English, but disliked the course and was rejected from a creative writing class. Reiss focused his attention on comedy, performing in talent shows and writing. In Holworthy Hall at Harvard, Reiss met fellow freshman Al Jean; they befriended one another and collaborated their writing efforts for the humor publication Harvard Lampoon. Reiss became co-president of the Harvard Lampoon, alongside Jon Vitti. Jeff Martin, another writer for the Lampoon, said Reiss and Jean [...] "definitely loomed large around the magazine. They were very funny guys and unusually polished comedy writers for that age. We were never surprised that they went on to success." [...] Jean has also stated that the duo spent most of their time at the Lampoon, adding that [...] "it was practically my second dorm room." ...|$|E

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} {{with seven}} laps {{to go and}} the sixth caution of the race flew for a multi-car wreck in turn 1. It started when Edwards got loose and slammed into the wall, collecting drivers like Ryan Newman and Keselowski. “It felt like <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> tight down there,” Edwards said. [...] "I had a little trouble there on the starts and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>there,</b> we were fighting really hard for the bottom {{and it felt like}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> tight with whoever was on the outside of me. If indeed that is what happened, I apologize, that’s pretty frustrating. I don’t know if he came down or if I came up. It felt like <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in <b>there</b> and just scrubbed that right front. Hopefully a Toyota wins. I hate it for Stanley, Joe Gibbs Racing and everybody that was caught up in that wreck. It’s frustrating.” This brought out the red flag to ensue cleanup. The race resumed under caution shortly thereafter.|$|R
2500|$|Colin Powell, then a 31-year-old Army major {{serving as}} an {{assistant}} chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division, was charged with investigating the letter, which did not specifically refer to Mỹ Lai, as Glen had limited knowledge of the events there. In his report, Powell wrote, [...] "In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal Division soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." [...] Powell's handling of the assignment was later characterized by some observers as [...] "whitewashing" [...] the atrocities of Mỹ Lai. In May 2004, Powell, then United States Secretary of State, told CNN's Larry King, [...] "I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored." [...] Indeed, in 1966, the so called Bình Hòa massacre at the hands of South Korean troops already occurred in Quảng Ngãi Province; in February 1968, in neighboring Quảng Nam province, during a similar to Muscatine counterinsurgency search-and-destroy operation, the Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất massacre and the purported Hà My massacre were committed by South Korean Marines. As for the U.S. military, seven months prior to the My Lai Massacre, on Robert McNamara's order, the Inspector General of the U.S. Defense Department investigated press coverage of alleged atrocities committed in South Vietnam. In August 1967, the 200-page report [...] "Alleged Atrocities by U.S. Military Forces in South Vietnam" [...] was completed. It concluded that many American troops did not fully understand the Geneva Conventions. No action was taken, however.|$|E
