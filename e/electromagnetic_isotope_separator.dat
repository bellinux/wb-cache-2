40|$|The {{search for}} element 114 to be {{described}} presently {{was based on a}} series of enrichments with the goal of improving upon the detection limit by several orders of magnitude relative to earlier efforts. The samples studied were taken from a lead ore with an age of about 1. 3 · 10 ^ 9 years and, {{on the basis of the}} physicochemical properties predicted for eka-lead, were selectively enriched through vaporization during the processing of the ore, coprecipitation and counter-current electrophoresis, resulting in an estimated chemical enrichment factor of from 2 to 3 · 10 ^ 8. In order to be able to detect the concentrations of 10 ^- 21 to 10 ^- 19 atoms of eka-lead per atom of lead expected from the assumption of halflives of a few times 10 ^ 7 to about 10 ^ 8 years for the isotopes which could conceivably have survived in nature, a further physical enrichment was undertaken with the help of the Jülich high performance <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>isotope</b> <b>separator.</b> For this step, the positions of the individual mass lines on the mass separator targets were first determined by using PbSe (masses 278 and 280 to 290). Synthetic quartz glass was used as the target material. The separation efficiency was determined radiometrically in simulation experiments with ^ 197 Hg. The quartz plates used as targets for the separation of the lead samples were subsequently subjected to a thermal neutron flux of about 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 i n a high-flux reactor and the resulting fission tracks counted under an optical microscope. The background due to fissionable impurities in the quartz (< 10 ^- 13 atoms per SiO_ 2 molecule) and that due to the use of the mass separator were studied in preliminary experiments. The possible escape of the presumably volatile element 114 from the fission track detectors during irradiation as a result of nuclear γ-heating was also investigated in simulation experiments. The diffusion behavior of carrier-free ^ 203 Hg implanted into quartz plates in the mass separator, as determined by a radiometric analysis, showed that the expected losses are negligible below 200 °C. The counting results from the fission track detectors gave a maximum value of 5. 1 · 10 ^- 22 barns for the product of the fission cross section σ_f and the number of eka-lead atoms per lead carrier atom. In order to be able to make an estimate of the absolute concentration limits, the fission cross sections of eka-lead for thermal neutrons were approximated using an extrapolation method [104]. With the assumption of these approximated fission cross sections, the following upper limits were placed on the concentration: 295 _ 114 : 8 · 10 ^- 24 atoms per atom lead, assuming σ_f = 70 barns; 297 _ 114 : 3 · 10 ^- 22 atoms per atom lead, assuming σ_f = 2 barns; 298 _ 114 : 1 · 10 ^- 19 atoms per atom lead, assuming σ_f = 4 mbarns. Assuming that no fundamental errors were made in the prediction of the chemical properties and in the selection of the samples and the enrichment processes undertaken, the upper limit for the concentration has been lowered by means of the methods chosen in this work by 3. 3 to 8. 4 orders of magnitude,relative to the values determined in earlier work...|$|E
