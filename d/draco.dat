5|$|Ron, Hermione, and Harry {{join the}} effort to save Hagrid's hippogriff, Buckbeak, from being {{executed}} for attacking <b>Draco</b> Malfoy, after <b>Draco</b> provoked him. Their efforts are unsuccessful, but Scabbers reappears shortly after they hear Buckbeak being executed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Draco</b> Malfoy is a slim, pale boy {{who speaks}} in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone {{who is not a}} pure-blood wizard– and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had {{supported}} Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. <b>Draco</b> avoids direct confrontations, and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy, <b>Draco</b> Malfoy's mother, Lucius Malfoy's {{wife and}} Bellatrix Lestrange's sister.|$|E
5000|$|... {{research}} related to <b>DRACOs</b> had ground to a halt, {{due to lack of}} funding, caused by competition from other broad-spectrum antivirals and the narrowness of the existing published research on <b>DRACOs.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{not clear}} whether <b>Draco's</b> law {{specified}} the punishment for intentional homicide. In 409 BC, intentional homicide was punished by death, but <b>Draco's</b> law begins, 'καὶ ἐὰμ μὲ ‘κ προνοίας κττίς τινα, φεύγεν', which is ambiguous and difficult to translate. One possible translation offers, 'Even if a man not intentionally kills another, he is exiled'.|$|R
5|$|In a final onslaught, Bellatrix {{is killed}} and Harry reveals to Voldemort {{that he is}} alive. He {{explains}} to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Although Voldemort believes by killing Snape he has gained the Wand's loyalty, Snape was in fact never its master. Instead, <b>Draco</b> Malfoy earned the Wand's loyalty when he disarmed Dumbledore just before Snape arrived. Harry believes the Elder Wand recognized <b>Draco</b> as its master, {{up to the point}} where Harry disarmed <b>Draco</b> at Malfoy Manor weeks prior, and the duel will depend on whether or not the wand recognizes Harry to be its master. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against Harry and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort at last.|$|E
5|$|Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, <b>Draco</b> Malfoy's {{father and}} a disgraced Death Eater.|$|E
5|$|Soranus {{wrote that}} Hippocrates' father was Heraclides, a physician, {{and his mother}} was Praxitela, {{daughter}} of Tizane. The two sons of Hippocrates, Thessalus and <b>Draco,</b> and his son-in-law, Polybus, were his students. According to Galen, a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates' true successor, while Thessalus and <b>Draco</b> each had a son named Hippocrates (Hippocrates III and IV).|$|E
50|$|<b>DraCos</b> had {{a unified}} memory {{architecture}} which {{gave them a}} competitive advantage over Amigas, as they are not limited by the 2 MB chipmem that Amigas can reach. If <b>DraCos</b> are queried on the chipmem they have, they display the video card´s framebuffer size (usually 4MB). The Eltanin card contains four 72 pin simm sockets to hold up to 128 MB of ram.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Amigas, <b>DraCos</b> {{lack the}} Amiga custom chipset, {{and so they}} rely on software APIs that retarget many hardware functions.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, Whitaker was {{in another}} Nature {{documentary}} on real-life reptiles such as Komodo dragons and <b>Dracos</b> that inspired tales of dragons.|$|R

50|$|A {{scene where}} Einon returns to <b>Draco's</b> cave after the {{encounter}} at the waterfall, finds Aislinn there, and gets suspicious that she's hiding something from him.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, an {{independent}} research group {{reported to have}} successfully observed antiviral activity against the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) using <b>DRACOs</b> in vitro.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown by}} Fig.  2, the {{predicted}} overshoot pressure approximately equals maximum measured pressures, and the Stauffer and <b>Dracos</b> data closely follow the predicted metastable drainage pressure curve.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, Harry and Dumbledore {{journey to}} a cave to {{retrieve}} a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore expertly finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island in the centre. The locket is {{at the bottom of a}} basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Harry helps Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, and though Dumbledore is severely weakened, together they manage to fight off Voldemort's Inferi that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over the highest tower in Hogwarts in their absence. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower where they are ambushed by <b>Draco</b> Malfoy, accompanied by Death Eaters that he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell to keep him hidden. <b>Draco</b> disarms Dumbledore of his wand and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort. <b>Draco</b> is unable to go through with it, and Snape arrives and casts the spell to kill Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is in fact the Half-Blood Prince before he, <b>Draco,</b> and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards <b>Draco</b> {{uses his}} {{contacts}} to inform Bond that Blofeld is somewhere in Switzerland. Bond returns to England {{to be given}} another lead: the College of Arms in London has discovered that Blofeld has assumed the title and name Comte Balthazar de Bleuville and wants formal confirmation of the title and has asked the College to declare him the reigning count.|$|E
5|$|Dumbledore picks Harry up {{from his}} aunt and uncle's house, {{intending}} to escort him to the Burrow, home of Harry's best friend Ron. On the way, they make a detour to the temporary home of Horace Slughorn, former Potions teacher at Hogwarts, and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione has already arrived. The next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) results, along with lists of school supplies. Later, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger follow <b>Draco</b> to Dark Arts supplier Borgin and Burkes. Harry is instantly suspicious of <b>Draco,</b> whom he believes to be a Death Eater.|$|E
5|$|Virginia North as Olympe – <b>Draco's</b> lover. Nikki van der Zyl {{provided}} the uncredited voice for Olympe, making On Her Majesty's Secret Service her sixth Bond film in succession.|$|R
50|$|The longest {{duration}} fire torch teething is 3 minutes 38.39 {{seconds and}} {{was achieved by}} Alexander Spitfire(U.S.A) at Circo Draconum's <b>Draco's</b> Inferno in Hell's Kitchen Lounge Newark, New Jersey on August 30, 2015.|$|R
25|$|The pair {{said they}} had fun {{trying to figure out}} why <b>Draco's</b> so mean, Mehlenbacher said. Their lyrics are written tongue-in-cheek, and all but the very {{youngest}} Harry Potter fans seem to understand that.|$|R
5|$|Fleming {{also used}} {{historical}} references {{for some of}} his names and Marc-Ange Draco's name is based upon that of El <b>Draco,</b> the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake, a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character <b>Draco</b> Malfoy. For Tracy's background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of Fleming's, who died in an air-raid and Bond's grief {{for the loss of}} his wife is an echo of Fleming's at the loss of Wright. Fleming did make mistakes in the novel, however, such as Bond ordering a half-bottle of Pol Roger Champagne: Fleming's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.|$|E
5|$|In The Biggest Secret (1999), he {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} many prominent figures derive from the Anunnaki, a reptilian race from the <b>Draco</b> constellation. In Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More (2012), he identified the Moon (and later Saturn) {{as the source of}} holographic experiences, broadcast by the reptiles, that humanity interprets as reality.|$|E
5|$|The roof bosses in the cloisters display many astrological {{references}} {{including the}} constellations Cygnus (the Swan), Vulpecula and Anser (Fox and Goose), Sagittarius (the Archer), the Man in the Moon, <b>Draco</b> (the Dragon), Canis Major (Sirius the Dog Star), Capricornus (the Sea Goat), Columba (the Dove), Noctua (the Owl), Aquila (the Eagle), Leo (the Lion) and Virgo (the Angel).|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is a pure}} republic--wild, yet strong-- [...] A 'fierce democracie,' {{where all}} are true [...] To what {{themselves}} have voted--right or wrong-- [...] And to their laws denominated blue; [...] (If red, they might to <b>Draco's</b> code belong.)"--HALLECK.|$|R
30|$|It {{appears that}} the Stauffer and <b>Dracos</b> {{drainage}} data are not constrained to the maximum residual nonwetting phase saturation but instead extend to complete saturation. This suggests that the additional capillary pressure at the metastable equilibrium is sufficient to overcome the capillary pore pressure.|$|R
5|$|Bond {{escapes from}} the clinic after Blofeld {{identifies}} {{him as the}} British agent. Bond arranges a raid on the clinic using men from <b>Draco's</b> organisation. The raid is a success, although Blofeld escapes. Bond marries Tracy, but she is murdered shortly afterwards by Irma Bunt, Blofeld's partner.|$|R
5|$|Argentinian {{artists have}} won the award more times than any other nationality. Colombian singer-songwriter Juanes has won the most awards in the category, with three wins {{out of the same}} number of nominations. Mexican {{performers}} Alejandra Guzmán and Julieta Venegas are the only female singers to be awarded. Fito Páez and Luis Alberto Spinetta are the most nominated performers, with four nominations each. <b>Draco</b> Rosa became the last recipient of the award in 2009, for the album Teatro.|$|E
5|$|At Hogwarts, the first-years are {{assigned}} by the magical Sorting Hat to houses that best suit their personalities. While Harry is being sorted, the Hat suggests that he be placed into Slytherin which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, but when Harry objects, the Hat sends him to Gryffindor. Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. <b>Draco</b> is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family before him.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{returns to}} London, {{and after a}} brief {{argument}} with M at the British Secret Service headquarters, heads for Draco's birthday party in Portugal. There, Bond and Tracy begin a whirlwind romance, and <b>Draco</b> directs the agent to a law firm in Bern, Switzerland. Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the title 'Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp'.|$|E
50|$|Ancients is a {{standard}} fare dungeon crawl with a simplified Dungeons and Dragons element of character creation including Warrior, Priest, Mage, Rogue classes; Elf, Human, Dwarf races; and the rerollable statistics of Hitpoints, <b>Dracos</b> (Money), Intelligence, Strength, Constitution and Dexterity. Players control a party of four characters.|$|R
50|$|The Citadel is {{discovered}} by Galan <b>Dracos</b> and comes {{under attack by}} the forces of Takhisis. Magius tells Huma that a mountain represented by a tapestry in the Citadel is important and that Huma should journey into Ergoth toward this mountain. Huma and Kaz flee the Citadel.|$|R
5000|$|A second new {{original}} {{from the}} band, [...] "Trigger," [...] features music written by Arkana and [...] "Forever" [...] remixer/FGFC820 member <b>Dräcos</b> and System Syn founder/vocalist Clint Carney.
