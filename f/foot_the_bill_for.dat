5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E
25|$|For the UK, the {{government}} organisation dealing with occupational health {{has been the}} Employment Medical Advisory Service but in 2014 a new occupational health organisation - the Health and Work Service - was created to provide advice and assistance to employers {{in order to get}} back to work employees on long-term sick-leave. The service, funded by government, will offer medical assessments and treatment plans, on a voluntary basis, to people on long-term absence from their employer; in return, {{the government}} will no longer <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> Statutory Sick Pay provided by the employer to the individual.|$|E
25|$|In November 1996, five investors {{formed a}} {{partnership}} called Columbus Hockey Limited, who then submitted an application and a $100,000 fee to the NHL office. The voters of Columbus were considering a referendum {{to build a}} publicly financed arena, a major step toward approval of their NHL bid. When League Commissioner Gary Bettman visited Columbus {{to meet with the}} community's leaders about the franchise proposal, there was concern that the voters might not pass the needed referendum. The civic leaders told Bettman {{that they would not be}} willing to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the team if the referendum failed. However, just after the meeting adjourned, John H. McConnell (one of those who entered the bid) privately guaranteed Bettman that an arena would be built, referendum or not.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s, {{most of the}} {{built-up}} {{areas were}} removed and replaced with grassy or wooded parkland. This {{was the result of}} the efforts of environmentalist groups, and dovetailed with the construction of the MRT Red Line. The Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation <b>footed</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conversion.|$|R

500|$|In {{the words}} of the {{historian}} Peter McLaughlin, the Southern Rhodesian settlers [...] "seemed to out-British the British" [...] in their patriotic zeal, so it was to the frustration of many of them that the Company did not immediately commit to any martial action. While it sent supportive messages to Whitehall, the Company felt it could not raise any kind of expeditionary force without first considering the implications for its administrative operations; as a commercial concern, it was possible for the Company to go bankrupt. Who would <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> war expenditure, its hierarchy pondered: the Company itself, the Rhodesian taxpayers or the British government? ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 December 2005, {{tensions}} between King's and the London School of Economics (LSE) were ignited when at least 200 students from LSE (located in Aldwych near the Strand Campus) diverted {{off from the}} annual [...] "barrel run" [...] and caused an estimated £32,000 of damage to the English department at King's. The Times reported that LSE director Howard Davies attended the fun run event, while LSE claimed that Davies only attended for a short time. King's principal, Sir Rick Trainor, deplored the behaviour, appealed to King's students to remain calm and called for no retaliation. The LSE Students' Union later on 6 December issued a formal apology, condemned the actions, as well as promising to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the damage repair.|$|E
500|$|The {{committees}} in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining {{funds for the}} construction of the pedestal. The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete. There was criticism both of Bartholdi's statue and {{of the fact that the}} gift required Americans to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue. There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen. Harper's Weekly declared its wish that [...] "M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had 'gone the whole figure' while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once." [...] The New York Times stated that [...] "no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances." [...] Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.|$|E
50|$|Holmes, {{heir to the}} Fleischmann's Yeast fortune, {{wanted to}} be an actor, so his father <b>footed</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> him to star in the early 1950s film Daughter of the Sun God. The movie was so bad, however, that it took nearly a decade for it to be released. By that time, the actor was already out of the business.|$|R
50|$|Gilmore and Albert Plummer of Character Pictures began {{filming the}} South Seas adventure, The Isle of Destiny, {{in the spring}} of 1920, on Anna Maria Island.

500|$|The Age of Adz {{received}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Keith Meatto of the Frontier Psychiatrist described the album as [...] "a musical masterpiece that blends analog and digital sounds as it reflects on love and loss, life and death, humanity and divinity". Entertainment.ie's Jenny Mulligan described Stevens as [...] "a strange one, that's for sure, {{but he may}} just be a genius". Uncut commented that the album provides plenty of evidence to argue that he is either [...] "one {{of the most important}} songwriters of his generation" [...] or [...] "just an infuriating, neurotic show-off". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that although the album [...] "goes a bit barmy and over-the-top" [...] there are some [...] "incredible tune" [...] that are [...] "not only genuinely remarkable, but genuinely enjoyable". Alex Denney of NME similarly commented that the album [...] "conjures just enough moments of heart-stopping gorgeousness to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> its dizzying excesses". Sam Lewis of the BBC remarked on the same point: that the album is [...] "suffused with individual moments of brilliance", but overall it is [...] "let down by its self-conscious incoherence".|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to polish a badly {{tarnished}} public image, Yerkes decided in 1892 to bankroll the world's largest telescope after being lobbied by the astronomer George Ellery Hale and University of Chicago president William Rainey Harper. He had initially intended to finance only a telescope but eventually agreed to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> an entire observatory.

For instance, he had been reimbursed more than $62,000 for personal expenses from 1987 to 1989. He also revealed that the NHLPA had unknowingly <b>footed</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> expensive clothing, theatre tickets and a luxury apartment in London.

50|$|Recently, as plants {{continue}} to age, many on-site spent fuel pools have come near capacity, prompting creation of dry cask storage facilities as well. Several lawsuits between utilities {{and the government}} have transpired over the cost of these facilities, because by law the government is required to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> actions that go beyond the spent fuel pool.|$|E
50|$|Many {{observers}} {{point out}} that the War on Poverty's attention to Black America created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s. The perception by the white middle class that it was <b>footing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> ever-increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs, especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods. Many whites viewed Great Society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low-income urban minorities; they lost sympathy, especially as the economy declined during the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The third issue, was {{the territories}} deficit budget, the {{territory}} was facing huge pressures from a rapidly increasing population {{in all parts}} of the territory. Earlier in 1898 the territorial government tried to exert control over liquor revenue in the Klondike, since it was <b>footing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> increased services and policing. The federal government however interfered and delt a huge blow, when it carved the Yukon out of the Northwest Territories and appointed a council loyal to the federal government to gain control.|$|R

Current port pricing practice is based on a rather linear structure and fails to incorporate modern pricing tools such as price differentiation or revenue management.
