Many variations of the edge coloring problem, in which an assignments of colors to edges must satisfy other conditions than non-adjacency, have been studied.

30|$|Concerning SFH-FAP, {{frequency}} planning {{has been}} done on a heuristic basis, mostly. Here one could mention the papers[14 – 16]. There, <b>frequency</b> <b>assignments</b> are created by the means of frequency lists for each transceiver, which are created and improved on a heuristic basis (e.g., by simulated annealing). While these methods are usually fast, they cannot claim to provide optimal <b>frequency</b> <b>assignments.</b> In contrast to these approaches, this article tries to invoke exact methods for obtaining optimal <b>frequency</b> <b>assignments.</b> Therefore, advanced optimization concepts like column generation and cutting plane algorithms are used. Though <b>frequency</b> <b>assignments</b> can be provided, no guarantees of optimality can be given. Nevertheless, this article analyzes the usage of the chosen means and points out future research potential. On the whole, this study is based on the master thesis of Tieves[17].|$|R

40|$|Abstract – There {{has been}} much recent {{attention}} on using wireless relay networks to forward data from mobile nodes to a base station. This network architecture is motivated by performance improvements obtained by leveraging the highest quality links to a base station for data transfer. With the advent of agile radios {{it is possible to}} improve the performance of relay networks through intelligent <b>frequency</b> <b>assignments.</b> First, it is beneficial if the links of the relay network are orthogonal with respect to each other so that simultaneous transmission on all links is possible. Second, diversity can be added to hops in the relay network to reduce error rates. In this paper we present algorithms for forming such relay networks dynamically. The formation algorithms support intelligent <b>frequency</b> <b>assignments.</b> Our results show that algorithms that order the sequence in which nodes join a relay network carefully achieve the highest amount of diversity and hence best performanc...|$|R
