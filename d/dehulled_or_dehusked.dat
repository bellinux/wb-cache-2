50|$|For seeds {{with hard}} seed coats such as {{sunflowers}} <b>or</b> groundnuts, <b>dehusking</b> <b>or</b> decortication is required. This {{removal of the}} seed coats improves productivity and reduces bulk. In addition to decortication, preliminary milling for some oilseeds such as groundnuts is needed.

An example of this is how soybeans must be roasted to deactivate trypsin inhibitors that are anti-nutritional for swine and poultry. In general, warming seed before processing increases oil yield. Although the best seed temperature for pressing is 38-71 °C, it is known that warming sunflower seed in the sun for just a half hour raises oil yields by 25%.|$|R
50|$|Soy protein {{isolates}} or soybean {{flour and}} gluten are usually used as foundation for most meat analogs {{that are available}} on the market. Soy protein isolate is a highly pure form of soy protein with a minimum protein content of 90%. The process of extracting the protein from the soybeans starts with the <b>dehulling,</b> <b>or</b> decortication, of the seeds. The seeds are then treated with solvents such as hexane in order extract the oil from them. The oil-free soybean meal is then suspended in water and treated with alkali to dissolve the protein while leaving behind the carbohydrates. The alkaline solution is then treated with acidic substances in order to precipitate the protein, before being washed and dried. The removal of fats and carbohydrates, results in a product that has a relatively neutral flavor. Soy protein is also considered a “complete protein” as it contains all of the essential amino acids that are crucial for proper human growth and development.|$|R

Four dietary treatments comprising a basal maize-soybean meal diet and three differently processed AYB meals were used to replace soybean at 50 % protein for protein in the basal diet (raw, aqueous heating and dehulled AYB). There were four 4 treatments groups of 3 replicates with 10 birds per replicate. Birds were randomly divided into four groups in a completely randomized block design.

Lupin grains have high protein content (35 – 40 %) but previous experience with white lupins has shown toxic effects in poultry due to high levels alkaloids and poor performance due to anti-nutritional Non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). Here blue lupins either processed or whole were trialled for their potential as a protein source. Point of lay chickens (64) at 16 weeks of age were weighed and allocated to 16 coops of four hens. Coops, as the experimental unit, were randomly allocated to four treatments: layers mash with soya (Control); or layers mash with 150  g of lupin/kg diet with the lupin either: whole (Whole); <b>dehulled</b> (<b>Dehulled)</b> <b>or</b> <b>dehulled</b> + a solid state fermentation enzyme extract (SSF; 150  g/tonne DM).

40|$|Moringa is a {{multi-purpose}} tree {{which has}} gained {{a lot of publicity}} because of its many varied uses, which range from the medicinal applications, industrial, sanitary to the nutritional. Moringa has very high nutritional properties that would be useful as a food supplement, especially in those marginalized communities. As regards Moringa nutrition, much research has been documented, as opposed to research on agronomic needs of the plant. Hence, studies were carried out studies to determine whether initial establishment of Moringa is affected by stand densities, nitrogen, phosphorus and pH, and whether media type and seed priming influences the germination, emergence and initial seedling establishment. These studies were conducted as four separate experiments. The first experiment tested five population densities. The second experiment was a 5 x 3 x 3 factorial experiment with five pH levels (3. 2, 6. 2, 7. 6, 8. 2, 8. 7) three phosphorus levels (0 g/plant, 8 g/plant, 16 g/plant) and three nitrogen levels (0 g/plant, 4 g/plant, 8 g/plant), and was carried out in the greenhouse. The third experiment was a 4 x 3 x 2 factorial with four pre-treatment methods, three organic sources and two soil texture sources, and also carried out in the greenhouse. The fourth experiment was a 4 x 3 x 2 factorial with four nitrogen levels (0 g/pot, 2 g/pot, 4 g/pot, 8 g/pot), three organic sources (pine bark, sawdust, none) and two textures (clay, sand). All these experiments were carried out at the University of Zimbabwe, Crop Science Department site. The results obtained indicated that high plant density produced high biomass yields and longer stems, but with smaller stem diameters, while low density produced higher individual growth of the plants as evidenced by the thicker stem diameters produced.

40|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that {{high quality energy}} and protein sources in diets for newly-weaned pigs, such as milk powders, lactose and cooked cereals, promote better performance after weaning. However, their higher cost and stability of supply sometimes requires nutritionists to explore potential for other ingredients {{for use in the}} formulation of weaner diets. Recent research in grower pigs demonstrated that lupins could be included at up to 350 g/kg in place of soybean meal, without compromising growth, carcase composition or meat quality (Kim et al., 2007). However, the use of lupins in a weaner diet to reduce or replace more expensive protein sources, such as milk products, has not been examined to date.

40|$|Hull {{thickness}} is {{an important}} component of seed quality, which effects <b>dehulling</b> ability, feed <b>or</b> food nutritional aspects and cooking times. A breeding objective in Lupinus angustifolius crop improvement is to reduce hull thickness and a rapid screening method is needed to efficiently screen genotypes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging using infrared illumination at 980 nm was used to compare hull thickness of genotypes of four lupin species. OCT-derived hull layer thickness correlated highly with actual hull thickness determined by environmental scanning electron microscopy (r = 0. 90) and allowed reliable distinction between mutant (thin-hulled) and parent genotypes of L. angustifolius. The imaging could clearly penetrate lupin seed to a depth of approximately 200 mum.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the suitability of pea and canola products, and of thin distillers' solubles, for use in salmonid diets with the ultimate aim of enhancing market opportunity for these agricultural crops and byproducts produced in western Canada. Four experiments were conducted with rainbow trout to evaluate the palatability, digestibility and nutritional value of pea and canola products. The ability of thin distillers' solubles to increase feeding activity, and the effect this product has on nutrient and dry matter digestibility of pea products, was also evaluated. Experiments one and two were conducted with the objective of comparing feed consumption, time to satiation and feeding aggressiveness in fish fed four diets containing canola meal or air-classified pea protein, with or without the presence of a palatability enhancer (Finnstim™). Feed consumption of a diet containing 15 % canola meal was equal to that of a commercially available trout ration (P ≤ 0. 05). Feed consumption of a diet containing 30 % air-classified pea protein, although being lower than the commercial ration (P ≤ 0. 05), did not indicate severe palatability problems. It was concluded that these two ingredients offer potential as alternative plant protein sources for feeding rainbow trout. Feed consumption of neither plant protein source was increased with supplementation of a commercial palatability enhancer. However, feeding response was significantly increased (P ≤ 0. 05) with supplementation of thin distillers' solubles at a level ≥ 3. 3 %; of the diet. Experiment three determined the effects that various milling and heat treatments had on nutrient, dry matter and energy digestibility of four pea ingredients as follows: autoclaved air-classified pea protein, raw/whole peas, raw/dehulled peas and extruded/dehulled peas. Digestibility of the protein component was uniformly high for all pea ingredients (apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of 90. 0 - 94. 6 %), regardless of the processing treatment, and compared favourably to protein digestibility values from other plant sources. Heat treatments achieved by autoclaving or extrusion greatly increased starch digestibility by 41 - 75 % (P ≤ 0. 05), which consequently increased energy and dry matter digestibility of whole and dehulled peas. Autoclaved air-classified pea protein had superior protein (ADC of 94. 6 %), energy (ADC of 87 %) and dry matter (ADC of 84 %) digestibility that compared favourably with other plant sources currently utilized in aquafeeds. Thin distillers' solubles was a highly digestible ingredient and supplementation with this product did not adversely affect digestibility values of the various pea ingredients. Experiment four compared the growth performance of rainbow trout fed diets containing soybean meal, dehulled peas, air-classified pea protein or canola meal fines as the primary plant ingredient in the diet, and evaluated the effectiveness of thin distillers' solubles as a feed enhancing compound for rainbow trout over a 12 week period. Feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, hepatosomatic index and dressout percentage were similar for the four plant protein sources (P ≤ 0. 05). It was concluded that dehulled peas, air-classified pea protein and canola meal fines are suitable ingredients for use in trout diet formulation. Addition of thin distillers' solubles, while increasing feed intake in the short term, did not increase feed intake (P ≤ 0. 05) ofpea and canola diets over the 12 week trial period. It can be concluded that further processing of peas and canola meal is of benefit in producing palatable, nutritious ingredients suitable for rainbow trout diet formulation. Peas, regardless of processing treatment, were a palatable ingredient. However, digestibility of the nutrient and energy fraction of peas varied with processing treatment. Air classification of dehulled peas produced a highly desirable pea ingredient with a concentrated protein, low starch content which resulted in superior digestibility relative to whole, <b>dehulled</b> <b>or</b> extruded peas. Similarly, sieving of conventional canola meal produced a palatable, high protein ingredient. Thin distillers' solubles were not effective as a palatability enhancer over a long-term period. The failure of this product to increase feed intake may be attributed to the destruction of amino acids during thermal processing or due to a decrease in gustatory stimulation with time. In conclusion, the overall results of these experiments show that there is great opportunity for utilization of pea and canola products in aquafeeds provided adequate processing treatments are used to concentrate the protein constituents and to remove components which inhibit digestion, absorption and utilization of these alternative protein sources by salmonid species...|$|R

Various nutrient concentrations were added and the vitamin retention of dried fortified {{as well as of}} cooked rice were determined. Fortified rice was evaluated based on vitamin retention, estimated as the percentage of vitamin in rice after fortification treatment versus the total amount of added plus its initially vitamin quantity. It was found that the average retention of all vitamins in dried rice was high and varied from 54. 3 % to 85. 3 % for the spraying and from 53. 5 % to 76. 2 % for the soaking method respectively. After rice cooking, the retention was maintained in sufficient level (> 70 %) for all vitamins except for B 12. When excess of water was used for cooking, the water-soluble vitamins were leached; however a significant amount of vitamins still remained, varying from 13. 5 % (B- 12) to 51. 2 % (B- 1). The good retention of vitamins, even after cooking, achieved applying these relatively simple techniques, may be attributed to the absorption and diffusion of vitamins in the interior of rice kernels in high concentrations.

Pigs receiving 240. g/kg of dehulled lupins grew slower (P< 0. 05) than pigs fed the other diets mainly due to decreased feed intake. Pigs fed diets containing more than 180. g/kg of dehulled lupins had a higher faecal β-haemolytic Escherichia coli score on day 3 after weaning (P< 0. 05). Moreover, inclusion of 240. g/kg of whole lupin or more than 180. g/kg of dehulled lupins increased (P< 0. 001) plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) levels. Total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) of dry matter decreased (P< 0. 001) in all lupin diets compared with the control diet. These data indicate that inclusion of dehulled lupin immediately after weaning {{should be limited to}} less than 180. g/kg whilst whole lupins can be included up to 240. g/kg without deleterious effects on production and intestinal health...|$|R
40|$|Organically {{produced}} cereals, legumes, {{oil seed}} products, forages, silages and new protein feedstuffs were analysed for nutrient composition. In this report, new high quality, protein rich feedstuffs included microalgae, insects and mussel meal. Protein feedstuffs also contained samples from less known plant feed materials for pigs and poultry, such as sainfoin seeds with hulls <b>or</b> <b>dehulled,</b> grass pea seeds and soybean by-product okara. Feed samples were analysed for dry matter, ash, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, neutral and acid detergent fibre, lignin, starch, sugars, amino acids, minerals, phytic acid, phytase activity and in vitro digestibilities according to Boisen and Fernàndez (1995, 1997) {{to predict the}} standardised ileal digestibility of amino acids (Boisen 2007). MTT, Agrifood Research Finland, analysed all the feed ingredients {{that were used in}} the feeding experiments throughout the ICOPP project. By having all samples analysed in the same place, and using the same methodology, it is possible to compare feed ingredients and transfer the results from country to country. Furthermore, there is often lack of information concerning analysed nutrient composition of organically produced feed materials. Information in this report can be used in feed optimisation for pigs and poultry on farms and by feed manufactures. Feedstuff names have been compiled based on EU feed catalogue (EU 575 / 2011). The calculation of feed energy values for pigs and poultry differs between European countries. In this report, the nutrient contents are translated into the feeding values according to feed evaluation systems used in different European countries. This report contains energy and protein values for pigs based on the French, Dutch and Danish feed evaluation systems. Energy values of feeds were also calculated according the British, German and Swiss feed evaluation systems. Energy values for poultry were presented according to the Finnish and Dutch feed evaluation systems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two 12 -day {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Large White turkeys to determine which amino acids are deficient in a diet containing dehulled soybean meal as the sole source of protein. A 22 % protein basal diet composed of 43. 3 % glucose monohydrate, 45. 4 % dehulled soybean meal,. 5 % DL-methionine, 6 % stabilized fat, and added minerals and vitamins served as the negative control. Two positive control diets were formed by substituting either 16. 5 % <b>dehulled</b> soybean meal <b>or</b> a mixture containing amounts of essential amino acids equivalent {{to those in the}} added dehulled soybean meal in place of an equal amount of glucose monohydrate in the basal diet. Nine additional diets were formed by removing one or more amino acids from the mixture. Each of the 12 diets in a block design was fed to two pens of males and two pens of females with 8 birds per pen from 7 to 19 days of age in each experiment. Average body weight gain of poults fed the 22 % protein diet with added amino acids approached that of poults fed the 30 % protein diet (288 vs. 300 g, respectively). Removal of the amino acid mixture from the 22 % protein diet depressed body weight gain by 19. 0 %. Depressions of 19, 16, 11, 7, and 6 % in body weight gains resulted from the removal of valine, threonine, lysine, phenylalanine (or tyrosine or glycine), and isoleucine, respectively. A decrease of 5 % was required for significance (P=£. 05). When evaluated by this deletion technique, effects of valine and threonine deficiency were more pronounced than effects of lysine deficiency in dehulled soybean meal for young turkeys...|$|R
40|$|Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed is {{the oldest}} oil seed crop and the highest content of fats and oils among other seeds oil. The fats and oils of sesame contain good {{proteins}} and vitamins for body health and food. This research presents the study of soap from undehulled (coated) and dehulled sesame seed oil which derived from a soxhlet extraction method. Different treats of sesame seed were exposed to experiment that determine the value of physiochemical, such as saponification value (SV), acid value (AV), iodine value (IV), free fatty acid value (FFA) and peroxide value (PV). Sesame oils were saponified with two types of alkali which sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) to give a solid and liquid soap, respectively. The analysis of the soap was carried out to determine the pH value, foam height, colour in solution, and solubility in water and foam structure. Further analysis of the soap was testing with a dirty cloth, hand washing and laboratory glassware. Results from the analysis were exposed that sesame seed can produce either solid or liquid soap with high of conditioning agent. Dehulled oil has saponification value of 186. 5 mg KOH/ g, acid value of 109. 4 g I 2 / 100 g, peroxide value of 14. 8 meq H 2 O 2 /g, and free fatty acid value of 49. 3 % (oleic) and undehulled seed oil has values 210. 4 mg KOH/ g, 1. 34 g I 2 / 100 g, 106. 3 meq H 2 O 2 /g, 8 and 39. 48 % (Oleic), respectively. In conclusion, {{the objective of this}} study is achieved where sesame seed soap can be established, whether from undehulled <b>or</b> <b>dehulled</b> oil. In future, sesame oil is potentially to use as an oil foundation in making soa...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} {{nutritional}} value of whole and dehulled ground seeds of Lupinus albus L., cv. Butan by the determination of balance digestibility of nutrients in growing pigs at different levels of replacement of soy protein with lupine. The experiment was performed on 25 pigs of hybrid combination Pietrain × (Duroc × Large White × Landrace) with initial body weights of 30. 7 ± 2. 21 kg. The feed compound of the control group contained extracted soybean meal (ESM). In four experimental diets, 50 % and 100 % replacement of soy protein with the inclusion of whole (WL 50, WL 100) <b>or</b> <b>dehulled</b> (DL 50, DL 100) lupine was carried out. Nutrient and amino acid digestibility was determined using the indicator of insoluble ash in 4 M HCl in pigs with a mean live body weight of 48. 9 ± 3. 51 kg. Higher digestibility of crude protein (P < 0. 01), ether extract (P < 0. 01), crude fibre (P < 0. 01), NDF, ADF (P < 0. 05), and cellulose (P < 0. 05) was found for the diet WL 50 compared with the control group ESM. In the diet DL 50, higher digestibility of crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, NDF, and cellulose (P < 0. 01) was recorded compared with the control. Higher digestibility of lysine and threonine (P < 0. 01) was found in the diet WL 50 in comparison with ESM; a lower digestibility of methionine (P < 0. 01) was found in the diet DL 50. Lower digestibility of crude protein, NDF, ADF (P < 0. 01), and cellulose (P < 0. 01) was found at 100 % supplementation of soy protein with whole seed lupine (WL 100) compared to the control. A 100 % replacement of soy protein with dehulled lupine (DL 100) resulted in significantly higher digestibility of dry matte...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{process of}} moving from {{collecting}} {{plants in the}} wild to cultivating and gradually domesticating them has as its linguistic corollary {{the formation of a}} specific vocabulary to designate the plants and their parts, the fields in which they are cultivated, the tools and activities required to cultivate them and the food preparations in which they enter. From this point of view, independent domestications of a plant can be expected to result in wholly independent vocabularies. Conversely, when cultivation of a plant spreads from one population to another, one may expect some elements of the original vocabulary to spread with cultivation practices. Reversing the argument, one might take loanwords as evidence of a transfer of cultivation practices. As a potential example, Japanese kome 'uncooked rice' could be borrowed from a precusor of the Old Chinese word 米 *C. mˤijʔ 'millet <b>or</b> rice grains, <b>dehusked</b> and polished'. Transmission of the term would have occurred as cultivation of temperated japonica rice spread northeast from east China. Reconstructing the history of rice thus {{can be thought of as}} the problem of matching three kinds of objects: genetically derived rice clades (Japonica, Indica, Aus), archaeology observed centres of domestication (lower Yangzi, mid Yangzi, perhaps the Ganges valley), and independent rice vocabularies. How many independent vocabularies of rice are there in Asia ? Sagart (2003) argued that there are no significant contacts between the Austroasiatic (AA) and Sino-Tibetan-Austronesian (STAN) rice vocabularies. The Hmong-Mien vocabulary was also shown to be distinct from the AA one, and to have points of contact with the STAN vocabulary. This might be taken as an argument supporting (at least) two distinct domestications of Asian rice. In this paper I will examine the rice-related vocabulary that can be reconstructed for Sino-Tibetan (ST) and the larger Sino-Tibetan-Austronesian more closely, also discussing the vocabulary of foxtail millet, not easily separated. I will suggest that the STAN and Hmong-Mien vocabularies are the result of interaction between a southern rice vocabulary (Yangzi valley) and a northern foxtail-millet vocabulary (Yellow river valley). I will also approach the question whether south Asian rice vocabularies have points of contact with any of the east and southeast Asian vocabularies. If so, this might constitute a linguistic parallel to the introgression of domestication genes from japonica into indica. Of particular interest is the east Asian term Proto-Austronesian *beRas 'dehusked rice', Written Tibetan mbras 'rice', compared with south Asian terms like Sanskrit vrihi, Afghan wrižē, Tamil arici, all 'rice'. The possibility that the resemblance between the two is meaningful will be discussed...|$|R
