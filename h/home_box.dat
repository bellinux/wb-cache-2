25|$|Originally, <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office was to {{debut on}} a Service Electric cable {{television}} system in Allentown; {{in order to}} avoid blackouts for NBA games that it was set to televise (Allentown was within the NBA's designated blackout radius for the Philadelphia 76ers' market area, under rules that the league had in effect at the time to protect ticket sales), Time-Life agreed to an offer by Service Electric president John Walson to launch the channel on its system in Wilkes-Barre (outside of the 76ers' DMA, in northeastern Pennsylvania). <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office launched on November 8, 1972. However, HBO's launch came without fanfare in the press, as it was not covered by any local or national media outlets. In addition, the city manager of Wilkes-Barre declined an offer to attend the launch ceremony, while Time Inc. {{president and chief executive officer}} J. Richard Munro was unable to attend as he was stranded in traffic while trying to exit Manhattan on the George Washington Bridge on his way to Wilkes-Barre.|$|E

Camacho dropped Ramirez in round three and won the fight by a unanimous twelve-round decision.|$|E
25|$|In September 1973, Time-Life, Inc. {{completed}} its {{acquisition of the}} pay service. At the time, <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office's future looked dim: it only had 8,000 subscribers across 14 cable systems, {{all of which were}} located in Pennsylvania, and it was suffering from a significant subscriber churn rate. HBO would eventually increase its fortunes within two years: by April 1975, the service had around 100,000 subscribers in Pennsylvania and New York state, and had begun to turn a limited profit.|$|E

25|$|He entered {{broadcasting}} as a nineteen-year-old radio {{disc jockey}} {{in his native}} Baltimore, Maryland. Two years later, he moved to television as a features reporter for an afternoon newsmagazine in Cleveland, Ohio. He rose to co-host. Moving to New York City, he worked as an entertainment reporter for Entertainment Tonight and the <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office. He returned to Cleveland in the early 1990s as a weekend news anchor, then again to New York City, and Los Angeles, {{as a reporter for}} the Fox Network prime time newsmagazine Front Page.|$|E
25|$|HBO {{broadcasts}} {{its primary}} and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer {{the east and}} west coast feeds of the main HBO channel, as well as HBO2 in some cases), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most. The premium film service Cinemax, which is also owned by Time Warner through <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office Inc., operates as a separate service from HBO; although HBO is very frequently sold together in a package with Cinemax, subscribers to one of the services do not necessarily have to subscribe to the other.|$|E
25|$|On April 27, 1986, American {{electrical}} engineer and business owner John R. MacDougall, using the pseudonym Captain Midnight, jammed the <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office (HBO) satellite signal on Galaxy 1 during a showing {{of the film}} The Falcon and the Snowman. He broadcast a message lasting {{four and a half}} minutes, protesting HBO's rates for satellite dish owners, which he considered too expensive. MacDougall was working at his second job as an operations engineer at the Central Florida Teleport uplink station in Ocala, Florida, and fought with a technician at HBO's communications center in Hauppauge, Long Island, for control of the transmission. The technician attempted to increase uplink power but gave up because of the risk of damaging the satellite. MacDougall eventually got scared and abandoned his control of the satellite.|$|E

25|$|Yates then {{directed}} Richard Curtis' {{script to}} The Girl in the Café, a television film starring Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald. In June 2005, {{the film was}} aired on the BBC in Britain and was also broadcast in the United States on the premium cable television network <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office. The Girl in the Café achieved three wins at the Emmy Awards, most notably the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, and gained {{a total of four}} nominations including Outstanding Directing for Yates. The film coincided with the BBC's Africa Lives season of programming and with the global Make Poverty History campaign. The message of the film is conveyed through the character-driven story of Lawrence (Nighy) and Gina (Macdonald) dealing with their feelings for one another while challenging political concerns at the G8 Summit in Reykjavík.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office (HBO) began {{scrambling}} its signal on a 24-hour {{basis on}} January 15, 1986, it offered subscriptions to home dish owners for $12.95 per month ($28.92 in 2017 dollars), which was either {{equal to or}} slightly higher than what cable subscribers paid. HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a descrambler for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the monthly fee) allow them to continue watching HBO. Several satellite dish dealers across the United States closed their stores {{as a result of}} a reduction in dish sales, caused by the rise in signal scrambling. Satellite dish owners began protests over scrambling, saying that clear signals from cable channels would become difficult to receive. One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on Washington, D.C., in March 1986 to urge the United States Congress to protect access to satellite transmissions.|$|E
25|$|Time-Life {{executives}} {{realized the}} problems in trying to expand <b>Home</b> <b>Box</b> Office's distribution footprint using microwave towers {{because of the time}} and expense that would be incurred in developing such a vast relay infrastructure, and began looking for cost-efficient methods of transmitting the channel nationally. In 1974, they settled on using a geostationary communications satellite to transmit HBO to cable providers throughout the United States. Other television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about uplinking their feeds to satellite due to fears that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or jettison out of their orbit, as well as due to the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes, which in 1974, were sold for as much as $75,000. Seeing satellite transmission as the only viable option to expand HBO's reach, Gerald Levin allocated $6.5 million to lease transponder space on the Westar 1 satellite for a five-year term. The Time-Life board subsequently approved the plan to transmit HBO via satellite.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{support of}} the {{terrestrial}} digital television network was controversial. Opponents stated that the frequencies would be better applied to providing wireless broadband; however as most other countries use these frequencies for television, little consumer equipment would have support for such use. Proponents stated that a digital television network would be {{the easiest way to}} carry out the digital television transition and that it would allow the population to receive NRK without having go have an agreement with a commercial company. [...] The long political precessing time resulted in that MPEG-4 could be used for compression, allowing for more channels and better quality, and that all <b>home</b> <b>boxes</b> can support high definition.|$|R
