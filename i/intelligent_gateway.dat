In the article, a system was developed for estimating the growth of crops in greenhouse, which was based on spectrum and WSN (wireless sensor network) technology. The system consisted of three parts: the intelligent sensor nodes, <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway</b> and the software in remote server. The ZigBee wireless communication modules were embedded in the intelligent sensor nodes and gateway to create WSN. The intelligent sensor nodes contained four optical channels, which allowed these instruments work at the wavelengths of 550, 650, 766 and 850 nm. They were used to collect spectral data and transmit to the <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway</b> by ZigBee wireless network. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway</b> worked as a coordinator of the whole wireless network waiting for sensor nodes to join in and receiving all the spectral data from sensor nodes, and transmitting the data to remote server by GPRS. The software in remote server analyzed the spectral data, calculated the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), by which, the growth of the plants can be detected effectively. In order to test the effectiveness and stability of the system, the strawberry of greenhouse was detected. Several experiments were carried out in the greenhouse of ZhuoZhou Experiment Station in Hebei. Results showed that the canopy spectral data of strawberries could be acquired by the intelligent sensor nodes stably, and the <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway</b> could connect the sensor nodes and the remote server effectively. The spectral data can be received by the remote server normally as well. The system provides a kind of technical support and theoretical basis for crop growth estimation in greenhouse...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) poisoning {{from natural}} gas water heaters {{is a common}} household accident in Taiwan. We propose a wireless and batteryless intelligent CO sensor for improving the safety of operating natural gas water heaters. A micro-hydropower generator supplies power to a CO sensor without battery (COSWOB) (2. 5 W at a flow rate of 4. 2 L/min), and the power consumption of the COSWOB is only ~ 13 mW. The COSWOB monitors the CO concentration in ambient conditions around natural gas water heaters and transmits it to an <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway.</b> When the CO level reaches a dangerous level, the COSWOB alarm sounds loudly. Meanwhile, the <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway</b> also sends a trigger to activate Wi-Fi alarms and sends notifications to the mobile device through the Internet.

They have a wide range of applications in many fields at home such as security and monitoring, healthcare, energy, and entertainment applications. The improvement of humans’ living standards make people keep trying to delegate many of their needs to a home automation system. Such a system has been built with capabilities of predicting what the user intends to do in smart home environment. However, there are many issues that need more investigation and solutions, such as: 1) many researches adopt a specific application without integrating different varieties of applications in one environment, 2) there is no study tries to show the real effect or even evaluates the implementation of predicted actions that have been established via homes <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway,</b> 3) there is an interoperability issue due to using different kinds of home applications that have different protocols for message context. In this proposal, we will describe a new approach of an intelligent self-adaptive system that can precisely monitor a stakeholder behaviors and analyze his/her actions trying to anticipate a stakeholder behavior in the future. In addition, we will evaluate the real effect of a predicted actions after implementing them by an <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway</b> in a simulated home environment. The principle behind a prediction process is presented by analyzing a sequence of user’s interaction events with heterogeneous, and distributed nodes in the environment using an <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway.</b> Predicting next stakeholder action can be process using certain analytical algorithms. The main novelties in the proposed approach are threefold: I) Developing a learning technique which is embedded in an <b>intelligent</b> <b>gateway</b> to build a model of users’ behavior and interactions to balance the needs of multiple users within a smart home environment. II) Presents a novel visualization model for a home area network (HAN) based on a degree of centrality criteria, that helps an enterprise companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Xively to understand the most important services of their customers, III) The proposed system shows a high level concept of how we can design an intelligent self-adaptive system in home environment that has the capability to provide stakeholder with local services, and to support a use of IoT paradigm concurrently...|$|E
