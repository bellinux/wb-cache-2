5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro {{models were}} updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apple’s only product to still include an optical drive and a <b>Firewire</b> <b>port,</b> and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.|$|E
25|$|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was {{released}} on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features. As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256MB and a built-in <b>FireWire</b> <b>port.</b> Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used {{a modified version of}} Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, {{with the exception of the}} Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{hailed by}} Slashgear as [...] "one {{of the best}} {{entry-level}} notebooks Apple have produced," [...] the unibody MacBook has received criticism for its lack of a <b>FireWire</b> <b>port</b> and SD card slot. Nilay Patel of Engadget added that the USB ports were easily dented and {{the bottom of the}} laptop became worn and discolored after a few days. He also drew particular {{attention to the fact that}} the price was not lowered, stating the small price difference between the MacBook and the MacBook Pro makes it a [...] "wasted pricing opportunity." [...] However, most critics agree that the unibody MacBook's display is significantly better than its predecessor's. AppleInsider states the new display [...] "delivers significantly better color and viewing angle performance" [...] than the previous MacBook, but still [...] "not as vivid and wide-angle viewable as the MacBook Pro screens." ...|$|E
50|$|Plug-and-play ports are {{designed}} so that the connected devices automatically start handshaking {{as soon as the}} hot-swapping is done. USB <b>ports</b> and <b>FireWire</b> <b>ports</b> are plug-and-play.|$|R
25|$|There {{were also}} fears that Intel, which {{took part in}} the {{development}} and implementation of the USB, would force Apple to drop all development and support of its FireWire serial bus on all Intel Macs. This did not occur, as <b>FireWire</b> <b>ports</b> continued to be included on all Macs, except certain notebook configurations beginning with the MacBook Air in 2008, until being replaced by the faster Thunderbolt port.|$|R
50|$|Though the {{potential}} for a combined Ethernet and <b>FireWire</b> 8P8C <b>port</b> is intriguing, , no products or chipsets include this capability.|$|R
500|$|Although Gizmodo {{concluded}} {{it to be}} [...] "our favorite MacBook to date," [...] {{they did}} claim, at this time, its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, alleging a smaller viewing angle, washed-out colors, and dimmer backlighting. Similarly, AppleInsider and Engadget concluded it [...] "may well be Apple's best MacBook to date" [...] and [...] "these are terrific choices—not only from an industrial design standpoint, but in specs as well" [...] respectively, while also drawing attention to a lower quality display {{as compared with the}} MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. Charlie Sorrel of Wired News reached a similar conclusion about the MacBook display, citing its poor contrast and lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older white MacBook. Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the <b>FireWire</b> <b>port</b> for Macworld, saying [...] "The absence of FireWire ports is certainly an inconvenience for some users. But it shouldn’t be considered a deal-breaker for most of us, anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apple {{incorporated}} several {{features in}} the design of the MacBook Air, such as the reduction of lead to make it more environmentally friendly. The MacBook Air contains no BFRs and PVC wiring, meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements, has a recyclable enclosure, and is rated EPEAT Gold. Its display is made from arsenic-free glass, and contains no mercury. To reduce the computer's size and weight, several features were sacrificed. It was Apple's first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built-in removable media drive. It also omits a <b>FireWire</b> <b>port,</b> Ethernet port, line-in, media card slots (except the 13" [...] 2010 through 2015 models, which have an SD card slot), and a Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
50|$|Second <b>FireWire</b> <b>port</b> {{allows a}} user to {{daisy-chain}} multiple Drobos up to a computer. Each Drobo mounts {{as a separate}} system on the computer.|$|E
50|$|USB or FireWire {{connections}} are typically used to attach consumer class external hard drives to a computer. Unlike SCSI, eSATA, or SAS these require circuitry {{to convert the}} hard disk's native signal to the appropriate protocol. Parallel ATA and internal Serial ATA hard disks are frequently connected to such chassis because nearly all computers {{on the market today}} have USB or <b>FireWire</b> <b>ports,</b> and these chassis are inexpensive and easy to find.|$|R
50|$|The 320 and 540 used a Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) memory system. This {{shared the}} video and system memory and ran {{them at the same}} speed, and allowed for up to 80 percent of the system ram to be applied to video memory. The {{allocation}} was static, however, and was adjusted via a profile. The 320 and 540 also used the onboard Cobalt video adapter, which was SGI's proprietary graphics chipset. The firmware the systems used was a PROM that enabled booting into a graphical subsystem before the OS was loaded. In this regard they resembled the Irix/MIPS line of SGI computers such as the SGI O2. The 320 and 540 also stood out for having <b>Firewire</b> (IEEE 1394) <b>ports,</b> onboard composite/s-video capture, and USB keyboards and mice. They differed from each other in the 320 was dual Pentium II/III capable with 1GB maximum system RAM, while the 540 was quad Pentium III Xeon capable with 2GB maximum system RAM. Both computers used a proprietary DIMM module that was essentially the same as ECC SDRAM PC-100, but in a package one half normal size. The maximum memory per module was 96MB, and the SGI 320 had twelve memory slots. It {{is important to note that}} the <b>Firewire</b> <b>ports</b> that were built into the 320 never functioned. SGI distributed Orange Micro Firewire cards about a year after production started in lieu of fixing the <b>Firewire</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
50|$|Premium Edition drives {{are similar}} to the Essential Edition model but also include <b>Firewire</b> 400 <b>ports,</b> an {{integrated}} visual capacity gauge and Western Digital backup software.|$|R
5000|$|This variant (SB0160) {{uses the}} full EMU10K2 chip (CA0100 chip [...] ) and is, as a result, quite similar in feature set. It is only missing its <b>FireWire</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
50|$|FireWave has six output {{channels}} {{through three}} 1/8” (3.5mm) stereo mini-jacks: Left/Right, Center/Subwoofer and Right Surround/Left Surround. There {{is also a}} passthrough <b>FireWire</b> <b>port</b> to allow for chaining more FireWire devices.|$|E
50|$|The Sound Blaster Audigy Platinum EX (SB0090) {{is similar}} to the Audigy ES, but {{supported}} an external break out box instead of the standard internal version. It came with a <b>Firewire</b> <b>port</b> and was introduced before the AS models.|$|E
50|$|The current edition (as of November 2010) has two <b>Firewire</b> 800 <b>ports</b> and one USB 2.0 mini port. It comes pre-formatted as Mac OS X HFS+.|$|R
50|$|Apple first {{included}} on-board FireWire {{in some of}} its 1999 Macintosh models (though it {{had been}} a build-to-order option on some models since 1997), and most Apple Macintosh computers manufactured in the years 2000 through 2011 included <b>FireWire</b> <b>ports.</b> However, in February 2011 Apple introduced the first commercially available computer with Thunderbolt. Apple released its last computers featuring FireWire late 2012. By 2014 Thunderbolt had become a standard feature across Apple's entire line of computers effectively becoming the spiritual successor to FireWire in the Apple ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|A SCSI {{host adapter}} is a device used to connect {{one or more}} other SCSI devices to a {{computer}} bus. It is commonly called a SCSI controller, which is not strictly correct as any component understanding the SCSI protocol can be called a controller. In this sense all SCSI devices have a SCSI controller built into them, while host adapters (unlike, for example, a hard disk or CD-ROM) bear responsibility for transferring data between the SCSI bus and the computer's input/output bus. SCSI adapters serve as a worthy adapter for <b>FireWire</b> <b>Ports.</b>|$|R
5000|$|I/O ports: 4 USB ports, 1 <b>FireWire</b> <b>port,</b> 1 Fast Ethernet port, 1 56K modem, 1 5-in-1 {{memory card}} reader, 1 Express Card slot, 1 VGA output, 1 S-Video output, 1 {{headphone}} jack, 1 microphone jack/line-in, and 1 power adapter port.|$|E
50|$|The second-generation of the iPod was {{introduced}} on July 17, 2002. Using a similar body style {{as the first}} generation, {{the top of the}} iPod was redesigned, switching from a single swooping cutout in the back plate to mount the <b>firewire</b> <b>port,</b> hold switch and headphone assembly, to individual ports being cut into the back plate to allow these ports to be accessed. Furthermore, the hold switch was redesigned, a cover was added to the <b>FireWire</b> <b>port,</b> and the mechanical wheel was replaced with a touch-sensitive wheel. The second-generation class was available in 10GB for US$399 and 20GB for US$499. The first-generation 5GB iPod was carried over, but its price was reduced to US$299.|$|E
50|$|The cables {{that carry}} digital video are almost {{invariably}} serial—such as coax cable plugged into a HD-SDI port, a webcam plugged into a USB port or <b>Firewire</b> <b>port,</b> Ethernet cable connecting an IP camera to a Power over Ethernet port, FPD-Link, etc.|$|E
50|$|Rohit Ports ports {{used with}} video {{equipment}} (among other devices) {{can be either}} 4-pin or 6-pin. The two extra conductors in the 6-pin connection carry electrical power. This is why a self-powered device such as a camcorder often connects with a cable that is 4-pins on the camera side and 6-pins on the computer side, the two power conductors simply being ignored. This is also why laptop computers usually have only 4-pin <b>FireWire</b> <b>ports,</b> as they cannot provide enough power to meet requirements for devices needing the power provided by 6-pin connections.|$|R
5000|$|... 3 <b>Port</b> <b>Firewire</b> 800 (1394b) {{controller}} (TI XIO2213AZAY - PCI Express) ...|$|R
50|$|In July 2008, Drobo {{announced}} a 2nd generation model, which offered a faster core processor, optimized firmware, better USB 2.0 performance {{and a pair}} of <b>FireWire</b> 800 <b>ports,</b> which are compatible with FireWire 400-to-800 cables and adapters.|$|R
50|$|The TRV950 has a fully {{functional}} analog {{to digital}} conversion and pass-through unlike the TRV900. The TRV900 {{will allow you}} to record from an analog source but will not directly convert the analog signal into DV when connected to a <b>firewire</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Early cameras {{used the}} PC serial port. USB {{is now the}} most widely used method (most cameras are {{viewable}} as USB mass storage), though some have a <b>FireWire</b> <b>port.</b> Some cameras use USB PTP mode for connection instead of USB MSC; some offer both modes.|$|E
5000|$|The Sound Blaster Audigy 4 (SB0610) uses CA10300 (CA0108's {{unleaded}} counterpart) DSP {{instead of}} the more advanced CA10200 (CA0102's unleaded counterpart) and does not have external hub, <b>FireWire</b> <b>port</b> or gold connectors. The board layout {{is similar to the}} Audigy 2 Value. The SNR is rated 106 dB.|$|E
25|$|The I/O ports {{were changed}} with the early 2009 revision. A fifth USB 2.0 port was added and the <b>FireWire</b> 400 <b>port</b> was {{replaced}} with a <b>FireWire</b> 800 <b>port.</b> The AirPort card was upgraded to 802.11a/b/g/draft-n and later to 802.11a/b/g/n. Bluetooth was also upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1. Instead of a single full-size DVI port, a Mini-DVI port was added along with a Mini DisplayPort connection, which allows dual display support. Unlike the DVI port, the Mini DisplayPort supports external displays with a resolution up to 2560×1600, which allows use of the 30-inch Cinema Display with the Mac Mini. As of this revision, the Apple Remote is no longer included with the Mac Mini.|$|R
50|$|Consumer-grade tapeless camcorders {{include a}} USB port to {{transfer}} video onto a computer. Professional models include other options like Serial digital interface (SDI) or HDMI. Some tapeless camcorders {{are equipped with}} a <b>Firewire</b> (IEEE-1394) <b>port</b> to ensure compatibility with magnetic tape-based DV and HDV formats.|$|R
50|$|It {{also allows}} more recent {{versions}} of Mac OS X {{to be installed}} on older G3 Macs which can only officially run earlier versions of OS X - for example, it allows Mac OS X v10.3 and Mac OS X v10.4 to run successfully on Beige G3s, 10.2 having been the last version supported by Apple. It can even facilitate otherwise-awkward installations on supported machines; for instance, it allows Mac OS X v10.4, which shipped on DVD media, to be installed onto a Blue and White G3 with only an external, non-bootable DVD drive. Likewise, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger ended support for machines that lacked built-in <b>FireWire</b> <b>ports,</b> these being the original iMac G3s and iBook G3s, but XPostFacto allows the use of 10.4 on them.|$|R
5000|$|Hardware {{specifications}} at introduction were a 200 MHz ($2000) or 266 MHz ($2700) Pentium MMX CPU, 32 MB RAM, a 2.1 GB hard drive, 10.4" [...] SVGA (800x600) screen, integrated sound, modem, speakers, microphone, PC-Card slot, and optional <b>firewire</b> <b>port.</b> It {{also featured}} a touchpad with additional pen (graphics tablet) functionality.|$|E
5000|$|I/O ports: 4 USB 2.0 ports, 1 <b>FireWire</b> <b>port</b> (optional), 1 Fast Ethernet port, 1 56K modem (optional), 1 VGA output, 1 HDMI output (with ATI Radeon HD 4350), 1 {{headphone}} jack, 2 microphone jacks, 1 line-in connector, 1 line-out connector, 1 19-in-1 {{memory card}} reader (optional), and 1 power cable connector.|$|E
50|$|The DVX100 also {{features}} two XLR audio inputs, another rare feature for cameras in its price range. It includes a 4-pin <b>FireWire</b> <b>port,</b> {{as well as}} S-Video and RCA in and out ports. It features manual and servo zoom, with a second zoom control and record button {{on top of the}} handle for recording from low angles.|$|E
50|$|The console also {{features}} USB and IEEE 1394 (<b>Firewire)</b> expansion <b>ports.</b> A {{hard disk drive}} can be installed in an expansion bay {{on the back of}} the console, and is required to play certain games, notably the popular Final Fantasy XI. This is only available on certain models.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009 Announced the VessRAID {{storage for}} SMBs and a {{partnership}} with Sony for IP surveillance storage. Announced NS4600 4 bay NAS with DLNA 1.5 certification and the DS4600 4 bay DAS with <b>FireWire</b> 800 <b>ports.</b> Launched the SuperTrak EX 6G SAS RAID controller and the first 6G SAS SBB 2.0.|$|R
25|$|The third {{generation}} began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for FireWire or USB connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, {{as most of}} them did not have <b>FireWire</b> <b>ports</b> at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) {{in an attempt to}} reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack or a USB data and charging port for the dock/cable.|$|R
