5|$|The {{body of the}} man killed {{outside the}} bowling alley is discovered, missing a tongue. It is {{identified}} as a retired police officer, Detective Mellen, who had given false testimony that had sent Annie Tisman's late husband to prison. Black realizes that the killer is motivated {{by the need to}} right wrongs such as this, killing those who <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> with crimes. Meanwhile, The Judge passes sentence on another victim—a slumlord whose negligence caused a tenant's death. Bardale is ordered to cut the landlord's leg off while he is still alive; the leg is later found in a postal depot in a package.|$|E
500|$|Criticism arose {{as soon as}} Coddington {{returned}} to Rhode Island with his commission. [...] In September 1651, William Arnold summed up the feelings {{of many of the}} Providence settlers when he wrote, [...] "Whereas Mr. Coddington have gotten a charter of Road Iland and Conimacuke Iland to himself, he have thereby broken the force of their charter that went under the name of Providence, because he <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> the greater part of that colonie." [...] Clarke voiced his opposition to Coddington's rule of the island, and he was commissioned as the island's agent to England on 15 October 1651. [...] The following month, he and William Dyer were sent to England to get the Coddington commission revoked. [...] Simultaneously, the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick sent Roger Williams on a similar errand, and the three men sailed for England in November 1651, just a few months after Clarke had been released from prison. [...] The men did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652 because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch.|$|E
500|$|Nikki and Paulo {{were killed}} off due to being disliked by much of Losts fan base. Show runner Damon Lindelof {{admitted}} that the couple were [...] "universally despised" [...] by fans. Lindelof explained that [...] "back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we could <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> with these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had {{to clean up the}} mess." [...] The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006. It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo's bad reception, they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast. Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive. Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has claustrophobia. Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired. Santoro {{said in an interview with}} Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season. Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show, Football Wives.|$|E

500|$|Aged thirteen, Mao left Shaoshan Primary School, {{pleased to}} <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> {{from what he}} saw as its oppressive atmosphere. The {{decision}} had been made by his father, who wanted Mao to devote his attentions to the family business by working on the farm and managing the financial accounts. However, relations between him and his father became increasingly strained. Mao continued to read in his free time, often staying up late at night in his bedroom to read by candle light; this angered his father, who saw recreational reading as an unproductive pursuit. At this point he read a book which inspired his interest in politics: Zheng Guanying's Sheng-shih Wei-yen ("Words of Warning to an Affluent Age"). Published in 1893, the book lamented the deterioration of Chinese power in East Asia, and argued for technological, economic and political reform, believing that China could be strengthed if it abandoned its absolute monarchy and politically modelling itself on the representative democracies and constitutional monarchies of the Western world. His political views were shaped by protests [...] led by the Gelaohui, or Elder Brother Society [...] which erupted following a famine in Hunanese capital Changsha; Mao supported the protesters' demands, but the armed forces suppressed the dissenters and executed their leaders. The famine spread to Shaoshan, where starving peasants seized his father's grain; disapproving of their actions as morally wrong, Mao nevertheless claimed sympathy for their situation.|$|E
500|$|In March 1995, Los Angeles Times writer Nancy Reichardt {{characterized}} Sharon as [...] "the {{girl from}} {{the wrong side of}} the tracks" [...] with Nekeeta Borden of the entertainment news website Daytime Confidential describing her as being kindhearted and a [...] "" [...] during her early years on the show, noting that she wanted to start her own trends rather than follow other members of the Newman family. Case likened Sharon to a younger Jill Foster Abbott (Jess Walton), telling Soap Opera Weekly that Jill [...] "was kind of like Sharon. She was nice...no one thought she was a gold digger—at first." [...] According to the actress, Sharon does [...] "weird things" [...] and panics when stressed, and her mistakes [...] "eat away at her", as [...] "She doesn't do well with secrets". Case also described the character as feeling insecure and unworthy of being in a happy relationship, telling the Star-Banner that [...] "Sharon goes through many emotions in a week". MSN characterized Sharon as a [...] "bitch" [...] after a storyline in which she took over Newman Enterprises in 2012. Of the writing for her character, Case said it is indispensable: [...] "They both have to be there. I couldn't <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> with this without those lines". However, the actress has expressed displeasure with Sharon being paired with [...] "too many men" [...] because it [...] "waters her down", wanting to incorporate different aspects of Sharon into her performance. Case stated that Sharon, who sees visions of her deceased daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes), believes that [...] "she is connected to the spiritual world".|$|E

2500|$|On January 1, 2014, Lovie Smith {{was hired}} as the new {{head coach of the}} Buccaneers, {{replacing}} Greg Schiano. Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under Tony Dungy. During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: [...] "There was a certain brand of football you expected from us", Smith said. [...] "You know we would be relentless. There was a brand of football that you got from us each week at Raymond James Stadium. It was hard for opponents to come in and win.

2500|$|Each {{of these}} episodes {{features}} Scooby {{and the four}} teenage members of Mystery, Inc., Fred, Shaggy, Daphne and Velma, arriving at a location in the [...] "Mystery Machine", a van painted with psychedelic colors and flower power imagery. Encountering a ghost, monster, or other supernatural creature who is terrorizing the local populace, they decide to investigate. The kids split up to look for clues and suspects while being chased at turns by the monster. Eventually, the kids come to realize the ghost and other paranormal activity is actually an elaborate hoax, and—often {{with the help of}} a Rube Goldberg-like trap designed by Fred—they capture the villain and unmask him. Revealed as a flesh and blood crook trying to cover up crimes by using the ghost story and costume, the criminal is arrested and taken to jail, often repeating something nearly identical to [...] "... and I would <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and realistic about what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing may <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox that makes {{you feel as if you}} [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E
