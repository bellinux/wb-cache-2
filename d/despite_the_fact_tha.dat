40|$|One {{lingering}} puzzle is why voluntary contribu tions {{to public}} goods decline {{over time in}} experimental and real-w orld settings. We show that the decl ine of cooperation is driven by individual preferences for im perfect conditional cooperation. Many people’s desire to contribute less than oth ers, rather than changing beliefs of what others will contr ibute over time or people’s heterogeneity in preferences makes voluntary cooperation fragile.

40|$|Priscoline can {{be given}} intra-arterially without difficulty. Untoward {{reactions}} are infrequent even in older patients. Intra-arterial administration was often effective in patients who {{did not respond to}} oral Priscoline. Although maximal vasodilatation may not be achieved by giving Priscoline intra-arterially, the degree of vasodilatation obtained is often adequate for a clinical effect. Results in 250 patients indicate that intra-arterial Priscoline is most useful in the treatment of ischemic rest pain resulting from organic vascular disease. Improvement in exercise tolerance was infre-quent. Causalgia, delayed wound healing and ulceration in Reynaud's disease responded favor-ably in some instances. ONE of the major objections to the use of chemical sympathetic blockade to produce vasodilatation in the manage-ment of peripheral arterial disease has been the inability to confine the effects of the medication to the local vascular bed where vasodilatation is desired. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} Canada’s {{development}} as a nation demonstrates the significant role played by small and medium-sized towns in the settlement process, particularly {{when one considers that}} the settle-ment pattern evolved from an “island archipelago”, whereby the population of the emerging nation was scattered in pockets from east to west close to the border with the United States, rather than in a continuous belt (Harris, 1998). As the Canadian urban system developed during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, these small towns played a vital role in supporting regional economies. Over time this system came to be dominated by a small number of metropolitan centres which, in turn, created and rein-forced core-periphery or heartland–hinterland relationships on both national and regional levels (McCann and Smith, 1991). Within this context, however, smaller urban centres continue to play a vital role within the resource economy, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The excitability of the monosynaptic reflex pathway {{was tested}} in infants and {{children}} from birth to four years of age during waking and sleeping. The H reflex, evoked in the soleus muscle, was {{used to calculate the}} ratio, maximal H to maximal M, construct recruitment curves and test reflex excitability by the paired stimulus method. The excitability of the monosynaptic reflex pathway during the waking state is greatest at birth; it diminishes gradually during the first years of life without reaching the average level observed in adults {{by the end of the}} fourth year of age. From birth, regard-less of age, sleep always depresses excitability. The mechanisms that underlie this change with age, and with waking or sleeping, are discussed. The characteristics of monosynaptic reflex responses have formed the subject of numerous studies in normal adult humanl- 3 and in the spastic man. 4 - 9 In the child, monosynaptic reflexes have been studied most in the upper limbs. 10 - 12 Few authors have used Hoffmann's monosynaptic reflex evoked in the soleus muscle of the child, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E

Forty patients of both sexes were clinically evaluated at the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile to identify pathologies of oral mucosa, gingival enlargement (GE), decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) index, and salivary flow. The average age of the transplant subjects was 49. 4 years, and the age range was 19 to 69 years. Most subjects maintained a good level of oral hygiene, and the rate mean of DMFT was 14. 7.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown {{variation}} among experimental attempts to establish whether human monozygotic twins that are genetically identical also have identical individual scents. In none of the cases were the dogs able to distinguish all the individual scents of monozygotic twins {{living in the same}} environment if the scents were presented to them separately. Ten specially trained police German Shepherd dogs of three Czech Republic Police Regional Headquarters were used for scent identification in our study. The dogs were supposed to match scents of two monozygotic pairs (5 and 7 years old) and two dizygotic twin pairs (8 and 13 years old). Scents were collected on cotton squares stored in glass jars. Dog handlers were blind to the experiment details. In each trial (line-up), one scent was used as a starting scent and the dog was then sent to determine if any of the 7 presented glass jars contained a matching scent. Scents of children of similar ages were used as distractors. In the matching procedure, the dogs matched correctly the scent of one twin with the other, as well as two scents collected from every single identical and non-identical twin to prove their efficacy and likewise, the presence of the matching twin scent in any given glass jar. All dogs in all trials distinguished correctly the scents of identical as well as non-identical twins. All dogs similarly matched positively two scents collected from the same individuals. Our findings indicated that specially trained German Shepherd dogs are able to distinguish individual scents of identical twins <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E

40|$|We now {{delve into}} one final major theme of our text: distribution. In {{this part of}} the book, we will explore some of the {{underlying}} tech-nology {{in one of the most}} important aspect of modern systems: how to build distributed systems. Distributed systems have changed the face of the world. When your web browser connects to a web server somewhere else on the planet, it is participating in what seems to be a simple form of a client/server distributed system. When you contact a modern web service such as Google or facebook, you are not just interacting with a single machine, however; behind the scenes, these complex ser-vices are built from a large collection (i. e., thousands) of machines, each of which cooperate to provide the particular service of the site. Thus, it should be clear what makes studying distributed systems interesting. Indeed, it is worthy of an entire class; here, we just intro-duce a few of the major topics. A number of new challenges arise when building a distributed system. The major one we focus on is failure; machines, disks, net-works, and software all fail from time to time, as we do not (and likely, will never) know how to build “perfect ” components and sys-tems. However, when we build a modern web service, we’d like it to appear to clients as if it never fails; how can we accomplish this task? Interestingly, while failure is a central challenge in constructing distributed systems, it also represents an opportunity. Yes, machines fail; but the mere fact that a machine fails does not imply the en-tire system must fail. By collecting together a set of machines, we can build a system that appears to rarely fail, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{series of}} {{experiments}} had its origin in an experiment on the mesenteric vein innervation in the intact animal, which was itself negative, in result. The animal was a rabbit, which was anesthetized previous to the experiment with 1 grams urethane per kilogram of body weight. As a control to the experiment, the effect of urethane was tested on a rabbit’s mesenteric vein ring, which was suspended between two hooks in a beaker of Ringer’s solution kept at 37 #{ 176 }C. The rabbit’s mesenteric vein is small in diameter, about 0. 15 cm., and yet this preparation gave a relaxation as great as 0. 6 cm. with a lever which magnified movements eighteen times. The effect was therefore considerable, and likely to be of importance in any experiment on veins in the urethanized animal. It seemed of equal importance and of some interest to investigate the effect of urethane on other tissues {{in which there is}} involuntary muscle, seeing that, although urethane is little used in the case of man, it is often used as a laboratory anesthetic. If it be taken, as seems justified by a summary of the results of a large {{series of experiments}} (1), that the rabbit’s blood weight is equal to approximately one-twentieth of its body weight, then a dosage of 1 grams per kilogram body weight would be equal to a concentration of over 1 : 40, if it were all in the blood. This is, of course, not claimed for an instant, but it is useful for the pres-ent purpose because it means that the concentration is nowhere likely to be greater than this, and experiments in which it is necessary to use urethane in larger amounts can reasonably be accounted of little practical importance, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E
