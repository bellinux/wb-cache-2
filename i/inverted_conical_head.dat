40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design of}} a broadband <b>inverted</b> <b>conical</b> circularly polarized quadrifilar helix antenna (QHA). The antenna has many good characteristics, including wide beam and broad bandwidth, which are achieved by utilizing <b>inverted</b> <b>conical</b> geometry and adjusting the dimensions of the <b>inverted</b> <b>conical</b> support. The antenna is fed by a wideband network to provide 90 ° phase difference between the four arms with constant amplitude. The antenna impedance and axial ratio bandwidth values are more than 39 % and 31. 5 %, respectively. The measured results coincide well with the simulated ones, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed design...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to improve the method for {{automatic}} measurement of particle-size distribution. 　In this attempt, the author has designed a special <b>conical</b> <b>head,</b> of which the base has a three dimensional Archimede 2 ̆ 7 s spiral contour, as a separator of particles. When particles are placed on the top of the specially designed <b>conical</b> <b>head,</b> they descend along its slope and then begin to drop one after another from it as a result of difference in the lengths of their descending paths. In order to enhance the effect of the separation, the <b>conical</b> <b>heads</b> and the hoppers are arranged, one after the other, in a vertical series. 　The results obtained on this apparatus are as follows :　The length of time required for a given number of particles to descend from the top of the <b>conical</b> <b>head</b> to the exit of the underlaying hopper is proportional to both the square root of ⊿lmax (⊿lmax is a maximum difference in the length of the generating line of the <b>conical</b> <b>head)</b> and the number of the <b>conical</b> <b>heads,</b> but is not affected by the nurnber of feeding particles...|$|R

Combining nanowire lengths of 2 - 9 μm with foot diameters of 36 - 935 nm yields fundamental flexural eigenmodes spanning two {{orders of magnitude}} from 200 kHz to 42 MHz.

5000|$|An {{instrument}} {{consisting of}} two attached, parallel, end-blown flutes of differing length, dating to the 15th or 16th century, was found in poor condition near All Souls College in Oxford.

Bob Marvin has estimated that the pipes played a fifth apart, at approximately C5 and G5. The instrument is sui generis. Although the instrument's pipes have thumb holes, the lack of organological precedent makes classification of the instrument difficult.

It had a clearly modernist aesthetic and ornamentation on its north and south facades. On the building's western side, there were three industrial naves that housed the boilers.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} the complex flow dynamics in the three-inlet plenum chamber of a swirling fluidized bed is presented.

Flow uniformity is assessed from the standard deviation of the velocities at the exit plane of the plenum. Ten different hub geometries,in the shape of cylinder, cone, conical frustum or a combination of these are considered in the study. From the simulation results it is seen that, {{from the point of view}} of pressure drop, the best hub geometry is the full-length cylinder.

Interestingly, the error does not affect any of the conclusions given in the 2010 paper.

The dielectric material creates a fundamentally new antenna which is reduced in size and much more rugged than a standard UWB conical antenna.
