The price and spatial connections (together with the quality of the provided services) become an important motive for clients when choosing a concrete accommodation establishment. As <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> is very difficult <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of accommodation establishments and the supply multiply surpasses the demand, there is an intensive search for miscellaneous strategies of <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>competition.</b> <b>The</b> built-up territory of the town České Budějovice was chosen as a model territory.

40|$|Online auction {{has become}} a very popular {{e-commerce}} transaction type. The immense business opportunities attract a lot of individuals as well as online stores. With more sellers <b>engaged</b> <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> between sellers is more intense. For sellers, how to maximize their profit by proper auction setting becomes the critical success factor in online auction market. In this paper, we provide a selling recommendation service which can predict the expected profit before listing and, based on the expected profit, recommend the seller whether to use current auction setting or not. We collect data from five kinds of digital camera from eBay and apply machine learning algorithm to predict sold probability and end-price. In order to get genuine sold probability and end-price prediction (even for unsold items), we apply probability calibration and sample selection bias correction when building the prediction models. To decide whether to list a commodity or not, we apply cost-sensitive analysis {{to decide whether to}} use current auction setting. We compare the profits using three different approaches: probability-based, end-price based, and our expected-profit based recommendation service. The experiment result shows that our recommendation service based on expected profit gives higher earnings and probability is a key factor that maintains the profit gain when ultra cost incurs for unsold items due to stocking...|$|R

In order to facilitate a true, immersive experience, {{we believe that it}} is necessary to adapt the presentation of an affective agent to the user’s affective state. Investigating the experience, behavior, and physiological correlates of affective events, such as winning and losing during a competitive game, therefore might be used to adapt the agent’s emotional states and system events. An experimental virtual reality game environment was designed as a stepping stone toward a system to demonstrate affective symbiosis. Users were invited to play a game of air hockey with affective agents in virtual reality. We collected the electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, and postural data, as well as self-reports, to investigate how emotional events affected physiology, behavior, and experience. The users were found to be <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> strongly while only paying limited attention to their adversaries’ emotional expressions. We discuss how game events are much stronger causes for affective responses, with the physiological effects of winning and losing becoming more enhanced as the game progresses.

Despite national support <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of grants provided by National Science Foundation, National Center for Information and Technology and legislation passed such as the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that encourages women to enter the STEM fields, the {{number of women}} actually graduating in these fields is surprisingly low. This research study focuses on a robotics competition and its ability to <b>engage</b> female adolescents <b>in</b> STEM curricula. ^ Data have been collected to help explain why young women are reticent to take technology or engineering type courses in high school and college. Factors that have been described include attitudes, parental support, social aspects, peer pressure, and lack of role models. Often these courses were thought to have masculine and “nerdy” overtones. The courses were usually majority male enrollments and appeared to be very competitive. With more female adolescents <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> this type of competitive atmosphere, this study gathered information to discover what about <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> appealed to these young women. ^ Focus groups were used to gather information from adolescent females who were participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First Lego League (FLL) and CEENBoT competitions. What enticed them to participate in a curriculum that data demonstrated many of their peers avoided? FLL and CEENBoT are robotics programs based on curricula that are taught in afterschool programs in non-formal environments. These programs culminate in a very large robotics competition. My research questions included: What are the factors that encouraged participants to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> robotics <b>competition?</b> What was <b>the</b> original enticement to the FLL and CEENBoT programs? What will make participants want to come back and what are the participants’ plans for the future?^ My research mirrored data of previous findings such as lack of role models, the need for parental support, social stigmatisms and peer pressure are still major factors that determine whether adolescent females seek out STEM activities. An interesting finding, which was an exception to previous findings, was these female adolescents enjoyed the challenge of <b>the</b> <b>competition.</b> <b>The</b> informal learning environments encouraged an atmosphere of social engagement and cooperative learning. Many volunteers that led the afterschool programs were women (role models) and a majority of parents showed support by accommodating an afterschool situation.

Since parties within multiparty systems compete <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of past and dawn of future coalition negotiations, parties that are regularly part of a coalition are not likely to exploit wedge issues as it could potentially jeopardize relationships with future coalition partners. Conversely, it is less risky for parties that have never been part of a government coalition to mobilize wedge issues.

The TPM, however, does have an impact on domestic pricing policies.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the outcome of}} a practice-based {{research}} project into contemporary formations of gender and sexuality through the study of drag performance. It is composed of two elements, the film Dragging the Past (presented on a DVD) and this written text. The film offers a multi-layered view of <b>the</b> drag performances <b>in</b> Koukles Club, Athens, Greece. The written thesis offers sociological analysis of articulations of self, from both performers and audiences. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate productions of the self through the process of viewing, <b>engaging,</b> and performing <b>in</b> a drag show, and also to examine <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which subjects negotiate their gender during this process. Moreover, this study illuminates the deployment of drag narratives, by both drag performers and members of the audience, as tools to create a desired self, always <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> other. A visual ethnography, that uses participant observation and video elicitation as key methods to gather empirical data, provides the foundation for this study. The ethnographic ‘I’ of the researcher combines with participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field and ‘together’ they produce ethnographic knowledge. Video elicitation interviews capture narratives of embodiment and competition; both film and text reflect that visual methods offer new perspectives on the way subjects form their gender and sexuality. This study reveals productions of particular kinds of subjects, specifically those that perform gender <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> other, while <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of <b>competition</b> and embodiment (incarnation), while also interrupting and disrupting the other. These themes proved to be central to the narratives participants deployed to perform the self. Furthermore, this thesis demonstrates that photographs and the act of mirroring are important to the forming of gender and sexuality, as they become tools for the production of the self.

40|$|Scramble {{competition}} polygyny {{is expected}} when females and/or resources are widely dispersed and not easily monopolized by males, or {{when there is}} an abundance of mates during an extremely restricted reproductive period. Additional factors such as first male sperm precedence or low female re-mating rate might further explain the propensity of males to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> scramble <b>competition.</b> <b>The</b> sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata exhibits a polygynous mating system, where females exist in low-density populations and male <b>competition</b> manifests as <b>the</b> race to find females rather than as direct physical fighting. Here, we aim to determine whether there is a paternity advantage for the first-male to mate and/or a low frequency of female re-mating. First, we determined sperm precedence patterns in P. albofimbriata using the sterile male technique. Second, we tested the likelihood of female re-mating in P. albofimbriata by comparing the close-range approach behaviour and frequency of successful mating attempts for males when paired with virgin as opposed to recently mated females, and by comparing the frequency of long-distance male attraction between virgin and mated females. We found no paternity advantage for the first male to mate, rather a second male advantage. Although mated females were not rejected by males when approached from close-range, they were chemically unattractive to males searching from a distance. Since initial mate attraction in many praying mantids, including P. albofimbriata, is mediated via long-distance chemical communication, we believe the latter result is more ecologically relevant and therefore more important. These results suggest that the relatively low frequency of female re-mating observed in P. albofimbriata may be an additional factor driving scramble competition in this system. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|With {{the booming}} {{of the world}} economy, {{globalisation}} seems to have become an unavoidable trend, making {{each part of the}} world interrelated and interactive. During the past few decades, a large quantity of firms seeking growth and expansion have chosen merger and acquisition (M&A) as one of their main strategies. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) states <b>in</b> 2000 that <b>the</b> amount of cross-border mergers has been on the rise and cross-border mergers have become the fasted means for those companies pursuing global expansion. Erel et al. (2012) stand for this point that the amount of international takeovers have dramatically increased from 23 percent in 1997 to 45 percent <b>in</b> 2002, and <b>the</b> majority of transactions are cross-border ones in developed country. However, even there being some wealth effects that acquirers can make positive although small abnormal returns upon merger deals (Fuller et al., 2002), several scholars come up with opponent views. Both Aw and Chatterjee (2004) and Moeller and Schlingemann (2005) find that the cross-border takeovers create lower returns than the domestic ones. It is agreed by both that cross-border deals have higher potential gains along with higher potential risks. The potential gains include greater market shares, high-quality resources and increased economies of scale while the potential risks include geography distances, cultural distances and political opposition. Despite this, as a matter of fact, many developing countries have realised the benefits of cross-border deals. China is a good example, which has been proved to surpass South Korea and Japan with respect to cross-border merger investments (UNCTAD, 2005). On one hand, for the purpose of integrating into <b>the</b> world <b>competition,</b> many Chinese firms have begun to create their global strategies, such as to acquire brand, advanced technologies and managerial expertise. A typical example can be the acquisition between Lenovo and IBM <b>in</b> 2005. On <b>the</b> other hand, Chinese government acts as a wise leader to encourage its entrepreneurs to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global <b>competition</b> by investing overseas. The decisions such as <b>the</b> Open-door policy <b>in</b> 1978, <b>the</b> Go-out policy <b>in</b> 1999 and <b>the</b> WTO accession <b>in</b> 2001 all have offer chances for Chinese firms to be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world trend of cross-border merger activities. In return, these firms can contribute to the high-level growth of Chinese economy. Apart from these, more details will be discussed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> section of Literature Review. Although the growth of Chinese acquirers can be achieved through cross-border deals, many of them are struggling to realise their synergies and obtain positive returns. Thus it still remains to be seen that whether most of the Chinese firms can benefit from cross-border mergers. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to conduct empirical studies on the performances of the Chinese acquirers and examine the possible determinants for them to achieve positive results...|$|R
40|$|Revenue {{management}} (RM) is {{one area}} of research and practice that has gained significant attention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past decade. <b>The</b> practice originated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airline industry, where {{the idea was to}} maximize revenues obtained from a fixed amount of resources through differentiation/segmentation and strategic use of pricing and capacity. While many of the research models take into account uncertainty, the uncertainty is modeled using random variables and known probability distributions, which is often difficult to estimate and prone to error for a variety of reasons. For instance, demand patterns can fluctuate substantially from the past,and characterizing demand from censored data is challenging. This dissertation focuses on the multifare single resource (leg) problem in RM. We consider the "limited information" case where the demand information available consists of lower and upper bounds rather than a characterization of a particular probability distribution or stochastic process. We first investigate the value of the amount and type of information used <b>in</b> solving <b>the</b> single-leg RM problem. This is done via extensive computational experiments. Our results indicate that new robust methods using limited information perform comparably to other well-known procedures. These robust policies are very effective and provide consistent results, even though they use no probabilistic information. Further, robust policies are less prone to errors in modeling demand. Results of our preliminary computations justify the use of robust methods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multi-fare single-leg problem. We next apply this distribution-free approach to a setting where progression of demand is available through time-dependent bounds. We do not make any further assumptions about the demand or the arrival process beyond these bounds and also do not impose a risk neutrality assumption. Our analytical approach relies on competitive analysis of online algorithms, which guarantee a certain performance level under all possible realizations within the given lower and upper bounds. We extend the robust model from a problem using static information into a dynamic setting, in which time-dependent information is utilized effectively. We develop heuristic solution procedures for the dynamic problem. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed heuristics are very effective and provide gains over static ones. The models and computations described above assume a single airline, disregarding competition. As an extension of robust decision-making, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third part of this dissertation, we analyze a model with two airlines and two fare classes where <b>the</b> airlines <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>competition.</b> <b>The</b> model does not use any probabilistic information and only the range of demand in each fare-class is known. We develop a game-theoretic model and use competitive analysis of online algorithms to study the model properties. We derive the booking control policies for both centralized and decentralized models and provide additional numerical results...|$|R
