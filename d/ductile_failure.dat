50|$|Failure {{theory is}} {{the science of}} {{predicting}} {{the conditions under which}} solid materials fail under the action of external loads. The failure of a material is usually classified into brittle failure (fracture) or <b>ductile</b> <b>failure</b> (yield). Depending on the conditions (such as temperature, state of stress, loading rate) most materials can fail in a brittle or ductile manner or both. However, for most practical situations, a material may be classified as either brittle or ductile.

50|$|Spiral columns are {{cylindrical}} columns with {{a continuous}} helical bar wrapping around the column. The spiral acts {{to provide support}} in the transverse direction and prevent the column from barreling. The amount of reinforcement is required to provide additional load-carrying capacity {{greater than or equal}} to that attributed from the shell as to compensate for the strength lost when the shell spalls off. With further thickening of the spiral rebar, the axially loaded concrete becomes the weakest link in the system and the strength contribution from the additional rebar does not take effect until the column has failed axially. At that point, the additional strength from spiral comes into play and prevents catastrophic failure, instead giving rise to a much slower <b>ductile</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

It was first researched for use in space-based electronics for the Brilliant Pebbles project.Dymaloy is prepared from diamond powder of about 25 micrometers size. The grains are coated by physical vapor deposition with 10 nanometers thick layer of alloy of tungsten with 26% rhenium, forming a tungsten carbide layer that assists bonding, then coated with 100 nanometers of copper to avoid carbide oxidation, then compacted in a mold and infiltrated with molten copper-silver alloy. Adding 55 vol.% of diamond yields material with thermal expansion matching that of gallium arsenide; slightly higher amount of diamond allows matching to silicon. Copper can be used instead of copper-silver alloy, but the higher melting point may cause partial transformation of diamond to graphite. The material shows some plasticity. High mechanical strain causes brittle failure in the diamond grains, and <b>ductile</b> <b>failure</b> in the matrix. The diamond grains give the alloy a degree of surface texture; when a smooth surface is desired, the alloy can be plated and polished.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical timber {{connections}} {{can fail}} both in a brittle and a ductile manner {{depending on the}} joint layout. Plug shear failure in nailed timber connections is a brittle failure mode, which shall be avoided in timber structures. This failure mode occurs in nailed connections loaded in tension parallel to the grain, for instance in the lower chord of a timber truss. The failure mode is not described in the Swedish building code of today, {{but there is an}} informative annex in the upcoming Eurocode 5 concerning the subject. In the thesis, plug shear failure is studied and a new prediction model developed based on experimental work on nailed steel-to-timber connections. The experiments were short-term experiments and the effect of long-term conditions is not considered. The total amount of joints tested was 86, which together with results from other researchers formed the base for the prediction model. The stress state and the effect of fastener placement were analysed and showed that plug shear failure is initiated at the nail farthest from the free end of timber. Increased spacing between fasteners lessens the risk for plug shear failure to occur, especially the spacing perpendicular to the grain is important. The prediction model is based on structural mechanics and suggests that the plug shear resistance R = blfv, where b is the joint width, l the joint length and fv the shear strength of wood. The shear strength is determined through fv = KAs- 0. 25, where As = bl and K is a constant. Furthermore, an analysis based on fracture mechanics was performed showing the importance of the softening behaviour of the joint failure. The overall goal with the development of a prediction model is to avoid brittle <b>failures</b> and promote <b>ductile</b> <b>failures.</b> As a tool to promote <b>ductile</b> <b>failures,</b> a measure was developed to aid the designer in designing ductile and strong joints.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Time-to-failure of polymers, and {{the actual}} failure mode, are {{influenced}} by stress, temperature, processing history, and molecular weight. We show that long-term <b>ductile</b> <b>failure</b> under constant load is governed by the same process as short term <b>ductile</b> <b>failure</b> at constant rate of deformation. Failure proves to originate from the polymer’s intrinsic deformation behavior, more particularly the true strain softening after yield, which inherently leads to the initiation of localized deformation zones. In a previous study, we developed a constitutive model that includes physical aging and is capable of numerically predicting plastic instabilities. Using this model the <b>ductile</b> <b>failure</b> of polycarbonates with different thermal histories, subjected to constant loads, is accurately predicted also for different loading geometries. Even the endurance limit, observed for quenched materials, is predicted and it is shown that it originates from the structural evolution due to physical aging that occurs during loading. For low molecular weight materials this same process causes a ductile-to-brittle transition. A quantitative prediction thereof is, however, {{outside the scope of}} this paper and requires a more detailed study. 1...|$|E

Common failures observed on ball-grid-array (BGA) solder balls on chip under board level impact include bulk solder <b>ductile</b> <b>failure,</b> intermetallic (IMC) layer crack and pad-lift. In this work, a finite element modeling approach was proposed to model bulk solder <b>ductile</b> <b>failure</b> and intermetallic layer crack. The use of beam elements and connector elements to represent the bulk solders and board/component side intermetallic layers, respectively, offers the advantage of simplicity {{over the use of}} continuum elements and cohesive elements for solder joints.

The model was verified by comparing its prediction of BGA solder reliability against actual test results in a dynamic four-point bend test.
