5|$|The {{contemporary}} rhetorician Libanius delivered Julian's funeral oration in 363, whose text survives. This {{contains some}} {{details about the}} battle which are missing in Ammianus, which he presumably learnt from members of Julian's entourage. But because his oration {{was intended as a}} eulogy, not a historical narrative, his account of Julian's campaign is unreliable, and Ammianus' version is to be preferred where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{properties}} imply Archimedean property (which is not {{implied by}} other definitions of completeness). That is, {{the set of}} integers is not upper-bounded in the reals. In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a least upper bound N; then, N – 1 {{would not be an}} upper bound, and there would be an integer n such that , and thus , which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> with the upper-bound property of N.|$|E
25|$|The set C {{constructed}} {{this way}} is a vertex cover: suppose that an edge e is not covered by C; then M∪{e} is a matching and e∉M, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> {{with the assumption that}} M is maximal. Furthermore, if e={u,v} ∈ M, then any vertex cover – including an optimal vertex cover – must contain u or v (or both); otherwise the edge e is not covered. That is, an optimal cover contains at least one endpoint of each edge in M; in total, the set C is at most 2 times as large as the optimal vertex cover.|$|E

25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E
25|$|Note that Lemma A is {{sufficient}} to prove that e is irrational, since otherwise we may write e = p / q, where both p and q are nonzero integers, but by Lemma A we would have qe - p ≠ 0, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction.</b> Lemma A also suffices to prove that π is irrational, since otherwise we may write π = k / n, where both k and n are integers) and then ±iπ are the roots of n2x2 + k2 = 0; thus 2 - 1 - 1 = 2e0 + e'iπ + e−iπ ≠ 0; but this is false.|$|E
25|$|So, Kant argues, we are {{committed}} to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we {{are committed}} to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} year the French {{mathematician}} Jules Richard used a variant of Cantor's diagonal method to obtain another contradiction in naive set theory. Consider the set A of all finite agglomerations of words. The set E of all finite definitions of real numbers is a subset of A. As A is countable, so is E. Let p be the nth decimal of the nth real number defined by the set E; we form a number N having zero for the integral part and p + 1 for the nth decimal if p is not equal either to 8 or 9, and unity if p is equal to 8 or 9. This number N is not defined by the set E because it differs from any finitely defined real number, namely from the nth number by the nth digit. But N has been defined by {{a finite number of}} words in this paragraph. It should therefore be in the set E. That <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, an {{algebraic}} {{function of}} several variables may yield an algebraic number {{when applied to}} transcendental numbers if these numbers are not algebraically independent. For example, π and (1 − π) are both transcendental, but π + (1 − π) = 1 is obviously not. It is unknown whether π + e, for example, is transcendental, though {{at least one of}} π + e and πe must be transcendental. More generally, for any two transcendental numbers a and b, at least one of a + b and ab must be transcendental. To see this, consider the polynomial (x − a)(x − b) = x2 − (a + b)x + ab. If (a + b) and ab were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field, this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, a and b, must be algebraic. But this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction,</b> and thus it must be the case {{that at least one of}} the coefficients is transcendental.|$|E

500|$|In {{the later}} balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet's soliloquy, but in Brooke's {{version of the}} story, her {{declaration}} is done alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually, a woman was required to be modest and shy {{to make sure that}} her suitor was sincere, but breaking this rule serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip courting and move on to plain talk about their relationship— agreeing to be married after knowing each other for only one night. In the final suicide scene, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>contradiction</b> in the message—in the Catholic religion, suicides were often thought to be condemned to hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the [...] "Religion of Love" [...] are joined with their loves in paradise. Romeo and Juliet's love seems to be expressing the [...] "Religion of Love" [...] view rather than the Catholic view.
