40|$|The Contrast Sensitivity Function {{relates the}} spatial {{frequency}} and contrast of a spatial pattern to its visibility and thus provides a fundamental description of visual function. However, the current clinical {{standard of care}} typically restricts assessment to visual acuity, i. e. the smallest stimulus size that can be resolved at full contrast; alternatively, tests of contrast sensitivity are typically restricted to assessment of the lowest visible contrast for a <b>fixed</b> <b>letter</b> size. This restriction to one-dimensional subspaces of a two-dimensional space was necessary when stimuli were printed on paper charts and simple scoring rules were applied manually. More recently, however, computerized testing and electronic screens have enabled more flexible stimulus displays and more complex test algorithms. For example, the quick CSF method uses a Bayesian adaptive procedure and an information maximization criterion to select only informative stimuli; testing times to precisely estimate the whole contrast sensitivity function are reduced to 2 - 5 minutes. Here, we describe {{the implementation of the}} quick CSF method in a medical device. We make several usability enhancements to make it suitable for use in clinical settings.

40|$|Circumscription {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an important principle for knowledge representation and common-sense reasoning. The need for a circumscriptive formalism that allows for simple yet elegant modular problem representation has led Lifschitz (AIJ, 1995) to introduce nested abnormality theories (NATs) {{as a tool for}} modular knowledge representation, tailored for applying circumscription to minimize exceptional circumstances. Abstracting from this particular objective, we propose L CIRC, which is an extension of generic propositional circumscription by allowing propositional combinations and nesting of circumscriptive theories. As shown, NATs are naturally embedded into this language, and are in fact of equal expressive capability. We then analyze the complexity of L CIRC and NATs, and in particular the effect of nesting. The latter is found {{to be a source of}} complexity, which climbs the Polynomial Hierarchy as the nesting depth increases and reaches PSPACE-completeness in the general case.

50|$|In total, twenty-four Tipsy B and Bc {{aircraft}} {{were built}} at Avions Fairey {{before the invasion}} of Belgium by Germany in World War II. About eight had open cockpits (Tipsy B) and the rest were enclosed (Tipsy Bc). The Tipsy {{seems to have been}} mostly nice to fly but, as with other aircraft with pointed wing tips, its low speed behaviour could be unforgiving, dropping a wing at the stall without much warning. During the British production run, some of these issues were addressed.The fourth British aircraft was the first to be modified. To improve the stalling behaviour, it had a strengthened wing with washout at the tips, so that this part of the wing should not stall first, and camber-changing flaps were added to the straight centre section to delay the stall. To meet British airworthiness concerns about control surface flutter, all were mass-balanced. The rudder balance was external, projecting from its leading edge just above the tip of the fin. The elevator was also revised to a single unit with a straight hinge and trailing edge, and the bottom of the rudder slightly cropped to allow it to move. Subsequent British Tipsys included these changes, and from the sixth aircraft onwards also featured <b>fixed</b> <b>letter</b> box slots. In August 1938, during the Certificate of Airworthiness tests at Martlesham Heath, there were concerns about rudder authority, so Tipsy Light Aircraft added 18% to the rudder area, leading to successful certification. At that point, the name of the aircraft changed from Tipsy B to Tipsy Trainer. The ninth aircraft was approved at an increased all up-weight of 1,200 lb (544 kg), and from then on the name was revised to Tipsy Trainer 1.|$|R
