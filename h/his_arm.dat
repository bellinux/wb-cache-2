5|$|In 2001, Cotto {{suffered}} a dangerous injury that threatened his boxing career. As {{he was driving}} to the gymnasium at 5 a.m., he apparently fell asleep and crashed, breaking <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> and requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the UK, Large was offered a discharge on medical grounds, which he declined. He went on to serve briefly in the quartermaster's stores, as an instructor, and in the regimental police. Throughout this time he worked on regaining his fitness and rehabilitating <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Deangelo {{makes it}} back to the office, still in his {{hospital}} gown, with an IV tube trailing from <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> His attempts to tell a bar joke come out as random gibberish. Gabe and Jim lead him out of the office after Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) calls for an ambulance.|$|E
5000|$|Felix {{is usually}} {{represented}} in art as holding in <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> the Infant Jesus, {{because of a}} vision {{he is said to}} have had, when the Blessed Virgin appeared to him and placed the Divine Child in <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> [...] Pope John Paul II observed that Felix is [...] "shown bearing the Infant Jesus in <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> because in bearing the burdens of the needy he had carried in <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> the poor Christ himself." ...|$|R
50|$|He later loses <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> When Taffler loses <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> he {{no longer}} wants to live because <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> were {{so much a part}} of him and his {{identity}} that without them he doesn't have the will to live. He attempts suicide, by rubbing his stubs against the wall, but is thwarted by Lady Juliet d'Orsey. Taffler's reputation and self-image are linked closely with <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> First as he's introduced using them to hit bottles with stones, and even later when he helps Robert toss Harris's ashes into the river.|$|R
50|$|Pearson has tattoos over <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> neck, chest, abdoman and shins. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> {{are covered}} by tribal tattoos. On his abdoman, are two Chinese {{characters}} and a mythical animal.|$|R

He subsequently received a three match ban and £5,000 fine from the Football Association.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|In J. M. Barrie's novel Peter and Wendy (1911), the {{character}} Captain Hook has lost <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> to the crocodile. Hook fears the crocodile, but is warned of its approach by the ticking of a clock {{which it has}} swallowed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris Sabin. Joe {{performed}} his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then placed Sabin in his signature submission hold the Coquina Clutch. Instead of submitting, Sabin instead passed out in storyline, with the referee lifting and raising <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{three times before}} giving the victory to Joe at 14 minutes and 2 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Mullum Malarum {{is based}} on a novel of the same name by Umachandran which was {{published}} in the Tamil magazine, Kalki. The story, about the love between a brother and sister, won the first prize in Kalkis Novel Short Story Competition celebrating the magazine's 1966 silver jubilee. Screenplay and dialogue writer J. Mahendran read only a part of Umachandran's novel, but was particularly impressed by the winch operator Kali and his affection for his sister, as well as the loss of <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> He outlined Mullum Malarum to producer Venu Chettiar, who was impressed. Adapting Umachandran's novel for the screen, Mahendran made his directing debut and wrote the film's dialogue. His screenplay diverged from the novel's plot, and he decided to make a minimalist, visually-rich film without melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue or duets. A significant difference is that in the novel, Kali loses <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> to a tiger while in the film, he loses it due to it being run over by a lorry.|$|E
5|$|That night, Mulder {{talks to}} Dana Scully, {{telling her that}} he's {{thinking}} of leaving the FBI.

6000|$|Mr. Pike paced up {{and down}} the narrow house and gritted his teeth. Then he paused. He leaned <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on the bridge-rail, rested his head on <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> for a full minute, then groaned: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{as if to}} embrace me. I drew near with {{incredible}} shrinkings, and surrendered myself to <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> with overwhelming disgust. But he only drew my ear down to his lips.|$|R
5|$|Triple H {{returned}} on the April 30 {{episode of}} Raw, {{when he refused}} {{to give in to}} Brock Lesnar's unreasonable contract demands, resulting in Lesnar attacking him and storyline breaking <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Upon his return two weeks later, Triple H was confronted by Lesnar's legal representative, Paul Heyman, who announced Lesnar was filing a lawsuit against WWE for breach of contract. After he accosted Heyman, Heyman threatened another lawsuit against Triple H for assault and battery. At the No Way Out in June, Triple H challenged Lesnar, who was not present, to a match at SummerSlam, which Heyman refused on Lesnar's behalf the following night on Raw. At Raw 1000, Stephanie McMahon goaded Heyman into Triple H's challenge against Lesnar. To anger Triple H, Lesnar broke Michaels's arm on the August 13 episode of Raw. Six days later at SummerSlam, Triple H lost to Lesnar after submitting to the Kimura Lock, breaking <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> again in storyline.|$|E
5|$|Wake Forest {{began the}} 2006 season on September 2 {{with a home}} game against Big East conference {{opponent}} Syracuse.

Backup quarterback Riley Skinner replaced Mauk in the game, and would serve as Wake's starting quarterback {{for the remainder of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{come home}} from trick-or-treating, Marge {{switches}} out the candy with dental hygiene products and asks Homer to deliver the candy to a drive for the troops overseas. Homer instead runs off with the bag to eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls {{to the bottom of}} the canyon with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> pinned. Fueled by his need to get the out-of-reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that he was carrying a bag of vegetables, as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had secretly stolen back their candy, inciting an upset Homer to scream in rage.|$|E

60|$|Young Thomas {{expressed}} these sentiments sitting astride {{of a chair}} {{before the}} fire, with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on the back, and his sulky face on <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>His</b> sister sat in the darker corner by the fireside, now looking at him, now looking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon the hearth.|$|R
5|$|A mentally {{unbalanced}} Ricky Williams (David Baxt) {{is driven}} to re-enter the caves when {{a sample of}} crystals pulsates and the chemical intelligence exerts its influence through a mark on <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes her helmet and freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost (Stephanie Beacham) shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he opens both the inner and outer airlock doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable.|$|E

5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers.

25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> the Danes surged forward and when <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|R
60|$|The latter exclamation {{was caused}} by Rosco falling backwards; to prevent which {{catastrophe}} he made a wild flourish with <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> and a sweep with his staff, which just grazed the negro's cheek. Zeppa, however, caught him in <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> and set him up again.|$|R
5|$|All {{his adult}} life, Pflueger {{maintained}} his residence at his childhood home on Guerrero Street. When entertaining downtown {{late into the}} evening, {{he was known to}} spend an occasional night at the Olympic Club. Pflueger drove a green Cadillac convertible and was often seen with his steady lady friend on <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Pflueger never married and left no children.

Pflueger, Architect.|$|E
5|$|Another feud {{created for}} Over the Edge {{involved}} Triple H and The Rock, who would {{meet each other}} in a standard singles match at the event. Triple H had interfered in one of The Rock's matches, and later threw him off the stage. The script called for The Rock to portray an injury to <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> that required him to wear a plaster cast. Shane, acting his role as co-owner of WWF and ally of Triple H, further aggrieved The Rock by forbidding him to wear the cast for Over the Edge.|$|E
