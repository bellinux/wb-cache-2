5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E

500|$|Age of Empires III {{was well}} {{received}} by critics and reviewers. The game received an average score of 82% according to GameRankings. Age of Empires III {{was listed as}} the eighth best-selling PC game of 2005, and over two million copies of it had been [...] sold by May 2007. GameSpot pointed out that [...] "Age of Empires III <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> big shoes to fill," [...] and GameSpy remarked that it [...] "may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high {{that we will be}} comparing games to this for years." [...] IGN also commented on the game, saying [...] "Age of Empires III is a superbly balanced and polished game," [...] and that [...] "Discounting a few niggles in the interface, the whole presentation is rock solid." [...] Game Revolution said that it is [...] "as detailed as a history book, and about as much fun," [...] while GameZone stated it is [...] "one purchase you will not come to regret." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t want to do it, but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Lana Wachowski, a trans woman, {{has written}} her first {{transgender}} character {{in her career}} in the series: Nomi Marks. For that she partly used her own experiences. [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> intense, autobiographical scenes, {{and that was very}} difficult and surreal," [...] said Lana. Jamie Clayton, who plays Nomi, has provided the example of a scene where a young Nomi is bullied by boys in a gym shower, as a scene that was based on experiences from Lana's life. Freema Agyeman, who plays Nomi's girlfriend Amanita, has shared that her character was based heavily on Lana's wife, Karin Winslow. Straczynski has stated that like Lana felt the close to Nomi when writing, he felt the closest to Wolfgang Bogdanow, because both him and Wolfgang had a bad relationship with their respective fathers. [...] "Wolfgang was my true north in the storytelling," [...] said Straczynski. Straczynski did not reveal who was the character Lilly Wachowski felt the closest to during the writing process, saying it's up to her to do that. Since then, Lilly has come out as transgender too. The beginning of her transitioning process preceded the release of the first season, and Clayton had known about it early on.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} a mixed reception from television critics. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News commented that [...] "like all hourlong episodes of comedies, this one becomes a little bloated in the middle. But it holds {{up for the}} most part and <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> funny and poignant moments, including an emotional rooftop scene between Will and Grace that defines their friendship." [...] Whitney Matheson of USA Today said she [...] "was bored to tears" [...] by the episode, while Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk thought it was a [...] "fun episode". Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated was not complimentary towards Connick: [...] "Whoever {{came up with the idea}} to cast Connick on Will & Grace should be fired." [...] A writer from Entertainment Weekly, however, commented that Leo [...] "fits right in to the antic Will & Grace world of Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide was not thrilled of the idea of Grace getting married, writing: [...] "Well, is the show called Will & Grace & Leo? I don't think so." [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall commented that Will & Grace [...] "has already been infected with a sense of cattiness and despair, as the writers try to top each other's nasty one-liners. A happy, healthy relationship could be just the cure for what's ailing the one-time Emmy winner." ...|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{wings of}} SpaceShipOne can be {{pneumatically}} tilted forwards into an aerodynamically stable high-drag [...] "feathered" [...] shape. This removes {{most of the}} need to actively control attitude during the early part of reentry: Scaled Composites refer to this as [...] "care-free reentry". One of the early test flights actually performed re-entry inverted, demonstrating the flexibility and inherent stability of Burt Rutan's [...] "shuttlecock" [...] design. This feathered reentry mode is claimed to be inherently safer than the behavior at similar speeds of the Space Shuttle. The Shuttle undergoes enormous aerodynamic stresses and must be precisely steered in order to remain in a stable glide. (Although this is an interesting comparison of behavior, it is not an entirely fair comparison of design concepts: the Shuttle starts reentry at much higher speed than SpaceShipOne, and so <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> different requirements. SpaceShipOne is more similar to the X-15 vehicle.) ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, British {{unions are}} more likely to focus on the ideological basis for the {{organizing}} model, rather than the practical applications of it. Jack Fiorito states that the U.K.'s adaptation of the organizing model <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> specific characteristics {{that may or may not}} be seen in other countries. Fiorito lists [...] "...less reliance on paid staff and much lower dues levels in U.K. unions..." [...] as important features of the organizing model in the U.K. Fiorito did extensive research about the condition of British unions in the 2000s, which demonstrated that the organizing model was influential in British unions in the 2000s. When Fiorito interviewed U.K. union members during this timeframe, [...] "Almost half of respondents (45%) volunteer that their union is adopting the OM," [...] which is Fiorito's abbreviation for the organizing model. The organizing model was present in many British unions in the 2000s, and the workers were aware of its presence. The British union members largely felt that the organizing model was a good model to have implemented in their unions, and they were satisfied with its results. Fiorito states that [...] "Although the OM varies somewhat in meaning, a strong majority of unionists feel that their union is truly committed to recruiting and organizing new members...".|$|E
2500|$|Cuttack is {{the home}} to the Barabati Sports Complex. The Barabati Stadium is an {{important}} venue for international cricket and football matches. The Barabati Sports Complex hosts the head offices {{of most of the}} sports bodies of the state. Apart from cricket and football, the sports complex also has facilities for Lawn Tennis, Basketball, Volleyball, Swimming. The sports complex also houses a state-of-the-art indoor hall christened as Sachin Tendulkar Indoor Hall, dedicated to legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar.

2500|$|The {{consensus}} on Ashton's Ondine {{is that it}} <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good things in it – and this is true; as is the implication that it is otherwise unsuccessful, not least because the music (which greatly disappointed Ashton himself) largely fails, except in the storm of Act II and the divertissements of Act III. According to many critics, the music did not suit Ashton [...] "who had been hoping for music as [...] "radiant" [...] as the Mediterranean from which its heroine was born". Yet the music does seem to fit its watery theme well: there are some beautiful passages to Ondine’s Act 3 [...] "swimming" [...] solo where the music seems thin and transparent as watercolour, and entirely suited to this sketch of the sea. The ballet is also a mixture of both the 19th and the 20th century, for the plot is quintessentially romantic while the music and choreography are more modern. Although it bore all the marks of Ashton's familiarly gentle, classically oriented manner, it discarded the classical ballet conventions that appear in such Ashton successes as Cinderella and Sylvia. What {{he was trying to}} suggest, says Ashton, was [...] "the ebb and flow of the sea: I aimed at an unbroken continuity of dance, which would remove the distinction between aria and recitative." [...] As a result, Ondine offered few pyrotechnics, gained its effects instead through sinuous mass movements in which the undulation of arm and body suggested forests of sea plants stirring to unseen tides. The sense of submarine fantasy was reinforced by Stage Designer Lila de Nobili's fine scenery: a castle of mist and fruitfulness, shadowy crags and waterfalls, aqueous skies streaked pink and green.|$|E
