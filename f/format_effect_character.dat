40|$|Adults’ simple {{arithmetic}} {{performance is}} more efficient when operands are presented in Arabic digit (3 + 5) than in number word (three + five) formats. An explanation provided is that visual familiarity with digits is higher respect to number words. However, most studies have been limited to single-digit addition and multiplication problems. In this article, we examine to what extent <b>format</b> <b>effects</b> {{can be found in}} the context of arithmetic word problems, in which visual familiarity is reduced (Manuel had 3 marbles, and then Pedro gave to him 5). Participants with high and low arithmetic fluency solved addition and subtraction word problems in which operands were presented in both formats.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{contribute}} to the existing body of evidence on vertically scaling mixed format tests by examining the impact of item <b>format</b> <b>effect</b> in conjunction with specific configurations of common item sets on two of the most popular calibration methods under test specification and scaling scenarios likely to exist in practice. In addition to advice for practical application provided by the investigation, this study also explored the impact of explicitly modeling the vertical scale factor when simulating data compared to a traditional model for in which the underlying vertical scale is implied. Using a CINEG data collection design, six grade level tests, consisting of 61 items, were created with a 9 : 1 ratio of multiple-choice to constructed-response items and two different sets of 14 mixed format items designated as common items. Ability distributions for 2000 students per grade level were generated with the mean ability for successive grade levels increasing at varying increments to simulate grade level separation along with four covariance structures that reflected varying degrees of correlation to simulate item <b>format</b> <b>effects.</b> Under a 3 PL-GRM model combination, expected scores were calculated with recovery of expected score used as evaluation criteria. Ability and item parameters were estimated using the MLE proficiency estimator in MULTILOG and transformation constants were calculated in STUIRT using the Stocking-Lord linking method. The performance of separate and pairwise concurrent calibration was then examined by calculating average BIAS and average RMSE values across 100 replications. While the results of the study provided evidence that item <b>format</b> <b>effects,</b> vertical scaling method, and separation between grade levels significantly impacted the vertical scales, influence of these variables was often in combination with one another. The major findings were (1) pairwise concurrent calibration holistically performed better compared to separate calibration; (2) moderate to large item <b>format</b> <b>effects</b> were more likely to bias resultant vertical scales; (3) a large separation between grade levels resulted in a more biased vertical scale; and (4) explicitly modeling the vertical scaling factor during data generation influenced mean RMSE values more significantly than mean BIAS values. ...|$|R

40|$|Pleiotropy {{allows for}} the {{deterministic}} fixation of bidirectional mutations: mutations with effects both {{in the direction of}} selection and opposite to selection for the same character. Mutations with deleterious <b>effects</b> on some <b>characters</b> can fix because of beneficial <b>effects</b> on other <b>characters.</b> This study analytically quantifies the expected frequency of mutations that fix with negative and positive <b>effects</b> on a <b>character</b> and the average size of a fixed <b>effect</b> on a <b>character</b> when a mutation pleiotropically affects from very few to many characters. The analysis allows for mutational distributions that vary in shape and provides a framework that would allow for varying the frequency at which mutations arise with deleterious and positive <b>effects</b> on <b>characters.</b> The results show that a large fraction of fixed mutations will have deleterious pleiotropic effects even when mutation affects as little as two characters and only directional selection is occurring, and, not surprisingly, as the degree of pleiotropy increases the frequency of fixed deleterious effects increases. As a point of comparison, we show how stabilizing selection and random genetic drift affect the bidirectional distribution of fixed mutational effects. The results are then applied to QTL studies that seek to find loci that contribute to phenotypic differences between populations or species. It is shown that QTL studies are biased against detecting chromosome regions that have deleterious pleiotropic <b>effects</b> on <b>characters...</b>|$|R
