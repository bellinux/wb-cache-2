It’s often done to change its <b>dyeability</b> or flame retardance. Nylon 6 is synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of caprolactam. Caprolactam has 6 carbons, hence 'Nylon 6'. When caprolactam is heated at about 533 K in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen for about 4-5 hours, the ring breaks and undergoes polymerization. Then the molten mass is passed through spinnerets to form fibres of nylon 6.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Low-pressure glow {{discharges}} are {{efficient in}} generating uniform plasmas. They {{have been applied}} in the surface modification {{of a variety of}} materials. But most of these applications are limited to small-scales because of their reliance on vacuum equipments needed to sustain processes at low pressure. This work aims at commending a continuous surface treatment device, which meets the requirement of textile material surface modification by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) at atmospheric pressure for industry production. In the experiment, quasi-glow-discharge, a glow-discharge like plasma, is produced under atmospheric pressure with the continuous simple device. Through the discharge of mixture of argon and oxygen, Ar-O 2 (10 : 1), polyester fabric is continuously modified. The results reveal that the <b>dyeability</b> of the polyester fabric is dramatically improved. The spectral value (K/S) of the dyed polyester fabric is increased by about 50 %, and the relative dye up-take is also increased by about 18 % after the treatment. The dyeing fastness of the modified material remains the highest degree. That is to say, the improvement of the <b>dyeability</b> does not degrade the dyeing fastness of the material at all. The study of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the smooth and glossy surface of polyester fiber becomes rough after the treatment.
