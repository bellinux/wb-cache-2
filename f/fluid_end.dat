The <b>fluid</b> <b>end</b> has been identified as requiring more maintenance work due to component failure, compared to the power end.

Barrier design {{is a combination of}} a sealless mag-drive design and gas seal technology. Gas seal separates the <b>fluid</b> <b>end</b> from the power end, thus allowing infinite dry running operation and solids-handling capability to 40 percent particulates. Since the back end is separated, fluid-lubricated journal bearings are not required, and antifriction ball bearings, are used instead providing stiff rotor construction, with (L^ 3) /(D^ 4) ratio as low as 9. 3, which significantly minimizes deflections of the shaft. At the same time, a containment shell ensures leak-free operation and no spills, even in the unlikely event of barrier seal failure. Installation of the gas barrier design improved the mean time between failure for a tough application at a major chemical plant from six days to two years, and the pump continues to operate successfully.

40|$|Halokinesis {{causes a}} dynamic {{structural}} evolution {{with the development}} of faults and fractures, which can act as either preferential fluid pathways or barriers. Reconstructing reactive fluid flow in salt dome settings remains a challenge. This contribution presents {{for the first time a}} spatial distribution map of diagenetic phases in a salt dome in northern Oman. Our study establishes a clear link between structural evolution and fluid flow leading to the formation of diagenetic products (barite and calcite) in the salt dome roof strata. Extensive formation of diagenetic products occurs along NNE-SSW to NE-SW faults and fractures, which initiated during the Santonian (Late Cretaceous) and were reactivated in the Miocene, but not along the E-W fault, which was generated during Early Paleocene time. We propose that the diagenetic products formed by mixing of a warm (100 °C) saline (17 wt% NaCl eq.) 87 Sr enriched (87 Sr/ 86 Sr: 0. 71023) fluid with colder (35 °C) meteoric fluid during Miocene to Pleistocene. The stable sulphur and strontium isotope composition and fluid inclusion data indicate that a saline fluid, with sulfate source derived from the Ara Group evaporite and Haima Supergroup layers, is the source for barite formation at about 100 °C, predominantly at fault conjunctions and minor faults away from the main graben structure in the dome. In the Miocene, the saline fluid probably ascended along a halokinesis-related fault due to fluid overpressure (due to the rising salt and impermeable layers in the overlying stratigraphic sequence), and triggered the formation of barite due mixing with barium-rich fluids, accompanied by a drop in temperature. Subsequently, evolving salt doming with associated fault activity and erosion of the Jebel allows progressively more input of colder meteoric fluids, which mix with the saline warmer fluid, as derived from stable isotope data measured in the progressively younger barite-associated calcite, fault zone calcite and macro-columnar calcite. The reconstructed mixing model indicates a 50 / 50 to 90 / 10 meteoric/saline fluid mixing ratio for the formation of fault zone calcite, and a 10 times higher concentration of carbon in the saline <b>fluid</b> <b>end</b> member compared to the meteoric <b>fluid</b> <b>end</b> member. The presented mixing model of salt-derived fluids with meteoric fluids is suggested to be a general model applicable to structural diagenetic evolution of salt domes world wide...|$|E
40|$|Third party spend {{accounts}} for {{a significant amount of}} a business' costs. When procuring unique, highly-engineered components, this cost is often negotiated with suppliers during the procurement process. Due to the limited understanding of the suppliers' true production cost, various techniques and models for determining how much a procured product should cost have been tried. One such approach is known as "should-cost modeling," where estimates for the cost of a product or service are made based on product architecture and/or firm financials. Both these approaches to should-cost modeling require extensive data collection and are time consuming. In this thesis, we expand an approach that uses aggregate industry-specific financial data to develop a simple, scalable tool to estimate a product's should-cost. One major challenge in building this tool is unifying the simple aggregate data available into an estimated price for a complex product. This is a major challenge of developing a should-cost estimate using existing methods. We develop an approach to simplifying a complex product, construct our model, and create a ready-to-use tool. We demonstrate the working of the model and the tool using the case of a semi-complex product (the <b>fluid</b> <b>end</b> of a pump) representative of a company's procured products. We then compare the price estimated by our model with that currently negotiated with our sponsor company's supplier and solicit qualitative feedback from procurement professionals regarding the should-cost tool's accuracy. The price estimated by our tool is within 9 % of the actual negotiated price and required significantly less time to compute compared to the current approach based on product architecture. The company's sourcing and procurement executive strongly endorses the benefits of our approach. This tool can remove the reliance on supplier-supplied quotes and strengthen the purchasing company's negotiating position. The tool developed in this thesis is shown to provide a more accurate estimate of product cost, with significantly less estimation effort. by Clayton M. Mealer and Sung Hwan Park. Thesis (M.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of seafloor hydrothermal systems in the late 1970 ´s, they {{have been found in}} different types of geological settings. Recent discoveries of active, inactive and inferred vent fields on the Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge reveals that hydrothermal activity might be more common than previously assumed. The Artic Mid Ocean ridge is a slow to ultra-slow spreading ridge, which can sustain long-lived hydrothermal activity with the potential to form large polymetallic mineral deposits. There is a growing interest in exploitation of seafloor hydrothermal deposits, as global demand for metal resources is growing. Exploration for these seafloor massive sulphide deposits is therefore an opportunity for academic research, and discovering metal resources of economic value. This thesis focuses on Perle and Bruse vent fields located on the southern segment of Mohn´s ridge and Aegir Vent Field located on central Mohns ridge. Perle and Bruse are part of the Jan Mayen Vent Fields, which also includes Troll wall and Soria Moria. Jan Mayen Vent Fields were discovered in 2005 during the BIODEEP- 05 cruise. Perle and Bruse were later discovered in 2013 during the CGB cruise, and explored and sampled during the 2014 CGB cruise. Aegir Vent Field was discovered during the 2013 CGB cruise, and explored and sampled during the 2015 NORMAR/CGB cruise, and 2016 CGB cruise. Polished thin sections from the sampled material, was studied in transmitted and reflective light followed by Scanning Elecron Microscope using EDS to understand the petrography and mineralogy. Samples were powdered for isotopic analyses of Strontium, sulphur, radiometric dating of barite and whole rock geochemistry. Active chimney material from Perle is dominated by anhydrite, while barite is found in sampled mound rubble. Active chimneys from Bruse are dominated by barite, and have relict crystals of anhydrite that are partly dissolved. Both Vent fields are dominated by the sulphides pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and minor amounts of galena. Bruse has higher amounts of silica and the sulphide covellite, which is reworked from chalcopyrite. Radiometric dating shows that samples from Perle (7, 4 ± 0, 4) is younger than Bruse (1400 ± 50). Aegir shows a range of mineralogical assemblages that seems to be caused by age differences. The material is dominated by anhydrite, which seems to dissolves as the chimneys grow older, getting more enriched in barite, silica and sulphides. The sulphide phases are dominated pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and galena. Sr isotopes shows a degree of mixing between the hydrothermal fluid and seawater endmembers, Perle and Bruse shows an isotopic ratio closer to the hydrothermal <b>fluid</b> <b>end</b> member than Aegir which is closer to seawater values. Perle and Bruse have sulphur isotopes with values close to seawater...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxii, 255 pages. Hydraulic power systems offer a robust, compact, and flexible method of power transmission {{and are used}} widely in both industrial and mobile applications. While 2 % of the energy consumed in the US passes through hydraulic systems, {{less than half of}} it does any useful work largely due to the use of inefficient flow control valves. Variable displacement pumps offer a method of delivering the required flow to an actuator without suffering the losses associated with a flow control valve. However, current variable displacement pumps exhibit poor efficiency at low displacement because their primary sources of energy loss are largely independent of displacement. Here, a novel adjustable linkage is proposed as the driving mechanism of a variable displacement pump. The linkage is constructed such that the pumping piston returns to the same top-dead-center position at all displacement, and can also achieve zero displacement. As a result of these features, the pump displacement is infinitely variable, and the unswept volume is remains constant at all displacements. By using pinned joints rather than sliding joints, the majority of the energy losses scale with output power resulting in a pump that is efficient over a wide range of operating conditions. In this thesis, a complete model of a variable displacement linkage pump is developed. A method of constructing the adjustable sixbar mechanism and the possible embodiments is presented. A new solution rectification technique is developed providing a robust method of generating valid linkages that is generally applicable to other mechanisms. The kinematics of the mechanism are then presented to describe the motion of the links and output piston. A kinetostatic model of the mechanism provides a means of determining the internal mechanical energy losses. A non-linear model of the bearing friction augments the model, but requires numerical methods to solve, and increases computational complexity. A dynamic model of the pumping cylinders and pump manifold provide a means of determining the fluid behavior of the pump including output flowrates and pressures. These models are coupled to create a complete understanding of the variable displacement linkage pump. The model is designed to be predictive and computationally inexpensive for use in multi-objective optimizations. As such, no experimentally determined performance coefficients are required. No model of this level of completeness exist for linkage driven pumps, variable displacement or otherwise. Two prototype pumps are presented and used to validate the models. A single cylinder pump is used to validate the mechanical energy loss model but was limited to low pressure operation due to large torque variations. Close agreement is demonstrated between the model and experiment. The model predicts a pump efficiency greater than 90 % at displacements as low as 15 % if roller bearings are used in the pin joints. To validate this prediction, a multi-cylinder prototype which uses roller bearings in the joints is designed. The kinematic and mechanical energy loss models are coupled to a basic pumping model for use in a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the mechanism. The resulting pump demonstrates close agreement between the model and experimentally measured shaft torque and mechanical energy loss at various pressures, displacements, and input shaft speeds. However, out-of-plane deflection of the mechanism reduced the piston displacement and altered the trajectory reducing pump output. The true temporal piston position is measured and used as an input to the dynamic fluid model. The predicted and experimentally measured cylinder pressures demonstrate the effectiveness of the model at predicting the dynamic behavior of the <b>fluid</b> <b>end</b> of the pump. It is shown that the models can accurately capture the physics of the pump without using tuning parameters or experimentally determined coefficients over a wide range of operating conditions. It is recommended that single shear linkage arrangements are avoided in future designs to increase the mechanism stiffness and improve performance. The variable displacement linkage pump offers the opportunity for high efficiency flow control at a wide range of operating conditions {{due to the nature of}} the energy loss mechanisms scaling with the output power. The flexibility of the driving sixbar mechanism allows for the optimization of the architecture for particular applications and the presented model provides a means of predicting performance...|$|E

Here, we focus on the characterization of the dependence of three-phase oil relative permeability on an identifiable set of Principal Components. We analyze the relationship between observed core scale three-phase oil relative permeability and input variables which are typically employed in the application of existing effective (pseudo-empirical) models.
