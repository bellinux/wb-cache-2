500|$|In February 1940 Welles {{supplied}} Mankiewicz with 300 {{pages of}} notes {{and put him}} under contract to write the first draft screenplay {{under the supervision of}} John Houseman, Welles's former partner in the Mercury Theatre. Welles later explained, [...] "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood and wrote mine." [...] Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, [...] "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own." ...|$|E

In the first read through, he said [...] "I want {{everybody}} here {{to know that you}} represent our first choice— each actor here represents our first choice for these characters. So do not fuck this up." [...] Spacey, whose last regular television role was in the series Wiseguy, responded positively to the script. He then played Richard III, which Fincher said was [...] "great training". Spacey supported the decision to release all of the episodes at once, believing that this type of release pattern will be increasingly common with television shows. He said, [...] "When I ask my friends what they did with their weekend, they say, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> and watched three seasons of Breaking Bad or it's two seasons of Game of Thrones".

500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in...</b> Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E

500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was born}} on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both {{physicians}} in the Indian Army. Her father was a Punjabi from Ambala. Her mother, from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Ms. Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, {{a former member of}} Bihar Legislative Assembly, and Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior and actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra and Mannara Chopra are her cousins.

Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in Daily News and Analysis, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir. She has said, [...] "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous... We were all army kids there.
