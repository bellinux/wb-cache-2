Some languages, especially system programming languages, allow the user to specify the bit combination {{to be used for}} each enumerator.

50|$|Loreo is a {{manufacturer}} of stereo photography equipment, including 3D cameras and stereo lens attachments for SLR cameras. Stereo pictures taken using Loreo systems are instantly viewable using 3D viewers without any cutting or remounting. These stereophotos {{are in the same}} <b>format</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> as any normal photograph, only they contain 2 images side by side. Some cameras produce cross eye stereo images, where the right-part of the photo is actually the left image and vice versa. Other cameras produce parallel stereoimages, where left and right are not swapped. Loreo was founded in 1982, and is based in Hong Kong, China.|$|E

In 1908 number plates were only 3 numbers and 1 letter long. Italy still permits smaller plates to {{be attached to the}} front of a vehicle, while the rear plate complies to the usual EU format. The common design consists of a blue strip on the left of the plate, which has the EU motif (12 yellow stars), along with the country code of the member state in which the vehicle was registered.|$|E

40|$|A morphology-based {{thresholding}} {{technique for}} character extraction from outdoor images is developed. Such extraction is traditionally {{difficult because of}} the influence of illumination changes, such as lightness, shadow, and reflection. Changes in character font, apparent size, and inclination also make extraction more difficult. Though there are some character reading systems for <b>format</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> determined characters, such as the automatic license plate reader, their strong assumptions limit their applications. We assume for character extraction merely that characters occupy plane areas and consist of narrow lines. The proposed method makes it possible to choose an appropriate threshold for each point using the gray level of the nearest edge points. The method yields more robust thresholding results against changes in illumination conditions and character. 1...|$|E
30|$|For {{performance}} {{evaluation of the}} proposed algorithm, the RD performance of the proposed and conventional algorithms was evaluated. Four test sequences (‘Akko’, ‘Ballroom’, ‘Flamenco 2 ’, and ‘Race 1 ’) were used with the <b>format</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of 4 : 0 : 0 YUV and 640 × 480, respectively. Key frames were coded using JM 17.2, and five QP points (33, 37, 41, 45, and 49) were used. Note that the ‘Akko’, ‘Ballroom’, ‘Flamenco 2 ’, and ‘Race 1 ’ sequences consist of 300, 250, 250, and 250 frames, respectively. The conventional algorithm employs every other frame as the key frame, {{while the number of}} key frames are determined depending on GOP size. The SI frames are reconstructed based on an adaptive search range [24] and an LDPCA channel coder with a matrix length of 6, 336 [5].|$|E

We have conducted a study in two stages, in 2005 and 2006, with user evaluations of e-newspaper prototypes and early version of an enewspaper, including tests, questionnaires and interviews. The overall research question is: What attributes are central from a user adoption perspective to launch a successful enewspaper innovation? The paper contributes to existing adoption and m-commerce research by a) exploring the applicability of Rogers ' framework in a pre-adoption phase in two stages, comparing the results regarding perceived attributes and intention to adopt, and b) presenting detailed descriptions of factors that enhance or inhibit an e-newspaper introduction, compared to other publication channels.

40|$|Available on the {{commercial}} market {{are a number}} of algorithms that enable assigning to pixels of a monochrome digital image suitable colors according to a strictly defined schedule. These algorithms have been recently used by professional film studios involved in the coloring of archival productions. This article provides an overview on the functionality of coloring algorithms in terms of their use to improve the interpretation quality of historical, black - and - white aerial photographs. The analysis covered intuitive (Recolored) programs, as well as more advanced (Adobe After Effect, DaVinci Resolve) programs. The use of their full functionality was limited by the too large information capacity of aerial photograph images. Black - and - white historical aerial photographs, which interpretation quality in many cases does not meet the criteria posed on photogrammetric developments, require an increase of their readability. The solution in this regard may be the process of coloring images. The authors of this article conducted studies aimed to determine to what extent the tested coloring algorithms enable an automatic detection of land cover elements on historical aerial photographs and provide color close to the natural. Used in the studies were archival black - and - white aerial photographs of the western part of Warsaw district made available by the Main Centre of Geodetic and Cartographic Documentation, the selection of which was associated with the presence in this area of various elements of land cover, such as water, forests, crops, exposed soils and also anthropogenic objects. In the analysis of different algorithms are included: <b>format</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of the image, degree of automation of the process, degree of compliance of the result and processing time. The accuracy of the coloring process was different for each class of objects mapped on the photograph. The main limitation of the coloring process created shadows of anthropogenic objects, where grey degree values were corresponding to forests...|$|E

40|$|The <b>format</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> {{specifications}} of the CubeSat platform require highly miniaturized subsystems, one of {{the most}} challenging ones being the propulsion system. Up to date, according to the authors' knowledge, only two CubeSats have successfully operated a propulsion system in space: CanX- 2 in 2008 and Defil-n 3 Xt in 2013. The importance of a miniaturized propulsion system becomes even more apparent when taken into consideration that most, if not all, of the CubeSats launched to date, due to budget constraints, have been piggybacking their launches into space and therefore they may end up in a non-optimal orbit. As a next step, a formation flying technology demonstration mission is planned by the Delft University of Technology (DelFFi), as part of the QB 50 project. This thesis gives an outline of the present development status of micro-propulsion systems at Delft University of Technology. The main design driving criteria are provided by the DelFFi satellites requirements. Keeping in mind the educational environment in which the work is performed, safety drives the requirements: thus, propellants have to be non-toxic and easy to handle. Additionally, present requirements aim at a thrust level in the range of 1 to 10 [mN] and a total ?V of 15 [m/s] or more. Wet mass, when installed in triple-unit CubeSats, shall be less than 450 [g], and peak power consumption less than 10 [W]. A number of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems have been investigated to find suitable candidates that fulfil these minimum requirements. However, it has been concluded that all presently available systems have low Technology-Readiness-Level (TRL) or their performance is out of the required range. It was thus necessary to start working at custom designed system. The design process and decisions made will be presented in this thesis. Furthermore for testing purposes also a test setup and an engineering model propulsion system was made. A general test program using LabVIEW was made that can automate the testing process of the thruster. The system was then tested and from the results, recommendations and conclusions were made for the next iteration of the thruster.
