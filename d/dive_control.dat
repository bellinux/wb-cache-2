50|$|Forelle was a single-hull boat {{designed}} with internal ballast and compensating tanks. She had fixed angled aft planes, and movable forward units for <b>dive</b> <b>control.</b> This boat {{had to be}} carried into action on board a surface ship and launched close to its target, as she was not fitted with a separate surface propulsion system. She was equipped with two Whitehead torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|In <b>dive</b> <b>control,</b> Kelly was {{watching}} his two divers {{on the video}} monitor while the bell was being raised. Prangley was calling out the depth every 10 meters. When the bell was thirty meters from the surface, Prangley suddenly stood up, waved his fist shoulder high, and shouted, “All stop.” On the monitor, {{he appeared to be}} listening to something.|$|E
50|$|In <b>dive</b> <b>control,</b> Supervisor Kelly was at {{the control}} panel when an amber warning light came on {{followed}} by the klaxon of the ‘Dive Alert’ alarm. Then, Captain Forsyth’s voice came over the intercom: “Get the diver back in the bell please.” Kelly relayed the message to Ward who stopped {{what he was doing}} and swam back to the bell. In the trunking he took off his helmet as Prangley stacked his umbilical.|$|E

One of the earliest sled designs was a converted Stokes litter in which two divers sat tandem with the forward diver operating the <b>diving</b> <b>controls</b> (Sand, 1956). The litter was relatively easy to maneuver and provided a comfortable platform for observing operational fishing gear. However, the use of underwater photographic equipment to document gear performance was difficult due to the limited mobility of the observer-cameraman...|$|R
50|$|If {{the player}} {{is able to}} surface with the treasure, a {{monetary}} value is assigned to the chest by the <b>Dive</b> <b>Control.</b> Players must return to port to sell their treasure for money. Any trip carrying treasure can be raided by another player. Raids are conducted by rolling the dice. The player with the higher roll wins the treasure on the opponent’s ship, which means that a player who instigates a raid can end up losing all his treasure.|$|E

50|$|On the surface, {{the force}} of the wind had blown the Canopus {{sideways}} against the platform overhang, snapping off the ship’s mast which came crashing down onto the deck with a loud bang. At the same time, the wind was driving the ship backwards towards the Haakon Magnus. Captain Forsyth quickly took the ship off DP and tried to swing the bow outboard to keep the vessel from grounding on the submerged pontoons of the Magnus. Then he pressed the ‘Dive Abort’ alarm and called <b>dive</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For <b>diving</b> <b>control</b> of {{autonomous}} underwater vehicle (AUV), a sliding-mode PID control with backstepping is proposed. First, an equivalent model of AUV is developed. Then, the sliding mode control with an PID sliding surface is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of AUV. Moreover, the analysis of stability can be completed by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, To validate the proposed control scheme, the simulation results are illustrated in this paper. Simulation results show that, the tracking precision and the robustness of the system are improved under the proposed control method...|$|R
40|$|The SWARM {{underwater}} system, {{which consists}} of multiple, homogenous robots, is a project for monitoring the Baltic Sea environments. The unit {{of the system is}} a Lagrangan type rosot which can control its depth by changing the buoyancy using a piston engine, and moves otherwise freely with the sea water flows. The depth control of the robots is very important for the performance of the whole system. This thesis provides an energy optimal <b>diving</b> <b>control</b> algorithm for the SWARM robots to improve the performance and energy consumption of the diving process. De to the nonlinear environment and dynamics, most of the classical theories may not achieve good results and consume much energy. The environment based depth control algorithm estimates the water density by a density model, which is built from previous information or measurement. By reducing the piston movements, much energy can be saved than the previous control algorithm. The Baltic environments are studied and the physical water properties including salinity, temperature, pressure and density are analyzed. Result proves the availability of the seawater properties model in <b>diving</b> <b>control.</b> Different methods of measuring seawater density and updating the environment model are evaluated, and the environment based control algorithm is tested in the simulator. Error and energy consumption are analyzed and the result shows the diving performance is improved significantly...|$|R

Physiol. 63 (6) : 2380 - 2387, 1987. -In the calculation of decompression schedules, it is commonly as-sumed that only the inert gas needs to be considered; all inspired 02 is ignored. Animal experiments have shown that high Oz can increase risk of serious decompression sickness (DCS). A trial was performed to assess the relative risks of O 2 and Nz in human no-decompression <b>dives.</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>dives</b> (477) of 30 - to 240 -min duration were performed with subjects breathing mixtures with low (0. 21 - 0. 38 ATA) or high (1. 0 - 1. 5 ATA) Paz. Depths were chosen by a sequential dose-response format. Only 11 cases of DCS and 18 cases of marginal symp-toms were recorded despite exceeding the presently accepted no-decompression limits by> 20 %.

50|$|When {{realising}} {{that there}} are POWs and civilians on board, {{and that they are}} facing certain death without rescue, U-boat Commander Werner Hartenstein (Duken) makes a decision which goes against the orders of German high command. The U-boat surfaces and Hartenstein instructs his men to save as many of the shipwrecked survivors as they can. Hartenstein also attempts to dive with all the survivors on board and, though this puts the submarine into a crash <b>dive,</b> <b>control</b> is regained and it resurfaces. He also has a Red Cross flag displayed and a message sent to the Allies to organise a rescue of the survivors. The Italian prisoners are taken off U-156 by another U-boat and an Italian submarine.|$|E
50|$|Supervisor Kelly {{did as he}} was told, {{and from}} <b>dive</b> <b>control,</b> he had {{a clear view of the}} {{moonpool}} and could see that something was wrong. The bell umbilical and clump weight guide wires were not hanging straight down through the moonpool; they were leaning towards the bow of the ship. What’s more, the trolley that the wires were hanging from was violently shaking and vibrating. Suddenly the video monitor blacked out. The Star Canopus, with her human payload dangling thirty meters below, had been blown across the path of a Haakon Magnus anchor chain, completely severing all connections to the bell, including the life-support umbilical, the main lift wire, and the clump weight/guide wire recovery system. In that instant, the bell, with Prangley and Ward inside, began plummeting to the seabed below.|$|E
50|$|In <b>dive</b> <b>control,</b> Kelly {{was waiting}} for Prangley and Ward to seal the bell when the red ‘Dive Abort’ {{indicator}} suddenly lit up. Captain Forsyth came on the intercom again, this time with noticeable urgency in his voice. “Get the bell up as soon as possible,” he said to Kelly. But when Kelly called down to the bell, he discovered that Prangley was having difficulty pulling in Ward’s umbilical; it was snagged on something outside the bell. He didn’t know on what, but now {{there was no way}} to shut the inside hatch until the umbilical was cleared. Ward wanted to lock out to fix the problem, but Kelly flatly forbade him to do so. Instead, he told Ward to throw the dive hat out of the bell, then pull in the umbilical; perhaps that would free it. But when this was tried, the umbilical remained snagged.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dynamic model and control scheme {{of an active}} variable buoyancy system (VBS) actuator for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Our aim is to design an active disturbance rejection controller for the AUV maneuvering in the vertical plane with two VBS actuators. Firstly, a vertical plane mathematical model of AUV and a dynamics model of the VBS are established, and the model consists of three degrees of freedom (DOF) motion components that are surge, heave and pitch. The control scheme is decoupled into two subsystems including <b>diving</b> <b>control</b> and pitch control. Then, two improved extended state observers (ESOs) are employed and made comparative researches. The controller with improved ESOs can achieve good noise attenuation and robustness. Finally, field trial and simulation results illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed control scheme...|$|R
