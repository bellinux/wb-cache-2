As Capp was ushered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> his prosthetic leg suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, [...] "Call Walter Reed (Hospital), or maybe Bethesda," [...] to which Capp replied, [...] "Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!"

50|$|President William Howard Taft {{moved the}} desk, sofas and chairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> which was {{completed}} in 1909. The furniture remained there {{for more than twenty}} years and was used by five presidents, until a December 24, 1929, fire. President Herbert Hoover rebuilt <b>the</b> Taft <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> but accepted <b>the</b> donation of a new desk from a Michigan trade association.|$|R
50|$|The White House {{bought a}} set of diminutive, cane-back {{mahogany}} armchairs from Davenport & Co. in 1902. Nearly-identical chairs, but with leather backs, {{had been made by}} the company for the Massachusetts State House. President Hoover installed six of the cane-back chairs his rebuilt <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> in 1930. President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> modern <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> completed 1934, where they have been used by every president since. The chairs are currently in use in <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> including a pair flanking the Resolute Desk.|$|R
50|$|At about 8:00 pm on Christmas Eve, 1929, a fire {{began in}} the attic of the West Wing. Due to some quick {{thinking}} and a tarpaulin, George Akerson managed to save the Theodore Roosevelt desk, but the executive offices were heavily damaged. By 10:30 the fire was extinguished but not before the roof, attic, floors, and press room of the West Wing were ruined. The building was repaired and on April 14, 1930, President Herbert Hoover moved back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> newly constructed <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Resolute desk is a large, nineteenth-century partners' desk used {{by seven}} {{presidents of the}} United States in the White House Oval Office as the Oval Office desk. It {{was a gift from}} Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 and was built from the English oak timbers of the British Arctic {{exploration}} ship [...] Franklin Roosevelt requested the addition of a door with the presidential seal to conceal his leg braces. Many presidents since Hayes have used the desk at various locations in the White House, but in 1961 it was First Lady Jackie Kennedy who had the idea, agreed to by her husband John F. Kennedy, to bring the Resolute desk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|Armas struck on June 18th. [...] While Armas' {{offensive}} was ineffectual, Arbenz was {{apprehensive about}} the possibility of future successful attacks, and about being betrayed by his military. [...] On June 22 Allen Dulles walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> certain that only drastic measures could unseat Arbenz and salvage the situation. [...] In the meeting they said that a filibuster by the chairman of Democrats for Eisenhower, one of Ike's richest, and most generous contributors was their last ditch hope, with a 20% chance of success. [...] A withdrawal of $150,000 from Riggs Bank purchased three fully armed P-47 Thunderbolts. [...] On June 27, after days of the miniature bombing campaign, Arbenz, thinking his forces outmatched, and thinking that his grasp on the military was failing ceded power to Colonel Carlos Diaz. [...] The CIA orchestrated several transfers of power, ending when the CIA finally placed Castillo Armas in the office of President.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b> Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the years}} prior to this merger, CSX donated the C&O desk to the White House and it was placed in <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> Study. Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan all used the desk there. On May 2, 1985 the desk was moved, and then Vice President George H. W. Bush started using the desk as his main work space in the White House. When Marlin Fitzwater, White House Press Secretary under both presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, was asked about Bush's use of the C&O desk, he stated that [...] "...he got used to it, found it comfortable, {{and thought it was}} attractive." [...] After his p{{residential}} inauguration on January 20, 1989 the C&O desk was used in the residential portion of the White House, and on June 13, 1989 it was moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> newly decorated <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b> <b>The</b> Resolute desk, <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> desk removed for the C&O, was placed briefly in the White House storage room, but found a final resting place for the Bush White House in the Treaty Room which Bush used as an ancillary office.|$|R
