500|$|Songs {{featured}} within [...] "Valley Girls" [...] {{were taken}} from both the Los Angeles punk rock scene and mainstream 1980s hits in order to represent the two worlds surrounding character Lily Rhodes.

With the exception of Fountains of Wayne's [...] "Prom Theme" [...] (1999), every song featured within [...] "Valley Girls" [...] was released prior to or in 1983, the year in which Lily's flashbacks take place.

His sharp comical yapping was unbearable, like stabs through one's brain, and Fyne's deeply modulated remonstrances abashed the vivacious animal no more than the deep, patient murmur of the sea abashes a nigger minstrel on a popular beach.

For rarity counters, spring included no fewer than 4 first state records: Glossy Ibis, Gray Flycatcher, Black-throated Gray Warbler, and Brambling. We make here a special note that the last 3 birds were seen by Steve Dinsmore, who found the flycatcher and warbler himself through his diligent checking of that migrant trap par excellence, Oliver Reservoir. The Glossy Ibis was found by Joel Jorgensen, through his equally diligent checking of the Rainwater Basin (disclaimer: WRS wrote this!). Slightly different types of first stat records, but possibly more significant biologically, included the first confirmed breeding records this century (!) for two species: Sandhill Crane and Pileated Woodpecker.

HIV-risk practices are defined as risky injecting practices such as the sharing of needles and other injecting equipment and unsafe sexual practices i. e. having multiple sexual partners and low level of condoms use. Employing qualitative approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 2 l young men (aged between 15 to 29 years) who were recruited <b>in</b> several <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> spots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lorong as well as participant observation aimed to document the lived experience of young men <b>in</b> this locale. <b>The</b> interviews and participant observation revealed the crucial role of socioeconomic deprivation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lorong and the intersection of Siri' (a local concept of diguity and esteem) and Rewa (a local construct of masculinity) as well as participation in gangs in stimulating young men in this area to be engaged in HIV-risk practices. These intersections push many members of the lorong to be involved in risky drug use and drug rnjecting practices as well as unsafe sexual practices that render them vulnerable to HIV infection. Furthermore, risky drug use and unsafe sexual activities that potentially leads to HIV infection is not an isolated behaviour and must be understood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social context of the lorong. I argue that to be more effective, the individualization of risk that characterize the existing harm reduction progr. rms in Makassar need to be complemented with wider community based progftlms that address socio-economic deprivation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lorong. Additionally, harm reduction programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lorong should be cognizant to the cultural and structural constraints hindering young men in this locality to apply safer drug injecting practices and safer sexual practices...|$|R
