Inner cone takes {{effect on the}} stability and guiding of the bit; cone apex is the part which penetrates into the formation first, {{the design of the}} structure is related to the formation characteristics, the length of outer cone is determined by cutter density, and the outer cone affects the wear of the bit (Kerr 1988; Cerkovnik 1982).

For the soft formation, whether the channel is unobstructed should be considered firstly.

As for the hard formation, the wear of the cutters should be considered.

30|$|The crown {{shape of}} {{polycrystalline}} diamond compact (PDC) drill bit affects the stability, wear, bottom hole cleaning, and load {{distribution of the}} bit. Predecessors {{have done a lot}} of researches about the design of PDC bit crown, and proposed some design principles, such as equivolume, equal abrasion, and equipower (Shusheng et al. 1998; Rong et al. 2006; Zhigang and Gang 1994; Hibbs and Flom 1978; Glowka D 1985; Sinor et al. 1998). But they just got the conclusion that “the axial force and cutting force of the topper cutter is bigger than the both sides cutters” qualitatively (Han Laiju et al. 1992), and did not give the quantitative analysis. The wear of the cutters is mainly caused by the rock-breaking force and specific energy consumption, and the force that applied on the cutters in the different parts of the crown is different, so it is necessary to study the mechanical characteristic of cutters in different parts of the crown, and this research will has an important guiding significance in the optimization design of PDC drill bit’s cutting structure. This paper takes “per revolution-specific rock-breaking work” as objective function, evaluates the rock-breaking effect of different crown shapes, and provides the theoretical basis for the optimization design of PDC <b>drill</b> bit’s <b>crown</b> shape.|$|R

This work studies the Fe-Cu-Co-diamonds composites processed by the powder metallurgy techniques – powders mixing and hot pressing at 850 °C/ 35 MPa/ 3 min. Microstructural analysis of composites as well as metal matrix-diamond adhesion was made by scanning electron microscopy-SEM after abrasion resistance tests. Compression tests were carried out to evaluate the elastic properties of composites, i. e., modulus of elasticity (E) and yield stress (σe), aiming at the assessment of the metal matrix-diamond adhesion. It was found satisfactory adhesion for the composites M 2 and M 3, with values σe = 360 MPa and 375 MPa, respectively...|$|R

In 1944 he partnered with Frank McMahon and others forming Empire Petroleum Limited, in an unsuccessful attempt to raise capital to drill a wildcat well. Two years later he tried again with two new companies, Reef Petroleum and Tower Petroleum. The two new companies also failed to find oil, but the efforts raised enough money for Bell and his partners to form Calvan Petroleums on the heels of Imperial Oil's discovery of a large oil field at Redwater, Alberta. The company found success trading in leases and <b>drilling</b> rights on <b>crown</b> land, prompting Bell to form several other oil companies in the years that followed. In 1951, Bell amalgamated his various companies into Calvan Consolidated Ltd. The new company held an interest in 77 wells at the Redwater field.

Safety clutch purpose is to ensure safety of electrical engine from overworking, which occurs in drilling with <b>drill</b> bit or <b>crown.</b> Safety clutch starts working when electrical engines spins pinion which is placed on cylinder. Pinion is being presseed by the spring to the cylinder‘s knuckles. Drill bit is being placed in the cylinder and when drill bit stucks or if there‘s too high resistance, knuckle goes up and overcomes spings tensile strength – pinion‘s and cylinders knuckles excel. When safety clutch starts working, pinions slide at each other and as friction exists safety clutch‘s pinions worn out. Changing worned out pinions is not complicated, but price of repair takes up to 50 % of a new perforator price. In this Master Degree work {{there is a}} comparison of four similar types of perforator safety clutches. Parameters which are included in the comparison is maximum drilling diameter in concrete, perforator price, clutch elements and safety clutch elements repair price. According to these parameters, manufacturer‘s no. 4 clutch is decided to be the weakest link. Also there is stated clutch‘s stiffness coefficient – 333. According to the stiffness coefficient, spring pushes pinion with a force of 667 N or 6, 67 kg. Averange torque is also stated in this work, as it is needed to make safety clutch work – 73 Nm.

40|$|The {{positive}} {{identification of a}} decedent is paramount to a forensic investigation in which human remains have been recovered and must be identified. Due to increasing global mobility in the world 2 ̆ 7 s populations, it is not inconceivable that an individual might die far away {{from his or her}} home. Pinpointing an individual 2 ̆ 7 s geographic origin may contribute to definitive forensic identification of contemporary human skeletal remains in cases where dental records and other means of identification are either unavailable to law enforcement personnel or do not yield immediate results. Stable isotope analysis of biogenic tissues such as tooth enamel and bone mineral has become a well‐recognized and increasingly important method for determining the provenance of human remains, and it has been used successfully in bioarchaeological studies as well as forensic investigations. Both 18 O and 2 H stable isotope signatures are well established proxies as environmental indicators of climate (temperature) and source water and are therefore considered reliable indicators of geographic life trajectories of animals and humans. Similarly, 13 C and 15 N abundance data have distinguished dietary preferences in ancient human populations, and have been used to qualify 2 H and 18 O geolocational data that may be consistent with more than one location. Few if any studies have systematically investigated the multi-isotopic signatures in human tooth enamel and dentin from living individuals. Since 18 O abundance values obtained from tooth enamel of late-erupting molars are a source of information on geographic origin of an individual during adolescence when crown formation takes place, it was hypothesized that: 1) the stable isotope abundance of 2 H, 18 O, and 13 C in human tooth enamel and dentin is consistent with self-reported residential history and dietary preferences data, and 2) the isotopic variability evident between individuals with shared residential history and nutrient intake is quantifiable, and indicative of intra-individual variability. Two pilot studies were conducted to: 1) evaluate the feasibility of extracting and measuring the 2 H composition of human tooth enamel and its suitability as a proxy for human geographic provenance, and 2) compare the isotopic abundance of isotopic abundance of 2 H and 13 C in human crown dentin collagen obtained from archaeological and modern teeth with the 18 O and 13 C isotopic composition of the corresponding tooth enamel carbonate. A protocol for preparing tooth enamel for 2 H analysis was successfully devised and implemented; however, no correlation was observed between tooth enamel 2 H abundance values as measured plotted against source water 2 H abundance values. While unexpectedly low rates of hydrogen exchange within mineral hydroxyl groups were documented, and it was possible to analyze tooth enamel for its 2 H isotopic composition, the seemingly fixed nature of 2 H abundance in tooth enamel means that the 2 H isotopic signature of tooth enamel cannot be used as an indicator of geographic provenance. Conversely, positive correlations between collagen 2 H abundance values of primary dentin with 2 H abundance values for source water and also with enamel 18 O abundance values suggests that primary dentin collagen 2 H values are linked to the isotopic composition of source water. Third molar tooth enamel was sampled from 10 living volunteers undergoing routine tooth extractions at University of Toronto affiliated dental clinics in Ontario, Canada. The mixed-sex group of patients was given questionnaires in which they provided detailed residential history and answered questions pertaining to dietary preferences (e. g., vegetarian) prior to donating all four third molars. Enamel was <b>drilled</b> from the <b>crown</b> of two third molars from each subject, chemically cleaned, and subjected to an acid digest before being analyzed for its 18 O and 13 C composition using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. Herewith, isotope abundance values are presented using the delta notation as delta values in per mil (‰). Mean d 13 CVPDB values for all samples ranged from - 9. 47 ‰ to - 11. 31 ‰ (pooled mean = - 10. 37 ‰), which suggested a persistent C 4 plant dietary influence at the time the sampled tooth enamel was forming and is consistent with the typical North American diet. While inter-subject variation contributed the largest proportion of total d 13 C variability, differences were not significant. The pooled mean d 18 OVSMOW value for enamel samples was 24. 39 ‰, while individual subject mean d 18 OVSMOW values ranged from 23. 76 ‰ to 25. 18 ‰. Marked offsets (0. 01 ‰ - 0. 51 ‰) in mean d 18 OVSMOW values for each pair of third molars were observed. While subject variation was significant (p= 0. 0034), neither diet nor sex significantly influenced the oxygen (or carbon) isotope data. Following conversion of d 18 OVSMOW values to d 18 OPhosphate values, drinking water values were calculated using the Daux et al. (2008) equation, and compared to their corresponding regional estimated annual average d 18 O values in precipitation retrieved from the Online Isotopes in Precipitation Calculator (OIPC) (Bowen 2014). Despite observed correlations between the drinking water d 18 OWater values and d 18 OOIPC values of four subjects, no statistically significant correlations were evident between the two limited data sets. However, when the isotopically similar d 18 O values of Toronto area residents were averaged and combined with the remaining Canadian data and the 18 O data from 5 enamel samples analyzed in the 2 H enamel pilot study, strong positive correlations were evident between d 18 OPhosphate valuesand d 18 OOIPC values (R 2 = 0. 87). Moreover, an equally strong linear relationship was observed between modeled annual precipitation 18 O and calculated source water 18 O (R 2 = 0. 87). Based on the d 2 H, d 18 O, and d 13 C values measured in tooth enamel and dentin, it is possible to infer and confirm geographic provenance and dietary intake. However, while enamel carbonate d 13 C values were consistent with self-reported dietary intake information and residential history, as could be expected vegetarians could not be distinguished from those who consumed meat without determining C/N isotopic ratios in dentin collagen. Further, the presence of strong linear relationships between the 18 O composition of enamel carbonate and modeled source water 18 O in the merged dataset illustrates the importance of considering site-specific isotopic complexities and using multi-isotope data obtained from multiple tissues when investigating the geographic origins of humans in an archaeological or forensic context. It is not possible to quantify intra-individual isotopic variability without sampling from larger, geographically diverse populations and controlling for as many variables as possible. The construction of regional databases containing 18 O and 2 H isotopic data obtained from a variety of environmental and human and faunal tissue samples, and the application of such data to individual cases in which geographic origins are desired, is recommended provided the following caveats are considered: 1) whenever possible, d 18 OPhosphate values should be used when comparing d 18 O values in tooth enamel with those in precipitation {{in order to avoid the}} unmitigated error associated with the application of carbonate conversion equations to enamel phosphate d 18 O data, 2) the continuous consumption of food sourced elsewhere is liable to affect the overall enamel carbonate d 18 O values, 3) d 18 O values in precipitation are not inclusive of the variety of postprecipitation and hydrological processes unique to a particular location, nor are they an accurate representation of the isotopically mixed nature of tap water sourced from distant reservoirs. Hence, extrapolations should be made with caution. Enamel sequential microsampling methods may be advisable for narrowing down a geographic timeline if the overlapping of isotopic signals at various points along the tooth’s longitudinal plane can be quantified and validated. While standardization of analytical methodology is critical to appropriate interpretations of the data, stable isotope profiling is not a standalone method and should be used in conjunction with other lines of evidence in determinations of human provenance...|$|R
