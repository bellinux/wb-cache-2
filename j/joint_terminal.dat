30|$|The quality-of-service (QoS) {{criteria}} (measured {{in terms}} of the minimum capacity requirement in this paper) are very important to practical indoor power line communication (PLC) applications as they greatly affect the user experience. With a two-way multicarrier relay configuration, in this paper we investigate the <b>joint</b> <b>terminals</b> and relay power optimization for the indoor broadband PLC environment, where the relay node works in the amplify-and-forward (AF) mode. As the QoS-constrained power allocation problem is highly non-convex, the globally optimal solution is computationally intractable to obtain. To overcome this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method to decompose this problem into three convex/quasi-convex sub-problems. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm under practical PLC channel conditions. Compared with the conventional bidirectional direct transmission (BDT) system, the relay-assisted two-way information exchange (R 2 WX) scheme can meet the same QoS requirement with less total power consumption.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh-temperature superconducting (HTS) cable has heat {{intrusion}} {{from the}} termination including joule heat generation at the <b>terminal</b> <b>joint</b> {{and from the}} room temperature cable through the Cu current lead. According {{to the length of}} the HTS cable, this heat loss may become a considerable amount which cannot be ignored in the HTS cable system. In this study, referring to a high-voltage cable (HV cable) which was developed in M-PACC project, the effect of heat transfer at the interface between the <b>terminal</b> <b>joint</b> and LN 2 in the terminal vessel (ho) on the temperature of the HTS cable were calculated and evaluated. The condition of flow in the terminal vessel was assumed to be natural convection, forced flow or static condition for evaluating this effect with various heat transfer condition. As a result, {{in the case of the}} natural convection, most of heats flow into the LN 2 in the terminal vessel where the volumetric flow of the LN 2 is large since ho becomes high. Accordingly, the temperature rise of the LN 2 in the inner pipe of Cu former and the terminal vessel can be restricted. However, in the cases of the forced flow and the static condition, most of heats flow into the LN 2 in the inner pipe where the volumetric flow of the LN 2 is small since ho becomes small. Accordingly, the temperature rise of the LN 2 in the inner pipe becomes high. This temperature rise of the LN 2 in the inner pipe makes the temperature of the HTS conductor large resulting in remarkable increase of AC losses. Consequently, on the HV cable design, for restriction of the AC loss increase, it is expected that designing the HTS cable termination such as extending outer surface of the <b>terminal</b> <b>joint</b> for increasing of the heat inflow from the <b>terminal</b> <b>joint</b> to the LN 2 in the vessel is effective...|$|R
