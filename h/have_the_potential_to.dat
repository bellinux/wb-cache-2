5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E

In addition, Hawaii <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> generate 2,800,000 million kWh/year from offshore wind power.

Popplewell portrays Silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence. She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack. Popplewell was new to the Halo series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> draw in a new audience.|$|E

Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> generate massive tsunamis.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
5|$|Florida State placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, who {{was born}} in Poland, also was a key {{component}} of the Seminoles' scoring offense. In his career at Florida State prior to the Sugar Bowl, Janikowski made 65 of 83field goal attempts, including 33 of his previous 38kicks of less than 50yards. Janikowski also handled kickoffs, kicking the ball so hard that 57 of his 83kickoffs were touchbacks. Janikowski was considered to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> be an early selection in the 2000 NFL Draft by several scouts for professional teams.|$|E
5|$|If possible, {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E

City-dwelling foxes may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} several years, HPMI has proven a number of {{technology}} concepts that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> narrow the gap between research and practical applications of nanotube-based materials. These technologies include magnetic alignment of nanotubes, fabrication of nanotube membranes or buckypapers, production of nanotube composites, modeling of nanotube-epoxy interaction at the molecular level, and characterization of SWNT nanocomposites for mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, thermal management, radiation shielding and EMI attenuation. HPMI personnel also established Florida's first National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC).|$|E

Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> be extremely useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
5|$|Brazza's martin may be hunted by humans, {{and both}} species may be {{infected}} {{with a variety}} of parasites.

The small islands which are the home of the Mascarene martin subspecies P. b. borbonica may be devastated by cyclones, which <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> cause severe temporary losses to the populations on Mauritius and Réunion. The legal protection afforded to the Phedina martins varies with jurisdiction, and ranges from none for Mascarene martins on Réunion to special protection for the same species on Madagascar.

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
