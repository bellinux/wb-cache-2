2500|$|In {{a drunken}} revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols {{into the air}} on October 27, 1880, [...] in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands. Tombstone's Town Marshal Fred White {{attempted}} to disarm Brocius and grabbed his weapon by the barrel. The gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Wyatt Earp had borrowed Fred Dodge's pistol and he pistol-whipped Brocius. At the preliminary hearing for Brocius afterward, Wyatt testified {{that he had heard}} White say: [...] "I am an officer; give me your pistol.” When he got close, he saw Brocius remove his pistol from his scabbard and White grab it by the barrel. He said <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White [...] "gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off." [...] White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt buffaloed Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, [...] "What have I done? I have not done anything to be arrested for.” ...|$|E

60|$|Clambering {{into the}} wagon, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around her neck, {{pressing}} his cheek close against hers, and during {{what seemed a}} very long while the two remained silent, not daring to give words to their fears.|$|E
60|$|Claus {{found her}} {{lying on his}} hearth, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{around the neck of}} the lioness and hugged her lovingly. The cat had retired into a far corner. She did not care to {{associate}} with Shiegra.|$|E
