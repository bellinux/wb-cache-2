2500|$|<b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> <b>infection</b> {{can occur}} through {{ingestion}} of dormant microbial cysts in contaminated water or food, {{or by the}} fecal–oral route (through poor hygiene practices). The cyst can survive for weeks to months in cold water, so can be present in contaminated wells and water systems, especially stagnant water sources, such as naturally occurring ponds, storm water storage systems, and even clean-looking mountain streams. [...] Giardia lamblia is a microscopic parasite that causes the diarrheal illness known as giardiasis. Can also be found on surfaces, soil, food, or water that has been contaminated with feces from infected humans or animals. They may also occur in city reservoirs and persist after water treatment, as the cysts are resistant to conventional water treatment methods, such as chlorination and ozonolysis. Zoonotic transmission is also possible, so Giardia infection is a concern for people camping in the wilderness or swimming in contaminated streams or lakes, especially the artificial lakes formed by beaver dams (hence the popular name for giardiasis, [...] "beaver fever").|$|E

The control group was made up of duodenal tissue of children with excluded giardiasis and inflammation of the upper part of gastrointestinal tract. The duodenal biopsies from children without <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> <b>infection</b> were found to have a high immunoreactivity for iNOS in enterocytes, the cells of intestinal crypts, endothelial cells of vessels and connective tissue cells of lamina propria.

There were significant differences in mean surface area (SA) measurements between patients with giardiasis and severe malabsorption and controls (P less than 0. 001) and infected patients with normal absorption (P less than 0. 05). SA measurements correlated significantly with D-xylose excretion results (r = 0. 55; P less than 0. 01) and daily facal fat output (r = - 0. 61; P less than 0. 001). Significant correlations between duration of symptoms and SA measurements (r = 0. 43; P less than 0. 05) and D-xylose excretion (r = 0. 43; P less than 0. 05) in giardiasis suggest that histological and functional impairment are maximal soon after infection and resolve in time.

Three hundred twenty eight stool samples from patients less than one to 81 years of age were examined using formalin-ether concentration for G. lamblia, Zeihl-Neelsen staining for Cryptosporidium, and the Prospectt rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA; Alexon, Sunnyvale, CA) for parasite diagnosis. The Prospectt Giardia rapid assay detected 17 cases of G. <b>lamblia</b> <b>infection</b> compared with six by formalin-ether concentration. However, the Prospectt Cryptosporidum EIA did not increase the rate of detection of Cryptosporidum when compared with Zeihl-Neelsen staining.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Giardiasis, or <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> <b>infection,</b> is {{the most}} common {{parasitosis}} of the human digestive tract. It is highly contagious and mostly occurs in warm climates. Children are especially susceptible to infection. MICROBIOLOGICAL FEATURES: The infection can sporadically occur anywhere and waterborne outbreaks have been reported in some countries. Hence, the prevention of giardiasis depends on proper sanitation. Once ingested through contaminated water, Giardia cysts adhere to the intestinal surface. The parasite feeds on the mucous secretions of the intestine and may produce severe infections which can interfere with nutrient absorption. Symptoms in affected individuals usually include diarrhoea, dehydration, stomach cramps, gas, and weight loss. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the detection of cysts in fecal samples. Treatment includes the use of metronidazole and other drugs that are effective in clearing the infection within a few days. CASE REPORT: We report the recent case of a patient with Giardiasis who received dental hygiene procedures and discuss the interventions required in consideration of the patient's concomitant heart condition.

If many G. <b>lamblia</b> <b>infections</b> of children were not detected by stool examination, then prior conclusions concerning diarrhea and growth of the children would be suspect...|$|R
40|$|The {{secretory}} {{immune response}} in humans infected with <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> was studied by using saliva samples and a membrane-rich protein fraction. The membrane fraction, studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showed 24 antigen bands, ranging from 170 to 14 kDa. Saliva samples from giardiasis patients showed a heterogeneous response against the membrane fraction {{when they were}} assayed by immunoblotting. Among the antigens recognized by patient saliva samples, those of 170, 105, 92, 66, 32, 29, and 14 kDa stood out. These antigens were not recognized by saliva samples from healthy individuals. They may be of importance in future studies of protection from or diagnosis of G. <b>lamblia</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
