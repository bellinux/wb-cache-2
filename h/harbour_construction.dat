5|$|Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital is a {{hospital}} located in Sheet <b>Harbour.</b> <b>Construction</b> began in 1947, and was opened on May 24, 1949. It is {{owned and operated}} by the Capital District Health Authority, which amalgamated into the Nova Scotia Health Authority in 2015. It has sixteen beds for patients. There is a cenotaph and gardens in front of the site where Duncan MacMillan Nursing Home (DMNH) once stood. The hospital offers quite a few services. It is connected to Harbourview Lodge, a nursing home, by a corridor. Harbourview Lodge was built in 2011 to replace DMNH, which was nearing the end of its life span.|$|E
5|$|Netham Lock is {{the point}} at Netham in Bristol at which boats from the River Avon, gain access to Bristol's Floating <b>Harbour.</b> <b>Construction</b> started in 1804 to build the tidal New Cut, where it is joined by the River Malago, and divert the Avon along the Feeder Canal to the harbour; a system {{designed}} and built by William Jessop and later improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A weir carries the river into the New Cut and boats use the adjacent lock. Access to the harbour is only possible during {{the day when the}} lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between Netham and Hanham is above or below the level of the harbour. Netham Lock and the weir form part of Bristol's flood defence mechanisms and it was announced in December 2008 that they would be upgraded as part of the £11 million City Docks Capital Project.|$|E
25|$|Possibly {{in early}} 1874, by {{then on the}} roster of the Cape Government Railways, this {{locomotive}} was rebuilt to a 0-4-2T configuration, before it was shipped to Port Alfred where it served as <b>harbour</b> <b>construction</b> locomotive {{on the banks of}} the Kowie River. While serving at Port Alfred, it was nicknamed Blackie.|$|E

It left Cape Town on board the ship Compage and arrived at Port Alfred on 11 July.|$|E
25|$|The George Hyman Construction Company of Bethesda, Maryland, was {{the general}} {{contractor}} on the Washington <b>Harbour</b> <b>construction</b> project. Structural engineer Zivan Cohen of the firm Tadjer-Cohen-Edelson and landscape architect James Urban also worked on the complex. By November 1983, the cement plant was gone, excavation of the foundations was complete, pilings for the buildings were being driven, and steel sheeting was being driven into the ground by the riverbank to help protect the site from water.|$|E
25|$|From 1913 to 1916, a {{lake was}} {{constructed}} in a shallow part of Coal Harbour, a project that was not without its detractors. The lake was named Lost Lagoon due to its history of ‘disappearing’ at low tide. The lake and a causeway into the park were designed by Thomas Mawson, who also designed a lighthouse for Brockton Point around the same time. Before the Causeway, a wooden footbridge provided the only access route into the park from Coal <b>Harbour.</b> <b>Construction</b> of the causeway (and new roads within the park for emergency access) was completed by 1926.|$|E

50|$|After the Second World War, a {{political}} struggle began {{to complete the}} <b>harbour's</b> <b>construction,</b> but the other harbours in Denmark feared this. But the passing of a new law on 29 April 1960 finally led to the harbour's completion. It opened in 1967 and today {{is one of the}} largest harbours in Denmark.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 the Italian street artist BLU {{was invited}} to create a mural {{for one of the}} granaries, {{reflecting}} on the overdue historical and social commemoration of the <b>harbour's</b> <b>construction</b> history and the forced labourers who built it.

25|$|The French gun-vessel Eclair {{was one of}} 20 chasse-marées {{built in}} 1785 in {{southern}} Brittany for use as service craft in <b>harbour</b> <b>construction</b> at Cherbourg. In 1793 Martin or Jacques Fabien converted ten of them into chaloupes-canonnières (gun-vessels). One of these received the name Eclair. Sir Richard Strachan's squadron captured her in 1795 in Cartaret Bay, and the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Eclair. She then sailed to the West Indies where she was probably out of service by 1801. In 1802 she was hulked under the name HMS Safety. Shen then served as a prison ship at Jamaica around 1808 to 1810. {{she may have been}} sold at Tortola in 1817/18, but in 1841 or so was brought back into service there as a receiving hulk. She was broken up in 1879.|$|E
25|$|Frustration with {{shipping}} grain through eastern ports, Manitoba farmers {{lobbied for}} their own grain port on Hudson Bay which led {{the creation of the}} Hudson Bay Railway which was built in stages north from The Pas after a railway bridge was constructed over the Saskatchewan River in 1910-1911 by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). After initial surveys considered both the ports of Churchill and Port Nelson, it was decided to proceed to Port Nelson in 1912. Construction began at Port Nelson and the new Canadian research ship CSS Acadia was sent to chart the port and shipping routes into the Bay. However <b>harbour</b> <b>construction</b> at Port Nelson ran into engineering and costs problems and was abandoned in World War I. Following the CNoR bankruptcy in 1918 and creation of Canadian National Railways (CNR), the federal government undertook to complete the Hudson Bay Railway; this time to Churchill. CSS Acadia was sent to survey for a port and railway construction resumed. Political and financing difficulties as well as engineering challenges due to the large amount of muskeg and frequent rock outcrops on the Canadian Shield delayed the completion of the railway and port but it was completed and opened to shipping in 1929.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the railway}} {{grouping}} of 1923, both the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham & Dover Railway {{became part of}} the newly formed Southern Railway, which decided to address the duplication of lines and stations at Ramsgate and Margate. It decided to link the two lines at Ramsgate to allow through running between them. This scheme had been proposed by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway before World War I, but work did not commence until 1925. This meant the closure of the terminus stations at Ramsgate Town and Ramsgate Harbour, and the construction of a line skirting the northern edge of the town to link the two existing lines. New stations on the north-eastern and north-western fringes of the town, called Dumpton Park and Ramsgate respectively, replaced the existing stations in the town centre and at the <b>harbour.</b> <b>Construction</b> work on the new line involved over 700men moving [...] of chalk, at a cost of approximately £500,000 (£ in [...] ).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>construction</b> of the <b>harbour</b> was {{proposed}} by the British who ruled the Gold Coast before its independence. An old fishing village called Torman was the proposed site for the <b>harbour's</b> <b>construction.</b> The rapid industrialization that followed Ghana's independence led to the town adopting the name Tema {{from that of the}} fishing village. After independence, Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah, begun the <b>construction</b> of the <b>harbour</b> in the 1950s [...] and commissioned it in 1962.|$|R
