Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance.

2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic physical {{area of the}} port and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner valve seat diameter, the outer valve head diameter, the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different <b>flow</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 7 th March 2018. <b>Flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> of intake valves and port {{combinations}} were determined experimentally for a compressed nitrogen engine under steady-state and dynamic flow conditions for inlet pressures up to 3. 2 MPa. Variable valve timing was {{combined with an}} indexed parked piston cylinder unit for testing valve flows at different cylinder volumes whilst maintaining realistic in-cylinder transient pressure profiles by simply using a fixed area outlet orifice. A one-dimensional modelling approach describing three-dimensional valve flow characteristics has been developed {{by the use of}} variable <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> that take into account the propagation of flow jets and their boundaries as a function of downstream/upstream pressure ratios. The results obtained for the dynamic flow cases were compared with steadystate results for the cylinder to inlet port pressure ratios ranges from 0. 18 to 0. 83. The deviation of <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> for both cases is discussed using pulsatile flow theory. The key findings include: 1. For a given valve lift, the steady-state <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> fall by up to 21 percent with increasing cylinder/manifold pressure ratios within the measured range given above; 2. Transient <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> deviated from those measured for the steady-state flow as the valve lift increases beyond a critical value of approximately 0. 5 mm. The deviation can be due to the insufficient time of the development of steady state boundary layers, which can be quantified by the instantaneous Womersley number defined by using the transient hydraulic diameter. We show {{that it is possible to}} predict deviations of the transient valve flow from the steady-state measurements alone...|$|R

Experimental results of azimuthal anisotropies {{by means of the}} two- and four-particle cumulants are generally well reproduced by the model including both parton cascade and hadronic rescatterings. Event-by-event treatments of the harmonic <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> v_n (for n = 2, 3 and 4) are performed, in which event distributions of v_n for different orders are consistent with Gaussian shapes over all centrality bins. Systematic studies on centrality, transverse momentum (p_T) and pseudo-rapidity (η) dependencies of anisotropic flows and quantitative estimations of the flow fluctuations are presented. The p_T and η dependencies of absolute fluctuations for both v_ 2 and v_ 3 follow similar trends as their <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Relative fluctuation of triangular flow v_ 3 is slightly centrality-dependent, which is quite different from that of elliptic flow v_ 2. It is observed that parton cascade has a large effect on the flow fluctuations, but hadronic scatterings make little contribution to the flow fluctuations, which indicates flow fluctuations are mainly modified during partonic evolution stage.

While the <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> v_ 2, v_ 3, v_ 4 and v_ 5 are reasonably described in comparison to the data from the ALICE Collaboration for different centralities within the default setting, no essential sensitivity is found with respect to the initial size of spatial fluctuations even for very central collisions where the <b>flow</b> <b>coefficients</b> are dominated by the size of initial state fluctuations. We attribute this lack of sensitivity partly to the low interaction rate of the degrees-of-freedom in this very early phase of order ∼ 0. 3 fm/c which is also in common with the weakly interacting color glass condensate (CGC) or glasma approach.
