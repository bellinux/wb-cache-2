5|$|As {{chair of}} Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts {{like those of}} this project ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E

She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match.

5|$|In an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> air quality, {{the city}} placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited {{the use of}} commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E

The Suzuka Circuit underwent a minor circuit change ahead of the Grand Prix.

5|$|D'Oliveira {{was aware}} of the {{political}} discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 not out and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.|$|E
