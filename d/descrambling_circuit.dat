40|$|A new two octaves {{bandwidth}} balun {{is presented}} in the paper, which has a bandwidth of 3 - 13 GHz with a very compact size, - 10 dB input reflection coefficient, low ohmic loss and large common mode suppression. A new descrambler circuit for the 2 - 13 GHz Eleven feed has been designed by using the new baluns, reducing from 4 twin-wire ports to 2 single-ended ports, one per polarization. The reflection coefficient of the whole Eleven antenna with the new <b>descrambling</b> <b>circuit</b> is below - 8 dB over the frequency range of 3 - 13 GHz. Further improvement of the bandwidth of the new balun will be emphasized in the future work...|$|E
