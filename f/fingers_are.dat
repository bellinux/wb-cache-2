5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{the cane}} toad is dry and warty. It has {{distinct}} ridges above the eyes, which run down the snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> free of webbing.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the tenets}} of right hand {{technique}} in melody playing is strict alternation of i & m. That is, no right hand <b>finger</b> should <b>be</b> used twice in a row (excluding the thumb). The a <b>finger</b> <b>is</b> occasionally used if i-m alternation creates an awkward string-crossing in the right hand. Otherwise, the default is strict alternation of i & m. Where the a <b>finger</b> <b>is</b> used, i-a or a-m <b>fingering</b> <b>is</b> preferred to m-a, due to the physical constraints of the hand.|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} had {{a prolonged}} genesis. Ingres agonised over the pose and made several preparatory sketches. The final work faithfully captures the sitter's character, conveying both a restless energy and imposing bulk. It is an unflinchingly realistic depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning hair of an overweight man who yet maintains his resolve and determination. He sits in three-quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right, his <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> pronounced and highly detailed, while the polish {{of his chair}} reflects light from an unseen window.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
25|$|The wing {{included}} three clawed fingers; however, unlike in some more primitive theropods, the longest two <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> not separate, but were bound {{together by the}} skin and other tissue forming the wing, so Anchiornis was functionally two-fingered. These bound <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into a post-patagium, or flap of skin and other tissues that helped support the bases of the main wing feathers. Like the toes, the skin around {{the bottom of the}} <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> covered in tiny, rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the <b>finger</b> bones <b>was</b> twice as thick as the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> straight and smooth without any major creases at the joints. Scales and skin around the <b>fingers</b> <b>is</b> very rarely preserved in fossils of early pennaraptorans, the only notable exceptions being Anchiornis and Caudipteryx, which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings.|$|R
40|$|Trigger <b>finger</b> <b>is</b> a {{disorder}} that presents with a blocking feeling and pain during finger movements. This condition more commonly {{occurs in the}} 2 nd finger with involvement of multiple digits being extremely rare. There are very few known cases in which trigger <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> developed in all ten fingers. Here, an unusual case of ten-digit <b>finger</b> trigger <b>is</b> presented. A 44 -year-old female housewife visited our clinic with painful blocking feeling in her hand. Her examination was compatible with trigger <b>finger.</b> Her hands <b>were</b> operated on in different sessions and A 1 pulleys of all <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> released.

5|$|After {{a tour of}} the home, {{the girls}} leave the {{watermelon}} in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's head, which flies in the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The other girls also begin to encounter other supernatural traps throughout the house. The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. These attacks cause the girls to try to escape the house. As soon as Gorgeous walks out the door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but only find Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girl's spirits up as the girls hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.|$|E
5|$|Rice is {{the staple}} diet, while fish is an {{integral}} component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut and spices are used extensively in South Indian cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes comprising rice, legumes and lentils. Its distinct aroma and flavour is achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices including curry leaves, mustard seeds, coriander, ginger, garlic, chili, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rosewater. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. Idli, dosa, uthappam, appam, pongal and paniyaram are popular dishes for breakfast. Rice is served with sambar, rasam and poriyal for lunch. Andhra cuisine is characterised by pickles and spicy curries. Chettinad cuisine is famous for non-vegetarian items and Hyderabadi cuisine is popular for its biryani.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{framework}} for [...] "classical" [...] palmistry (the most widely taught and practiced tradition) {{is rooted in}} Greek mythology. Each area of the palm and <b>fingers</b> <b>is</b> related to a god or goddess, and the features of that area indicate {{the nature of the}} corresponding aspect of the subject. For example, the ring <b>finger</b> <b>is</b> associated with the Greek god Apollo; characteristics of the ring <b>finger</b> <b>are</b> tied to the subject's dealings with art, music, aesthetics, fame, wealth, and harmony.|$|R

40|$|Patients with lesions of {{the left}} {{posterior}} parietal cortex commonly fail in identifying their fingers, a condition known as <b>finger</b> agnosia, yet <b>are</b> relatively unimpaired in sensation and skilled action. Such dissociations have traditionally been interpreted as evidence that structural body representations (BSR), such as the body structural description, are distinct from sensorimotor representations, such as the body schema. We investigated whether performance on tasks commonly used to assess <b>finger</b> agnosia <b>is</b> modulated by changes in hand posture. We used the ‘in between’ test in which participants estimate the number of unstimulated fingers between two touched fingers or a localization task in which participants judge which two <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> stimulated. Across blocks, the <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> placed in three levels of splay. Judged <b>finger</b> numerosity <b>was</b> analysed, in Exp. 1 by direct report and in Exp. 2 as {{the actual number of}} fingers between the fingers named. In both experiments, judgments were greater when non-adjacent stimulated <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> positioned far apart compared to when they were close together or touching, whereas judgements were unaltered when adjacent <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> stimulated.
