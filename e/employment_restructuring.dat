Our main finding is that in Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland a union wage premium is generally associated with <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> while in Hungary it is mostly concentrated in old firms that did not restructure employment in transition. We also show that <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> shapes the impact of unions on skill wage differentials differently in each country and that industry and firm level agreements may protect different skill groups...|$|E

Wage behavior is modeled in regional labor markets as an outcome of the speed of transition examining <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> in labor demand. The local short-term unemployment (excessive layoffs) rate elasticity of pay is estimated as − 0.29 and the local annual hiring rate elasticity of pay as + 0.75, controlling for individual characteristics and selection, amongst other factors. While individual characteristics determine participation rates and where one is on the wage distribution within regions, <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> accounts for most of the mean earning disparities across regions.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} and intersection between three employment developments of the past decade: the restructuring of employment, notably the growth in non-standard employment forms, the implementation of affirmative action and equal employment opportunity legislation, {{and the development of}} enterprise based decentralised bargaining. The central issue investigated is whether the employment conditions of women workers have been enhanced, unaffected or regressed by these developments. Of particular interest is whether enterprise bargaining and <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> are compatible with the implementation of equal-employment-opportunity-based employment conditions for women workers. The article argues that <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> and enterprise bargaining are unlikely to realise the goals associated with equal employment opportunity legislation. Indeed, many women workers will find it difficult to retain existing employment conditions. The likely impact of the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996 on the employment conditions of women workers is examined and found to offer nothing which will assist women workers to maintain standards of employment...|$|E
30|$|The Polish {{labor market}} in early {{transition}} was inhibited {{by the lack}} of inter-regional worker and job flows and intra-region differences in the pace of <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring.</b> Yet, these legacies of planning have allowed this research to study the importance of regional labor demand dynamics on earnings, as outlined in Aghion and Blanchard (1994), in an environment far less complex than that observed in mature market economies. While individual characteristics are clearly important for determining labor force participation rates and where one is on the wage distribution within regions, differences in mean wage across regions are clearly dictated by the pace of regional <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring.</b> In other words, differences in expected pay across regions are explained more by the pace of structural change in labor demand and less by labor supply considerations. It is found that structural change in employment has a first order effect on wages in a labor market in early transition. The importance of an unemployment benefits and good infrastructure for the private sector cannot be underestimated for an efficient worker reallocation path.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT ▪ The {{literature}} {{on the impact of}} new competitive forces on ‘traditional ’ industries in Europe tends to emphasize a rather unidirectional line of development. Concentration of capital will pave the way for structural adaptation leading to rationalization and redundancies. In contrast, this cross-national study of the Austrian and Danish banking industries, which have very much in common in terms of their contextual characteristics, indicates rather diverse approaches to pressures for change. Even though competitive pressures are similar, differences in <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> and flexibility prevail between the two national sectors...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of systemic change growing flows of foreign direct investments (FDI) have been perceived as {{an important source of}} capital, technology and <b>employment</b> for <b>restructuring</b> regional economies of Central-Eastern Europe (CEE).

This political economy model asks for the incentives of governments to privatize or restructure a state-owned firm. Different government types are compared to identify the political and institutional determinants of privatization. Under privatization, governments commit not to in influence the profit-maximizing employment choice by private investors. With respect to the social optimum, both voter-oriented and egoistic governments can have inefficiently high incentives to privatize. When this is the case, outside pressure to privatize is detrimental. An improving institutional environment reduces these inefficiencies.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of rapid {{structural}} adjustment and the onslaught of neoliberal policies, this paper explores the varied trajectories and processes of <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> in 'postcommunist' East-Central Europe. I first examine some of the comparative dimensions of employment and labour-market change in the region. The differential links between uneven employment loss and unemployment are explored to highlight the diverse national experiences of labour restructuring. I {{then go on to}} assess the links between <b>employment</b> <b>restructuring</b> and increasing nonparticipation in the labour market, again highlighting the importance of national differences which belie neoliberal notions of a unidimensional transition to capitalist employment relations. Having established the severity of the 'employment shocks' across East-Central Europe, I then go on to examine the links between labour-market restructuring and emergent social inequality since 1989. The polarisation of employment opportunities and constraints provides a context for discussing the development of household economic practices that lie outside the 'formal', emergent capitalist economy. Through an exploration of a household data set for Bulgaria I examine the ways in which households in different labour-market positions have developed 'strategies' that involve economic activities constituted outside of formal capitalist, market relations. On the basis of this analysis I argue that a theoretical space becomes opened, through which it is possible to situate household economic practices not solely as 'responses' to the austerity of transition, but as constitutive of alternative sites of economic relations with their own autonomies and histories. ...|$|E
