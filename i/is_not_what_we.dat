25|$|Nothing within {{quantum theory}} itself {{requires}} each possibility within a wave function to complement a mental state. As {{all physical states}} (i.e. brain states) are quantum states, their associated mental states should be also. Nonetheless, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> experience within physical reality. Albert and Loewer argue that the mind must be intrinsically different than the physical reality as described by quantum theory. Thereby, they reject type-identity physicalism in favour of a non-reductive stance. However, Lockwood saves materialism through the notion of supervenience of the mental on the physical.|$|E
25|$|Once one accepts The Matrix as a {{generated}} {{reality of}} malicious machines invention {{then this is}} Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise {{can be found in}} Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. One can make a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} pronoun is that (at is {{an alternative}} form borrowed from Norse but can also be arrived at by contraction) for all persons and numbers, but may be left out Thare's no mony fowk (that) bides in that glen (There aren't many {{people who live in}} that glen). The anglicised forms wha, wham, whase 'who, whom, whose', and the older whilk 'which' are literary affectations; whilk is only used after a statement He said he'd tint it, whilk wis no whit we wantit tae hear (he said he'd lost it, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to hear". The possessive is formed by adding s or by using an appropriate pronoun The wifie that's hoose gat burnt (the woman whose house was burnt), the wumman that her dochter gat mairit (the woman whose daughter got married); the men that thair boat wis tint (the men whose boat was lost).|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{opening of the}} BS by Sir Edwin Cornwall, chairman of the London County Council, took place on 10 March 1906. Shortly after the line's opening, the London Evening News columnist [...] "Quex" [...] coined the abbreviated name [...] "Baker-loo", which quickly caught on and began to be used officially from July 1906, appearing on contemporary maps of the tube lines. The nickname was, however, deplored by The Railway Magazine, which complained: [...] "Some latitude is allowable, perhaps, to halfpenny papers, {{in the use of}} nicknames, but for a railway itself to adopt its gutter title, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> expect from a railway company. English railway officers have more dignity than to act in this manner." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

2500|$|A retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, {{the first}} {{creation}} of chief designer Walter de'Silva, {{was presented in}} 2006.

It is a car we can reference for another 25 years if we choose. Its status is assured." [...] He went on to state: “It is possible that we will one day create another supercar, but in my view a super-high-end machine <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> need right now." ...|$|E

[...] "I must do my mother the justice," [...] he resumed, [...] "I must do myself the justice, to say that our decision <b>was</b> <b>not</b> easy.

At the end of their school life, girls were either returned to their family or supporters (known as Friends) or apprenticed and supported until they could establish themselves.|$|R
2500|$|One {{response}} to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: [...] "No doubt we do instinctively prefer {{to help those who}} are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> usually do, but what we ought to do, {{and it is difficult to}} see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The FFRF {{filed suit}} against the IRS over the parish {{exemption}} that allows [...] "ministers of the gospel" [...] to claim part of their salary as an income-tax-free housing allowance. This was originally filed in 2009, in California, then subsequently dropped and re-filed in 2011, in Wisconsin, because of standing. In August 2012, a federal judge stated that the suit could go forward. In August 2013, the Justice Department argued that leaders of an atheist group may qualify for the parish exemption. Gaylor states [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are after," [...] going {{on to say that}} the government should not give religious groups any special treatment.|$|E

[...] He clarified by saying, [...] "My point to Keith Ellison... is the same point that I make to my own faith, and that is — you must stand up before things {{get out of control}} ...

50|$|The first flyby {{spacecraft}} {{image of}} Mars {{was taken from}} Mariner 4 on July 15, 1965, with a camera system designed by NASA/JPL. It used a video camera tube followed by a digitizer, rather than a mosaic of solid state sensor elements, so it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> usually define as a digital camera, but it produced a digital image that was stored on tape for later slow transmission back to Earth.|$|R
2500|$|Historian Lucian Boia {{highlights}} {{the clash between}} such a vision and that of a patriotic, liberal and congenial Gheorghiu-Dej, retrospectively advanced in the 1990s {{by some of the}} leader's collaborators, among them Alexandru Bârlădeanu, Silviu Brucan and Ion Gheorghe Maurer. Boia writes: [...] "In between Bârlădeanu and Tismăneanu, may we be allowed to prefer the latter's interpretation. [...] oblivion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> owe , but condemnation, be it moral and posthumous." [...] Vladimir Tismăneanu's reflections on a self-legitimizing, [...] "Byzantine", discourse in Romanian communism, Ioan Stanomir notes, were also being applied by Tismăneanu to the post-Revolution President of Romania, former Communist Party activist and PSD leader Ion Iliescu, who, both argued, did not represent an anti-communist social democracy, but a partial return to Gheorghiu-Dej's legacy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities {{does not come}} from a priori or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations [...] One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the case}} was resolved, control of the Legacy of Kain {{trademark}} belonged to Crystal Dynamics, and Kain II was either canceled or superseded when Shifter became Soul Reaver. Though Crystal Dynamics staff who worked on Soul Reaver {{declined to comment on}} the discovery, Dyack had previously affirmed that [...] " [...] tried to take it over". He said that [...] "many people ask us if we like the direction they have gone in but it is so alien to what we created it is pointless to answer now. We understand that some people love the Soul Reaver series and we think that is great. However, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would ever have done". In a 2008 interview, he elaborated his sentiment that [...] "if you look at Legacy of Kain where it is right now -- so diluted, so dysfunctional -- as a property itself, it's pretty much gone in a completely different direction than we would have ever taken it. [...] Even if the developer's good, and I think Crystal Dynamics is not a bad developer, you get this dilution of the content, because the original author is gone".|$|E

40|$|Some {{forms of}} {{analytic}} reconstructivism take natural language (and common sense at large) to be ontologically opaque: ordinary sentences must be suitably rewritten or paraphrased before questions of ontological commitment may be raised. Other forms of reconstructivism take {{the commitment of}} ordinary language at face value, but regard it as metaphysically misleading: common-sense objects exist, but they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> normally think they are.
