The low female participation in labour workforce has motivated this study to be conducted. It aimed to provide insight to the employers on female employees special needs and their readiness to embrace <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> if the resources were made available to them. “Readiness” to embrace <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangement</b> was not previously studied in the <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> field, hence a considerable amount of {{attention has been paid to}} construct the theoretical framework. An instrument is developed based on a critical review of Person-Environment (PE) fit theory that is able to explain the readiness of female employees depending on the situation surroundings them. Thus, this study postulates into three microsystems that are family (family responsibility, perceived benefits), work (career advancement, company policy), and community (supportive workplace) in PE fit theory that creates demands and resources (readiness on <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements).</b> The integrated approach has explained how the independent variables family responsibility, perceived benefits, career advancement, company policy impact on the readiness on <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> and the mediating role of supportive workplace. The results shown that hypothesised relationships were partially supported, i. e family responsibility and perceived benefits was positively related to readiness to embrace <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements.</b> Besides, supportive workplace mediated the relationship between perceived benefits and company policy in relation to readiness to embrace <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements.</b> These findings have also demonstrated that women with different experience have different demands in <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements.</b> Findings have shown that 60 percent of the respondents were ready to embrace <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> except for part time work options.

40|$|In {{order to}} advance gender {{equality}} in the workplace, <b>flexible</b> work <b>arrangements</b> must be available to and actively supported for both genders, according to this report. Summary The Power of Flexibility is the fifth {{in a series of}} landmark gender parity surveys by global management consulting firm Bain & Company and Chief Executive Women, Australia’s pre-eminent organisation of 360 –senior women leaders. Over 1000 members of the Australian business, government and not-for-profit community responded to the survey about their use of <b>flexible</b> work <b>arrangements</b> and their perceptions of their organisations. In order to advance gender {{equality in the}} workplace, <b>flexible</b> work <b>arrangements</b> must be available to and actively supported for both genders. Currently less than 50 % of Australian organisations have a workplace flexibility policy and even when such policies exist, there are barriers to effective utilisation. The right culture and active support are fundamental to improving employees’ experience of flexible working. Male and female respondents to the latest Bain-Chief Executive Women Survey agreed that proof of the potential to progress one’s career, visible commitment by the CEO, leadership and colleagues, and respect for boundaries are the most important factors in their experience of flexible working. Where <b>flexible</b> <b>arrangements</b> are widely used, all employees are four times happier than in organisations with no flexible options. However <b>flexible</b> work <b>arrangements</b> are not driving advocacy or confidence for men, despite strong interest in their uptake. Bain and CEW have identified several key actions to normalise and accelerate the success of flexible working. Organisations must: 	 Actively encourage and role model the uptake of <b>flexible</b> work <b>arrangements</b> 	 Ensure <b>flexible</b> <b>arrangements</b> are supported and working successfully for both genders 	Create the right culture and support employee priorities of career progression, visible support from the CEO, leadership team and colleagues, and respect of boundaries 	Create clear policies around promotion and compensation when working flexibly 	Ensure technology and an agile work environment are in place and working wel...|$|R

Use of <b>flexible</b> staffing <b>arrangements</b> [...] including temporary help agency, short-term, on-call, regular part-time, and contract workers [...] is widespread and two-thirds of employers believe this use will increase in the near future. Traditional reasons concerning the need to accommodate fluctuations in workload or absences in staff are the most commonly cited reasons for using all types of <b>flexible</b> staffing <b>arrangements.</b> Many employers also use agency temporaries and part- time workers to screen candidates for regular positions. Finally, savings on benefits costs {{is an important factor}} determining employers' use of <b>flexible</b> staffing <b>arrangements.</b> Workers in <b>flexible</b> staffing <b>arrangements</b> typically are not covered by regulations governing benefits, and they typically do not receive key benefits, like pension benefits and health insurance, when these benefits are offered to regular full-time workers. flexible staffing, contingent work, part-time work, Houseman...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> and the gender pay gap is explored in this article, {{based on a}} study of <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> among Chartered Accountants in Britain. Individual interviews with 50 participants provided details on working patterns, flexibility policies and practices, and experiences of flexible working. The article considers whether gender-neutral discourses of flexible working succeed in encouraging more men and non-parents to use <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements,</b> thereby potentially reducing the gender pay gap. The study highlighted gendered patterns of take-up of flexible working. Women who worked flexibly or part time typically did so to combine working with caring commitments, in ways that damaged their career prospects. In contrast, men typically deferred working flexibly to a later stage when their career had progressed further. There was therefore a clear impact on current and future salary for women taking up <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements,</b> which was not equivalent for the men who did so.

50|$|Plenge Jakobsens {{project is}} socio-critical {{in the sense}} that he {{examines}} and discusses political, economical, cultural and social structures forming the foundation of modern life. Like the Situationists, he is interested in finding a meaningful art form capable of defining a place in the public space, while directly making use of everyday institutions. His project does not seek to cannibalize reality but to incorporate reality into the work itself. His work is radical exactly because it insists on the work’s real presence rather than interrogating the foundation of reality. For Plenge Jakobsen, art and reality are not separate spheres that can be temporarily forced together. Existing in the world, art represents one of the realities that constitute life.Henrik Plenge Jakobsens work can be described as a configuration of visual elements in spatial arrangements, often involving an additional element of action or performance. Many of his works combine sculptural elements and objects in a plastic display positioned between sculpture and installation. Differing from the theatrical and systemic, “total” form of classic installation art.

Stuzenegger and Levy Yeyati sustained {{that most of the}} empirical literature on exchange rate regimes were using the IMF de jure classification based on regime announced by the governments, despite the recognized inconsistencies between reported and actual policies in many cases. Many countries that in theory had a flexible exchange rate intervened in exchange markets so pervasively that in practice very little difference existed (in terms of observable performance) with countries that have explicit fixed exchange rate regimes. Conversely, periodic devaluations of pegs in inflation-prone countries were the result of the implementations of monetary policies that were inconsistent with fixed exchange rates and that made the effective regime resemble a <b>flexible</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Moreover, countries that appeared to behave according to the declared regime during tranquil times could be tempted to change their course of action once the regime was under stress. Thus, a very different picture of exchange rate regime choices might have appeared once the international context became more volatile.|$|E
50|$|Those linkspans {{designed}} originally for train ferries {{were therefore}} very restricting {{for the new}} general-purpose ferries. Dover, {{which was one of}} the earliest tidal rail ferry ports, continued to adopt the “precise fit” approach so that road vehicular ferries had to have the exact beam to fit a berth. Their bow and stern configuration also had to conform to fit with the guide fenders to allow the vessel to “nest” into them. At the bow it was necessary to fit a “moustache” which is a steel structure projecting from the stem. Such ships have neither a support ledge nor drawbridge ramps: the link across the gap between ship and linkspan is bridged by flaps about 2 - 2.5 m long. When stowed these flaps stow vertically to the end of the linkspan and in so doing prevent a ramped vessel lowering its ramp. Most of the other tidal rail-ferry ports initially adopted this arrangement in the English Channel, North Sea and Irish Sea routes but have now moved away to the more <b>flexible</b> <b>arrangement</b> described below. Dover/Calais route, one of the busiest in the world, still require that vessels using these ports are configured to suit the restraints of each berth, in doing so this limits them from being used in service elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is {{to shed light on}} {{possible}} reasons for the stagnation in the participation rate of women in the Malaysian workforce by focusing on the phenomenon of <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements.</b> This is researched {{in the context of the}} possibility of <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> helping women achieve work-life balance and how such work affects their well-being. Using a mixed method approach, the study addresses three main questions:- are Malaysian women interested in <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements?</b> would <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> be useful in bringing more women into the labour force? and what impacts do <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> have on their well-being? The study was conducted in the Klang Valley, which has a total population of over seven million people and is the heartland of Malaysia's industry and commerce. It employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative approach, self-administered questionnaires were distributed to women employees working in seven organisations which have <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> and seven organisations with fixed working arrangements. A random sample of 415 female employees from 14 selected organisations in the services sector were identified. To complement the statistical data, 30 women were interviewed. Findings from the logistic regression analysis revealed that <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> at the workplace are preferred by women who are more educated, earning a higher income and are at the higher end of the occupational status. It further revealed that <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> will encourage more women to work in paid labour since they have a better work-life balance and more empowerment. The information gathered from the qualitative interviews concerned women’s wellbeing in terms of work-life balance, empowerment and lifestyles. While most of the women experienced work-life balance barriers, some common threads and themes revealed that <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> will be a good option towards achieving work-life balance and had a positive effect on women’s well-being in terms of work-life balance and household empowerment. The qualitative interviews showed that workplace flexibility can improve the working women’s work-life balance, especially among married women with young children and hence, encourage women to participate in paid labour. In adopting a combination of theoretical approaches, it is argued that there is a greater tendency for Malaysian married women to exit the labour force after having children compared to most other countries and this is primarily due to their caring responsibilities, lack of an enabling environment and the cultural and social factors particular to Malaysia. The study found that <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> are very varied in type and cannot be treated as a single, comprehensive package which might be suitable for all women. Further, the implementation of <b>flexible</b> working <b>arrangements</b> at the workplace would not be alone sufficient to bring in more women into the labour force...|$|R
