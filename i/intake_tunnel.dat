50|$|The Ratle Hydroelectric Plant is a run-of-the-river {{hydroelectric}} power station currently under construction on the Chenab River, downstream of the village of Ratle in Doda district of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The project includes a 133 m tall gravity dam and two power stations adjacent to one another. Water from the dam will be diverted through four <b>intake</b> <b>tunnels</b> about 400 m southwest to the power stations. The main power station will contain four 205 MW Francis turbines and the auxiliary power station will contain one 30 MW Francis turbine. The installed capacity of both power stations will be 850 MW. On 25 June 2013, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone for the dam. The project {{is expected to be}} complete in February 2018.

50|$|Lafitte {{declared}} his final verdict on February 12, 2007, {{in which he}} upheld some minor objections of Pakistan, declaring that pondage capacity be reduced by 13.5%, height of dam structure be reduced by 1.5 meter and power <b>intake</b> <b>tunnels</b> be raised by 3 meters, thereby limiting some flow control capabilities of the earlier design. However he rejected Pakistani objections on height and gated control of spillway declaring these conformed to engineering norms of the day. India had already offered Pakistan similar minor adjustments for it to drop its objection. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 divided the Indus river — into which the Chenab flows — {{between the two countries}} and bars India from interfering with the flow into Pakistan while allowing it to generate electricity. However the key issue that any dam constructed by India should be strictly run of the river was rejected. Pakistan government expressed its disappointment at the final outcome. Both parties (India and Pakistan) have already agreed that they will abide by the final verdict.|$|R

50|$|The mussel is also {{notorious for}} {{clogging}} water pipes used by industrial complexes and fouling marine equipment. It has fouled the <b>intake</b> condenser <b>tunnels</b> of {{power plants in}} India and Florida and the navigational buoys in China where their biomass has grown to up to 72 kg/m2. Chlorination of pipes and using high velocity water was shown to decrease or remove P. viridis population. However, the mussel excretes ammonia which reacts with the chlorine to form chloramine, a weaker disinfectant than chlorine. Ammonia can also accelerate the corrosion of copper-based alloys found in the water pipes. Heat treatment is also being considered {{as an alternative to}} chlorination due to the safety and environmental concerns raised by the latter method.|$|R
50|$|The <b>intake</b> then <b>tunnels</b> {{water through}} a {{pipeline}} (penstock) to the powerhouse building containing a turbine. In mountainous areas, {{access to the}} route of the penstock may provide considerable challenges. If the water source and turbine are far apart, the construction of the penstock may be the largest part of the costs of construction. At the turbine, a controlling valve is installed to regulate the flow and the speed of the turbine. The turbine converts the flow and pressure of the water to mechanical energy; the water emerging from the turbine returns to the natural watercourse along a tailrace channel. The turbine turns a generator, which is then connected to electrical loads; this might be directly connected to the power system of a single building in very small installations, or may be connected to a community distribution system for several homes or buildings.|$|R

50|$|The tunnel {{starts at}} Asikkalanselkä in Lake Päijänne, {{which is the}} second largest lake in Finland, with an area of 1,080 square kilometres.

The tunnel ends at the Silvola reservoir in Vantaa in the Greater Helsinki area. From the reservoir covering 0.5 square kilometres, water is pumped to water treatment plants in Pitkäkoski and Vanhakaupunki. Since the constant low temperature in the deep tunnel ensures high quality during transport, only minimal processing is required before use.|$|R

40|$|Water flow is an {{important}} characteristic determining the settlement and growth of macroinvertebrates in the marine environment. Intake systems of coastal power stations offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study the effect of water flow on benthic organisms under field conditions. The cooling water intake system of a tropical coastal power station is used as an experimental facility to study the effect of flow on the recruitment and growth of three mussel species, viz, Brachidontes variabilis, B. striatulus, and Modiolus philippinarum. The study was prompted by earlier observation that these mussels were numerically abundant in the biofouling community present inside the seawater <b>intake</b> <b>tunnel</b> of the power station, even though their occurrence in the benthic community in the coastal waters outside was only nominal. Recruitment data showed that the three mussel species very successfully colonised surfaces exposed to the intake mouth (characterised by relatively high flow) of the power station. Significant difference was observed in the recruitment recorded at the intake point and the ambient environment outside. Under high flow condition, the growth rates of all the three mussel species were uniformly enhanced. It is argued that recruitment of the different species is related to the number of byssus threads produced by each mussel and the strength of the byssus threads. The results indicate that byssus number and byssus strength of the mussels are important criteria that decide successful colonization and establishment in high flow environment...|$|E

40|$|Reservoir {{dredging}} {{issues are}} important to {{extend the life of}} reservoir. The most effective and cost reduction way is to construct a tunnel to desilt the bottom sediment. Conventional technique is to construct a cofferdam to separate the water, construct the <b>intake</b> of <b>tunnel</b> inside and remove the cofferdam afterwards. In Taiwan, the ZengWen reservoir dredging project will install an Elephant-trunk Steel Pipe (ETSP) in the water to connect the desilting tunnel without building the cofferdam. Since the installation is critical to the whole project, a 1 : 20 model was built to simulate the installation steps in a towing tank, i. e. launching, dragging, water injection, and sinking. To increase the construction safety, photogrammetry technic is adopted to record images during the simulation, compute its transformation parameters for dynamic analysis and reconstruct the 4 D animations. In this study, several Australis© coded targets are fixed on the surface of ETSP for auto-recognition and measurement. The cameras orientations are computed by space resection where the 3 D coordinates of coded targets are measured. Two approaches for motion parameters computation are proposed, i. e. performing 3 D conformal transformation from the coordinates of cameras and relative orientation computation by the orientation of single camera. Experimental results show the 3 D conformal transformation can achieve sub-mm simulation results, and relative orientation computation shows the flexibility for dynamic motion analysis which is easier and more efficiency...|$|R
