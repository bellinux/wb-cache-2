2500|$|The {{most common}} use of swaging is to attach {{fittings}} to pipes or cables (also called wire ropes); the parts loosely fit together, and a mechanical or hydraulic tool compresses and deforms the fitting, creating a permanent joint. Pipe <b>flaring</b> <b>machines</b> are another example. [...] Flared pieces of pipe are sometimes known as [...] "swage nipples", [...] "pipe swages", or [...] "reducing nipples". In furniture, legs made from metal tubing (particularly in commercial furniture) are often swaged to improve strength {{where they come}} in contact with the ground, or casters.|$|R
40|$|YesIn this paper, a machine-learning-based {{system that}} could provide {{automated}} short-term solar flare prediction is presented. This system accepts two sets of inputs: McIntosh classification of sunspot groups and solar cycle data. In order to establish a correlation between solar flares and sunspot groups, the system explores the publicly available solar catalogues from the National Geophysical Data Center to associate sunspots with their corresponding flares based on their timing and NOAA numbers. The McIntosh classification for every relevant sunspot is extracted and converted to a numerical format that is suitable for machine learning algorithms. Using this system we aim to predict whether a certain sunspot class {{at a certain time}} is likely to produce a significant flare within six hours time and if so whether this flare {{is going to be an}} X or M <b>flare.</b> <b>Machine</b> learning algorithms such as Cascade-Correlation Neural Networks (CCNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) are optimised and then compared to determine the learning algorithm that would provide the best prediction performance. It is concluded that SVMs provide the best performance for predicting whether a McIntosh classified sunspot group is going to flare or not but CCNNs are more capable of predicting the class of the flare to erupt. A hybrid system that combines a SVM and a CCNN is suggested for future use. EPSR...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} modeling, design, and {{fabrication}} of millimeter-wave quasi-integrated horn antennas {{consisting of a}} micromachined horn with an embedded detector and a small <b>flare</b> angle <b>machined</b> horn. The micromachined portion of the quasi-integrated millimeter-wave horns can be fabricated using low-cost, well-established techniques. To facilitate lower-cost fabrication of the machined section, this thesis explores the use of cir-cular machined sections. Circular sections are much cheaper to fabricate than the previously used rectangular machined sections. In order to predict the performance of circular sections, the mode matching method along with the generalized scattering matrix technique is used to model the quasi-integrated horn. The far-field pattern is predicted and designs of circular sections are created. The designed narrow flare angle circular sections were fabricated {{through the use of}} conventional and laser machining. Far-field patterns of six configurations of quasi-integrated horns were successfully obtained. These measurements indicate good agreement with the predictions of the modeling code. Explanations are offered for discrepancies between measuremen...|$|R
40|$|This group {{exhibition}} of rotating works showcases new and rarely exhibited pieces by Laure Prouvost, Dan Rees, Simon Mathers, Dennis Oppenheim and others. Laure Prouvost’s new tapestry Swallow me, From Italy to Flander, a tapestry (2015) unites {{her use of}} collage and scenography to create an intricately woven visual narrative. The painting Woman Upsidedown (2011) depicts a naked woman hanging {{in the middle of}} an unclear landscape accompanied by an audio track in which her seductively broken English recounts a story of desire accompanied by a song by Elton John. Simon Mathers’ paintings are characterised by simplicity of form and gesture. Depicting horses, cars and anonymous figures, his almost monochromatic paintings draw out gestural abstractions that place emphasis on the quality of the line. The exhibition also includes the new sculptures Lamps (2015). Dan Rees’ on-going series Shaker Peg Paintings consist of monochromatic canvases hung on Shaker peg rails. Presented as individual elements, sequences or as an entire show, the abstract paintings can exist both on their own or as sculptural configurations in which each panel ties into the next. Dennis Oppenheim was a pioneer of new sculptural thinking, using fireworks, <b>flares</b> and <b>machines</b> as sculptural materials. Drawing for Second Sight for a Staircase (From The Fireworks Series) (1981) illustrates his working process and is a key example of how he used drawing within his practice to further expand his concepts...|$|R
40|$|Background In low-income {{and middle-income}} countries, {{invasive}} mechanical ventilation {{is often not}} available for children at risk of death from respiratory failure. We aimed to determine if continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a form of non-invasive ventilation, decreases all-cause mortality in children with undifferentiated respiratory distress in Ghana. Methods This open-label, cluster, crossover trial was done in two Ghanaian non-tertiary hospitals where invasive mechanical ventilation is not routinely available. Eligible participants were children aged from 1 month to 5 years with a respiratory {{rate of more than}} 50 breaths per min in children 1 – 12 months old, or more than 40 breaths per min in children older than 12 months, and use of accessory muscles or nasal <b>flaring.</b> CPAP <b>machines</b> were allocated to one hospital during each study block, while the other hospital served as the control site. The initial intervention site was randomly chosen using a coin toss. 5 cm of water pressure was delivered via CPAP nasal prongs. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality rate at 2 weeks after enrolment in patients for whom data were available after 2 weeks. We also did post-hoc regression analysis and subgroup analysis of children by malaria status, oxygen saturation, and age. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01839474. Findings Between Jan 20, 2014, and Dec 5, 2015, 2200 children were enrolled: 1025 at the intervention site and 1175 at the control site.

50|$|JIC {{fittings}}, {{defined by}} the SAE J514 and MIL-F-18866 standards, are a type of <b>flare</b> fitting <b>machined</b> with a 37-degree flare seating surface. JIC (Joint Industry Council) fittings are widely used in fuel delivery and fluid power applications, especially where high pressure (up to 10,000 psi) is involved. The SAE J514 standard replaces the MS16142 military specification, although some tooling is still listed under MS16142. JIC fittings are dimensionally identical to AN (Army-Navy) fittings, but are produced to less exacting tolerances and are generally less costly. SAE 45-degree flare fittings are similar in appearance, but are not interchangeable, though dash sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 16 share the same thread size. Some couplings may have dual machined seats for both 37-degree and 45-degree flare seats.Komatsu and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) fittings have flare ends similar to JIC fittings. Komatsu and JIS both use a 30-degree flare seating surface. The only difference is Komatsu uses milimeter thread sizes while JIS use a BSP (British Standard Pipe) thread. JIC fitting systems have three components that make a tubing assembly: fitting, flare nut, and sleeve. As with other flared connection systems, the seal is achieved through metal-to-metal contact between the finished surface of the fitting nose and the inside diameter of the flared tubing. The sleeve is used to evenly distribute the compressive forces of the flare nut to the flared end of the tube. Materials commonly used to fabricate JIC fittings include forged carbon steel, forged stainless steel, forged brass, machined brass, Monel and nickel-copper alloys.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{engineering}} {{plants have}} varieties of processes, where individual process flows {{are dependent on}} previous processes and operated by default or manual settings. Initial raw material feeds may fluctuate over time, possibly resulting in inefficient use of energy resources. This paper describes a study on power generation capabilities of such a plant. Off-gasses from various steel production processes are utilized in boilers; producing steam for the Works. Excess steam is used for power generation. The Works experienced unstable power generation, due to fluctuations in available steam. This resulted in regular turbine trips, causing power generation losses, additional gas <b>flaring</b> and reducing <b>machine</b> life expectancy. To address this problem; off-gas and steam production data were analyzed over three months. A control approach was set up, where the algorithm’s objective was optimum power generation, for a 5 MW and 30 MW turbine. Results showed potential power generation increase over 26 % was possible, still not eliminating trips. The algorithm incorporated the possibility of burning natural gas in a boiler, when needed. This scenario could have led to no trips and an increased generation capacity of over 48 %. Additional power generation’s financial impact overcame {{the high cost of}} utilizing natural gas for power generation purposes[URL]...|$|R
500|$|The Germans {{knew the}} {{invasion}} was imminent {{if not the}} exact location; Major Schmidt, {{in command of the}} bridges, had been told that they were {{one of the most critical}} points in Normandy. The defenders however were not on full alert and only two sentries were on duty when the gliders landed. The sound of a gunshot alerted the two sentries on the canal bridge. As Brotheridge's platoon attacked, one ran off shouting [...] "paratroops" [...] while the second fired a flare gun to alert nearby defenders. Brotheridge shot him while other members of his platoon cleared the trenches and pillbox with grenades. Alerted by the <b>flare,</b> the German <b>machine</b> gunners opened fire at the men on the bridge, wounding Brotheridge as he threw a grenade. The grenade silenced one of the machine gun positions and another was taken out by Bren gun fire. Number One Platoon crossed the bridge to take up a defensive position on the west bank. The Royal Engineers from number one glider searched for explosive charges and cut the fuse wires when they found any. Smith's platoon crossed the bridge next, exchanging fire with the German defenders, whereupon Smith was wounded by a grenade. Using grenades and sub-machine gun fire, the platoons cleared the trenches and bunkers. By 00:21 German resistance on the west bank of the canal bridge was over. Checking the area, the men of Brotheridge's platoon now realised that their leader was wounded. He failed to recover and soon died of his wounds, becoming the first Allied soldier killed by enemy action during the invasion. On the east bank, Wood's platoon cleared the trenches and bunkers with little opposition. Woods was hit in the leg by machine-gun fire as he ordered the platoon to storm the German defences. All three platoon commanders at the canal bridge were now either dead or wounded.|$|R

Findings: Between Jan 20, 2014, and Dec 5, 2015, 2200 children were enrolled: 1025 at the intervention site and 1175 at the control site. Final analysis included 1021 patients in the CPAP group and 1160 patients in the control group. 2 weeks after enrolment, 26 (3 %) of 1021 patients in the CPAP group, and 44 (4 %) of 1160 patients in the control group, had died (relative risk [RR] of mortality 0 · 67, 95 % CI 0 · 42 – 1 · 08; p= 0 · 11). In children younger than 1 year, all-cause mortality was ten (3 %) of 374 patients in the CPAP group, and 24 (7 %) of 359 patients in the control group (RR 0 · 40, 0 · 19 – 0 · 82; p= 0 · 01). After adjustment for study site, time, and clinically important variables, the odds ratio for 2 -week mortality in the CPAP group versus the control group was 0 · 4 in children aged up to 6 months, 0 · 5 for children aged 12 months, 0 · 7 for children aged 24 months, and 1 · 0 for those aged 36 months. 28 patients (3 %) in the CPAP group and 24 patients (2 %) in the control group had CPAP-related adverse events, such as vomiting, aspiration, and nasal, skin, or eye trauma. No serious adverse events were observed. Interpretation: In the unadjusted analysis the use of CPAP did not decrease all-cause 2 -week mortality in children 1 month to 5 years of age with undifferentiated respiratory distress. After adjustment for study site, time, and clinically important variables, 2 -week mortality in the CPAP group versus the control group was significantly decreased in children 1 year of age and younger. CPAP is safe and improves respiratory rate in a non-tertiary setting in a lower-middle-income country. Funding: General Electric Foundation...|$|R
