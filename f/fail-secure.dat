5000|$|<b>Fail-secure</b> systems {{maintain}} {{maximum security}} {{when they can}} not operate. For example, while fail-safe electronic doors unlock during power failures, <b>fail-secure</b> ones will lock, keeping an area secure.|$|E
50|$|Fail-safe and <b>fail-secure</b> are {{distinct}} concepts. Fail-safe {{means that a}} device will not endanger lives or property when it fails. <b>Fail-secure,</b> also called fail-closed, means that access or data will not fall {{into the wrong hands}} in a security failure. Sometimes the approaches suggest opposite solutions. For example, if a building catches fire, fail-safe systems would unlock doors to ensure quick escape and allow firefighters inside, while <b>fail-secure</b> would lock doors to prevent unauthorized access to the building.|$|E
50|$|Fail-safe - {{to protect}} people: The lock is {{released}} if power cuts off. <b>Fail-secure</b> (also known as non fail safe) - to protect property: The lock remains closed if power cuts off.This type of lock has a cylinder, {{similar to those}} found in conventional locks.The cylinder makes it possible for the lock to remain secure, even if the power supply is cut off.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{manufacturers}} of electric strikes, {{and there are}} many things that have to be considered when buying one, i.e., type of jamb, type of locking hardware, whether one requires <b>fail-secure</b> or fail-safe, length of latch, depth of jamb, voltage requirements and the length of the faceplate. In some cases it is a good option to choose a magnetic lock.|$|E
5000|$|A {{system that}} is {{designed}} to fail safe, or <b>fail-secure,</b> or fail gracefully, whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely, does so in a way that protects people, property, or data from injury, damage, intrusion, or disclosure. In computers, a program might fail-safe by executing a graceful exit (as opposed to an uncontrolled crash) in order to prevent data corruption after experiencing an error. A similar distinction is made between [...] "failing well" [...] and [...] "failing badly".|$|E
50|$|Motorized gates — In case {{of power}} outage the gate can be pushed open by hand with no crank or key required. However, as this would allow {{virtually}} anyone {{to go through}} the gate, a <b>fail-secure</b> design is used: In a power outage, the gate can only be opened by a hand crank that is usually kept in a safe area or under lock and key. When such a gate provides vehicle access to homes, a fail-safe design is used, where the door opens to allow fire department access.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fail-secure.</b> Also called fail-locked or non-fail safe. In this configuration, {{applying}} {{electric current}} to the strike will {{cause it to}} unlock. In this configuration, the strike would remain locked in a power failure, but typically the mechanical lock can still be used {{to open the door}} from the inside for egress from the secure side. These units can be powered by alternating current, which will cause the unit to buzz, or DC power, which offers silent operation, except for a [...] "click" [...] while the unit is powered.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric locking devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A <b>fail-secure</b> locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe locking devices are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|E
40|$|A {{system is}} said to be <b>fail-secure,</b> {{sometimes}} confused with fail-safe, if it maintains its security requirements even in the event of some faults. <b>Fail-secure</b> analyses are required by some validation schemes, such as some Common Criteria or NATO certifications. However, it is an aspect of security which as been overlooked by the community. This paper attempts to shed some light on the <b>fail-secure</b> field of study by: giving a definition of <b>fail-secure</b> as used in those certification schemes, and emphasizing the differences with fail-safe; and exhibiting a first feasibility draft of a <b>fail-secure</b> design analysis tool based on the Alloy model checker. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for deploying stronger, intelligent resilience mechanisms in mission-critical ATM networks over and above that offered by physical n-fold redundancy. We compare the challenges facing power and data network resilience and discuss disruptive threats to real-world operations. Using recorded live data from an ATM data network we argue our proposed architecture with deployable, distributed on-demand anomaly detection and monitoring modules provides enhanced <b>fail-secure</b> versus current fail-safe resilience...|$|E
40|$|Information {{security}} devices must preserve security properties {{even in the}} presence of faults. This in turn requires a rigorous evaluation of the system behaviours resulting from component failures, especially how such failures affect information flow. We introduce a compositional method of static analysis for <b>fail-secure</b> behaviour. Our method uses reachability matrices to identify potentially undesirable information flows based on the fault modes of the system 2 ̆ 7 s components...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{industrial}} {{control systems}} no longer operate in isolation, but use other networks (e. g., corporate networks and the Internet) to facilitate and improve business processes. The {{consequence of this}} development is the increased exposure to cyber threats. This paper surveys the latest methodologies and research for measuring and managing this risk. A dearth of industrial-control-system-specific security metrics {{has been identified as}} a barrier to implementing these methodologies. Consequently, an agenda for future research on industrial control system security metrics is outlined. The “functional assurance” concept is also introduced to deal with fail-safe and <b>fail-secure</b> industrial control system operations...|$|E
