It remains challenging due to {{the diversity of the}} cell or nanoparticle types, the arbitrary shapes, and the large numbers of cells or nanoparticles. The most existing methods are only capable of segmenting some specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> cells or nanoparticles. In this paper, we propose a more versatile approach that is capable of segmenting a variety of cells or nanoparticles. It consists of five parts: 1) automatic gradient image formation; 2) automatic threshold selection; 3) manual calibration of the threshold selection method <b>for</b> <b>each</b> specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> cell or nanoparticle images; 4) manual determination of the segmentation cases <b>for</b> <b>each</b> specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> cell or nanoparticle images; and 5) automatic quantification by iterative morphological erosion.

25|$|Elemental silicon {{is added}} to molten cast iron as {{ferrosilicon}} or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air.

Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon.

25|$|The term {{polymorphism}} {{refers to}} the ability of code (especially, functions or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or {{to the ability of}} different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow polymorphism generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with polymorphism, programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an associative array once, rather than once <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> element with which they plan to use it. For this reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of polymorphism generic programming. The type-theoretic foundations of polymorphism are closely related to those of abstraction, modularity and (in some cases) subtyping.|$|E
