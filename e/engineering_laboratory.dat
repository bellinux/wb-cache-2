40|$|Distance {{education}} {{has the ability}} to transcend distance and time, reaching students anywhere at any time, particularly those underrepresented in engineering. Engineering is a practice-oriented profession requiring an interweaving of scientific theory and applied hands-on activities. Despite the need for distance education in engineering, few studies have systematically investigated the impact of student achievement and attitude in distance <b>engineering</b> <b>laboratories.</b> This quasi-experimental research addressed that need by studying the cognitive and affective domains of achievement in <b>engineering</b> <b>laboratories</b> while employing computer-based and traditional oscilloscopes. The students from two courses, electrical engineering for nonmajors and electronic fundamentals, were randomly assigned into treatment and comparison groups. The students 2 ̆ 7 achievement and attitudes were gauged using assessment instruments and an attitudinal survey. These results were statistically analyzed and conclusions are discussed. The results suggested that computer-based instruments were viable in <b>engineering</b> <b>laboratories...</b>|$|R
