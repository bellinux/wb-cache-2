5|$|On 7 May 1965, the divider {{separating}} {{the left and}} right halves of XB-70A AV-1's <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> ramp broke off in flight and was ingested by all six engines, damaging them beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{behind the}} leading edge of the wing the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> had wing {{boundary}} layer ahead of it. Two thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging. Extensive wind tunnel testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.|$|E
25|$|The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F-15E Strike Eagle is an American {{all-weather}} multirole strike fighter {{derived from}} the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. The F-15E was designed in the 1980s for long-range, high speed interdiction without relying on escort or electronic-warfare aircraft. United States Air Force (USAF) F-15E Strike Eagles can be distinguished from other U.S. Eagle variants by darker aircraft camouflage and conformal fuel tanks mounted along the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> ramps.|$|E
25|$|By 1950, several design {{proposals}} for a supersonic interceptor were explored which included versions with swept wings, a tail-less delta wing (similar to the Dassault Mirage IV), side-body <b>engine</b> <b>intakes,</b> in-nose <b>engine</b> <b>intakes</b> (similar to the Mig-21), turbine engines and rocket engines, and combinations of several.|$|R

25|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{may also}} be used to increase fuel efficiency without increasing power. This is achieved by recovering waste energy in the exhaust and feeding it back into the <b>engine</b> <b>intake.</b> By using this otherwise wasted energy to increase the mass of air, it becomes easier to ensure that all fuel is burned before being vented {{at the start of the}} exhaust stage. The increased temperature from the higher pressure gives a higher Carnot efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the fusible core process is not limited just to the injection of thermoplastics, but with corresponding core alloys also to thermosetting plastic molding materials (duroplast). The fusible core process finds application, for example, for injection molded passenger car <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> manifolds. By modifying the equipment, small molded parts like valves or pump housings can be manufactured, as the manufacture of the fusible cores and the injected parts {{can be carried out}} on an injection molding machine.|$|E
25|$|The Lavi {{employed}} a mainly traditional airframe, {{the majority of}} development focus being upon the avionics and systems to provide the aircraft's performance edge instead. In {{order to meet the}} low structural weight requirements imposed, the use of composite materials was employed in elements such as the wing and its substructure, as well as the fin and the skin. The forward fuselage was shaped in a manner that resulted in it naturally directing air into the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> and to avoid inlet blanking while flown at a sideslip condition.|$|E

25|$|A {{mechanic}} {{standing near}} a Boeing 737 at El Paso International Airport in Texas was sucked {{into one of}} the engines and killed. The mechanic's failure to maintain proper clearance with the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> during a jet engine run, and the failure of contract maintenance personnel to follow written procedures and directives contained in the airline's general maintenance manual were determined to be the cause. Factors contributing to the accident were the insufficient training provided to the contract mechanics by the airline, and the failure of the airport to disseminate a policy prohibiting ground engine runs above idle power in the terminal area.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} of the Lightning were equipped with the Ferranti-developed AI.23 monopulse radar, which was contained right {{at the front of}} the fuselage within an inlet cone at the centre of the <b>engine</b> <b>intake.</b> Radar information was displayed on an early head-up display and managed by onboard computers. The AI.23, an immediate predecessor of the AI.24 Foxhunter, supported several operational modes, which included autonomous search, automatic target tracking, and ranging for all weapons; the pilot attack sight provided gyroscopically-derived lead angle and backup stadiametric ranging for gun firing. The radar and gunsight were collectively designated the AIRPASS: Airborne Interception Radar and Pilot Attack Sight System. The radar would be successively upgraded with the introduction of more capable Lightning variants, such as to provide guidance for the Red Top missile.|$|E
25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the <b>engine</b> <b>intake,</b> cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke <b>engine's</b> <b>intake</b> timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type <b>engine's</b> <b>intake</b> timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R

25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with European Union regulatory requirements. Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> air temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall warning horn also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> air flow, causing both engines to flame out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E
25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the <b>engine</b> <b>intake.</b> This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E

5|$|B-1A: The B-1A was the {{original}} B-1 design with variable <b>engine</b> <b>intakes</b> and Mach2.2 top speed. Four prototypes were built; no production units were manufactured.|$|R
500|$|The XB-70 used {{compression}} lift, which {{arose from}} a shock wave {{generated by the}} sharp {{leading edge of the}} central <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> splitter plate below the wing. [...] At Mach 3 cruising speed, the shock wave attached along the wing leading edge, preventing the high pressure behind the shock front from leaking up over the wing. The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift. The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher pressure field behind the strong shock wave. Unique among aircraft of its size, the outer portions of the wings were hinged, and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees, acting almost as a type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft's directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds, and strengthened the compression lift effect. With the wingtips drooped downwards, the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings.|$|E
500|$|The OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout {{for their}} new fighter, the I-300 (also called the izdeliye F (model or product F) by the OKB) because it offered the {{advantages}} of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing but it had some drawbacks, such as the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear, protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust, and where to place the aircraft's armament. The all-metal aircraft had unswept, mid-mounted wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose. Its two-spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and Frise ailerons. Its powerplant comprised two RD-20 turbojets, which were Soviet-manufactured versions of the BMW 003. The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage, with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit. A steel laminate heatshield was installed {{on the bottom of}} the rear fuselage to protect it from the exhaust gasses. There were four bag-type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing, providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1,625 liters (429 US gallons). The cockpit was not pressurized. The planned armament consisted of a 57mm NL-57 cannon mounted in the centerline <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> bulkhead and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes. The N-57 gun was provided with 28 rounds and the two NS-23 cannons had 80 rounds each.|$|E
500|$|SST {{was one of}} {{the first}} oceanographic {{variables}} to be measured. [...] Benjamin Franklin suspended a mercury thermometer from a ship while travelling between the United States and Europe in his survey of the Gulf stream in the late eighteenth century. [...] SST was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface. [...] The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963. [...] These observations have a warm bias of around [...] due to the heat of the engine room. [...] This bias has led to changes in the [...] perception of global warming since 2000. [...] Fixed weather buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of [...] Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night. Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design, and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. [...] These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. [...] A large network of coastal buoys in U.S. waters is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). [...] Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the El Niño phenomenon.|$|E
