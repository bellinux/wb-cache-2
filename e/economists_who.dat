5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most <b>economists</b> <b>who</b> favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs {{on a host of}} manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs {{on a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 <b>economists</b> <b>who</b> protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|The 1992–2004 {{period was}} marked by {{the rule of the}} Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, which was {{responsible}} for gradual transition from the Titoistic economy to the capitalist market economy. It later attracted much criticism by neo-liberal <b>economists,</b> <b>who</b> demanded a less gradual approach. The party's president Janez Drnovšek, who served as prime minister between 1992 and 2002, {{was one of the most}} influential Slovenian politicians of the 1990s, alongside President Milan Kučan (who served between 1990 and 2002).|$|E

25|$|Krugman {{has since}} drawn {{parallels}} between Japan's 'lost decade' {{and the late}} 2000s recession, arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a liquidity trap. In response to <b>economists</b> <b>who</b> {{point out that the}} Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system.|$|E
25|$|The first {{criticism}} is that, following Say's {{law and the}} related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, prices will fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower price will stimulate demand (though at lower profit or cost – possibly even lower wages). This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian <b>economists,</b> <b>who</b> reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of sticky prices as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point.|$|E
25|$|The Keynesian {{revolution}} is typically {{viewed as a}} major shift in macroeconomics. According to John Kenneth Galbraith, Say's Law dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. <b>Economists</b> <b>who</b> contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers. In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, John A. Hobson, who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>economists</b> <b>who</b> {{have studied}} {{proposals}} for universal healthcare {{worry that the}} consumer driven healthcare movement will reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern {{was one of the}} driving factors behind a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as Obamacare, which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy over-the-counter drugs without a medical prescription.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{reducing}} {{poverty and}} increasing China's wealth, Deng's reforms {{have been criticized}} by the Chinese New Left for increasing inequality and allowing private entrepreneurs to purchase state assets at reduced prices. These accusations were especially intense during the Lang-Gu dispute, in which New Left academic Larry Lang accused entrepreneur Gu Sujung of usurping state assets, after which Gu was imprisoned. The Hu-Wen Administration adopted some New Left policies, such as halting privatizations and increasing the state sector's importance in the economy, and Keynesian policies that have been criticized by some Chinese <b>economists</b> <b>who</b> advocate a policy of deregulation, tax cuts and privatization.|$|E
25|$|From {{the end of}} the Great Depression {{until the}} early 1970s, Keynesian {{economics}} provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. The influence of Keynes's theories waned in the 1970s, due to stagflation and critiques from Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Jr. and other <b>economists,</b> <b>who</b> were less optimistic about the ability of interventionist government policy to positively regulate the economy or otherwise opposed to Keynesian policies. From the early 1980s to 2008, the normative consensus among economists was that attempts at fiscal stimulus would be ineffective even in a recession, and such policies were only occasionally employed by the governments of developed countries.|$|E
