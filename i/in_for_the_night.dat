Five of their LCAs were sunk by beach obstacles or enemy fire, {{at the cost}} of 76 casualties. Major P. M. Donnell temporarily took charge until Phillips and some others who had got separated from the unit rejoined the group at 14:00 along the Meuvaines–Le Carrefour road. The commando took additional casualties in several skirmishes, including at La Rosière, on the way to Point 72. They did not arrive there until 22:30, too late to launch an attack, so they dug <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> The town and port were captured in the battle of Port-en-Bessin on 7–8 June 1944.|$|E

The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E

25|$|During the withdrawal, Fissel was wounded. Unable to {{determine}} the exact locations on the battalion's companies, Smoak sent several staff officers {{to determine}} the exact positions of his companies. Company F could not be found, and a large gap existed between the right flank of Company G and the left flank of Company E which left the battalion in a precarious position. As a result, Smoak ordered Company E to move forward, contact Company G, and establish a line to protect the battalion's front and right flank. In the meantime, Company G was to extend its line to the right in order to tie in with Company E. By 16:30, Smoak decided to dig <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> with his companies suffering fairly heavy casualties, Company F was missing and communications with regimental headquarters and the artillery had been broken.|$|E

500|$|Operating to {{the south}} of 7th Panzer Division, were the 106th Infantry Division and the 320th Infantry Division of Corps Raus. The two {{formations}} attacked across a [...] front without armour support. The advance began well, with the crossing of the river and a swift advance against the 72nd Guards Rifle Division. Corps Raus took the village of Maslovo Pristani, penetrating the first Red Army defence line. A Soviet counter-attack supported by about 40 tanks was beaten off, with the assistance from artillery and flak batteries. After having suffered 2,000 casualties since the morning and still facing considerable resistance from the Soviet forces, the corps dug <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
500|$|Marines of 2/5 {{secured the}} {{northwest}} end of Tulagi without opposition and then joined Edson's Raiders in their advance towards the southeastern {{end of the}} island. The Marines advanced towards the southeast {{end of the island}} throughout the day while defeating a few isolated pockets of Japanese resistance. Around noon, Suzuki repositioned his main defenses into a line [...] on a hill—called Hill281 (Hill280 in some sources) by U.S. forces based on its elevation—and a nearby ravine located at the southeast end of the island. The Japanese defenses included dozens of tunneled caves dug into the hill's limestone cliffs and machinegun pits protected by sandbags.

Soldiers {{on their way to}} Bény-sur-Mer, [...] inland, discovered that the road was well covered by machine gun emplacements that had to be outflanked before the advance could proceed. Elements of the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade advanced to within sight of the Carpiquet airfield late in the afternoon, but by this time their supporting armour was low on ammunition so the Canadians dug <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> The airfield was not captured until a month later as the area became the scene of fierce fighting.

The 10th SWB captured the eastern stretches of the wood and inflicted many casualties on the Germans. The 15th Welsh, along with the 15th and 17th RWF, fought north through the wood and made it to within [...] of the northern edge when they were thrown back by German fire.

500|$|After the {{occupation}} of Poland, the Nazi German administration created hundreds of ghettos, with ethnic Poles on the [...] "Aryan side" [...] and the Polish Jews on the [...] "Jewish side" [...] of metropolitan cities and towns. Anyone from the Aryan side caught assisting those on the Jewish side in obtaining food was subject to the death penalty. Capital punishment and collective responsibility of entire families for aiding Jews, was the most draconian such Nazi practice against any nation in occupied Europe. On 10 November 1941, {{the death penalty was}} expanded by Hans Frank to apply to Poles who helped Jews [...] "in any way: by taking them <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> giving them a lift in a vehicle of any kind" [...] or [...] "feed runaway Jews or sell them foodstuffs". The law was made public by posters distributed in all major cities. Polish rescuers were fully conscious of the dangers facing them and their families, not only from the Germans, but also from betrayers (see:szmalcownik) within the local population. The Nazis implemented a law forbidding all non-Jews from buying from Jewish shops under the maximum penalty of death.|$|E
