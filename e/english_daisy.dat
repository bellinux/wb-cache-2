25|$|There {{is little}} {{discussion}} of Chinese animation in <b>English.</b> <b>Daisy</b> Yan Du's PhD dissertation, On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China (University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2012), {{is by far}} the most systematic analysis of early Chinese animation before 1980. Weihua Wu’s PhD dissertation, Animation in Postsocialist China: Visual Narrative, Modernity, and Digital Culture (City University of Hong Kong, 2006), discusses contemporary Chinese animation in the digital age after 1980. Besides the two major works, there are other articles and book chapters written by John Lent, Paola Voci, Mary Farquhar, and others about Chinese animation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vernacular name}} [...] "daisy", widely applied {{to members of}} this family, {{is derived from the}} Old <b>English</b> name of <b>daisy</b> (Bellis perennis): dægesege, from dæges eage, meaning [...] "day's eye". This is because the petals open at dawn and close at dusk.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, regular-season champ Fort Wayne (54-40) won on a forfeit from the third-place Grand Rapids Chicks (46-45). A {{confrontation}} erupted when, due to an injury to Fort Wayne’s regular catcher, the league voted to allow the Daisies to add Ruth Richard to their roster. Richard, an All-Star catcher for the Rockford Peaches, was available after the elimination of her team (37-55). Then the Chicks, claiming that using a new player was unfair, played the first game under protest, though they won it, 8-7. Attempting to resolve the matter the following night in Fort Wayne, Chicks manager Woody <b>English</b> and <b>Daisies</b> pilot Bill Allington ended up fighting at home plate. Later, the entire Chicks team voted not to play, so the Daisies advanced to the championship round to face Kalamazoo.|$|R

But a dispute erupted before the two teams had played the opening game at Grand Rapids ballpark. Due to an injury to Fort Wayne’s regular catcher, the league voted to allow the Daisies to add Rockford All-Star Ruth Richard to the roster. The Chicks, claiming that using a new player was unfair, played the first game under protest, which won by an 8–7 score.

In the end, the Kalamazoo Lassies won the last AAGPBL Championship Series by defeating the Daisies three to two games.|$|R
5000|$|Many related plants {{also share}} the name [...] "daisy", so to {{distinguish}} this species from other daisies {{it is sometimes}} qualified as common daisy, lawn daisy or <b>English</b> <b>daisy.</b> Historically, {{it has also been}} commonly known as bruisewort and occasionally woundwort (although the common name woundwort is now more closely associated with Stachys (woundworts)).

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a formal name {{is to have a}} single name that is {{accepted}} and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. For example, the botanical name Bellis perennis denotes a plant species which is native to most of the countries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has accumulated various names in many languages. Later, the plant was introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages. English names for this plant species include: daisy, <b>English</b> <b>daisy,</b> and lawn daisy. The cultivar Bellis perennis 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-variegated horticultural selection of this species.|$|E
5000|$|Malanga {{was born}} in the Bronx in 1943, the only child of Italian {{immigrant}} parents. In 1959, {{at the beginning of his}} senior year at the School of Industrial Art in Manhattan, Malanga became a regular on Alan Freed's The Big Beat, televised on Channel 5 (WNEW) in New York City. He graduated from high school with a major in Advertising Design (1960). He was introduced to poetry by his senior class <b>English</b> teacher, poet <b>Daisy</b> Aldan, who had a profound influence on his life and work from then on. He enrolled at the University of Cincinnati's College of Art & Design (1960), and was mentored by the poet, Richard Eberhart who was the university's resident poet for 1961. He dropped out at the end of the Spring semester. In the fall of 1961, Malanga was admitted to Wagner College in Staten Island on a fellowship anonymously donated for the express purpose of advancing his creative abilities as a poet and artist. At Wagner he befriended one of his English professors, Willard Maas, and his wife Marie Menken, who became his mentors. In June 1963, he went to work for Andy Warhol as [...] "a summer job that lasted seven years," [...] as he likes to put it. Malanga dropped out of Wagner College in 1964, freeing him up to work for Warhol full-time.|$|R
