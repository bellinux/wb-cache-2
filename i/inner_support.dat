Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean [...] "political bolshevization of Germany." [...] Further, there would be [...] "no princes, only Germans," [...] and a legal system with no [...] "...Jewish system of exploitation... for plundering of our people." [...] The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonizing territories to the east. Goebbels was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as [...] "a Jewish creation" [...] and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property.

40|$|The {{developing}} cochlea {{of mammals}} contains {{a large group}} of columnar-shaped cells, which together form a structure known as Kölliker’s organ. Prior to the onset of hearing, these <b>inner</b> <b>supporting</b> cells periodically release adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP), which activates purinergic receptors in surrounding <b>supporting</b> cells, <b>inner</b> hair cells and the dendrites of primary auditory neurons. Recent studies indicate that purinergic signaling between <b>inner</b> <b>supporting</b> cells and <b>inner</b> hair cells initiates bursts of action potentials in auditory nerve fibers before the onset of hearing. ATP also induces prominent effects in <b>inner</b> <b>supporting</b> cells, including an increase in membrane conductance, a rise in intracellular Ca 2 +, and dramatic changes in cell shape, although the importance of ATP signaling in non-sensory cells of the developing cochlea remains unknown. Here, we review current knowledge pertaining to purinergic signaling in supporting cells of Kölliker’s organ and focus on the mechanisms by which ATP induces changes in their morphology. We show that these changes in cell shape are preceded by increases in cytoplasmic Ca 2 +, and provide new evidence indicating that elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + and IP 3 are sufficient to initiate shape changes. In addition, we discuss the possibility that these ATP-mediated morphological changes reflect crenation following the activation of Ca 2 +-activated Cl− channels, and speculate about the possible functions of these changes in cell morphology for maturation of the cochlea...|$|R

50|$|The soft PAX {{sidewall}} {{allows for}} a more comfortable ride compared to run flat tires which work by having stiff sidewalls. When flat, the PAX tire sidewalls collapse until {{the weight of the}} car is riding on an internal polymer support ring mounted to an asymmetric wheel. That is the outside diameter of the wheel is smaller than the inside diameter of the wheel. This asymmetric wheel and tire design allows the tire to lock onto the wheel, rather than coming off at speed and/or while turning. So a PAX wheel that appears to be about 18 inches from the outside of the car (the side facing out), will look more like 19 inches {{on the inside of the}} wheel (the side facing the suspension). The <b>inner</b> <b>support</b> ring is also coated with a gel that is required to lubricate the rotating flat PAX tire.|$|E
