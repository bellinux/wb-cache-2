5|$|In {{the first}} 25 years after Hershiser {{recorded}} his streak, the closest challenge came from Brandon Webb of the 2007 Arizona Diamondbacks, who pitched 42 consecutive scoreless innings. <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> and Kenny Rogers {{were the only}} other pitchers to have reached 39 innings during that time period.|$|E
5|$|Steve Carlton in 1982 {{became the}} first pitcher to win more than three Cy Young Awards, while <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> in 1994 {{became the first}} to win at least {{three in a row}} (and {{received}} a fourth straight the following year), a feat later repeated by Randy Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: Roger Clemens, <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux,</b> Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in {{the game in the}} last decade of the 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E
50|$|Vizquel was <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> 3000th strikeout victim on July 26, 2005.|$|R
50|$|Barrett {{was behind}} the plate on August 7, 2004 for <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> 300th win.|$|R

5|$|In {{his season}} debut on April 4 against the San Francisco Giants, Young became the 435th {{different}} pitcher to surrender {{a home run}} to Barry Bonds when he surrendered Bonds' first {{of the season and}} 735th of his career. The game marked Young's 25th consecutive road start without a loss. Young was 9–0 during the streak, which ended in his subsequent road start on April 15 at Dodger Stadium in a 9–3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The last of the nine other pitchers to go 20 consecutive road starts without a loss was <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> who went 22 starts without a loss during 1997 and 1998. Young's streak began on June 25, 2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> has won {{the most}} Gold Glove Awards among all players, {{including}} pitchers, in Major League Baseball history. He won 18 awards, all in the National League; his streak of wins was consecutive from 1990 through 2002 until interrupted by Mike Hampton in 2003. Maddux won five more awards from 2004 to 2008, after which he retired. Jim Kaat is second and held the record for most wins (16) until he was displaced by Maddux in 2007. He won 14 awards in the American League and 2 in the National League; his 16 consecutive awards is a record among winners. Bob Gibson won nine Gold Gloves with the St. Louis Cardinals, and the inaugural winner Bobby Shantz won four awards in each league, {{for a total of}} eight. Mark Langston and Mike Mussina are tied for the fifth-highest total, with seven wins each. Five-time awardees include Ron Guidry, Phil Niekro, and Kenny Rogers; Jim Palmer won four times. Gold Glove winners at pitcher who have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame include Gibson, Palmer, and Niekro.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lieber was the Cubs' Opening Day starter. From June 28 to August 14, he won {{a career-high}} six {{consecutive}} decisions. On July 3, he threw a shutout, allowing two hits in a 30 victory over the Pirates. In his next start, on July 8, he had 12 strikeouts and threw a complete game in a 92 win over the White Sox. Lieber was 127 with a 4.12 ERA through his first 29 starts; however, he went 04 in September with a 5.88 ERA. In 35 starts (tied for the NL lead with Randy Johnson, Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine, and <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux),</b> Lieber had a 1211 record, a 4.41 ERA, and 54 walks. He tied Darryl Kile for ninth in the league with 192 strikeouts, he led the league with 251 innings pitched, he ranked third in the league with 248 hits allowed (behind Liván Hernández's 254 and José Lima's 251), and he tied Maddux for third with six complete games (behind Johnson's and Curt Schilling's eight).|$|E
50|$|As {{a reserve}} umpire in 2004, Armendariz worked {{at first base}} for <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> 299th career win on July 27.|$|R
5000|$|... "Movement and Location", a song {{written by}} Chris Thile, {{a long time}} {{baseball}} fan of the Chicago Cubs, was inspired by former Cubs pitcher <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> obsession over the movement and location of his pitches.|$|R
50|$|Became {{the first}} pitcher {{ever to win}} the Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Awards in the same season (2003). The Gold Glove also snapped then-Atlanta {{teammate}} <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> streak of 13 consecutive Gold Gloves. Hampton was the only National League pitcher other than Maddux to win a Gold Glove during Maddux's career from 1989 and onward.|$|R
5|$|The most Gold Gloves {{ever won}} by one player is 18 by pitcher <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux.</b> He won 13 {{consecutive}} awards from 1990 to 2002, {{all in the}} National League. Brooks Robinson has the most wins as a third baseman, with 16 Gold Gloves, and is tied for the second-highest total overall with pitcher Jim Kaat, who won his 16 awards consecutively. Iván Rodríguez has won the most Gold Gloves as a catcher, with 13 career awards in the American League. Ozzie Smith has 13 wins at shortstop; he and Rodríguez are tied for the fourth-highest total among all winners. Among outfielders, Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays, who played primarily right field and center field, respectively, are tied for the lead with 12 Gold Gloves. Keith Hernandez, the leader at first base, has won 11 times, and Roberto Alomar leads second basemen with 10 wins. Other players with 10 or more wins include shortstop Omar Vizquel (11), catcher Johnny Bench (10), third baseman Mike Schmidt (10), and outfielders Ken Griffey Jr., Ichiro Suzuki, Andruw Jones, and Al Kaline (10 each).|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux,</b> who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E
25|$|<b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> {{was drafted}} by the Cubs in the 2nd round. Player signed June 19, 1984.|$|E
50|$|With 164 {{victories}} {{during the}} 1990s, Glavine earned {{the second highest}} number of wins as a pitcher in the National League, second only to teammate <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> 176. He was a five-time 20-game winner and two-time Cy Young Award winner, and one of only 24 pitchers (and just 6 left-handers) in major league history to earn 300 career wins.|$|R
50|$|Barksdale was {{at first}} base on August 7, 2004 for <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> 300th win and also at first base on June 1, 2012, when Johan Santana threw a no-hitter. He has also umpired in the World Baseball Classic in 2009 and 2013, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2012, the Wild Card Game in 2013, and the Division Series in 2014 and 2015.|$|R
50|$|As of June 23, 2016, Peavy has the 12th lowest career WHIP {{of active}} Major Leaguer. Peavy's two-seam fastball acts {{primarily}} as a sinker and induces many ground balls. This can allow Peavy to induce many double plays when runners are on base. Peavy likes to run his fastballs in on lefties and make the pitch break back into the zone, similar to a power version of <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> technique.|$|R
25|$|Right-handed pitcher <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> {{won three}} in a row with the Braves, from 1993 through 1995. His first award came in 1992 with the Cubs.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1997 season, Boras {{broke the}} $50 million barrier by {{negotiating}} a five-year, $57.5 million contract for <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> with the Atlanta Braves, making Maddux the highest paid {{player in the}} game.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Boras {{negotiated}} a record five-year, $28 million contract for <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> with the Atlanta Braves, eclipsing the second-best offer by $9 million. The contract trailed only David Cone's contract {{in terms of}} annual value and was two years longer.|$|E
50|$|Eduardo Rafael Pérez (born May 4, 1968) is a Venezuelan-American former {{professional}} baseball player and current First Base coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians and the Milwaukee Brewers. He batted and threw right-handed. Pérez {{is the current}} bullpen coach for the Atlanta Braves. He was known for being pitcher <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> personal catcher during his tenure as a player with the Braves.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Michael Martin (born December 3, 1958) is {{a former}} Major League Baseball catcher. He played eight games for the Chicago Cubs in , getting just one hit, a double in 13 at bats. He holds the {{distinction}} of catching the final out of <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> first win, a complete game victory over Cincinnati on September 7, having initially entered the game as a pinch-runner for Jody Davis. 1986 was Martin's last professional season after nine years in minor league baseball.|$|R
5000|$|He has officiated three World Series (2006, 2011, 2015), four League Championship Series (2003, 2008, 2013, 2016), and six Division Series (2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2015), {{as well as}} the 2006 All-Star Game. The first Mexican-born umpire {{in major}} league history, he resides in Gilbert, Arizona. Graduated from Fullerton Union High School in Orange County, California in 1990. [...] Márquez wears the uniform number 72. He was at second base on August 7, 2004 for <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> 300th win.|$|R
25|$|In December 2002, for {{the second}} year in a row, a Boras free agent client {{surprised}} his former team by accepting salary arbitration. This time, it was <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> accepting the offer from the Atlanta Braves. Boras eventually negotiated a record-breaking $14.75 million contract for the star pitcher, at the time the largest one-year contract in baseball history.|$|E
25|$|Martínez became {{just the}} fourth pitcher to reach 3,000 strikeouts {{with fewer than}} 1,000 walks (in Martínez's case, 701). Ferguson Jenkins, <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> and Curt Schilling had {{previously}} done likewise. Martínez also joined Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson to become the third 3,000-strikeout pitcher to have more strikeouts than innings pitched, and is also the first Latin American pitcher to have 3,000 strikeouts.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, in {{his first}} year of eligibility, Clemens {{received}} only 37.6% of the votes cast and was denied entry into the Hall of Fame, falling short of the 75% required for induction. With the inductions of <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> and Tom Glavine the following year and Randy Johnson in 2015, Clemens is currently the only eligible member of the 300 win club not to be inducted into the Hall.|$|E
25|$|The Braves {{have retired}} eleven {{numbers in the}} history of the franchise, {{including}} most recently Chipper Jones' number 10 in 2013, John Smoltz's number 29 in 2012, Bobby Cox's number 6 in 2011, Tom Glavine's number 47 in 2010, and <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> number 31 in 2009. Additionally, Hank Aaron's 44, Dale Murphy's 3, Phil Niekro's 35, Eddie Mathews' 41, Warren Spahn's 21 and Jackie Robinson's 42, which is retired for all of baseball with the exception of Jackie Robinson Day, have also been retired. The color and design of the retired numbers reflect the uniform design at the time the person was on the team, excluding Robinson.|$|R
5000|$|After their 100-win 1988 season ended, the Mets {{started a}} decline that lasted {{well into the}} 1990s. Darling's [...] started as poorly as 1988 had ended when he lost his first three starts with an ERA of 11.57. He {{recovered}} with a good May but was inconsistent for the entire season, finishing 14-14 with a 3.52 ERA. Darling's five losses in his last seven starts contributed to the Mets missing the postseason. Darling did become the first Mets pitcher to win the Gold Glove Award. He was also the last N.L. pitcher to win the award before <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> remarkable streak of 13 consecutive Gold Gloves. On August 10, 1989, Darling won his 83rd game with the Mets to move him past Jon Matlack into fourth on the Mets' all-time wins list where he remains today (behind Tom Seaver, Dwight Gooden and Jerry Koosman).|$|R
500|$|Young {{is not a}} {{traditional}} power pitcher. He {{is said to be}} a control pitcher in a [...] power pitcher's body—his pitching style is more like <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> than that of five-time Cy Young Award winner Randy Johnson, who is the same height as Young. Young has been traded three times partly because of the low velocity of his fastball, which is in the 83–87 miles per hour (133.6–140km/h) range. Young has learned how to use precise location to make his fastball effective. He has also been compared to another control pitcher, Jim Palmer, because Young similarly induces popups and fly ball outs with deceptive late movement on his high fastballs. Over 50% of the balls put in play against him are fly balls. Of the flyballs hit off Young in 2007, 3.8% were home runs. while the average is about 11%. From 2003 to 2006 the best single-season percentage was 6.2% by Dontrelle Willis in 2005.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the game, the Braves {{unveiled}} their All-Turner Field Team, as chosen on the team's website by fans: catcher Javy López, {{first baseman}} Freddie Freeman, second baseman Marcus Giles, shortstop Rafael Furcal, third baseman Chipper Jones, left fielder Ryan Klesko, center fielder Andruw Jones, right fielder Brian Jordan, utility player Martin Prado, pitchers <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux,</b> Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Tim Hudson, and Julio Teheran, and relief pitcher Craig Kimbrel.|$|E
25|$|The first postseason {{game played}} at Turner Field was also during the 1997 season between the Braves and the Houston Astros in the NLDS. Starting pitcher <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> pitched a {{complete}} game, giving up only one run and leading the Braves to a 2–1 victory. Following {{a sweep of}} the Astros, the Braves {{went on to the}} NLCS, where Tom Glavine picked up the first NLCS win at Turner Field; however, the Braves lost to the eventual-World Series-champion Florida Marlins.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals won the National League Central Division {{championship}} in 2000. Injuries to other pitchers left Ankiel and Darryl Kile {{as the only}} fully healthy starters left on the roster. Cardinals manager Tony La Russa chose Ankiel to start Game One of the National League Division Series against veteran pitcher <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> of the Braves. To shield Ankiel from media pressure, La Russa had Kile answer questions to the media as if to start Game One, and afterwards informed the media that Ankiel was starting.|$|E
5000|$|Kaat was an All-Star {{three times}} (1962, 1966, 1975), {{and won the}} Gold Glove Award for {{defensive}} skill a record 16 consecutive times (1962-1977). His record for career Gold Gloves by a pitcher is now second to <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux's</b> 18. Kaat used the same baseball glove for 15 seasons. Although Kaat would pitch a few games a year out of the bullpen, he was primarily a starting pitcher until 1979, {{when he became a}} relief pitcher in a season in which he split time between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. With the Cardinals in 1982, Kaat earned his only World Series ring working in four games out of the bullpen in the 1982 World Series. In 1983 he became the last major league player to have played in the 1950s and the last [...] "original" [...] (pre-Twins) Washington Senator player to retire. Kaat is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades.|$|R
25|$|<b>Greg</b> Maddux: Although <b>Maddux</b> had his {{greatest}} success while with the Atlanta Braves for 11 seasons, {{he had two}} stints with the Chicago Cubs {{for a total of}} 10 seasons, including the first seven of his MLB career. Maddux believed that both fanbases were equally important in his career, and so the cap on his plaque does not feature any logo. His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Braves.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, the Braves signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher <b>Greg</b> <b>Maddux</b> {{from the}} Chicago Cubs, leading many {{baseball}} insiders {{to declare the}} team's pitching staff the best at that time. The 1993 team posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the San Francisco Giants, who won 103 games. The Braves needed a stunning 55-19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, the Braves fell in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies in a six-game upset.|$|E
