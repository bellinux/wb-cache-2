40|$|In {{the present}} study a brief review is {{presented}} made of previous investigations which looked at the current practices in a contained tube extrusion process i. e. <b>Hooker</b> <b>extrusion</b> process. This {{is followed by the}} results of a systematic study of press forces (and hence press power) and press work, when extruding S 1010 cold rolled steel and 1200 aluminium billet work materials using specially designed tool sets tested in uncoated and coated conditions. The aim was to study the accuracy of reported predictive equations for force and work predictions, and to examine both the pattern and quantities of the experimental forces and work for uncoated and tin coated tools. Results showed that the force and work trends were not influenced qualitatively by the tool substrate material or tool surface coatings. The best predictions for forces and work were for the steel billet materials and the uncoated tools. In the coated conditions the tools reduced, on average, the total press force by ~ 15 % and the total press work by ~ 14. 5 %, and therefore they were economically efficient. Moreover, the products made by the coated tools exhibited better quality than items produced by uncoated tools...|$|E
40|$|The equal channel angular {{pressing}} (ECAP) {{process is}} a promising technique for imparting a large plastic deformation to materials without a resultant decrease in cross sectional area. In the present study, the suitability of this technique for the processing of tubular specimens has been investigated. Commercially pure titanium was selected for the study. Tubular specimens were extruded to three passes using two processing routes through an ECAP die with an angle of 150 degrees between the two intersecting channels. Sand {{was used as a}} mandrel during the pressing. Analysis of force-stroke diagram was carried out, work from registered force-stroke diagram was calculated and compared with theoretical calculations. The mechanical properties and the microstructure were also investigated. To determine the influence of surface area to volume ratio of the specimens (referred to as the shape difficulty factor, SDF), data obtained in the current study on ECAP of tubular CP-Titanium was compared with data available in the literature on <b>Hooker</b> <b>extrusion</b> and conventional solid extrusion of CP-Titanium. Improvement in mechanical properties was observed in both the Routes. The grain size was reduced from similar to 18 mu m to similar to 12 mu m. These investigations demonstrate that ECAP is a promising technique for improving properties of tubular materials while ensuring retention of shape (with the possibility of imparting further deformation to the specimen using the same die) and with low pressing pressures.
