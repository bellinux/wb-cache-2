2500|$|In Davidson's first {{autobiography}} The Full Monty (1993), {{he talked}} about his violent and abusive behaviour towards his wife in a light-hearted manner: [...] "We’re like a couple of boxers. On the first occasion, I poked her in the eye by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> shiner. I threw a bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye. Just for a giggle she kept blackening it up to make it look worse." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{little time}} to compose herself; and then asked {{what she had to}} say.|$|E
60|$|GRACE. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{lecture on}} her {{behavior}} which she will remember {{to the last}} day of her life.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> {{imaginary}} check, {{and now she}} {{is suing}} me for substantial dollars. It looks inconsistent.|$|R
60|$|As I come in, {{she jumped}} up, and stood staring at me. I {{went to the}} tap, and turned the flow off, and then <b>I</b> <b>gives</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> look.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say, mamma; {{she wants}} {{something}} to eat. Can <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> orange?' called the boy, prancing {{away into the}} splendid room, quite like a fairy prince, Tessa thought.|$|R
60|$|The servant {{was still}} waiting a {{favourable}} opportunity to announce me. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> shilling not to, and got away unperceived.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{when that}} unfortunate girl, her niece, {{was to be}} married to poor Sir Griffin Tewett, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> whole service of plate." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head, {{with such a}} sad, sad doubt of it, that the tears came into my eyes. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> last kiss--and hurried away.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is noised {{that you}} visit my first wife's tomb. Now, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> honoured name to bear While living, when dead. So I've claim to ask [...] By what right you task [...] My {{patience}} by vigiling there? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{best for}} her health," [...] said Joceline, [...] "lest <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> ducking for digestion.--But give me the pitcher, Mistress Alice--meeter I bear it than you.--How now? what jingles at the bottom? have you lifted the pebbles {{as well as the}} water?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{run for a}} {{month or}} two at a time, now an' agin, when I fall on a {{friendly}} set o' well-disposed redskins--just to keep the right sort o' spirit in her, and comfort <b>her</b> <b>a</b> bit. But she's always willin' to live alone wi' me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I parted {{with her}} at Paul's Wharf," [...] said Nigel, [...] "where she went ashore with her charge. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> letter to that very man, John Christie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! The {{three girls}} in the spare room and dressing-room, and Fergus in the little room over the porch. I will write to Fanny; <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> hint.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One minus common sense, plus folly, plus romance, minus {{anything}} to do. Your equation {{is worthy of}} Mrs. Harvey Anderson. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> good dose of the 'Diseases of Climate!'' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got a pink kitten that {{sometimes}} talks like that," [...] she said, [...] "but after <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> good whipping she doesn't think she's so high and mighty after all. If you only knew who Ozma is you'd be {{scared to death}} {{to talk to her}} like that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When my aunt returned, I quite {{forgot that}} we were on bad terms. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> {{enthusiastic}} account of all that had passed between her sister and myself. How {{do you think she}} met this little advance on my part? She positively refused to let me go to Scotland.|$|R
60|$|Well, there's some bygones {{that are}} best left bygones, {{and the night}} at the White City what she was {{alluding}} to was one of them. I still maintain, as I always shall maintain, that the constable had no right to--but, there, it's a story that wouldn't interest you. And, anyway, I was glad to see Katie again, so <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> smile.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> hug to {{take away}} the turn, or to give her another turn in the right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in anxious inquiry.|$|E
60|$|She {{started to}} walk to where I was, and {{suddenly}} I seen she was limping. So <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> hand down to my room, and set her on a chair.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{look that}} made her catch 'er breath, and I was just {{stepping}} through the wicket, when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I go to mamma's room {{every morning}} when I wake," [...] the child began. [...] "I get into <b>her</b> bed, and <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> kiss, and <b>I</b> say 'Good-morning'--and sometimes, if she isn't {{in a hurry}} to get up, I stop in her bed, and go to sleep again. Mamma thought I was asleep this morning. I wasn't asleep--I was only quiet. I don't know why I was quiet." ...|$|R
25|$|My {{father was}} very slow {{to get into}} the cornfield. He was so indignant at the ruffians that he was unwilling to retreat before them. My little {{children}} were in the field three hours. They seemed to know that if they cried the noise would betray their parents whereabouts, and so they kept as still as mice. The baby was very hungry & <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> ear of raw green corn which she ate ravenously.|$|R
60|$|Peggotty {{cried out}} No! with an {{astonishing}} volume of voice; {{and then sat}} down, and began to pant, and said <b>I</b> had <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> turn.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Adam's my man,' she said, {{and at that}} <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{look for}} which God might have struck me dead. But instead of blaming me {{she put her arms}} round my neck.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer. But the old willful Sally {{was not in}} evidence. Watching {{her face}} <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> slow and gentle pull, one she could easily resist if she cared to, and she slipped from her saddle into my arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got it," [...] he said suddenly. [...] "Look here. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{present on}} her last birthday. All {{we have to do}} is to go to the shop, hunt up the date when it was bought, and the thing's done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It has not, and we {{can only}} regret it. Adrienne has half-consented, and <b>I</b> shall <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{handsome}} wedding--for, married she must be in our house." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was magnificent, but I {{felt she}} was still to better it should <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> new chance. [...] "Who the lady really is? Well, hardly; and that's why, as you so acutely see, the {{question}} of your having risked such a step has occurred to me only as a jest. Fancy indeed"--I piled it up--"your saying to him: 'We're all noticing that you're so much less of an idiot than you used to be, and we've different views of the miracle'!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A price I will cheerfully {{pay for my}} life. It is as you say--Dido {{certainly}} {{wishes to}} speak to me, and <b>I</b> must <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> invitation to come nearer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{would it}} be," [...] enquired Reggie, {{appearing}} in the doorway like part of a conjuring trick, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> flower or two every now and then? Just {{thought of it as}} I was starting the car. She's fond of flowers." ...|$|E
60|$|And then I believe <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> bit of {{the rough}} side of my tongue, as she deserved. She stood up at once, like a sentry to his officer; for I must say she was always well brought up, and had a great respect for whites.|$|E
60|$|As I {{passed this}} party, I saw behind the lady's chair a maid, with a clothes-pin in her hand, and no nose. She sobbingly {{told me a}} bird had nipped it off; and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> bit of court-plaster, which I {{fortunately}} had in my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{broke it}} to her as gentle as I could. I didn’t tell <b>’er</b> much, <b>I</b> just <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> few ’ints. Just {{enough to make her}} ask for more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, {{nor even}} will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> post-hypnotic {{suggestion}} to vaccinate herself, {{or go to}} the doctor's and have it done when she is awake; though,' said Miss Martin, 'that is not bad business either. I must make a note of that. But I can't hypnotise anybody. I tried lots of girls when I was at St. Ursula's and nothing ever came of it. Thank you for the idea all the same. By the way, I first must sterilise the pontifical--' She paused.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was struck}} {{all of a}} heap--the truth flasht on my mind's hi. [...] "Toinette," [...] says I, for that was the gal's name--"Toinette," [...] says <b>I,</b> <b>giving</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> kiss, [...] "keep them for two minits, as you valyou my affeckshn;" [...] and then <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> another kiss, and ran up stares to our chambers. Master had now pretty well {{recovered}} of his wound, and was aloud to drive abowt: it was lucky for {{him that he had}} the strength to move. [...] "Sir, sir," [...] says I, [...] "the bailiffs are after you, and you must run for your life." ...|$|R
