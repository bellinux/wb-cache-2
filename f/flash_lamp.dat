5|$|Xenon {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called xenon flash lamps, used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamp,</b> and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.|$|E
25|$|The {{light source}} is {{commonly}} a xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamp,</b> or flashtube, {{which has a}} complex spectrum and a color temperature of approximately 5,600 kelvins. To obtain colored light, colored gels may be used.|$|E
25|$|This method {{involves}} two fluorophores: a donor and an acceptor. Excitation of {{the donor}} fluorophore (in this case, the lanthanide ion complex) by an energy source (e.g. <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> or laser) produces an energy {{transfer to the}} acceptor fluorophore if they are within a given proximity to each other (known as the Förster’s radius). The acceptor fluorophore in turn emits light at its characteristic wavelength.|$|E
50|$|Where {{a signal}} aspect {{incorporates}} a <b>flashing</b> <b>lamp,</b> the <b>flashing</b> <b>lamp</b> is always applied to less restrictive signals. This {{is to prevent}} a stuck flashing relay from accidentally upgrading the signal.|$|R
40|$|Several {{finite element}} models of defects such as debond and void have been {{developed}} for composite panels subjected to transient thermography inspection. Since the exact nature of the heat generated from the <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> is unknown, direct comparison between FEA and experimental results is not possible. However, some similarity of the results has been observed. The shape of the time curve that simulates the heat flux from the <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> has minimal effect on the temperature profiles. Double the number of <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> could increase the contrast of thermal image and define the shape of defect better...|$|R

25|$|Photoinhibition {{can also}} be induced with short flashes of light using either a pulsed laser or a xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamp.</b> When very short flashes are used, the photoinhibitory {{efficiency}} of the flashes depends on the time difference between the flashes. This dependence has been interpreted {{to indicate that the}} flashes cause photoinhibition by inducing recombination reactions in PSII, with subsequent production of singlet oxygen. The interpretation has been criticized by noting that the photoinhibitory efficiency of xenon flashes depends on the energy of the flashes even if such strong flashes are used that they would saturate the formation of the substrate of the recombination reactions.|$|E

60|$|To their right, in {{the faint}} {{light of the}} <b>flash</b> <b>lamp,</b> a narrow {{stairway}} was revealed leading to the second story. Straight ahead was a door opening upon the blackness of a rear apartment. Beside {{the foot of the}} stairway was another door leading to the cellar steps.|$|E
50|$|Xenon {{is used in}} <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> and arc lamps, and as {{a general}} anesthetic. The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer {{molecule}} (Xe2) as its lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> as pumps. Xenon is also being used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as the propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft.|$|R

50|$|Xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{gas-filled}} tubes used in {{cameras and}} strobe lights to produce bright flashes of light.|$|R
60|$|Bridge stepped quickly {{down the}} {{remaining}} steps, entered the rear room which {{had served as}} dining room and kitchen, inspected the two small bedrooms off this room, and the summer kitchen beyond. All were empty; {{then he turned and}} re-entering the front room bent his steps toward the cellar stairs. At the foot of the stairway leading to the second floor lay the <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> that the boy had dropped the night before. Bridge stooped, picked it up and examined it. It was uninjured and with it in his hand he continued toward the cellar door.|$|E

50|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} significantly {{influences the}} insulation properties of air. High-voltage applications, e.g. xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamps,</b> can experience electrical breakdowns at high altitudes.|$|R
40|$|Vertical cracks {{are among}} the most {{problematic}} types of defects from the thermal nondestructive testing (NDT) point of view. Nowadays, the fast thermal inspection techniques most commonly utilize infrared cameras and pulsed heating provided by <b>flash</b> <b>lamps.</b> The <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> illuminate the whole surface of a sample, and the resulting heat flow is mostly perpendicular to the surface. Therefore, the heat signature caused by the vertical cracks may be very small, and the cracks may avoid detection...|$|R
50|$|Xenon flash lamps {{are used}} for medium- and high-intensity strobe applications. Sufficiently rapid or bright {{flashing}} may require active cooling such as forced-air or water cooling to prevent the xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> from melting.|$|E

50|$|For {{the gain}} medium to amplify light, {{it needs to}} be {{supplied}} with energy in a process called pumping. The energy is typically supplied as an electric current or as light at a different wavelength. Pump light may be provided by a <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> or by another laser.|$|E
25|$|Xenon {{arc lamps}} can be roughly {{divided into three}} categories: continuous-output xenon short-arc lamps, continuous-output xenon long-arc <b>lamps,</b> and xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> (which are usually {{considered}} separately).|$|R

50|$|Gas strobe beacons include Xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> and halogen varieties. Gas strobe beacons {{consist of}} a {{gas-filled}} tube surrounded by a lens. When electricity is applied, the tube flashes, is magnified by the lens, and a 360 degree light is emitted. The intensity of the light depends {{on the amount of}} electricity provided.|$|E
50|$|This {{equipment}} is a spectroscopic (light gathering) apparatus and corresponding method for rapidly detecting and analyzing analytes in a sample. The sample is irradiated by an excitation source in optical {{communication with the}} sample. The excitation source may include, but is not limited to, a laser, a <b>flash</b> <b>lamp,</b> an arc lamp, a light-emitting diode, or the like.|$|E
50|$|During the 1930s, American {{engineer}} Harold Edgerton began exploring {{strobe light}} technology for high speed photography. This {{led him to}} the invention of the xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> in which light is generated by passing brief electric current through a tube filled with xenon gas. In 1934, Edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method.|$|E

50|$|The Xenon <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> {{produces}} a single {{flash of light}} in the millisecond-microsecond range and is commonly used in film, photography and theatrical lighting. Particularly robust versions of this lamp, known as strobe lights, can produce long sequences of flashes, allowing for the stroboscopic examination of motion. This has found use in the study of mechanical motion, in medicine and in the lighting of dance halls.|$|E
