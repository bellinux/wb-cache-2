5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> gives birth.|$|E

After this, Satyavati returned home to help her father.|$|E

500|$|Milian {{began writing}} songs {{at the age}} of {{seventeen}} because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> recorded a song, the producer would refuse to give her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with.

"Fantasy" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey {{from her}} fifth album Daydream (1995), {{released}} in September 12, 1995 by Columbia Records as the lead single from Daydream. The song was written by Carey and Dave Hall, both serving as primary producers alongside Sean Combs. The song heavily samples Tom Tom Club's 1981 song [...] "Genius of Love" [...] and incorporates various other beats and grooves arranged by the former. The song's lyrics describe {{a woman who is}} in love with a man, and how <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> sees him she starts fantasizing about an impossible relationship with him. The remix for the song features rap verses from Ol' Dirty Bastard, something Carey arranged to assist in her crossover into the hip-hop market.|$|E
500|$|Bound {{was shot}} in thirty-eight days in Santa Monica, California. The Wachowskis' {{original}} director of photography resigned {{on the grounds that}} he could not do the film with the limited budget he had available, nor did he know anyone he believed could. Subsequently, cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew [...] "a bunch of cheap guys". Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by Frank Miller's neo-noir Sin City series in particular. Pope's sound counterpart was sound director Dane Davis. One of his ideas was to give Corky a cat-like quality by making a [...] "swishing" [...] sound <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.|$|E

500|$|... "Come into My World" [...] was {{released}} as {{the fourth and}} final single off the album on 11 November 2002.

In the United States, the song peaked at number 91 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It received a gold certification in Australia for sales of 35,000 units. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Michel Gondry and features Minogue strolling around a busy street in Paris, France; <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> completes a full circle, a duplicate of her appears {{through one of the}} stores, {{and by the end of}} the video there are four Minogues present together.|$|E
500|$|... "The Dreamscape", the season's ninth episode, was co-written {{by staff}} writer Zack Whedon and playwright Julia Cho.

[...] Anna Torv later commented that she wished for Olivia to [...] "lighten up" [...] during the first season, [...] "but <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> did, something would happen." [...] The writers inputted small scenes to shine more light on her character, which included Olivia dressing up for a night out but then [...] "the phone rings.

500|$|When Milian {{moved to}} Los Angeles, her only desire {{was to be}} an actress. She {{always wanted to be}} in the record business, but did not know how to obtain a {{recording}} contract. During this time, she was also a host for Disney Channel. After living in Los Angeles for six months, Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins. Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once he heard her sing, they began working together. For a year and a half, Milian went into a studio every day and worked with Jerkins, which is where she started meeting people in the record business. She began writing songs at the age of 17 because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> recorded a song, the producer would refuse to give her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with.

500|$|Pixar {{then set}} up a Simulation {{department}} and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt (short for [...] "physics tool"). After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated, this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley's fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way. Every time when Sulley would have to move, his fur would (automatically) react to his movements, thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well. The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo's clothes, which provided another [...] "breakthrough". The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge to animate thanks to those hundreds of creases and wrinkles that automatically occurred in the clothing when the wearer moved. Also, this meant {{they would have to}} solve the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled — in other words, to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect. Fizt applied the same system to Boo's clothes as to Sulley's fur. First of all, Boo would be animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo's body, and <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> [...] would move, her clothes also would react to her movements in a more natural manner.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the character has been generally negative. Robert A. George of the New York Post has written that Glee has: [...] "the most unpleasant pack of female characters of any show in recent memory", and deemed Terri the [...] "biggest culprit". George called Terri's hysterical pregnancy [...] "Freudian" [...] and wrote: [...] "The Terri-Quinn plot sends {{the message that the}} devious gender will use every trick to lure and trap its mate — including lying about pregnancy." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry commented: [...] "Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, [...] (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called Terri [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and opined: [...] "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell." [...] Ryan later deemed Terri the [...] "one big flaw in Glee, commenting that she: [...] "manages to drain all the fun out of Glee <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> appears. Not only is this shrill character intensely annoying, but she makes you wonder whether Will has brain damage. What other explanation could there be for his ending up with this materialistic harpy?". Furthermore, Terri was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote it}} is [...] "an uncommonly good movie, {{entertaining}} and actually inspirational". Writing for Film Journal International, Doris Toumarkine praised its pace and how [...] "Atchison takes spelling competitions and conveys {{the excitement of}} the 'sport,' the appeal of the 'game,' the thrill of the win, [...] the crushing blow of the loss." [...] Hornaday from The Washington Post called the film [...] "a triumph on many levels" [...] and proclaimed, [...] "It's that nod to the collective ... that makes Akeelah and the Bee so special." [...] She especially appreciated that South Los Angeles was presented without stereotypes. Jane Clifford of U-T San Diego felt the film would appeal to both children and adults, and stated that <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> tried to predict its plot [...] "it took a sharp turn. A turn that leaves you facing your stereotypes and feeling a little sheepish." [...] Dana Stevens, writing for The New York Times, asserted, [...] "The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee," [...] and [...] "a trio of crack performances" [...] can turn [...] "a formulaic sports picture" [...] into a [...] "tale that manages to inspire without being sappy." [...] Shantayaé Grant of The Jamaica Observer wrote that [...] "acting is spectacular, the emotions are real and this story of black triumph is simply phenomenal." [...] New York Press critic affirmed that Akeelah and the Bee [...] "resurrects a nearly lost idea of what an art-movie really is" [...] because it has [...] "dramatic attention to character and place, psychology and existence." ...|$|E

The lanthorn {{overhead}} threw a weird light on red caps and tricolour cockades, on the sullen faces {{of the men and}} the shoulders of the women, on the dancer's weird antics and her flying, tattered skirts. She was obviously tired, as a poor, performing cur might be, or a bear prodded along to uncongenial buffoonery. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> that <b>she</b> paused and solicited alms with her tambourine the crowd dispersed, and some of them laughed because she insisted.|$|R
