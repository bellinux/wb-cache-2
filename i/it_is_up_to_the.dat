5|$|After Jon {{discusses}} the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa criticizes him for attacking without gathering more men and predicts that Ramsay will defeat them. Jon {{insists that the}} army is the largest one possible. When Jon asks Melisandre not to resurrect him if he dies in battle, she says that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lord of Light. Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving Stannis and Mance and acknowledge {{that they may have}} served the wrong king all along. Davos discovers the pyre where Shireen and the wooden stag he carved for her were burned.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courts {{to determine whether a}} decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E
5|$|Chulip {{puts the}} {{player in the}} role of a young man who has just moved to a new town and next door to the girl of his dreams. Although she wants {{nothing to do with him}} due to his family's poor {{economic}} status, he decides to write her a heartfelt love letter. When the letter is stolen, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> protagonist to travel around the village and retrieve all of its pieces. The gameplay of Chulip revolves around improving the player's reputation with the citizens in order to access all parts of the town. To do this, the player must impress each member of the community and then kiss them.|$|E

5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their ballots. In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} question, the Court {{found that the}} {{religious}} freedom guarantee will protect those who disagree from performing same-sex marriages or even protect those who disagree from renting religious spaces {{for the purpose of}} same-sex marriage. Again, the Court reiterated that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> provinces to legislate protection for religious groups.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> umpires to {{keep out}} of the way of both the ball and the players. In particular, if the ball is hit and the players attempt a run, then the umpire behind the stumps will {{generally}} retreat to the side, in case the fielding side attempts a run out at that end.|$|E

25|$|Civil Partnerships {{have been}} {{permitted}} for clergy since 2005. Regarding such civil unions, “The Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships {{who are in}} a sexual relationship can serve as clergy. If the issue arises, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relevant Bishop to decide.” The Welsh Church does not require abstinence within civil unions.|$|E

25|$|The Marriage of Figaro is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings; the recitativi are {{accompanied}} by a keyboard instrument, usually a fortepiano or a harpsichord, often joined by a cello. The instrumentation of the recitativi is not given in the score, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conductor and the performers. A typical performance usually lasts around 3 hours.|$|E

25|$|A Judge of the High Court is {{not bound}} by {{previous}} decisions by other High Court Judges. However, {{as a matter of}} comity, a Court will generally not depart from a previous decision unless there is a good reason to do so, particularly if that decision has stood for some time. If there are conflicting High Court decisions, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of Appeal to decide which decision is correct.|$|E
25|$|Decisions of the High Court are {{binding on}} District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. However, a {{judge of the}} High Court is not bound by {{previous}} decisions by other High Court judges.

25|$|In ObjC, {{and most}} other {{languages}} implementing the protocol concept, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> programmer {{to ensure that the}} required methods are implemented in each class. Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use generic programming (generics) to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.|$|E

25|$|Tatangelo {{was also}} {{committed}} to cutting county spending and lowering property tax rates, issues that attracted Republican support. Homeowners, however, {{found that even}} when the county cut the ad valorem tax rates, their property taxes continued to climb because the Webb County Appraisal District in Laredo routinely increases the valuation of their properties on an annual basis. The district points out that state law requires the higher evaluations each year. Then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> taxing bodies to set the actual tax rates per $100 assessed value.|$|E
25|$|Generally, a state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance {{of no more than}} 200 nautical miles (370km) out from its coastal baseline. The exception to this rule occurs when {{exclusive economic zone}}s would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles (740km) apart. When an overlap occurs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> states to delineate the actual maritime boundary. Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.|$|E
25|$|I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{states to}} work out their social {{problems}} if possible, and while I have {{always been interested in}} seeing that the Negro has a square deal, I have never dissipated my strength against the particular stone wall of segregation. I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E
