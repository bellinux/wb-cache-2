40|$|Abstract—Compared {{with the}} {{conventional}} boosting PFC con-verter, the three-level boosting PFC converter has two cascaded switches and two cascaded capacitors across the dc-side voltage. Two capacitor voltages {{may be different}} due to their mismatched equivalent series resistance, their mismatched capacitance, and the mismatched conducting time of the corresponding switches. It fol-lows that the controller needs to sense the capacitor voltages to balance both capacitor voltages. In this paper, the sensorless ca-pacitor voltage balancing control (SCVBC) without sensing the capacitor voltages is proposed, and {{the total number of}} the <b>feed-back</b> <b>signals</b> is saved. The proposed SCVBC is digitally imple-mented in an FPGA-based system. The provided simulated and experimental results also demonstrate the proposed SCVBC.

40|$|Abstract. Wireless sensor {{networks}} can {{be viewed}} as the integration of three subsystems: a low-impact in situ data acquisition and collection system, a system for inference of process models from observed data and a priori information, and a system that controls the observation and collection. Each of these systems is connected by feedforward and <b>feed-back</b> <b>signals</b> from the others; moreover, each subsystem is formed from behavioral components that are distributed among the sensors and out-of-network computational resources. Crucially, the overall performance of the system is constrained by the costs of energy, time, and computa-tional complexity. We are addressing these design issues in the context of monitoring forest environments with the objective of inferring ecosystem process models.

Two-wheel {{autonomous mobile robot}} that capable of interactive, communicative behaviour is considered social in this research. Current mobile robot motion accuracy has not been yet achieved to full satisfaction. This paper presents a novel technique of Cross-Coupling Motion Control for Motion Controller, (NC-CMCMC), for Two-Wheel Mobile Robot to achieve higher motion accuracy.

The technique presented in this paper is based on the consideration of both internal and external disturbances simultaneously. Similarly, previous Cross-Coupling control techniques used only <b>feed-back</b> <b>signals</b> to correct the errors of the system.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a force-controlled micro-electromechanical systems rotary microgripper with integrated electrothermal sensors. The proposed microgripper achieves a large displacement (85 µm) at low driving voltages (≤ 80 V). Closed-loop force control is implemented {{to ensure the}} safety of the operation where the controller gain is experimentally tuned so that the desired response is achieved. One of the main contributions of this work is the implementation of a null-displacement feedback control force-sensing technique, where the controller counteracts the input disturbance (contact force) and an integrated electrothermal displacement sensor provides a <b>feed-back</b> <b>signal</b> to close the control loop. In this manner, the contact force is measured without moving the structure. Finally, the effec-tiveness of the controller and the performance of the proposed microgripper are verified by a set of experiments.

40|$|Cancellation {{control laws}} are {{designed}} which reduce {{the high levels}} of lateral acceleration encountered during aggressive rolling maneuvers executed at high angle of attack. Two independent problem are examined. One is to reduce lateral acceleration at the mass center, while the other focuses on lateral acceleration at the pilot's station, located 7. 0 m forward of the mass center. Both of these problems are challenging and somewhat different in their limitations. In each case the design is based on a linearization of the lateral-directional dynamics about a high angle of attack condition. The controllers incorporate dynamic inversion inner loops to provide control of stability-axis roll- and yaw-rates and then employ cancellation filters in both feed-forward and <b>feed-back</b> <b>signal</b> paths. The relative simplicity of the control laws should allow nonlinear generalizations to be devised. Although it is shown that lateral acceleration can be reduced substantially by such control laws, this is at the cost of slowed roll response, poor dutch-roll damping or a combination of the two...|$|R

Based on its minor concentration in the extracellular space under physiological conditions 1, and the expression of its receptor P 2 X 7 R on different immune cells, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) could function as a danger signal when released from dying cells. We observed increased ATP levels in the peritoneal fluid following total body irradiation, and during the development of GvHD in the mouse and in humans. Stimulation of host type antigen-presenting cells (APC) by ATP led to increased expression of CD 80 /CD 86 and actuated a cascade of proinflammatory events, including STAT 1 phosphorylation, IFN-γ production and donor type T cell expansion, while regulatory T cell frequencies were simultaneously reduced. P 2 X 7 R expression increased when GvHD evolved, rendering APC more responsive to the detrimental effects of ATP, thereby providing positive <b>feed-back</b> <b>signals.</b> ATP neutralization, P 2 X 7 R blockade or genetic deficiency during GvHD development significantly improved survival without global immune paralysis.

40|$|Stem cells confer {{to adult}} tissues the {{capacity}} to maintain morphology and function counterbalancing intrinsic wear and tear (homeostasis) and environmental damages (regeneration). Stem cells are undifferentiated multipotent cells that perpetuate themselves indefinitely. To sustain cell demand from the tissue, they generate progenitors which are able to differentiate to substitute old and/or damaged cells. In the process of cell replacement, feedback mechanisms from the tissue to stem cells ensure adequate proliferation rate and exact lineage specification. Unfortunately, cell turnover is difficult to monitor and regeneration paradigms {{have been widely used}} to infer molecular mechanisms behind homeostatic cell turnover. But actually, very little is known about how mechanisms of regeneration resemble or differ from homeostatic tissue maintenance. In this work, using Drosophila midgut as a model, we investigated directly the basic mechanisms of epithelial homeostasis, in unchallenged conditions. To this end, we devised an original method which allowed detecting tissue turnover in a precise and temporally controllable manner in midguts. We found that in normal homeostatic conditions, midgut turnover follows unexpected asynchronous dynamics and that, surprisingly, progenitor cells sense where exactly to differentiate independently of birth time. We have identified Escargot, a Snail family gene, and the miR- 200 -related microRNA miR- 8, as key intrinsic elements controlling this progenitor behavior during homeostasis. The escargot gene hold progenitors in undifferentiated state repressing mir- 8 locus and conferring them marked mesenchymal traits that we found to be a prerequisite for proper intercalation into the epithelium. Conversely, miR- 8 controls through direct targeting of escargot mRNA, the transition from undifferentiated toward differentiated state by repressing mesenchymal characteristics. The break of this reciprocal regulation impacts on homeostasis by altering the spatial and timing control of progenitors differentiation. Altogether, these results indicated that progenitors are not simple transient and passive entities but active players in homeostasis. Possibly, progenitors are able to integrate local <b>feed-back</b> <b>signals</b> to regulate their cellular state via the antagonic Escargot/miR- 8 action. Given the striking analogies between Escargot/miR- 8 "undifferentiated to differentiated transition" and the Snail/miR- 200 mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), we think the future identification of the signals and molecular mechanisms controlling Escargot and miR- 8 would be of wide-ranging relevance to understand not only homeostasis but also physiological and pathological related MET, as wound healing and metastasis establishment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Large-scale {{distributed}}-antenna system (L-DAS) {{with very}} large number of distributed antennas, possibly up to a few hundred antennas, is considered. A few major issues of the L-DAS, such as high latency, energy consumption, computational complexity, and large feedback (signaling) overhead, are identified. The potential capability of the L-DAS is illuminated in terms of an energy efficiency (EE) throughout the paper. We firstly and gener-ally model the power consumption of an L-DAS, and formulate an EE maximization problem. To tackle two crucial issues, namely the huge computational complexity and large amount of <b>feed-back</b> (<b>signaling)</b> information, we propose a channel-gain-based antenna selection (AS) method and an interference-based user clustering (UC) method. The original problem is then split into multiple subproblems by a cluster, and each cluster’s precoding and power control are managed in parallel for high EE. Simu-lation results reveal that i) using all antennas for zero-forcing multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is energy inefficient if there is nonnegligible overhead power consumption on MU-MIMO processing, and ii) increasing the number of antennas does not necessarily result in a high EE. Furthermore, the results validate and underpin the EE merit of the proposed L-DAS complied with the AS, UC, precoding, and power control by comparing with non-clustering L-DAS and colocated antenna systems.

Additionally, a d. c. motor could be {{attached}} to the lever in order to perform similar passive movements. During performance of the task, single Purkinje cells were recorded from the intermediate part of the cerebellar anterior lobe. Electromyographic activity of the flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm was recorded simultaneously. Passive hand movements evoked changes in the complex spike and simple spike discharge of Purkinje cell. The complex spike responded most sensitively {{to the beginning of the}} movement; the activity pattern had phasic character and could be related specifically to the movement direction. The simple spike response was usually weak and hence revealed-less specific relations. During active movements the simple spike frequency change was generally stronger than during passive movements and reached a maximum (or minimum) at the beginning of hand deflexion. The complex spike activity during active movements was characterized by a contrast between the time phases before and after the movement onset. In most of the cases, where a phase of increased activity stopped at the movement onset, the sensory <b>feed-back</b> <b>signal</b> seen during passive movements was cancelled.

40|$|Recently, Adaptive Secondary Mirrors showed {{excellent}} on-sky {{results in}} the Near Infrared wavelengths. They currently provide 30 mm inter-actuator spacing and about 1 kHz bandwidth. Pushing these devices to be operated at visible wavelengths is a challenging task. Compared to the current systems, working in the infrared, the more demanding requirements are the higher spatial resolution and the greater correction bandwidth. In fact, the turbulence scale is shorter and the parameter variation is faster. Typically, the former is not larger than 25 mm (projected on the secondary mirror) and the latter is 2 kHz, therefore the actuator {{has to be more}} slender and faster than the current ones. With a soft magnetic composite core, a dual-stator and a single-mover, VRALA, the actuator discussed in this paper, attains unprecedented performances with a negligible thermal impact. Pre-shaping the current required to deliver a given stroke greatly simplifies the control system, whose output supplies the current generator.

40|$|Notch 1 is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved transmembrane receptor {{involved in}} melanoma growth. Notch 1 is first cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus {{to produce the}} biologically active heterodimer. Following ligand binding, Notch 1 is cleaved at the cell mem-brane by proteases such as ADAM 10 and- 17 andmembrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP), the latter of which we recently identified as a novel protease involved in Notch 1 processing. The final cleavage is -secretase dependent and releases the active Notch intracellular domain (NIC). We now demonstrate that Notch 1 directly regulates furin expression. Aside from acti-vating Notch 1, furin cleaves and activates several proteases, includingMT 1 -MMP, ADAM 10, and ADAM 17. By chromatin im-munoprecipitation and a reporter assay, we demonstrate that Notch 1 binds at position 1236 of the furin promoter and drives furin expression. The Notch 1 -dependent enhancement of furin expression increases the activities of MT 1 -MMP and ADAM 10 but not that of ADAM 17, as demonstrated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of furin, and promotes the cleavage of Notch 1 itself. These data highlight a novel positive-feedback loop whereby Notch 1 -dependent furin expression can induce Notch 1 signaling by increasing Notch 1 processing and by potentiating {{the activity of the}} proteases responsible for Notch 1 acti-vation. This leads to Notch 1 signal amplification, which can promote melanoma tumor growth and progression, as demon-strated by the inhibition of cell migration and invasion upon furin inhibition downstream of Notch 1.

40|$|Clinical and {{experimental}} evidence demonstrates that endocannabinoids play either beneficial or adverse roles in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Their medical significance {{may be best}} explained by the emerging concept that endocannabinoids are essential modulators of synaptic transmission throughout the central nervous system. However, the precise molecular architecture of the endocannabinoid signaling machinery in the human brain remains elusive. To address this issue, we investigated the synaptic distribution of metabolic enzymes for the most abundant endocannabinoid molecule, 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), in the postmortem human hippocampus. Immunostaining for diacylglycerol lipase-α (DGL-α), the main synthesizing enzyme of 2 -AG, resulted in a laminar pattern corresponding to the termination zones of glutamatergic pathways. The highest density of DGL-α-immunostaining was observed in strata radiatum and oriens of the cornu ammonis and in the inner third of stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus. At higher magnification, DGL-α-immunopositive puncta were distributed throughout the neuropil outlining the immunonegative main dendrites of pyramidal and granule cells. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that this pattern {{was due to the}} accumulation of DGL-α in dendritic spine heads. Similar DGL-α-immunostaining pattern was also found in hippocampi of wild-type, but not of DGL-α knockout mice. Using two independent antibodies developed against monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), the predominant enzyme inactivating 2 -AG, immunostaining also revealed a laminar and punctate staining pattern. However, as observed previously in rodent hippocampus, MGL was enriched in axon terminals instead of postsynaptic structures at the ultrastructural level. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the post- and presynaptic segregation of primary enzymes responsible for synthesis and elimination of 2 -AG, respectively, in the human hippocampus. Thus, molecular architecture of the endocannabinoid signaling machinery supports retrograde regulation of synaptic activity, and its similar blueprint in rodents and humans further indicates that 2 -AG's physiological role as a negative <b>feed-back</b> <b>signal</b> is an evolutionarily conserved feature of excitatory synapses. © 2011 IBRO...|$|R

By using MEMS components in a closed-loop control configuration, the combination of milli-Newton thrust range, sub micro-Newton resolutions, and fast response time can be achieved. In our view, using MEMS technology and integrating the flow control valve, mass flow sensor and chamber/nozzle on a single chip is the best –if not the only- way to realize a closed-loop control thruster that can meet new tough small satellite propulsion requirements. Today, most thrusters and fluid control components are operated in ON/OFF mode and in a control system where the <b>feed-back</b> <b>signal</b> comes from sensors (such as accelerometers, sun sensors or star trackers) on-board the spacecraft.

Conventional, simplified considerations of regulatory mechanism by cytoplasmic ADP according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics or by derived parameters such as phosphate potential etc. do not explain relationships between oxygen consumption, workload and metabolic {{state of the}} cell. On the other hand, there are abundant data in literature showing microheterogeneity of cytoplasmic space in muscle cells, in particular with respect to ATP (and ADP) due to the structural organization of cell interior, existence of multienzyme complexes and structured water phase. Also very recent experimental data show that the intracellular diffusion of ADP is retarded in cardiomyocytes because of very low permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane for adenine nucleotides in vivo. Most probably, permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane porin channels is controlled in the cells in vivo by some intracellular factors which may be connected to cytoskeleton and lost during mitochondrial isolation. All these numerous data show convincingly that cellular metabolism cannot be understood if cell interior is considered as homogenous solution, and {{it is necessary to}} use the theories of organized metabolic systems and substrate-product channelling in multienzyme systems to understand metabolic regulation of respiration. One of these systems is the creatine kinase system, which channels high energy phosphates from mitochondria to sites of energy utilization.

From the discussion, by appropriately scaling the passive filter gain and cooperating with a single-bit quantizer, the hybrid AP loop filtering can achieve an approximated noise-shaping {{function as a}} fully active DR modulator with the same order. The ELD effect in the hybrid AP CT DR modulator which influences the poles and zeros locations of the Noise Transfer Function (NTF) in the modulator is depicted. This paper also investigates the feasibility of applying the ELD compen-sation techniques {{that were used to}} be implemented in the active integrator’s case to the hybrid AP CT DR modulator; however, some of them cannot be practically applied since the passive loop-filter cannot perform proportional <b>feed-back</b> <b>signal</b> summation. After the discussion and analysis, the technique similar to Vadipour et al. (In: Symposium on VLSI circuits digest of technical papers, 2008) can be easily implemented at circuit-level and after applying it, there is one additional zero to compensate the peak in the NTF. With the help of this technique, the maximum quantizer delay tolerance can be a full clock period. The mentioned ELD compensation technique was applied in a 2 nd order CT DR modulator with an active-RC integrator as the 1 st stage and a passive RC filter as the 2 nd stage, which was verified by transistor-level simulations in 65 nm CMOS. The circuit exhibits either 67. 3 dB or 65. 3 of SNDR, under the effect of half clock period or one clock period ELD, respectively; by contrast, without compensa-tion, the system is unstable with both half or one clock period ELD effect.

This interface aims at providing visually impaired people with a capability of perception of the environment. As a first step of this on-going project, the purpose is to verify the hypothesis {{that it is possible to}} use sounds from musical instruments to replace color. Compared to state of the art devices, a quality of the See ColOr interface is that it allows the user to receive a <b>feed-back</b> auditory <b>signal</b> from the environment and its colors, promptly. Two experiments based on a head mounted camera have been performed. The first experiment pertaining to object manipulation is based on the pairing of colored socks, while the second experiment is related to outdoor navigation with the goal of following a colored serpentine. The ``socks'' experiment demonstrated that seven blindfolded individuals were able to accurately match pairs of colored socks. The same participants successfully followed a red serpentine for more than 80 meters...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been {{dramatic}} advances in the miniaturization of electromechanical devices. Most of the micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS-NEMS) operate in the resonant modes 1. The micron-, and, the more, the submicron-sizes devices, are driven usually by electrostatic forces, as piezoelectric and electromagnetic engines are powerless over this size range. Such engines could {{play the role of}} external actuators for the NEMS, being, however, macro devices in their own. Apart from actuation, an objective of NEMS is getting the output signal characterizing the oscillations 1, so, actuators sensing their own motion are rather topical (see 2 for example). Not long ago, several works appeared demonstrating high sensitivity of the sizes 3, 4 and form 5 of quasi one-dimensional conductors to the deformations of the charge-density wave (CDW). Here we demonstrate electrically driven torsional resonators based on whiskers of the quasi one-dimensional conductor with CDW, TaS 3. The driving force for the torsional deformation is peculiar to the CDW systems and reflects the transmission of the CDW deformation to the crystalline lattice. In comparison with the piezoelectrics, the effect of electric field on the crystal deformation is 3 - 4 orders of magnitude larger. The resonator is found to provide also a torsion-induced electrical <b>feed-back</b> (output <b>signal)</b> from the oscillations. We discuss the CDW systems as promising elements for NEMS-MEMS.

40|$|The GTPase RhoA {{participates in}} a number of {{cellular}} processes, including cytoskeletal organization, mitogenesis and tumorigenesis. We have previously shown that the transforming activity of an oncogenic version of RhoA (Q 63 L mutant) was highly dependent on the transcriptional factor c–Myc. In contrast to these positive effects in the RhoA route, we show here that c–Myc affects negatively the F–actin cytoskeleton induced by RhoAQ 63 L and its downstream effector, the serine/threonine kinase Rock. This effect entails the activation of a transcriptional program that requires synergistic interactions with RhoA–derived signals and that includes the upregulation of the GTPase Cdc 42 and its downstream element Pak 1 as well as the repression of specific integrin subunits. The negative effects of c–Myc in the F–actin cytoskeleton are eliminated by the establishment of cell–to–cell contacts, an effect associated with the rescue of Pak 1 and integrin levels at the post–transcriptional and transcriptional levels, respectively. These results reveal the presence of a hitherto unknown <b>signaling</b> <b>feed–back</b> loop between RhoA and c– Myc oncogenes that can contribute to maintain fluid cytoskeletal dynamics in cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are {{excitatory}} interneurons {{found in}} the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the granule cell layer of cerebellar cortex, being particularly evident in the paraflocculus (PFL) and flocculus (FL). UBCs receive glutamatergic inputs and make glutamatergic synapses with granule cells and other UBCs. It has been hypothesized that UBCs comprise local networks of tunable feed-forward amplifiers. In the DCN they might also participate in <b>feed-back</b> amplification of <b>signals</b> from higher auditory centers. Recently {{it has been shown}} that UBCs, in the vestibulocerebellum and DCN of adult rats, express doublecortin (DCX), previously considered a marker of newborn and migrating neurons. In an animal model, both the DCN, and more recently the PFL, have been implicated in contributing to the sensation of acoustic-exposure-induced tinnitus. These studies support the working hypothesis that tinnitus emerges after loss of peripheral sensitivity because inhibitory processes homeostatically down regulate, and excitatory processes up regulate. Here we report the results of two sequential experiments that examine the potential role of DCN and cerebellar UBCs in tinnitus, and the contribution of glutamatergic transmission in the PFL. In Experiment 1 it was shown that adult rats with psychophysical evidence of tinnitus induced by a single unilateral high-level noise exposure, had elevated DCX in the DCN and ventral PFL. In Experiment 2 it was shown that micro-quantities of glutamatergic antagonists, delivered directly to the PFL, reversibly reduced chronically established tinnitus, while similarly applied glutamatergic agonists induced tinnitus-like behavior i...|$|R
