500|$|Rolling Stone {{contributor}} Doug Pratt {{called it}} a [...] "high point" [...] of the first season. Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register said of the episode, [...] "All this proves once again that animated series are great platforms for hot topics that live action shows don't dare <b>grab</b> <b>head</b> on. South Park allegory {{of good and evil}} is more apt and knowing than anything seen on Christy or Touched by an Angel. Funnier too." [...] However, Littlefield also said some of the show's graphic dialogue, like the phrase [...] "poop on a stick", was growing [...] "pretty darn redundant". Gary Budzak of The Columbus Dispatch described the [...] "Damien" [...] episode as perhaps [...] "the most outrageous yet". Virginia Rohan of The Record praised the episode, saying, [...] "The episode is funny, and ultimately, good does conquer evil, albeit for all the wrong reasons." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Lon Grahnke gave the episode three stars and called it simultaneously strange and funny. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News called the episode [...] "awfully funny" [...] and praised its satirical element, although he warned it was potentially very offensive to some viewers: [...] "A scene in which the kids offer profane between-rounds encouragement to Jesus could make even thick-skinned viewers wince a bit." [...] Likewise, Star-Ledger reporter Matt Zoller Seitz said, [...] "Tonight's episode is crazy, vulgar and borderline blasphemous; it is also, if you're in the right frame of mind, paralyzingly funny." ...|$|E
