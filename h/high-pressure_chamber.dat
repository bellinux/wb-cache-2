40|$|Abstract: Reaction thrusts of {{submerged}} water jets {{for different}} cylindrical nozzles are inves-tigated numerically and experimentally. Simplified {{models of the}} pressure distribution on the interior walls of <b>high-pressure</b> <b>chambers,</b> the reaction thrust of water jets and the thrust coeffi-cients are all established {{on the basis of}} the general characteristics of the isobaric surface near the inlet of the nozzle, respectively. Simulation studies on the reaction thrust are also conducted through a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package called FLUENT. In particular, the effects of the inlet conditions as well as the nozzle dimensions on the reaction thrust of the water jet are addressed. Comparison analyses are also performed on the results of the simplified models, the CFD simulation and the experiments. It is concluded from the results that: (a) the model results and the CFD simulation results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results; (b) the nozzle diameter and the inlet conditions exert a significant influence on the reaction thrust of the water jet; and (c) the reaction thrust coefficient is almost a constant, ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 3.

40|$|Investigative {{research}} efforts using a cardiovascular model required {{the determination of}} central circulatory haemodynamic and arterial system parameters {{for the evaluation of}} cardiovascular performance. These calculations required continuous beat-to-beat measurement of pressure within the four chambers of the heart and great vessels. Sensitivity and offset drift, longevity, and sources of error for eight 3 F dual-tipped micromanometers were determined during 21 days of implantation in goats. Subjects were instrumented with pairs of chronically implanted fluid-filled access catheters in the left and right ventricles, through which dual-tipped (test) micromanometers were chronically inserted and single-tip (standard) micromanometers were acutely inserted. Acutely inserted sensors were calibrated daily and measured pressures were compared in vivo to the chronically inserted sensors. Comparison of the pre- and post-gain calibration of the chronically inserted sensors showed a mean sensitivity drift of 1. 0 +/- 0. 4 % (99 % confidence, n = 9 sensors) and mean offset drift of 5. 0 +/- 1. 5 mmHg (99 % confidence, n = 9 sensors). Potential sources of error for these drifts were identified, and included measurement system inaccuracies, temperature drift, hydrostatic column gradients, and dynamic pressure changes. Based upon these findings, we determined that these micromanometers may be chronically inserted in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>chambers</b> for up to 17 days with an acceptable error, but should be limited to acute (hours) insertions in low-pressure applications...|$|R
