40|$|Over {{the last}} decade states passed {{hundreds}} of <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> covering a range of policy areas. This article considers the recent state legislative surge against scholarly treatments of immigration federalism, and identifies the symbolic politics in state lawmaking. The analysis combines a historical treatment of key court decisions that delineated boundaries {{of state and federal}} immigration roles with a legislative analysis of over 2200 <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> passed between 2006 and 2013, to identify the numerous ways in which national immigration policy shapes state measures. It argues that recent laws must be considered against symbolic federalism which privileges state sovereignty and justifies social policy devolution by advancing frames of intergovernmental conflict, state-level policy pragmatism, and federal ineffectiveness...|$|R
50|$|In {{what was}} {{essentially}} a replay of the 2006 actions, on June 6, 2007 the US Senate again voted on two separate amendments to a subsequent <b>immigration</b> reform <b>bill</b> that closely resembled the amendments to the 2006 Senate bill. Ultimately, neither the 2006 nor 2007 <b>immigration</b> reform <b>bill</b> has become law.|$|R
25|$|The nationalists, {{identified}} as Lolita Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores Rodríguez, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and began shooting at Representatives in the 83rd Congress, who were debating an <b>immigration</b> <b>bill.</b> Five Representatives were wounded, one seriously, but all recovered. The assailants were arrested, tried and convicted in federal court, and given long sentences, effectively life imprisonment. In 1978 and 1979, they were pardoned by President Jimmy Carter; all four returned to Puerto Rico.|$|E

He believes so-called sanctuary policies provide safe havens for criminals. Tancredo also mentioned his support of the building of a fence between Mexico and the United States, and that mayors and city council members who adopt sanctuary city policies should face criminal charges. He urged New Hampshire Governor John Lynch to veto an upcoming <b>immigration</b> <b>bill</b> and demanded the ouster of the bill's sponsors.|$|E

40|$|In 2006, massive protests drew {{well over}} 1 million undocumented {{immigrants}} and their supporters {{to the streets of}} major U. S. cities. The protesters were asking for a comprehensive bill to reform the failing U. S. immigration system. But a year later, there was still no comprehensive reform, only a public opinion backlash and an unfunded bill to build a fence along the U. S. -Mexico border. Were protesters adopting the wrong strategy by hyping up their cause? ^ More than 2, 000 <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> introduced in the U. S. House and Senate from 1980 to 2005 were studied with an original scale to test three hypotheses [...] -that <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> were more symbolic during years of high hype, that they were more anti-immigrant in years of high hype and that legislators from districts along the U. S. -Mexico border were generally less likely to draft symbolic, anti-immigrant bills than their non-border counterparts, regardless of hype. Symbolic, anti-immigrant bills have realworld consequences because their very introduction reinforces negative stereotypes about {{immigrants and their}} possible passage into law can hurt immigrants. The focus of this study is the relationship between hype, or mediatized public interest, and symbolic, anti-immigrant legislation, such as the fence bill. ^ In results represented visually by graphics, highly symbolic bills such as resolutions followed the highs and lows of hype and anti-immigrant bills, such as those focusing on alien criminals and terrorists, followed even closer. This was especially true after the 1990 s backlash made anti-immigrant public opinion a political force to be reckoned with. Border legislators showed greater sensitivity to immigration issues by drafting proportionally more <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> than their non-border counterparts and less anti-immigrant bills. This study seems to suggest that hype is not conducive to the drafting of substantial and pro-immigrant <b>immigration</b> <b>bills.</b> Pressuring legislators through public and media pressure may be counterproductive for those seeking meaningful legislation. ...|$|R

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his presidency, Obama supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for many immigrants illegally residing in the United States. However, Congress did not pass a comprehensive <b>immigration</b> <b>bill</b> during Obama's tenure, and Obama turned to executive actions. In the 2010 lame-duck session, Obama supported passage of the DREAM Act, which passed the House but failed to overcome a Senate filibuster in a 55-41 vote in favor of the bill. In 2013, the Senate passed an <b>immigration</b> <b>bill</b> with a path to citizenship, but the House did not vote on the bill. In 2012, Obama implemented the DACA policy, which protected roughly 700,000 illegal immigrants from deportation; the policy applies only to those who were brought to the United States before their 16th birthday. In 2014, Obama announced a new executive order that would have protected another four million illegal immigrants from deportation, but the order was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 4-4 tie vote that upheld a lower court's ruling. Despite executive actions to protect some individuals, deportations of illegal immigrants continued under Obama. A record high of 400,000 deportations occurred in 2012, though the number of deportations fell during Obama's second term. In continuation of a trend that began {{with the passage of the}} Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the percentage of foreign-born people living in the United States reached 13.7% in 2015, higher than at any point since the early 20th century. After having risen since 1990, the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States stabilized at around 11.5 million individuals during Obama's presidency, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007.|$|E
25|$|As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod {{helped to}} found the {{homeless}} charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a {{decision of the}} Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government’s Commonwealth <b>Immigration</b> <b>Bill,</b> believing {{it to be a}} breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod's subsequent dealings with him were, Powell said, as if he was a pariah though Macleod 'knew what I said was not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved as if he did not know'. Powell's speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many {{of the members of the}} public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} factors that affect how legislators respond when faced with immigration policy matters. In contrast to previous theories of immigration policymaking, I propose that public opinion affects how legislators respond, particularly in areas experiencing large demographic change due to immigration. Legislators respond to public opinion because they first and foremost are motivated by electoral concerns. Therefore, they are most responsive to those constituents whose votes can help them win reelection, and are least responsive to immigrant constituents in their districts who cannot vote. I test this theory by examining how public opinion and demographic change affected legislators’ roll call votes on key <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> and legislators’ cosponsorship of <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> in the 109 th Congress. I use public opinion data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Study and demographic indicators from the 2005 American Community Survey. I also test other alternative explanations of how legislators respond to immigration policy issues, including the effect of minority legislators, economic interests that depend on immigrant labor, and racial threat. I find that legislators are responsive to public opinion when deciding immigration policy issues, whether they are voting on <b>immigration</b> <b>bills</b> or cosponsoring <b>immigration</b> legislation. The effect of public opinion is more salient in areas experiencing large demographic changes from immigration; however, this effect differs between Democratic and Republican legislators. I also find support for alternative explanations, particularly among minority legislators and economic interests, but these effects are mixed and depend {{on the type of}} bill proposed...|$|R
