5000|$|A hyfrecator is a low-powered medical {{apparatus}} used in electrosurgery on conscious patients, {{usually in}} an office setting. It is used to destroy tissue directly, and to stop bleeding during minor surgery. It works by emitting low-power high-frequency high-voltage AC electrical pulses, via an electrode mounted on a handpiece, directly to the affected area of the body. A continuous electrical spark discharge may be drawn between probe and tissue, especially at the highest settings of power, although this is not necessary for the device to function. The amount of output power is adjustable, and {{the device is equipped}} with different tips, electrodes and forceps, depending on the electrosurgical requirement. Unlike other types of electrosurgery, the hyfrecator does not employ a dispersive <b>electrode</b> <b>pad</b> that is attached to the patient in an area not being treated, and that leads back to the apparatus (sometimes loosely but not quite correctly called a [...] "ground pad"). It is designed to work with non-grounded (insulated) patients.|$|E

Initial shock was 100  J which, if unsuccessful, was followed by 200  J, 300  J, and 360  J if required. Peak current and transthoracic impedance were measured.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Cardioversion success rate and energy requirements.  RESULTS—Cardioversion was successful in 81 % of the patients (73 / 90). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the cardioversion success rate (AA 84 %, 38 / 45 patients; AP 78 %, 35 / 45 patients; p =  0. 42) or mean (SD) energy requirement for all patients (AA 223  (96. 1) J; AP 232  (110) J) or for patients who were successfully cardioverted (AA 197. 9  (82. 4) J; AP 195. 4  (97. 2) J; p =  0. 9) between the two pad positions. The mean transthoracic impedance (TTI) for the first shock (AA 77. 5  (18. 4) ohms; AP 73. 7  (18. 7) ohms; p =  0. 34) was not significantly different between the two groups. TTI correlated significantly with body mass index, percentage body fat, and chest AP diameter. There was a progressive decrease in TTI with serial shocks. While aetiology and TTI were the two independent significant predictive factors for energy requirement, duration of atrial fibrillation was the only independent predictor of cardioversion success in a multivariate analysis.  CONCLUSIONS—Electrode pad position is not a determinant of cardioversion success rate or energy requirement.    Keywords: atrial fibrillation; cardioversion; <b>electrode</b> <b>pad</b> positio...|$|E

40|$|Sudden {{cardiac arrest}} (SCA) {{is a major}} cause of death in Canada and {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States and Europe with {{survival}} rates as low as 5 %. Defibrillation is the key intervention for improving survival from SCA and can increase survival up to 75 %. This has sparked the movement to increase public access to defibrillation by placing automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public areas such as universities, shopping centers, and athletic centers. The effectiveness of AEDs to revive those with SCA is dependent on the design of these devices. The purpose of this study was (1) to evaluate the design features that aid or hinder the effective and timely use of three commercially available AEDs using a heuristic evaluation; (2) to rank the three AEDs in terms of overall usability based on user comments and preference, and the severity of usability heuristic violations; and (3) develop design recommendations to guide the future design of AEDs.

Electroless Cu plating was also applied after chemical polymerization of PPy to improve the conductivity of the fabric pad. Per-formance of prepared stretchable conductive fabric pad was evaluated in terms of conductivity changes as a function of extension and continuous current application time, and clin-ical test. As a result, the fabric conductivity was well main-tained with extension up to 60 % and prolonged treatment time over 30 min. The effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was observed with prepared TENS pad in this study and conventional TENS pad for medical use. The significant effect of TENS was observed with a pad made of conductive fabric by Cu plating and a conventional TENS pad (P 0. 05, respectively). Even though the efficiency of an experimental pad made of fabric composite with electrochemically polymerized PPy was not as good as conventional TENS pad for medical use in this exper-iment, it can possibly be used for other applications where relatively low-strength electrical pulse is required. © 2004 Wile...|$|E

This systematic review examines the evidence for different training methods of basic life support providers (laypersons and healthcare providers) using standard instructor-led courses as comparators, to assess whether alternative method of training can lead to effective skill acquisition, skill retention and actual performance whilst using the AED. Method OVID Medline (including Medline 1950 -November 2010; EMBASE 1988 -November 2010) was searched using “training” OR “teaching” OR “education” as text words. Search was then combined by using AND “AED” OR “automatic external defibrillator” as MESH words. Additionally, the American Heart Association Endnote library was searched with the terms “AED” and “automatic external defibrillator”. Resuscitation journal was hand searched for relevant articles.

40|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) uses electrode pads {{placed on the}} head to deliver weak direct current to the brain and modulate neuronal excitability. The effects depend on the intensity and spatial distribution of the electric field. This in turn depends on the geometry and electric properties of the head tissues and electrode pads. Previous numerical studies focused on providing a reasonable level of detail of the head anatomy, often using simplified electrode models. Here, we explore via finite element method (FEM) simulations based on a high-resolution head model how detailed electrode modeling influences the calculated electric field in the brain. We take into account electrode shape, size, connector position and conductivities of different electrode materials (including saline solutions and electrode gels). These factors are systematically characterized to demonstrate {{their impact on the}} field distribution in the brain. The goals are to assess the effect of simplified electrode models; and to develop practical rules-of-thumb to achieve a stronger stimulation of the targeted brain regions underneath the electrode pads. We show that for standard rectangular electrode pads, lower saline and gel conductivities result in more homogeneous fields the region of interest (ROI). Placing the connector {{at the center of the}} <b>electrode</b> <b>pad</b> or farthest from the second electrode substantially increases the field strength in the ROI.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the bipolar {{technique}} of resecting the prostate has become available worldwide, and currently alongside other minimally invasive techniques, especially different laser modalities, challenges the monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) as being the gold standard in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The proposed advantages of bipolar resection are improved haemostasis, better intraoperative visualisation, use of saline as an irrigant, which reduces the risk for TUR syndrome, shorter catheterisation time and reduced hospital stay. This study compares monopolar and bipolar TURP with respect to safety, efficacy and complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was performed in the Department of Urology, Rajarajeswari Medical College and Hospital, Bangalore from March 2015 to March 2016 after ethics committee clearance. Fifty patients with bladder outlet obstruction due to BPH were randomised into two groups (the first managed by standard monopolar TURP and the second managed by bipolar TURP). RESULTS Resection and operative time is comparable in both groups. Volume of the irrigation fluid used was less in Bipolar group, but this difference was statistically insignificant. In Bipolar TURP, change in Serum Na levels postoperatively is less compared to monopolar group and this difference is statistically significant. Postoperative catheter duration was found same in both groups. Although postoperative hospital stay and patients requiring blood transfusion was less in bipolar group, this difference was not found significant statistically. Postoperative complication rate in bipolar group was less {{but it was not}} statistically significant. CONCLUSION Bipolar TURP has an equivalent complication profile; however, the elimination of a patient return <b>electrode</b> <b>pad</b> and toxicity from hypo-osmolar irrigation fluids may provide an extra level of patient safety.

Throughout the Shuttle program these electrodes experienced failures during several EVAs performed from the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) airlocks. An attempt during Shuttle Flight STS- 109 to replace the old electrodes with new commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) disposable electrodes proved unsuccessful. One assumption for failure of the STS- 109 COTS electrodes was the expansion of trapped gases under the foam <b>electrode</b> <b>pad,</b> causing the electrode to be displaced from the skin. Given that our current electrodes provide insufficient reliability, a number of COTS ECG electrodes were tested at the NASA Altitude Manned Chamber Test Facility.

Additionally, the magnetic tweezers apparatus is large and not amenable to miniaturization and integration into microfluidic systems. Another approach involves the synchronization of two droplet trains followed by electrocoalescence and splitting [22]. One droplet train contained magnetic particles in a background solution to be washed away, the other droplet train contained wash buffer into which the magnetic particles are transferred. The droplet trains are forced through a rail-road network of channels to equilibrate pressure and synchronize the positions and velocities of the droplets. Droplets are then electrocoalesced at a junction proximal to a stationary magnetic field, thereby transferring magnetic microparticles into the wash buffer droplet prior to physical splitting of the electrocoalesced droplet into two daughter droplets. In spite of relatively efficient washing in a single step, multiple failure mechanisms were observed and throughput was low due to the required synchronization of droplet trains in the rail-road network.|$|R
50|$|The Human Research Facility (HRF) Holter {{accessories}} kit is stowed during {{launch and}} landing. Prior {{to using the}} Holter, the crew-member takes the HRF Holter accessories kit from stowage, uses the razor to shave the electrode sites, wipes the area clean with biocide wipes, and applies the <b>electrode</b> <b>pads</b> to the chest in the configuration depicted on the placard. The crew-member then dons the hardware, attaches the Holter harness to the main unit, and activates the hardware. At {{the end of the}} recording period, the crew-member deactivates, doffs, and stows the hardware. For data download, the crew-member removes the hard disk card assembly from the main unit, plugs the card into the HRF personal computer (PC), and downloads the data to the HRF PC. Downlink of the Holter data is accomplished as part of HRF rack activities.|$|R
