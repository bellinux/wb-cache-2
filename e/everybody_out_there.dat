500|$|Chater {{has noted}} that [...] "Sunshine" [...] was {{included}} in the album at the last minute but is one of his favorite tracks on Wildflower. [...] "It starts off appearing like it's a very happy, joyous song," [...] says Chater, [...] "but there's a twist in the tale when the sample reveals that it's actually about someone having their sunshine taken away – the blue skies turn grey. It's really a song for <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who's every lost love, who's ever been broken-hearted." [...] The lyrics to [...] "If I Was a Folkstar" [...] were written by Toro y Moi about him and his wife taking LSD on the beach shortly after they got married. The title of the album, Wildflower, was chosen for its simplicity. The group was inspired by other albums with simple titles which do not distract from the music, such as Smile by the Beach Boys. The cover art is a direct reference to Sly and the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) [...] in order to draw from the record's rebellious counter-culture nature, however approaching a more psychedelic style.|$|E

You could ride, and you would know just <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Perhaps if you stay on to take your degree, we might marry immediately after that.

According to WAGT in Augusta, Georgia (whose service area includes part of South Carolina) Sanford declared that it would be his last campaign.|$|R
5000|$|Thus Bugs stays to torment Elmer, {{and many}} hijinks ensue, {{including}} Bugs posing as Elmer's shower faucets {"Gurgle, gurgle. Why don't ya' pay ya' water bill, Doc?"} {{and a doctor}} ("Dr. Killpatient", parodying Dr. Kildare), painting a room with red, yellow and blue spots to make Elmer think he sees spots before his eyes (which is the 1st symptom of Rabbititus) and pretending to be Elmer's {{reflection in the mirror}} (a scene inspired by the famous mirror scene in the Marx Brothers' film, Duck Soup) and his own rabbity image reflected at him in a mirror that's really just Bugs after the glass has been removed. And when Dr. Killpatient (Bugs) tests Elmer's reflexes, Elmer goes into a familiar Russian kick dance, and Bugs decides to join him in a busby hat and boots; the subsequent heys are hilarious! Finally, Elmer sees Bugs' game and chases {{him out of the house}} with a shotgun. But Bugs quickly halts the chase and, in an unusually lengthy breaking of the fourth wall, even by Bugs' standards, he convinces Elmer that members of the audience are now afflicted with rabbititis by saying [...] "Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look, the people <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the audience - the lady there with the long ears. They're getting longer all the time. And the guy back there in the seventeenth row with the cute tomato - he's gettin' all fuzzy. Yeah, they've got it. <b>Everybody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there's</b> got rabbititis! Yaah!" [...] which causes Elmer to flee back into his house in a terror of panic.|$|R

I wouldn't promise to marry him till he did. <b>Everybody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> knows his career, and most people think he got his money underhand, but he tells me he didn't, and I take his word. Every dollar he spends on me or on our home comes out of some mines he owns. I told him I wouldn't touch a dollar of the saloon money--and I won't. Some folks think I don't care, but I do. I don't like the saloon business, and he got out and he's livin' {{straight}} now, as straight as any man. It's pretty hard on him, too, though he won't admit it. He must get awful sick of sittin' round the way he does. I tell him he needn't cut out all his old cronies on my account. He says he ain't sufferin', but it's like shuttin' a bronco up in the corral and lettin' the herd go back into the hills." ...|$|E

This has been brewing since april, and {{is starting to}} get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).I've currently ported bash(1.08)and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd {{like to know what}} features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(. Linus Torvalds ...|$|E

I've been lost in life, I'm still lost in life in these sense of trying to find your way back to that person who your grandmother or father wanted you to be.

Earnhardt continued down the backstretch and spun down the track. Earnhardt said afterwards that he [...] "knew I {{was going to hit}} the wall.

It was kind of weird back there. I’m not really sure what kind of car we had. I thought in clean air we weren’t too bad, but I guess a lot of people could say that.
