40|$|Context Humanwildlife {{conflict}} {{is a global}} problem and increasing worldwide as people and wildlife compete for limited resources. Conflict between people and crocodiles, especially in Africa, is recognised as a serious problem. The people of the Chiawa Game Management Area are heavily dependent on the Zambezi River for several resources from potable water and <b>irrigating</b> <b>fields</b> to a source of food (subsistence and small-scale commercial fishing). Aims To assess the spatial and temporal scale of humancrocodile conflict (HCC) and identify associated factors, {{with a view to}} recommending mitigation measures. Methods A questionnaire survey and Zambia Wildlife Authority data were utilised to estimate the scale of HCC. Key results Between 2000 and 2009, there were 98 crocodile attacks on people, 62. 2 % were fatal. Most of the attacks occurred while canoe fishing (57. 1 %) and collecting water (29. 6 %). Crocodiles were disliked and seen as a 'problem' by the majority of the populace. Even though crocodiles are a charismatic mega-fauna species, being employed within the tourism industry had only a minor positive effect on people's attitudes. The area is an important location for crocodile egg and adult harvesting, although the local population gains no financial benefit. An {{increase in the number of}} boreholes in the villages was suggested by the local people as the primary mitigation measure, as well as the removal of crocodiles by various means. Conclusions Although people displayed an understanding of the risks of crocodile attack, very few actually employed mitigation techniques or utilised protective barriers when at the river. Increased water-access points (and their maintenance) in the villages would reduce people's dependency on the river. The negative attitude towards crocodiles is an issue that has to be addressed to allow successful implementation of long-term conservation strategies. Implications Understanding local people's attitudes towards wildlife is an important aspect within any conservation management plan. Competition for limited resources by people and wildlife is guaranteed to cause confrontations. The existing mitigation for human crocodile conflict in Zambia is ineffective. The negative attitude towards wildlife needs to be addressed and a suitable response formulated. The most favoured type of mitigation suggested by local people was more boreholes and the removal of crocodiles. Photograph by Kevin Wallace. © CSIRO 2011...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This {{thesis is}} {{a case study of}} the Warner Valley Stock Company, a large eastern Oregon Stock Ranch, which {{utilizes}} over 680, 000 acres of government grazing land. The purpose is to examine the background growth, and forces affecting the ranch. The relationship of man to land can be understood by presenting an organized view of the resources available and how he has utilized them. The ranch is located in South Warner Valley, 35 miles east of Lakeview, Oregon. The valley, a graben 4400 to 4500 feet above sea level, is surrounded by a higher, rolling plateau with elevations ranging from 5000 to 7000 feet. The high desert rangeland has a sparse sagebrush-bunch grass vegetation. Warner Valley is an interior drainage basin which accumulates water for irrigation on valley fields. The natural vegetation of the valley floor consists of tules, willows, and native grasses which supply hay. Early settlers arrived in the late 1860 's and by the late 1870 's a a number of people settled and an estimated 7000 to 8000 head of cattle were present, grazing on the range in the summer and wintering in the valley. The present ranch lands are owned {{largely as a result of}} land granted by Oregon through Swamp Land Laws. A controversy raged between homesteading settlers and the company for years, but was finally settled in favor of the company. Immediately after buying the company in 1936, William Kittridge began reclamation by constructing dikes and canals to control the water. Cultivating and <b>irrigating</b> <b>fields</b> to grow grain was also initiated. This reclamation program continues, with the most highly developed land now producing four tons of alfalfa annually per acre. Grazing rights on over 680, 000 acres of government grazing lands are leased by the Company and support cattle five to seven months of the year while hay and grain crops are grown on the ranch. Grazing is controlled by the BLM through issuance of permits. Increasing competition by man for other uses of the rangeland such as wildlife refuges and recreation are a source of concern for the rancher. BLM is developing the range with multiple use concept in mind to achieve the maximum use possible. More intensive management of the range is increasing the rangecost to the rancher. This is a large concern with annual operating expenses of over one million dollars, a cattle inventory of approximately 15, 000 head (including calves) and a feed mill-feed lot installation which assists in raising the animals from calves to finished market animals. The principle market is California, with transportation being a costly factor. The ranch as it now exists is the result of many forces. The physical elements place restrictions on the land, the most important being aridity, which does not allow diversification of agricultural production. At present cattle grazing is the most efficient land use. The large meat eating public assures a continued demand, although market requirements may deviate...|$|E

40|$|Water harvesting, {{storage and}} reutilization for crop {{production}} {{is an important}} component of research for sustainable agricultural development in the dry regions. Traditionally in southern India, water storage tanks {{are an integral part of}} villages and the water is used for recharging groundwater and <b>irrigating</b> <b>fields.</b> Over the years, the storage capacity of tanks gets reduced due to sediment deposits from erosion and runoff processes. During 2001, the Government of Andhra Pradesh undertook the ‘Neeru-Meeru’ (Water and You) initiative in Medak district, for desiltation of tanks during the dry season. We assessed the viability of desilting operations and economic value of potential utilization of sediments desilted from tanks for its nutrient value. The sediment samples collected from 21 tanks spread out in 11 mandals of the Medak district were analyzed for their plant nutrient content and microbiological properties. On an average, the sediment samples contained 720 mg nitrogen (N) and 320 mg phosphorus (P) per kg of sediment. The organic carbon (C) content of sediment varied from 5. 3 g kg- 1 to 27. 2 g kg- 1, with a mean value of 10. 7 g C kg- 1 of sediment. The application of 48, 777 tons of sediments to agricultural lands returned 520 tons of C to fields, thereby enhancing the nutrient availability for crop production. The microbiological assays indicated that the sediment samples had higher counts of bacteria (20 - 30 × 104 colony forming units [CFU] g- 1 of sediment) and actinomycetes followed by fungi. The benefit-cost (B/C) ratio of desilting operation and its utilization as plant nutrient source of N and P varied from 0. 62 to 3. 44 with an average ratio of 1. 17. This suggests economic feasibility for the application of tank sediment to agricultural fields for crop production in addition to increased water storage capacity, groundwater recharge and availability of more irrigation water. The data obtained from 21 tanks was used for extrapolating results to the entire district in which a total of 78 tanks were desilted. The approach used for extrapolation utilized the N and P composition of sediments from the nearest available sediment value to compute for rest of the tanks in the district. The overall mean N, P and organic C content in the sediments was calculated to be 730 mg kg- 1 sediment, 357 mg kg- 1 sediment and 11. 64 g C kg- 1 sediment respectively. In the district, a total of 246831 tons of sediments from 78 tanks were desilted and addition of these sediments back to farms would return 183 tons of N, 86 tons of P and 2873 tons of organic carbon. On an average, the B/C ratio for desilting operations from water tanks based on the economic plant nutrient value (N and P content) of the district was calculated to be 1. 23 which reflects a positive benefit for the cost incurred in the ‘Neeru-Meeru’ program. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{morphological}} and physical characteristics, {{as well as}} flow behaviour of a Mediterranean Vertisol {{under the influence of}} two different irrigation systems currently used for irrigation, i. e. drip and sprinkler systems, were compared. No differences in soil texture, compaction and in potential cracking were found on cores from the two fields. However, field application of methylene blue showed the presence of continuous macropores, penetrating up to depths of 20 - 25 cm from the soil surface, in the field where the drip system was in use (field 1). This was considered to be the pre-existing soil structure. Instead, macropores terminating at a depth ranging between 5 and 10 cm from the soil surface were observed in the sprinkler <b>irrigated</b> <b>field</b> (field 2). The same difference in terms of macropores' continuity was also observed on soil cores sampled from the two <b>irrigated</b> <b>fields.</b> The higher raindrop impact and the non-point water application involved in the sprinkler irrigation system were assumed to have determined, during several years, the different depth of penetration of the macropores in the two fields. A different hydraulic behaviour was evidenced by laboratory measurement of bypass flow on soil cores taken from the two fields. Specifically, higher values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity were found in the cores from the drip <b>irrigated</b> <b>field</b> compared to those sampled in the sprinkler field. In addition no bypass flow was measured in the columns under the sprinkler field, while high rates and amounts of bypass flow were obtained in the cores taken from the drip <b>irrigated</b> <b>field.</b> The different hydraulic behaviour observed in the cores taken from the drip and from the sprinkler <b>irrigated</b> <b>field</b> was in agreement with the difference in terms of macropores' continuity between the two fields. Being bypass flow a mechanism inducing leaching of solutes, results of this investigation suggest that irrigation systems affecting soil structure, and altering macropores' continuity, should be avoided in clay soils.

The study area is Bist Doab area in Punjab and the analysis was carried out for two agro-climatic regions, both semi-arid, one having medium to high rainfall and the other having low to medium rainfall. The first location (Changarwan) is predominantly canal and well irrigated, whereas the second location (Skohpur) has well irrigation and conjunctive use. The analysis involved working out an index called “irrigation quality index ” for different types of irrigation systems, and then compares water productivity of individual crops vis-à-vis estimated values of this index, for each location.
