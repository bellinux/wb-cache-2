5000|$|There is {{considerable}} debate concerning the legal {{effect of the}} protocol. One view, shared by Jan Jirásek, is that the protocol is an opt-out that excludes {{the application of the}} Charter to Poland and the United Kingdom. Another, shared by Ingolf Pernice, is that the protocol is only an <b>interpretative</b> <b>protocol</b> which will either have limited or no legal consequence. Craig and de Burcá argue that the protocol is merely declaratory. It says that the [...] "Charter does not extend the ability" [...] of the ECJ or other court to overturn UK or Polish law, but the ECJ already had the power to do this in any case. Accordingly, the Protocol is [...] "unlikely that it will have any significant effect in practice".|$|E

The Supreme Court has relatively recently defined public welfare offenses as those, which a reasonable person would know are subject to strict public regulation, could threaten public health and safety, and relate to activities that are both 2 ̆ 2 dangerous 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 uncommon. 2 ̆ 2 Despite a relatively clear definition, practitioners and judges are left to determine which mental state word applies to each element of the regulatory offense and whether the offense falls within the 2 ̆ 2 public welfare offense 2 ̆ 2 category at all. Using the criminal provisions of the federal Clean Water Act in section 309 (c) and its judicial interpretations as a guidepost, the author argues that Congress should redraft the federal regulatory criminal statutes using the Model Penal Code <b>interpretative</b> <b>protocols</b> and definitions. The author further argues that the government should have to prove some awareness of illegality under section 309 (c) and offers a suggested amendment of section 309 (c) using a Model Penal Code approach...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} explore looked-after young people's perceptions of these fictional depictions and the impact these depictions have on them. Drawing on Freire’s seminal text, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, I adopt a participatory approach throughout. Research methods involved viewing and discussing TV and film content depicting looked-after characters with a group of young people in care, followed by semi-structured interviews with group members. The data is analysed using a modified <b>Interpretative</b> Phenomenological Analysis <b>protocol.</b> My research highlights that these young people perceive onscreen fictional depictions to be “unrealistic” and negative. These depictions have significant impact, particularly in terms of “presumed media influence”, on how these young people perceive negative depictions to influence others. The young people offer a range of suggestions in terms of better depicting looked-after characters, drawing on their own experiences of care. My research also highlights the benefit of utilising a Freirean empowerment model, in terms of raising critical consciousness, for a group of looked-after young people...|$|R
