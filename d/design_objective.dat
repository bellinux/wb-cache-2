25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{was unique}} in that the vehicle was a study in symmetry. It was built to {{demonstrate}} the use of numerous interchangeable body panels. For example, the fenders were identical (the opposite ends, e.g. left front and right rear). The doors were similarly shared with opposite sides (an idea originated by Cord on its prototype 935 Saloon) since the rear doors were hinged in the back (suicide door). The hood and decklid were also interchangeable. The Nash Metropolitan, which was sold by AMC up to 1962, also had interchangeable inner panels, but their outer skins were different. In addition to reducing tooling costs by thirty percent, the <b>design</b> <b>objective</b> of the AMC Cavalier was also to demonstrate how to reduce the costs of production.|$|E

[...] Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} MASCOT (MicroArchitecture Synthesis of ConTrol paths). This synthesis system constructs {{the optimal}} microarchitecture for a control path of an instruction set processor. Input {{to the system}} is the behavioural specification of a control path. This specification is in finite state machine form which is mapped initially onto a single programmed logic array (PLA) microarchitecture. The synthesis strategy then applies a sequence of decompositions on this initial microarchitecture. This strategy follows a decision scheme until all <b>design</b> <b>objectives</b> are met. It transforms the initial microarchitecture into a complex microarchitecture of several PLAs and ROMs. Where {{it is impossible to}} meet the <b>design</b> <b>objectives,</b> the system constructs a microarchitecture which comes {{as close as possible to}} given <b>design</b> <b>objectives.</b> <b>Design</b> <b>objectives</b> are allowed on floorplan dimensions and delay. Our strategy integrates a number of known optimization methods for specific microarchitectures. Therefore this synthesis method explores a larger part of the design space than do other control path synthesis methods. Other methods are mostly bound to one microarchitecture which they optimize. Our system is not only very flexible in microarchitecture construction but also open for extension by other optimizations...|$|R
