5|$|By 2005, Marvel Entertainment began {{planning}} to independently produce its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures. Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox. Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios {{and wanted to}} <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less pleased about others. As a result, they decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent movie studio since DreamWorks.|$|E
5|$|The road, {{also known}} as Old Post Road, was {{incorporated}} in 1813 as the Elk and Christiana Turnpike in order to <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> for repairs. The turnpike was completed in April 1817. As a turnpike, tolls were collected {{to pay for the}} maintenance of the road. The construction of the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad lowered the revenues of the turnpike and it became a public road again in 1838. The road historically went through agricultural areas; however, the surroundings have become more developed over the years. Much of the Old Baltimore Pike remains two lanes.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University).

Bell's records show that the city made nearly a million dollars just in impound fees in fiscal year 2008-09, which works out to be about $10 per citizen in this small town. Bell was charging $300 for unlicensed motorists to recover their cars, three times what Los Angeles County and neighboring cities charge."All of this was just a means by Rizzo to nickel and dime the community to death to <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> out of them", Christina Garcia, a community activist, said.|$|E

500|$|Following the team's {{loss to the}} Dodgers in the 1981 World Series, the Yankees had a 15-year {{absence from}} the World Series, the longest since the time before their initial {{appearance}} in 1921. As the 1980s progressed, the Yankees regularly spent heavily on free agents who were often aging and proved to be declining in performance. The atmosphere of turmoil around the club discouraged some players from signing contracts with New York; they either ignored the Yankees' offers or used them to <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> from other teams. Steinbrenner traded prospects for veterans; sportswriter Buster Olney called this [...] "a practice that ultimately inflicted serious damage on the organization, leaving the team without the needed influx of young and cheap talent." [...] With Steinbrenner at the helm, the team continued to change managers frequently; there were 21 managerial changes {{in his first two}} decades of ownership; Martin served five separate stints as New York's manager.|$|E
500|$|The {{national}} {{financial crisis}} reached its nadir in February 1797, when the Bank of England stopped redeeming its bills for gold. [...] In {{an effort to}} <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> into circulation, the Government adopted a plan to issue large quantities of copper coins, and Lord Hawkesbury summoned Boulton to London on 3 March 1797, informing him of the Government's plan. [...] Four days later, Boulton attended {{a meeting of the}} Privy Council, and was awarded a contract {{at the end of the}} month. [...] According to a proclamation dated 26 July 1797, King George III was [...] "graciously pleased to give directions that measures might be taken for an immediate supply of such copper coinage as might be best adapted to the payment of the laborious poor in the present exigency... which should go and pass for one penny and two pennies". The proclamation required that the coins weigh one and two ounces respectively, bringing the intrinsic value of the coins close to their face value. Boulton made efforts to frustrate counterfeiters. Designed by Heinrich Küchler, the coins featured a raised rim with incuse or sunken letters and numbers, features difficult for counterfeiters to match. The twopenny coins measured exactly an inch and a half across; 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet. The exact measurements and weights made it easy to detect lightweight counterfeits. [...] Küchler also designed proportionate halfpennies and farthings; these were not authorised by the proclamation, and though pattern pieces were struck, they never officially entered circulation. [...] The halfpenny measured ten to a foot, the farthing 12 to a foot. The coins were nicknamed [...] "cartwheels", both because of the size of the twopenny coin and in reference to the broad rims of both denominations. [...] The penny was the first of its denomination to be struck in copper.|$|E

Years later, Porter said that, though he really liked Orbison, the singer [...] "never understood the engineer's contribution." [...] It was Rose's advice to leave Monument, and he was [...] "doing his job as a manager" [...] to <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money,</b> but, said Porter, [...] "he didn't know that much about the music."

2500|$|In September 1992, Ferguson {{was awarded}} $26,250 for his workers' {{compensation}} claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, Ferguson insisted {{he was still}} in pain and demanded the case be reopened so he could <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> for medical treatment.

She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because [...] "I {{did not want to be}} alone with him", something Abramson said she had never done before. Although Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, Ferguson made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre that occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers' compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed Ferguson on a list of potentially dangerous people security guards were to watch out for.|$|E
