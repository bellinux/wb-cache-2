Following the expected electrification of the Outer Harbour and Grange rail lines, new tram-trains were proposed to run to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore by 2018.

5|$|On May 20, 1880 the Carson and Colorado Railway was formed, {{with the}} intent of {{extending}} a rail line <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Hawthorne, Nevada through the Owens Valley towards the Colorado River. Though the rail line was never finished, it did bring economic development to the valley. The railroad was never completed past Keeler on the shores of Owens Lake. This line was acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900. There were plans to connect this narrow gauge line with SP's standard gauge lines in the area, however these plans never materialized and the narrow gauge line was scrapped in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Phase I's {{flagship}} project was the 63rd Street–Southeast Queens line, which would stretch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> 57th Street subway station in Midtown Manhattan {{to the existing}} Laurelton LIRR station in Springfield Gardens. The construction of this line was to be split up into three parts. The first part, Route 131–A, would run from Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan below 63rd Street and the East River to Northern Boulevard. The next part, Route 131–B, the Super–Express Bypass Line, would continue along the LIRR right-of-way to Forest Hills. And finally, Route 131–D, the Southeastern Queens Line, would build {{a branch of the}} Queens Boulevard Line at Briarwood through Downtown Jamaica to Springfield Gardens via the LIRR's Atlantic Branch, with a ramp to eliminate the Jamaica Avenue elevated structure in Downtown Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the Oslo Tunnel {{was officially}} {{initiated}} in 1938, {{as a way}} to connect the Drammen Line to Oslo East Station (OsloØ, now Oslo Central Station, OsloS). The Station Committee of 1938, led by Axel Grenholm, recommended a route that would branch off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> line close to the then terminal station of Oslo West Station (OsloV). Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was established in 1960 to look at the matter again. It stated that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and with a second station built at Frogner. The proposal was presented to Parliament on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Elisenberg Station was passed unanimously.|$|E

On November 11, 2004 Geauga Lake announced Wildwater Kingdom, a new water park {{scheduled to open in}} 2005. It would be constructed in two phases, with the first phase costing $16million and the second phase $8million. The first phase consisted of a ProSlide Tornado, an activity pool, an action river and a new children's area with a multistory play structure. Hurricane Mountain, Ohio's tallest water-slide complex, was moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> water park to the new Wildwater Kingdom and renamed Thunder Falls. Together, they formed Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom. The parks were connected by a floating bridge {{in the middle of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|Wax {{became known}} for his {{activism}} during the Civil Rights Movement. Though some members—particularly those whose families {{had lived in the}} South for generations—had segregationist views, others were prominent in the fight for black civil rights. During Wax's tenure, most of Temple Israel's members moved far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> synagogue, and in 1976 the congregation constructed its current building, closer to where most members lived. Wax retired in 1978, and was succeeded by Harry Danziger, who brought traditional practices back to the congregation. He retired in 2000, and was succeeded by Micah Greenstein. , Temple Israel has almost 1,600 member families. Greenstein is the senior rabbi, and the cantorial soloist is Abbie Strauss.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there were two {{suburban}} tramways on the east side, the Ekeberg Line (opened in 1919) and the Østensjø Line (1923). Only the latter would {{be connected to the}} T-bane; the Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway, but three new lines were to be built—the Grorud Line on the north side and the Furuset Line {{on the south side of}} Groruddalen and the Lambertseter Line on the east of Nordstrand. These areas were all chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and would quickly need a good public transport system; suburban lines would first be built out extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> tramway, and later a final section with tunnel to the central station would be built. The Lambertseter Line was opened in 1957, from Brynseng to Bergkrystallen while the Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler in 1958.|$|E

5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Commando Regiment, {{then known}} as 4 RAR (Cdo), was {{deployed}} {{as a part of}} the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in 2001. When notified to replace 1 RAR in East Timor, 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion, developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR. With the commitment to East Timor continuing, however, 4 RAR was re-roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to East Timor as AUSBATT IV. This involved reorganising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> two commando-companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel. This saw B and C Company remain commando-qualified. A Company was formed in June 2000 followed by D Company in November both filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in to the unit. The battalion took official control over Area of Operations (AO) Matilda in the northern border region on 25 April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Sengelman.|$|E
