40|$|Clostridium botulinum {{serotype}} A {{produces a}} neurotoxin {{composed of a}} 100 -kDa heavy chain and a 50 -kDa light chain linked by a disulfide bond. This neurotoxin {{is part of a}} ca. 900 -kDa complex, formed by noncovalent association with a single nontoxin, nonhemagglutinin subunit and a family of hemagglutinating proteins. Previous work has suggested, although never conclusively demonstrated, that neurotoxin alone cannot survive passage through the stomach and/or cannot be absorbed from the gut without the involvement of auxiliary proteins in the complex. Therefore, this study compared the relative absorption and toxicity of three preparations of neurotoxin in an in vivo mouse model. Equimolar amounts of serotype A complex with <b>hemagglutinins,</b> complex without <b>hemagglutinins,</b> and purified neurotoxin were surgically introduced into the stomach or into the small intestine. In some experiments, movement of neurotoxin from the site of administration was restricted by ligation of the pylorus. Comparison of relative toxicities demonstrated that at adequate doses, complex with <b>hemagglutinins,</b> complex without <b>hemagglutinins,</b> and pure neurotoxin can be absorbed from the stomach. The potency of neurotoxin in complex was greater than that of pure neurotoxin, but the magnitude of this difference diminished as the dosage of neurotoxin increased. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when complex with <b>hemagglutinins,</b> complex without <b>hemagglutinins,</b> and pure neurotoxin were placed directly into the intestine. This work establishes that pure botulinum neurotoxin serotype A is toxic when administered orally. This means that pure neurotoxin does not require <b>hemagglutinins</b> or other auxiliary proteins for absorption from the gastrointestinal system into the general circulation...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Due to an {{interest}} in the evolutionary origins of vertebrate mechanisms of immunorecognition, researchers have frequently turned to deuterostome invertebrates as model organisms. The purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea), was selected for this study of putative immunorecognition molecules in a deuterostome invertebrate. <b>Hemagglutinins,</b> molecules which agglutinate red blood cells, have been reported in most invertebrates including echinoderms. Most relevant studies have characterized <b>hemagglutinins</b> as lectins, carbohydrate-binding molecules, and for this reason these substances have been proposed as primitive recognition molecules. The work presented here describes the occurrence and range of <b>hemagglutinins</b> in the coelomic fluid of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and attempts to characterize the sugar-binding capabilities of these molecules and their responses to various chemical and enzyme treatments. The results of screening and cross-adsorption experiments with vertebrate red blood cells are described. The existence of at least two hemagglutinating activities in the coelomic fluid of S. purpuratus is demonstrated. Results presented for sugar-inhibition tests support this finding. Glycoproteins were found to be the best inhibitors of all hemagglutinating activity in coelomic fluid. This information suggests that the binding sites for S. purpuratus <b>hemagglutinins</b> may be more complex than can be revealed by mono- and simple oligosaccharide inhibition experiments. The agglutinating activities were unaffected by trypsin, pronase, or periodate treatments, and were relatively heat-stable.

40|$|Past {{studies of}} this series have been {{concerned}} {{with the development of}} noninfectious <b>hemagglutinins</b> during the process of replication of influenza virus under a variety of conditions. In growth curves in the intact chick embryo various properties of the virus appear in the allantoic membrane or increase therein differentially; i. e., following a latent period of about 2 hours, the soluble complement fixation antigen (S) can be measured first, followed shortly by the development of the virus or V antigen and of <b>hemagglutinins</b> (HA), and a rise in infectivity is detected last (1). Similar observations have been made by Hoyle (2, 3). These results were interpreted in terms of a step-wise development of the virus in that components with S, V, and HA activities were formed first and these were converted subsequently into infectious virus. However, these experiments were carried out under conditions when every cell lining the allantoic cavity was probably infected with more than one seed virus particle and subsequent studies (4 [...] 10) revealed that in that case the final yields in the allantoic fluids always contain an appreciable proportion of non-infectious <b>hemagglutinins</b> (NIHA); in other words, according to the above hypothesis...|$|R

No differences in hemagglutinating activity were attributed to the animal origin of the bordetella isolates. Horse and dog erythrocytes consistently resulted in the strongest hemagglutination reactions, whereas only 4 % of the B. bronchiseptica isolates produced weak agglutination of chicken erythrocytes. A total of 85 % of the isolates agglutinated horse, sheep, dog, pig, and guinea pig erythrocytes. One canine isolate with hemagglutinating activity, strain 110 H, was examined to determine the nature of the <b>hemagglutinin(s)</b> involved. Hemagglutination was always accompanied by hemadsorption, as determined by dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy. Treatment of cells and cell extracts with heat or protease K inhibited the hemagglutination reaction. Sonicated bacterial cells had a greater hemagglutinating ability than did unsonicated live bacteria. The hemagglutination reaction was not inhibited by any of 17 sugars nor by N- acetylglucosamine or ethylene glycol-bis-(β-aminoethyl ether) -N, N-tetraacetic acid. <b>Hemagglutinins</b> were not detected in sonic extracts nor in several bacterial subunit fractions, including isolated pili. Antigens in some of these preparations were, however, detectable by indirect hemagglutination with anti-B. bronchiseptica serum. Isolated pili could not be detected on the erythrocyte surface by electron microscopy; however, serial sections of erythrocytes agglutinated by the live Bordetella organisms showed that the bacterial outer membrane and the erythrocyte surface were separated by a space of approximately 20 nm. This study provided additional circumstantial evidence that B. bronchiseptica pili or at least heat-labile surface proteins which extend some distance from the bacterial surface are involved in hemagglutination. Multiple <b>hemagglutinins</b> are likely to exist within this species since one isolate lacking pili also agglutinated canine erthyrocytes.

40|$|Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a {{major public}} health concern in {{developing}} countries. Most UTIs are caused by E. coli, accounting for up to 90 % of community-acquired UTIs (CAUTI). Recurrent UTI is considered as a major risk factor for urolithiasis. Virulence factors like adhesins and biofilm have been extensively studied by authors on UPEC isolated from recurrent UTI. The studies on isolates from infection stones in kidney are scanty. In a prospective study, we aimed to determine the expression of Haemagglutinins, (Type 1 and P fimbriae), Biofilm production and resistance pattern to common antibiotics of Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) isolates from Community acquired Acute Urinary Tract Infection(CAUTI) and Urolithiasis. Materials and Methods: A total of 43 UPEC isolates, 23 mid-stream urine (MSU) samples from patients with CAUTI attending Out Patient Departments and 20 from renal calculi of urolithiasis patients {{at the time of}} Percutaneous nephrolithostomy (PCNL) were included in the study and the expression of Haemagglutinins,(Type 1 and P fimbriae), Biofilm production and resistance pattern to common antibiotics was assessed. Results: A total of 43 UPEC isolates 23 from CAUTI and 20 from renal calculi were tested for production of biofilm and <b>hemagglutinins.</b> In CAUTI, biofilm producers were 56. 52 % and <b>hemagglutinins</b> were detected in all isolates 100 %. In urolithiasis, biofilm producers were 100 % but <b>hemagglutinins</b> were detected only in 70 % of isolates. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics used. CAUTI isolates were susceptible to 3 rd generation cephalosporins, whereas urolithiasis isolates were resistant to 3 rd generation cephalosporins and 25 % were Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases ESBL producers.
