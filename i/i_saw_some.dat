25|$|Leftists were {{liquidated}} on sight. The {{procedure was}} summary. When one {{was captured by}} Chiang's forces, his arms were held by two Chiang soldiers while a third, with a sword, hacked off his head. The remains were left lying {{as a warning to}} other Leftists to follow Chiang or perish. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> heads mounted on poles.|$|E
500|$|The two {{boats in}} the Cambridge University Women's Boat Club (CUWBC) trials were denoted as Rise and Grind, with the race commencing at 2:30p.m. [...] Starting from the Surrey station, Rise, despite the lower stroke rate, were half a length ahead within the first 20 strokes, and held a length's lead by Craven Cottage. [...] They {{gradually}} extended their lead to two lengths by Hammersmith Bridge, three by Chiswick Steps and finished five lengths ahead of Grind. [...] Cambridge's coach Rob Baker was mildly disappointed but remained upbeat, suggesting [...] "Though I would have liked a closer race, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> excellent performances".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the game}} Riley told reporters: [...] "I {{knew there were}} 14seconds left on the clock, and the initial read wasn't there. [...] <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> green field, and I thought I could get around that guy. I was just using playing-ball instincts. [...] I {{was in the middle}} of the play. I just couldn't make one." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Hannover CL.V was a biplane ground-attack {{aircraft}} {{built in}} Germany during World War <b>I,</b> which <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> service and additional production in Norway following the war.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not know}} it was you; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> lady was there, and I would not disturb her. I {{wondered}} all the evening if it were you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> where <b>some</b> MkV tanks {{crossed a}} muddy field without sinking the tracks over five inches, where {{we in the}} M4 started across the same field the same day and bogged down.|$|R
2500|$|A {{supervisor}} in another building 300 yards away heard the fire alarm and walked outside. He {{had served in}} Vietnam, but said the explosion was worse than anything encountered in his war experience: [...] "I watched B-52s drop 500-pound bombs. This is the biggest explosion I ever saw and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> pretty good-sized ones. When it blew, the explosion kept rolling out, rolling out. We sat there and watched the ball of fire coming toward us." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....three or {{four hundred}} yards a heavy {{fire from the}} stockade was opened on the troops and me. When the fire was opened on us we {{received}} orders to fire. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> of the 40th wounded {{lying on the ground}} but I cannot say that it was before the fire on both sides. I think some {{of the men in the}} stockade should - they had a flag flying in the stockade; it was a white cross of five stars on a blue ground. - flag was afterwards taken from one of the prisoners like a union jack â€“ we fired and advanced on the stockade, when we jumped over, we were ordered to take all we could prisoners..." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> large bats {{with white}} heads flitting around in zigzag flights--assuredly new and strange creatures to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} in Montreal," [...] she answered, [...] "and <b>I</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> one very much like Lord Arranmore there. But I am {{convinced}} that it {{could only have been}} a resemblance." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. You needn't be {{anxious about}} him, dear. He is with Lady Stutfield; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them <b>some</b> time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room. They seem quite happy together. You are not going, Caroline? Pray sit down.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well!' he {{said with}} a sigh, dismissing, as <b>I</b> then <b>saw,</b> <b>some</b> trial she had borne, or was yet to bear, in {{connexion}} with what my aunt had told me. 'Well! I have never told you, Trotwood, of her mother. Has anyone?' ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES. What {{about that}} woman he was mixed up with? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> one uncommonly like her outside {{as we came}} in.|$|E
60|$|Glancing {{across the}} water in the {{direction}} pointed out, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> white thing hanging from an inland rock, perhaps half a mile from the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> {{one in the}} garden," [...] {{returned}} Demorest, quietly, satisfied of {{the illusion}} of his senses, [...] "but it was a mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, monsieur, it {{is within}} my {{knowledge}} that you {{have at least two}} hundred. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at least <b>some</b> fifty drawn up in the courtyard below here yesterday morning." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{touch of}} the truth in these words that knocked me like a blow: clothes, a bottle of usquebaugh, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in change made up, indeed, the most of what Alan and I had carried from Aucharn; and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> of James's people had been blabbing in their dungeons.|$|R
60|$|I whistled to Bob, {{and started}} for home. On the beach <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the {{professor}} <b>some</b> little distance away, and waved my towel in a friendly manner. He made no reply.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{have all}} run away, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> of them hiding among the mob. As I live, the man {{will be killed}} in five minutes more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You would perhaps like tiger-hunting or pig-sticking. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> of {{that for}} a season {{or two in the}} East. Everything here is poor stuff after that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There must {{be plenty}} of fish here, too," [...] said Tom. [...] "In fact <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> {{sporting}} {{in the waters of}} a little bay up the coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember what?" [...] I cried, all eagerness; for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> she {{attached}} <b>some</b> special {{importance to}} the recollection. And yet, it was terrible she should jest about the clue to my father's murderer! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The silver {{trumpets}} rang {{across the}} Dome; [...] The people knelt upon {{the ground with}} awe; [...] And borne upon the necks of men <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> [...] Like <b>some</b> great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.|$|R
60|$|At length the {{position}} got upon my nerves, especially as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> {{of them were}} beginning to fiddle with their bows, and that their General, a tall, one-eyed old fellow, was making up his mind to do something. I called {{to one of the}} two Mazitus, whom I forgot to say we had named Tom and Jerry, and gave him a pannikin of coffee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has Jo smashed all {{the bottles}} by accident?" [...] he whispered, [...] "or am I merely laboring under a {{delusion}} that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> lying about loose this morning?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought it}} could not have been simpler, more audacious or more impressive, till <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> women in pretty frocks go up and peer at the hissing gas-valves.|$|E
6000|$|... "My window looks this way," [...] she said, [...] "and I fancied that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> one {{cross the}} Park while I was dressing. The spinney gate was {{certainly}} open." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nelson {{also was}} the {{starting}} and winning pitcher in the final game played at Forbes Field on June 28, 1970. He commented on the fans' frenzy {{at the end of}} that game: [...] "After the game, the fans stormed the field and took everything, grass, bases, numbers off the scoreboard. <b>I</b> even <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> old ladies with parts of chairs. It was a real scene." ...|$|R
60|$|The moment I {{entered the}} room <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> one had been there since I had left. A silk lay upon the floor. It {{had not been there}} before. There were also a dagger and several metal {{ornaments}} strewn about as though torn from their wearer in a struggle. But worst of all, the door leading to the pits where I had hidden my Princess was ajar.|$|R
60|$|I was as well {{pleased with}} this {{circumstance}} {{as with any}} my landlord had done, because I had not so entire a confidence in the native Chilians as he had; but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> plainly, <b>some</b> time after, that I was wrong, for {{nothing could be more}} honest, quiet, and free from design, than those people, except the poor honest people where we dressed up the king and queen, as already mentioned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's go out {{and walk}} on the {{platform}} until the train starts," [...] suggested Honora, desperately. [...] "Oh, Howard, the shades are up! I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> one looking in!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> sort of {{a village}} ahead," [...] cried Dave, who had been peering intently through the windshield. [...] "I think I saw the white steeple of a church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that would}} be slow work!" [...] cried Sam. [...] "Let us try to fix the pipe. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> extra pieces in the tool room. Maybe {{one of them will}} fit." ...|$|E
60|$|There was no house now, no brewery, no {{building}} whatever left, but {{the wall}} of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence, and looking over it, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> of the old ivy had struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.|$|R
60|$|I {{was walking}} on the turf, {{that he might not}} hear my footsteps, and was able to keep him easily in sight, for it was a clear, frosty evening, and the full moon was shining in a {{cloudless}} sky. At a sudden bend in the road he came in sight of a place where stacks of bracken had been left on either side opposite to each other. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him pause as though hesitating which he should avoid, and at the same moment <b>I</b> distinctly <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> dark body crouched down behind one of them and swaying slightly backwards and forwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will, indeed, relieve you of much drudgery," [...] {{said the}} Magician. [...] "By the way, Margolotte, <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you getting <b>some</b> brains from the cupboard, while I {{was busy with}} my kettles. What qualities have you given your new servant?" ...|$|R
