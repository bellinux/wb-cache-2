50|$|Around {{two and a}} {{half hours}} after the {{flooding}} began, a high-tide alarm for the estuary was triggered in the observation room of plant 4, although those in the other plants failed to activate. This should have caused the control room operators to launch a 'Level 2 Internal Emergency Plan', however this was not done as the requirement had been omitted from the operation room manual; instead they continued to follow the procedure for the loss of the off-site power supply, so failing to shut down the operating reactors at the earliest opportunity to allow the decay heat to start to dissipate. At 3:00 am on December 28, the power plant's emergency teams were called to reinforce the staff already on site; at 6:30 the management of the Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety (now part of the Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute) were informed, and a meeting of experts was convened at the IPSN at 7:45 am. At 9:00 am the Level 2 <b>Internal</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Plan</b> was finally activated by the Directorate of Nuclear Installation Safety (now the Nuclear Safety Authority) and a full emergency management team of 25 people was formed, working in shifts around the clock. At noon on December 28, the incident was provisionally rated at 'level 1' on the International Nuclear Event Scale before being reclassified at 'level 2' the following day. The team was scaled back during December 30, and stood down around 6 pm the same day.|$|E
40|$|The terms “disaster” or “surge capability”, {{referred}} to hospitals, {{are often used}} to define a massive casualty admission. This may be a misleading concept, because emergency may as well arise from inside hospitals, and the last years high figures related to fires in the about 2, 000 italian hospitals should suggest {{a different point of}} view. In this article the authors describe their experience in hospital preparedness at Ospedale Martini in Turin. Hospital operators regularly attend basic (GOM) and advanced (HDM©) courses about disaster response and organization, and a specific course is dedicated to operators involved in internal safety (fire emergency). In this courses, computer simulations are widely used, associated with conventional didactic. If education is one of the two cornerstones of disaster preparedness at Ospedale Martini, well designed emergency plans and an effective disaster management are the other one. The <b>Internal</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Plan</b> (Fire and Evacuation) is aimed to give a proper response to fires and other events arising from inside the hospital and potentially requiring its partial or total evacuation. The Massive Casualties Admission Emergency Plan increases the surge capability of the hospital allowing {{to take care of a}} great number of injured people, and at the same time avoiding a dramatic fall in the treatment quality. The “Hospital Disaster Management©” system, created by the authors, is an organizational scheme based on team work. Its aim is to “put order in chaos” when hospitals are facing a disaster. Properly trained physicians and nurses, assigned to key positions, act in this system as Hospital Disaster Managers: their tasks are to coordinate the teams, to manage critical resources and to use the emergency plans as powerful instruments...|$|E
40|$|This {{expert report}} {{reflects}} conclusions and key points from two surveys and a workshop involving Seveso inspectors from around Europe {{on the role}} of safety reports in preventing major chemical accidents. The Seveso Directive requires operators of so-called “upper-tier” major hazard sites to submit safety reports detailing the major risks associated with the site and how they are controlled. Safety reports are the documents in which the operator of such a site demonstrates that the major accident prevention policy and a safety management system are in effect, that major accident hazards and risk have been identified and are adequately prevented and potential consequences limited, that adequate safety and reliability is incorporated in all aspects of the plant, and an effective <b>internal</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> has been drawn up and implemented. A good safety report allows the authorities to get a clear overview of what could happen, how accidents are prevented and what is being done to ensure that if an accident occurred, the consequences can be minimised and a clear mitigation plan is in place. Ideally, the safety report should also be a dynamic, living document that helps companies control and take into account the potential for major accident hazards in various operational decisions. In many cases, the safety report is, however, still only a report compiled for the authorities. The report indicates that while there are many practical differences in how the Seveso II Directive safety reports are evaluated and used in inspections within the EU and its Seveso partner countries, the challenges are almost universal. Most challenges appear to be related to whether the safety report presents a coherent and convincing case that justifies the risk management decisions taken. The report describes the key challenges, providing several examples of good practice for improving safety reports (operators) and verifying safety reports during inspections (authorities). It also identifies a number of specific areas where it could be useful to develop common tools and solutions to improve overall effectiveness of safety reports as an active and useful mechanism for site risk management.

40|$|Emergency {{response}} combines with {{prevention and}} mitigation {{to form the}} risk management triad of control measures for reducing chemical accident risks. In fact, standard good practice dictates that appropriate emergency response measures are identified for every major accident scenario of a hazardous operation. Consistent with this philosophy, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> has been taken on board as {{an essential component of}} the Seveso Directive since its inception in 1982. Within the current Seveso Directive (2012 / 18 /EU), under Article 12, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> for upper-tier sites is assigned as a direct obligation to both the operator (for <b>internal</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>planning)</b> and the authorities (for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning).</b> These obligations present considerable challenges for the authorities, in particular, in verifying that <b>internal</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> of each upper tier site is conducted in accordance with Seveso requirements and existing performance standard; that a parallel process for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> is established; and an appropriate strategy is defined to inform populations potentially at risk from the accident scenarios of concern. To bring improvements and consistency to Member State practices in this regard, the European Commission and the Irish Health and Safety Authority organised a workshop in 2012 for Seveso inspectors from EU and aligned countries to exchange information on challenges and successes in implementing <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> obligations.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of schools and educational institutions in the South Bohemian Region in terms of their preparedness to evacuate children and students with special educational needs. This thesis assesses the preparedness and awareness of individual schools. The work is divided into two parts, a theoretical part and a research part. The theoretical part deals mainly with evacuations as a reaction on an emergence of an incident or crisis. Evacuation applies to people of all ages. Evacuation is divided in several respects. This includes aspects of the measures adopted, where we put area evacuation and building evacuation. Another aspect is that of selecting persons involved in the evacuation; then it is universal and partial evacuation. Evacuation is also divided according to its duration, into the short term evacuation, long term evacuation and an exit. Evacuation divided according to the mode of implementation is driven evacuation, spontaneous evacuation and self-evacuation. The last division of evacuation, division in terms of danger, divides evacuation into direct and indirect evacuation. Further in the thesis I deal with evacuations planning. I analyse evacuation plan {{as a part of the}} emergency plans of the region. I also discuss the planning of evacuation in emergency planning zones. One of the subsections discusses also a plan for the evacuation of people, as an integral part of the external emergency plan which is elaborated for a nuclear facility or a workplace of 4 th category. Other subchapters deal with evacuation plans of organizations preparing an <b>internal</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>plan,</b> evacuation plans as part of flood protection and evacuation plans of other legal entities and individuals. An important chapter in the theoretical part is the educational system in the Czech Republic. Here I proceed mainly from the Act no. 561 / 2004 Coll., on preschool, primary, secondary, higher professional and other education (Education Act) and amending other laws, as amended. There are different kinds of schools. These species include kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, conservatory, higher vocational school, elementary school of arts and language school with the state language examination. Other types of schools are special schools. Among special schools we include kindergarten for visually impaired children, elementary school for the visually impaired, high school for the visually impaired, conservatory for the visually impaired; nursery school for the deaf, school for the hearing-impaired, high school for the hearing impaired; kindergarten for the deaf and blind, primary school for deaf and blind; kindergarten at health care facilities, primary school at health care facilities, special primary school at a health care facility; nursery school for the disabled, a school for the disabled, a secondary school for the disabled; speech therapy kindergarten, speech therapy elementary school; special kindergarten, elementary practical school, special school, vocational school, practical school; elementary school for pupils with learning disabilities, primary school for pupils with specific behavioural problems. Special schools are attended by children, pupils and students with special educational needs. These children, pupils and students can have different kinds of disability. According to the Act no. 108 / 2006 Coll., on social services, we divide disability into several groups, into visual impairment, hearing impairment, mental disability, physical disability, internal disability, speech impairment, combined handicaps and we also include mental illness, seniors and parents of children with disabilities to these groups.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{methodology}} for the analysis of the robustness of industrial <b>internal</b> and external <b>emergency</b> <b>plans,</b> established by the European Union SEVESO II Directive. This methodology is based upon a systemic, hierarchical and generic model of an internal or external industrial <b>emergency</b> <b>plan.</b> The process generally found within an internal and/or external industrial <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> is identified through the model, thus allowing for a modular representation of the plan. Each process integrates the functions/activities performed, the resources necessary for performing these functions/activities, the resources generated or affected by these functions, the supports required for each resource and the interactions (inputs and outputs) of each process. An explicit specification of these elements for a generic plan was provided through an ontological approach. An analysis of the plan model is performed to estimate a priori the failures that can potentially occur in the emergency response phase, when the plan is put into action. An extensive experience feedback analysis has also been performed to identify a posteriori the failures that have already occurred during the application of the plan. Some 160 accident reports have been consulted, and 31 <b>internal</b> and external <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> exercises were followed. This double analysis (a priori and a posteriori) has led to putting in place assessment checklists, structured via the systemic model for each of the plan's process.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} the thesis is {{protection}} {{of the population in}} the <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> zone of Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant, and dealing with evacuation {{in case of an emergency}} situation associated with the release of radioactive substances. Particular way of evacuation of people as one of the most important protective measures to ensure public protection was analyzed. The thesis particularly focuses on the correct procedures in case of evacuation and the competence of persons involved in the protective measures. It deals with the basic criteria that are applied in the protection of the population from the impact of ionizing radiation around the nuclear power plant. Improvements for protection and awareness of population living in the <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> area are proposed. According to Nuclear Legislation a license holder is responsible for taking action to eliminate the occurrence of an emergency as well as taking action to prevent occurrence of an emergency related to technological devices that work with hazardous substance, process, use, transport, store it or manipulate with it. At the same time they are responsible for protecting their employees and persons taken into their care. Measures by permit holder to operate a nuclear facility and protect their own employees or persons taken into care represent the first stage in the structure of emergency preparedness. The public protection plan involves measures to protect the population in the area of release of radioactive substances into the environment. The part of the plan shall be a mutual interaction between the <b>internal</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> of the holder of the permit to operate. The work is based on existing legislation and scientific publications of the scope of the research. The protection plan of the population is seen as the basic document for planning measures to handling with the consequences of radiation incidents or accidents and elimination of their consequences on the <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> zone. The theoretical part is based on the analysis of current legislation related to the issue, where the membership of the Slovak Republic in the European Union undertakes the country to fulfil its duties, obligations and responsibilities under the legislation of the European Commission. All these directives are transposed in the Atomic Act and create conditions for the exchange of information in the event of an accident of a nuclear device in the Slovak Republic. Basic concepts are defined, and the thesis deals with important safety measures when dealing with an emergency, related to a radiation accident at a nuclear power plant. The principles of appropriate behaviour of the population in the event of such an occurrence are emphasised. Exploratory method of asking underlying the proposed methodology was used to compile the thesis. Based on the analysis of results of the questionnaire, areas for improvement were proposed. From the collected data possible systemic measures related to evacuation with respect to application in real life were assessed...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{energy consumption}} constantly requires new energy sources. One {{of the energy}} sources are nuclear power plants. We can suppose {{that the number of}} nuclear power plants will increase {{as a consequence of the}} exhaustion of fossil fuels. Therefore it is crucial to enhance the nuclear power plants security which corresponds with the risks related to the nuclear power plant operation. It is compulsory for each nuclear power plant to have an external and <b>internal</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> ready. In the nuclear power plant surroundings satefy measure including decontamination are planned. A suitable layout of the decontamination station is crucial for the quality decontamination. It is also necessary to check up the functionality of such stations. I took part in one of such rescue unit drills (ZONA 2007) on 25 October as an observer. The participation in it made me more familiar with nuclear power plant safety issues and therefore it was very useful for my thesis. The current situation is very complicated because special units that have been in charge of the decontamination zones (MSO) until recently are being dismissed or transformed. In spite of this fact the objective of my thesis was to design the layout of the decontamination zone which will meet such an area requirements. I set this hypothesis: I am convinced that the current preparedness and parameters of the decontamination zone as a component of the rescue system are more advanced than they used to be before. " This hypothesis was confirmed as far as the technological and material progress is concerned. I was also dealing with difficult questions such as ethics at the procedure of decontamination in men and women, conditions in winter etc. I think the hypothesis of my thesis has been confirmed and I have managed to make the reader acquainted with the questions I dealt with. I also wanted to express my attitude to the disestablishment of the rescue unit in Jindřichův Hradec which had provided the decontamination service so far. In my thesis I analyse the decontamination measures in the surroundings of the nuclear power station in detail. The thesis may be used as a tutorial text and it is possible to elaborate on it after 1.
