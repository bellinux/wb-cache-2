40|$|Identifying quad-bike-related {{injuries}} in administrative <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> can be problematic. This {{study sought to}} determine whether quad-bike-related injuries could be identified in routinely collected administrative <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and to determine the information recorded according to World Health Organization (WHO) injury surveillance guidelines that could assist injury prevention efforts. Five routinely collected administrative <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> in NSW in the period 2000 – 2012 were reviewed. The WHO core minimum data items recorded {{in each of the}} five <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> ranged from 37. 5 % to 75. 0 %.

5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> and stated {{that the quality of}} <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a critical evaluation of Australian <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> relating to general practice services. It describes the usefulness of these <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> for meeting priority information needs, and recommends strategies to address data gaps and limitations. Primary health care services are generally the first port of call when Australians need health care. Services provided through general practice are the core of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s primary health-care system, and it is vital that accurate, reliable and timely information about these services is available to support policy and practice decisions. Although several national and regional <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> contain information relevant to general practice, few sources provide comprehensive information {{that can be used to}} assess the value, quality and outcomes of the care provided. This leads to significant gaps in our understanding of the performance and effectiveness of the Australian primary health-care system.

40|$|Similarity joins {{between two}} {{collections}} of item sets {{have recently been}} investigated and have attracted significant attention, especially for linguistic applications such as those involving spelling error corrections and data cleaning. In this paper, we propose {{a new approach to}} similarity joins for general item set collections, such as purchase history data and research keyword data. The main objective of our research is to efficiently find similar records between two <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> under the constraints of the number of added and deleted items. Efficient matching algorithms are urgently needed in similarity joins because of the combinatorial explosion between two <b>data</b> <b>collections.</b> We developed a matching algorithm based on Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZDDs) to overcome this difficulty and make matching process more efficient. ZDDs are special types of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and are suitable for implicitly handling large-scale combinatorial item set data. We present, in this paper, the algorithms for similarity joins between two <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> represented as ZDDs and pruning techniques. We also present the experimental results obtained by comparing their performance with other systems and the results obtained by using real huge <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> to demonstrate their efficiency in actual applications...|$|R
