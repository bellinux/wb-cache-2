However, Cambodia’s disaster management institution has since faced chronic shortages of human and economic resources and the NCDM remains a response-oriented—rather than a proactive risk management-oriented—body without any standing budget (Nguyen et al. 2010).|$|R

50|$|The Government of Jamaica {{maintained}} anti-trafficking {{law enforcement}} efforts during the US State Department's reporting period, {{but did not}} punish any trafficking offenders. Legislatively, the government prohibits all forms of trafficking through its comprehensive Trafficking in Persons Act, which became effective on 1 March 2007, and which prescribes penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment, penalties that are sufficiently stringent. This law also prohibits holding a person’s passport {{as a means of}} keeping an individual in labor or service. During the reporting period, the government charged four suspects with trafficking under its new law; these cases remain pending, in addition to six prosecutions from the previous year. The government did not convict or sentence any traffickers during the reporting period. The government also dedicated six police officers to the National Task Force against Trafficking in Persons, an <b>inter-agency</b> <b>body</b> that coordinates anti-trafficking activities, and reconstituted the organized-crime division of its police force to focus more attention on human trafficking crimes. A vetted police Airport Interdiction Task Force, created through a memorandum of understanding between Jamaica and the United States in 2005, investigates cases of drug trafficking and human trafficking at ports of entry. In conjunction with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), several police, consular, and judicial officials received anti-trafficking training. No reports of official complicity with human trafficking were received in 2007.|$|E
