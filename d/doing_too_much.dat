At the separately held United States Olympic Trials {{she was back}} down the order, ending 17th in the 10,000 meters. This was last place by some distance, but she persevered until the finish, driven on by memories of her late father. She failed {{to break into the}} top of the American elite that decade, finishing 13th at the 1988 USA Cross Country and tenth at the 1989 USA Outdoor 3000m. A plantar fasciitis injury interrupted her career in 1989 to 1991, but she reflected that she had been <b>doing</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> training and welcomed the change.|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 1945, Yamato, Haruna and Nagato were {{transferred}} to the newly reactivated 1st Battleship Division. Yamato left drydock two days later for Japan's Inland Sea. This reassignment was brief; the 1st Battleship Division was deactivated once again on 10 February and Yamato was allotted to the 1st Carrier Division. On 19 March, American carrier aircraft from , [...] and [...] raided Kure. Although 16 warships were hit, Yamato sustained only minor damage {{from a number of}} near misses and from one bomb that struck her bridge. The intervention of a squadron of Kawanishi N1K1 [...] "Shiden" [...] fighters (named [...] "George" [...] by the Allies) flown by veteran Japanese fighter instructors prevented the raid from <b>doing</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> damage to the base and assembled ships, while Yamatos ability to maneuver—albeit slowly—in the Nasami Channel benefited her.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Soul Sound" [...] {{was directed by}} Max & Dania and filmed in London. Band member Siobhán Donaghy stated that {{around the time of}} the video's filming, her and the other group members were not performing as a group frequently: [...] "It's been fairly quiet recently, but it usually is between singles. The other two have been doing their exams, and I have been doing some interviews for newspapers and magazines abroad. Apart from the video for 'Soul Sound' we have not been <b>doing</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> together." [...] During the video, the group's members are featured in an apartment and are seated on couches and chairs. The plot involves their inner souls being released by the music, while outside in the neighbourhood the music takes control of other people's lives and causes their souls to be lifted too. The video was included on the CD release of [...] "Soul Sound".|$|E

Blel Kadri (...) then attacked, but was soon {{overtaken}} by Wilco Kelderman (LottoNL–Jumbo) and Mikel Landa (Sky). Going into the final kilometre, they had a 14-second lead. Contador, who had lost the key stage of the Volta a Catalunya after <b>doing</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> work on the final climb, waited for the other riders in the group to chase Landa and Kelderman. Rui Costa attempted to bring the two riders back, with Contador, Henao, Rodriguez and Samuel Sánchez (...) following, but {{they were unable to}} catch them. In the final few hundred metres, Landa came past Kelderman and took the stage win, his first since signing for Team Sky. Keldeman was second, one second behind Landa, with Henao four seconds further back in third. Landa took over the race lead. After the stage, however, he said that Henao remained the team leader {{for the rest of the}} race and that he [...] "could crack tomorrow".|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing he had been <b>doing</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> television at the time; {{at the request of}} Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times when you know you are hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bossy has harboured some {{animosity}} towards Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers, {{stating that}} the Islanders got little recognition for their dynasty (1980–83) compared to the Canadiens (1976–79) or Oilers (1984–90). Bossy complained [...] "I {{do a lot of}} promoting for how good [...] were...We never got one millionth of the recognition we should. We had a very low-key organization. They didn't want guys <b>doing</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> because they thought the hockey might suffer. People don't talk about us in the first mention of great teams." [...] During Gretzky's interview with the New York Post in 1993, he praised Bossy as the best right-winger ever to play, saying that their scoring totals would have been even higher if the two had played together. (They nearly did; in the 1977 WHA Amateur Draft, Bossy was selected by the Indianapolis Racers, who one year later would become Gretzky's first pro team.) Bossy's response in the Post was not complimentary, as he pointed out that their playing styles were different, and also said that Trottier was the best centre in hockey.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{would have}} liked to open {{the left side of the}} thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was {{slightly}} supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without <b>doing</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.".|$|E
