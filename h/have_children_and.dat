She left for Germany in 1954. Galland married Sylvinia von Dönhoff on 12 February 1954. However, {{she was unable to}} <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> they divorced on 10 September 1963.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E
5|$|Murray married Elizabeth Finch. They did not <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> took on care {{of their}} niece, Lady Elizabeth Murray (b. 1760), after her mother died. When Mansfield's nephew Captain Sir John Lindsay {{returned}} to Britain in 1765 following the Seven Years' War and his assignment in the West Indies, he brought his natural daughter Elizabeth. Of half African descent, she was born into slavery in 1761, the daughter of Maria Bell, an enslaved woman. Lindsay asked Murray to take on her care and education, and she was baptized Dido Elizabeth Belle in 1766 in London.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Voyagers {{exposure to the}} swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth on her back. She resists the ’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|Becky confronts Kylie after a bad {{reference}} {{that she}} provided to an adoption agency. At first Kylie pretends {{that she has}} a privileged life in order to impress Becky but it soon emerges that she is on the streets. She then moves into the Rovers Return Inn and instantaneously sparks a conflict with Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Becky and Steve soon discover {{that she has a}} four-year-old son called Max, whose custody she seeks. She sells Steve's motorbike and tries to sleep with him. After visiting Max at the foster parents' home, she takes him home. She sleeps with Gary Windass (Mikey North). Kylie is awarded custody of her son. Later she steals money from the till at Roy's Rolls, and jets off to Cyprus on holiday and leaves Max in Becky's care. She returns {{a couple of weeks later}} with a new boyfriend, Demetri. She tells Becky that she has come back to take Max to live in Cyprus, leaving Becky heartbroken. Kylie sees Becky's desperation as she cannot <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> offers to give Max to her in exchange for 20,000 pounds. Becky complies and Kylie leaves.|$|E

5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj hoped they would <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> in 1413 deposited some money at a transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E

25|$|During Vetter's life, {{the only}} options for {{children}} born with SCID were either to be sequestered in a sterile environment or else to quickly die from infection.

25|$|The church puts notable {{emphasis}} on the family, and the distinctive concept of a united family which lives and progresses forever {{is at the core}} of Latter-day Saint doctrine. Church members are encouraged to marry and <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> as a result, Latter-day Saint families tend to be larger than average. All sexual activity outside of marriage is considered a serious sin. All homosexual activity is considered sinful and same-sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Latter-day Saint fathers who hold the priesthood typically name and bless their children shortly after birth to formally give the child a name and generate a church record for them.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} {{of men and}} women meant that women were forced to wait long periods to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> get married. This lengthened the timeline of independence for single women and impacted the Japanese-Canadian community after internment by creating more independent women, both of which disrupted the pre-internment way of life. Young children were forced to step up and take on more responsibilities when fathers were taken away. Accounts from children in internment camps recall the impact not having a father. One girl recalls how her sister went from being a pampered eldest child to being a head of household in their father's absence. This was disruptive to the typical family structure because not only was a child in charge, but it was a girl. Transitions such as these gave women a much greater power within the family structure and gave children more adult responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|In February 1910, Madetoja—while {{composing}} the incidental {{music for}} Eino Leino's play, Shakkipeli (Chess)—made the acquaintance of the Finnish poet Hilja Onerva Lehtinen (a.k.a., L. Onerva), {{a friend and}} lover of the playwright. Although Madetoja was five years Onerva's junior, their relationship gradually deepened into love, and in 1913, they (thrice) announced their engagement, telling everyone that they were married (in fact, they were not formally married until 1918). Due to their precarious financial situation, an orchestral rehearsal in Turku doubled as honeymoon. Their marriage was childless (even though they wished to <b>have</b> <b>children)</b> <b>and</b> tempestuous, plagued by quarrels and chronic alcoholism, from which both suffered. In {{the final years of}} Madetoja's life, Onerva was confined to a mental institution—it appears, against her will; the letters she wrote to her husband, asking for him to retrieve her, were not successful. In 2006, the couple's correspondence was published (in Finnish) under the title, Night Songs: L. Onerva and Leevi Madetoja's Letters from 1910 to 1946 (eds. Anna Makkonen and Tuurna Marja-Leena).|$|E
25|$|As {{the show}} progressed into the 1990s, EastEnders still {{featured}} hard-hitting {{issues such as}} Mark Fowler discovering he was HIV positive in 1991, {{the death of his}} wife Gill from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, adoption, abortion, Peggy Mitchell's battle with breast cancer, and Phil Mitchell's alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy. Mental health issues were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old Joe Wicks developed schizophrenia following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a marriage breakdown connected to his inability to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> the side effects of combination therapies.|$|E
25|$|Kat and Alfie {{holiday in}} Spain, and bring Shenice back with them. Upon their return, Kat gets {{pregnant}} again. Alfie {{believes that he}} cannot <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> assumes Kat has cheated on him, despite her insistence to the contrary. Alfie learns that he is wrong, but Kat is hurt by his accusation and will not let him near her, even after suffering a miscarriage. Kat has a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she instantly regrets. She eventually confesses to Alfie, and tells him that her behaviour is how she is and always will be. Alfie tells Kat he would rather have her cheat on him than not have her in his life. The couple attempt to mend relations with each other over Christmas, but Alfie overhears Kat saying that she thinks he no longer loves her. Alfie books a session with a marriage counsellor, which Kat initially refuses to attend. She turns up late, and Alfie tells her the counsellor never arrived. Alfie pays his friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) {{to pretend to be}} a marriage counsellor, who comes to their home. Kat tells Gerry that she believes Alfie does not love her any more and so she wants to end their marriage.|$|E
