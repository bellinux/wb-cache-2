5|$|Historian Matti Moosa {{considered}} Marrash to be {{the first}} truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times. Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended them in his own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in Western Asia and North Africa. He was also influential <b>in</b> <b>introducing</b> French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes of thinking and feeling, and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Red Rackham was partly inspired by Jean Rackam, a fictional pirate {{who appeared in}} a story alongside female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read that Hergé encountered in a November 1938 edition of Dimanche-Illustré. Red Rackham's looks and costumes were also inspired by the character, Lerouge, who appears in C. S. Forester's novel, The Captain from Connecticut, and by the 17th-century French buccaneer Daniel Montbars. The name of Marlinspike Hall— in French—was based upon {{the name of the}} real Belgian town, Sart-Moulin. The actual design of the building was based upon the Château de Cheverny, albeit with the two outer wings removed. <b>In</b> <b>introducing</b> Francis Haddock to the story, Hergé made Captain Haddock the only character in the series (except Jolyon Wagg, introduced later) to have a family and an ancestry.|$|E

5|$|Deliveries of the Vengeances to Australia {{were much}} delayed. Following Australia's entry into Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF order still stood at 297 Vengeances. These {{aircraft}} {{were scheduled to}} be delivered between January and December 1942. No Vengeances had arrived by 8 May 1942, though the RAAF's order had been increased to 367. A small number of the type arrived in Australia in late May 1942, but subsequent deliveries were slow. This was because the USAAF was also rapidly expanding at this time, which limited the number and types of aircraft available to its allies. Attempts by the Australian Government to obtain Vengeances from USAAF allocations in March 1942, when the country faced a possible Japanese invasion, were unsuccessful. The majority of the dive bombers arrived after April 1943; {{by this time the}} threat of invasion had passed. Overall, Australia received 15 Vengeances in 1942, 227 in 1943 and 100 during 1944. Many of the aircraft suffered from defects, which led to delays <b>in</b> <b>introducing</b> them into service and caused the type to have a relatively low serviceability rate.|$|E
5|$|During the era {{of civil}} wars and the Commonwealth, {{significant}} building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture. After the Restoration, large scale building began again, often incorporating more comprehensive ideas of reviving classicism. Sir William Bruce (1630–1710), was the key figure <b>in</b> <b>introducing</b> the Palladian style into Scotland, following {{the principles of the}} Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–80). He built and remodelled country houses, including Thirlestane Castle and Prestonfield House. Among his most significant work was his own Palladian mansion at Kinross. As the Surveyor and Overseer of the Royal Works he undertook the rebuilding of the Royal Palace of Holyroodhouse in the 1670s, which gave the palace its present appearance. James Smith worked as a mason on the Bruce's rebuilding of Holyrood Palace. With his father-in-law, the master mason Robert Mylne, Smith worked on Caroline Park in Edinburgh (1685), and Drumlanrig Castle (1680s). Smith's country houses followed the pattern established by William Bruce, with hipped roofs and pedimented fronts, in a plain but handsome Palladian style. After the Act of Union, growing prosperity in Scotland led to a spate of new building, both public and private. William Adam (1689–1748), was the foremost architect of his time in Scotland, designing and building numerous country houses and public buildings. His individual, exuberant, style was built on the Palladian style, but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture.|$|E

40|$|Evolution {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} alien species may experience genetic changes <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> ranges, facilitating adaptation to new habitats and range expansion. Responses {{to the selection}} pressures incurred by the novel abiotic and biotic factors <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> ranges are primary causes for alien species evolution, although other factors such as intra- and inter-specific hybridizations, genetic shifts can also cause evolution. In this paper, we mainly analyze how alien plant species evolutionarily adapt to environmentalchanges related to different latitudes and altitudes, and to enemy release <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> ranges. With respect to evolutionary adaptation to abiotic environments, we introduce some important common garden experiments and reciprocal transplant experiments, emphasizing the necessity to integrate the studies on evolution of phenotypic traits with those on neutral molecular makers. With respect to evolutionary adaptation to enemy release, we mainly discuss evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, the refinement of EICA hypothesis, and their weaknesses in theory and practices. Finally, we introduce the hypothesis of theevolution of nitrogen allocation, which predicts that invasive plants may decrease leaf nitrogen allocations to defenses but increase allocations to photosynthesis in response to enemy release <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> ranges...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{a recent}} founder event on genetic {{diversity}} in wild populations of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta were studied, with particular attention given to the genetic sex-determining system. Diploid males are far more common relative to haploid males <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> populations than <b>in</b> native populations of fire ants, and queens that produce diploid males account for a significantly larger proportion of the mated queens <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> than <b>in</b> native populations. Differences between native and <b>introduced</b> populations <b>in</b> attributes of the mating systems (i. e., queen mating frequency or level of inbreeding) can be excluded as factors contributing to these different levels of diploid male production. Thus, we conclude that diploid males have increased <b>in</b> frequency <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> populations because of a loss of allelic diversity at the sex-determining locus (loci). This loss of sex alleles has generated {{a substantial increase in}} the estimated segregational genetic load associated with production of sterile diploid males <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> populations over the load in native populations. The loss of allelic diversity in the sex-determining system <b>in</b> <b>introduced</b> S. invicta is paralleled by a loss of electrophoretically detectable rare alleles at protein-encoding loci. Such concordance between these different types of markers is predicted because each of the many sex alleles present in the native populations is expected to be rare. Estimates of expected heterozygosity (H(exp)) based on 76 electrophoretic loci do not differ significantly between the native and introduced fire ant populations, illustrating the lack of sensitivity of this measure for detecting many types of bottlenecks...|$|R
