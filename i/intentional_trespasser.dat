2500|$|Aaron and Christine Boring, a Pittsburgh couple, sued Google for {{invasion}} of privacy. Street View made {{a photo of}} their home available online, and they claimed that this diminished {{the value of their}} house, which they had chosen for its privacy. They lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. [...] "While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, {{it is hard to believe}} that any – other than the most exquisitely sensitive – would suffer shame or humiliation," [...] Judge Hay ruled. Since then the decision was reversed in part and on December 1, 2010 Magistrate Judge Bissoon ruled that Google is an <b>intentional</b> <b>trespasser</b> and the company was ordered to pay one US dollar to the plaintiffs.|$|E

40|$|In 2008 the {{landmark}} decision in A v Hoare 1 was {{received from the}} House of Lords. The decision will have a wide impact on the law on limitation periods in claims for personal injury. Victims of <b>intentional</b> <b>trespass</b> to the person can now apply to the court to either extend or disapply the primary limitation period. This article will consider the wider implications of the decision on issues of limitation. It aims to examine what the initial rationale of limitation legislation is. With this in consideration the article then analyses judicial application of the Limitation Act 1980 prior to, and post A v Hoare. This enables the article to conclude on whether the initial purpose of having limitation periods in personal injury claims is currently being met...|$|R
40|$|Intentional torts to {{the person}} are those torts which involve "intentional or wilful invasions of the {{physical}} and mental integrity of the person", such as <b>intentional</b> <b>trespass</b> {{to the person}} (battery, assault and false imprisonment), and can be distinguished from "negligent or careless invasions". 1 Although the historical distinction between negligence and trespass is based upon whether the defendant's act is direct or indirect, a trend towards fault-based categorisation {{of the law of}} torts has been recognised by a majority of the High Court in Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307 at [18]; see also Brennan J at [52]. Given the legislative changes to the law of negligence following the review of the law of negligence, 2 and particularly the damages restrictions which have been imposed, there has been renewed interest in the ancient trespass actions. Although difficult issues may arise in intentional tort claims such as proof of intention, 3 the extent to which insurance is available, 4 and whether vicarious liability will be imposed, 5 there may be advantages for plaintiffs who plead <b>intentional</b> torts, particularly <b>trespass</b> to the person. Some of the key legal advantages are that trespass is actionable per se; the defendant bears the onus of proof; the rules of causation and remoteness which relate to negligence actions may not apply to trespass actions; and exemplary and aggravated damages may be awarded. 6 In particular, the provisions of the Civil Liability Acts may not apply...|$|R
40|$|This essay explores an {{emerging}} {{issue in the}} criticism of the "bundle" conception of property: whether embracing the right to exclude as the core of property is sufficiently determinate to avoid the same disintegrating effects as the bundle conception. Thomas Merrill and Henry Smith believe so, and they have developed an extensive account of what I call the "exclusion conception of property. " It is initially alluring {{as a solution to}} the problems caused by the bundle conception, but this is a false promise. Merrill and Smith are correct that the bundle conception is wrong, but their model of how the right to exclude functions in practice [...] what they call an "exclusion strategy" [...] cannot account for the substantial majority of property doctrines that are the subject of litigation. In practice, most property disputes arise not from <b>intentional</b> <b>trespass</b> and similar situations in which exclusion is the essential issue, but rather from ex ante relationships between individuals concerning the use, possession and disposition of property rights. Although Merrill and Smith claim that such doctrines are "governance strategies" that allegedly function only at the periphery of property law, these doctrines actually comprise the majority of property cases, including many trespass cases. Although trespass is supposed to represent the exclusion strategy par excellence, affirmative defenses and other counter-claims representing the so-called "governance strategies" often constitute the bulk of the actual litigation. Although the elegant reductionism of the exclusion conception makes it theoretically appealing, lawyers and economists should be wary of its promise of determinacy in saving property from the disintegrative effects of the bundle conception.

5000|$|After an {{adjournment}} of {{the case}} {{at the request of}} the defence, it was reported that Iauko would appear in court on 10 June, on charges of unlawful assembly, <b>trespass,</b> <b>intentional</b> assault and threatening. On 30 June, having pled guilty to aiding and abetting damage to property and aiding and abetting intentional assault, he was fined Vt15,000. The other charges were withdrawn by the prosecution. Reporters Without Borders denounced the fine as [...] "risible", saying it was [...] "not commensurate with the gravity of the crime", and that such a small fine for an assault on a journalist risked pushing other journalists to censor themselves rather than criticise politicians.|$|R
50|$|In tort common law, {{the defense}} of {{necessity}} gives the state or an individual a privilege to take or use the property of another. A defendant typically invokes {{the defense of}} necessity only against the <b>intentional</b> torts of <b>trespass</b> to chattels, trespass to land, or conversion. The Latin phrase from common law is necessitas inducit privilegium quod jura privata ("Necessity induces a privilege because of a private right"). A court will grant this privilege to a trespasser when the risk of harm to an individual or society is apparently and reasonably greater than the harm to the property. Unlike the privilege of self-defense, those who are harmed by individuals invoking the necessity privilege are usually free from any wrongdoing. Generally, an individual invoking this privilege is obligated to pay any actual damages caused {{in the use of}} the property but not punitive or nominal damages.|$|R
