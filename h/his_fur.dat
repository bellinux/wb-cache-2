5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all <b>his</b> <b>fur.</b> Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|It {{was never}} {{attacked}} again. The windmill was rebuilt in 1700, and was probably {{still in use}} until the 1780s. In 1703, Jacques Le Ber de Senneville constructed a large stone house and fort {{in order to improve}} and protect <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> trading operations, and the local seigneural manor house was built in 1706. However, after the fall of New France in 1763, it was not used by the British as a military post. In 1776, Fort Senneville was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War by Continental Army troops under Benedict Arnold, in military manoeuvres associated with the Battle of the Cedars.|$|E

5|$|During {{the latter}} part of the reign of Edward IV, Richard {{demonstrated}} his loyalty, in contrast to their brother George, who had allied himself with Warwick through the 1460s, and threw in his lot with the earl when the latter rebelled at the end of the decade. Following Warwick's 1470 rebellion, in which he made peace with Margaret of Anjou and promised the restoration of Henry VI to the English throne, Richard, William, Lord Hastings and Anthony Woodville, Earl Rivers escaped capture at Doncaster by Warwick's brother, Lord Montague. On 2 October they sailed from King's Lynn in two ships; Edward landed at Marsdiep and Richard at Zeeland. It was said that, having left England in such haste as to possess almost nothing, Edward was forced to pay their passage with <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> cloak; certainly Richard borrowed three pounds from Zeeland's town-bailiff. They were attainted by Warwick's only Parliament on 26 November. They resided in Bruges with Louis de Gruthuse, who had been the Burgundian Ambassador to Edward's court, but it was not until Louis XI of France declared war on Burgundy that Charles, Duke of Burgundy, assisted their return, providing, along with the Hanseatic merchants, £20,000, 36 ships and 1200 men. They departed Flushing for England on 11 March 1471. Warwick's arrest of local sympathisers prevented them from landing in Yorkist East Anglia and on 14 March, after being separated in a storm, their ships ran ashore at Holderness. The town of Hull refused him entry, and Edward gained entry to York by using the same claim as Henry of Bolingbroke had before deposing Richard II in 1399; that is, that he was merely reclaiming the Dukedom of York rather than the crown. It was in Edward's attempt to regain his throne that Gloucester began to demonstrate his skill as a military commander.|$|E

25|$|DreamWorks began {{production}} in 2001, which was actually {{before the first}} film was even completed. DreamWorks made sure there was something new to see in Shrek 2 by putting more human characters in the film than there were in its predecessor and improving their appearance, {{with the use of}} a few systems that dealt with hair and fur to improve its appearance and movement. The set up for all the characters was done in the first three years of production. Puss in Boots required a whole new set of tools in the film to handle <b>his</b> <b>fur,</b> belt and feather plume in his hat. The character also required an upgrade in the fur shader for his introduction in the film.|$|E
25|$|Being {{the most}} curious of the Three, Jayfeather {{tries to find}} out who his true parents are. When asking around about his birth, Mousefur reveals that Leafpool accidentally put a strange herb in Mousefur's tansy soon after Jayfeather's birth. After looking through herbs in the {{medicine}} cat's den and with herbs sticking to his pelt, he goes to Mousefur to deliver some fresh-kill. Mousefur says that a certain herb sticking to <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> is the mystery herb, but Jayfeather does not know what it is. To find out, he asks Littlecloud when the medicine cats meet at the Moonpool. The ShadowClan medicine cat recognizes it as parsley, a herb that stops the milk of a cat whose kits die. Jayfeather remembers that while going back to the camp after birth, there is another cat with him besides Squirrelflight: Leafpool, Jayfeather's true mother.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} Taz {{appeared in the}} 2017 DC Comics/Looney Tunes crossover comics, where he was designed more for the DC Universe and faced off against Wonder Woman in the Wonder Woman/Tasmanian Devil Special. In the story, Taz is a Guardian of the Labrynth on Themyscira and fought Diana {{when she was a}} teenager during her trials to become an Amazon warrior. Before Taz could attack her, Diana plays the harp and puts it to sleep before snipping off some of <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> as proof of her victory. She returns to Taz years later as Wonder Woman after Circe uses the Talisman of Eurytale to turn Hippolyta and the other Amazons into stone. As the Talisman can only be stopped by the Minotaur's Amulet, she requests Taz's help as Taz's connection to the other Guardians would lead them down the right path. During the journey, Taz reveals that he wasn't mad at Diana for tricking him, but was rather upset that she took the music away. The two defeat the Minotaur and Circe and the Amazons reward him with a large feast in return. In the issue's backup story (done more {{in the style of the}} classic Looney Tunes shorts), Diana sings to Taz the tale of the Trojan War with her and the Looney Tunes characters roleplaying the major players, but Taz in his dream alters the events to work out more in his favor.|$|E

500|$|Samuel Lord Black as George Sanderson, a chubby, oranged-furred monster with a sole horn {{on top of}} his head. A running gag {{throughout}} the film involves George repeatedly making contact with human artifacts (such as socks and the like which cling to <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> via static), prompting his scare coach to trigger [...] "23–19" [...] incidents with the CDA resulting in him mobbed, shaved bald, and sterilized.

500|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for Framestore in creating Rocket was <b>his</b> <b>fur.</b> Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since [...] "raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use [...] "guide hairs" [...] to control the movements of thick sections of fur. Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.|$|E
500|$|Thus, Innis {{travelled}} extensively {{beginning in}} the summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an [...] canvas-covered canoe hundreds of miles down the Peace River to Lake Athabasca; then down the Slave River to Great Slave Lake. They completed their journey down the Mackenzie, Canada's longest river, to the Arctic Ocean on a small Hudson's Bay Company tug. During his travels, Innis supplemented <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the Western Arctic and the east side of Hudson Bay.|$|E

500|$|Frustrated by bad investments, Irving {{turned to}} writing to {{generate}} additional income, beginning with A Tour on the Prairies, a work which related his recent travels on the frontier. The book was another popular success {{and also the}} first book written and published by Irving in the United States since A History of New York in 1809. [...] In 1834, he was approached by fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who convinced Irving to write a history of <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> trading colony in the American Northwest, now known as Astoria, Oregon. Irving made quick work of Astor's project, shipping the fawning biographical account titled Astoria in February 1836. In 1835, Irving, Astor, {{and a few others}} founded the Saint Nicholas Society in the City of New York.|$|E
500|$|Pixar {{then set}} up a Simulation {{department}} and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt (short for [...] "physics tool"). After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated, this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley's fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way. Every time when Sulley would have to move, <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> would (automatically) react to his movements, thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well. The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo's clothes, which provided another [...] "breakthrough". The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge to animate thanks to those hundreds of creases and wrinkles that automatically occurred in the clothing when the wearer moved. Also, this meant {{they would have to}} solve the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled — in other words, to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect. Fizt applied the same system to Boo's clothes as to Sulley's fur. First of all, Boo would be animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo's body, and every time she [...] would move, her clothes also would react to her movements in a more natural manner.|$|E
2500|$|In the December 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, Stuart and his cavalry—most notably {{his horse}} {{artillery}} under Major John Pelham—protected Stonewall Jackson's flank at Hamilton's Crossing.

He left together with Dmitri and Lazovert into Purishkevich's car, suggesting Rasputin had left the palace alive. Because Purishkevich's wife refused to burn the fur coat and the boots in her small fireplace in Purishkevich's ambulance train, the conspirators went back to the palace with the mentioned items. When the body was wrapped in a curtain, the conspirators drove toward Krestovsky Island and, at about 5 a.m., threw the corpse from a bridge into the Malaya Nevka River into an ice hole. They forgot to attach weights so that the body would sink deep, dropped <b>his</b> <b>fur</b> coat over the railing with the chains, and drove back, without noticing one of Rasputin's goloshes, a rubber boot (size 10), was stuck between the piles of the bridge.|$|E
