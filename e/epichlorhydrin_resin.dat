40|$|The chlorine-Hercosett {{process has}} been {{dominant}} in the wool shrink-proofing industry for more than 30 years. Hypochlorite breaks the hydrophobic nature of wool surface; Hercosett (cationic polyamide <b>epichlorhydrin</b> <b>resin)</b> covers wool and prevents wool from shrinking. From today's modem point of view, however, the chlorineHercosett process shows a number of drawbacks which make the search for an ecologically clean alternative worthwhile: poor handle, yellowing of wool, difficulties in dyeing and most importantly today, environmental impact (rdlease of absorbable organic halogens- AOX to the effluents). As a result, many researches {{have been carried out}} for Non-AOX rapid oxidation of wool. Potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS), hydrogen peroxide and some per acids have been concerned as possible alternatives, but only little commercial successes. It was well known that Hercosett will not deposit on the PMS or hydrogen peroxide treated wool. The key difference. in terms of polymer compatibility between chlorinated and PMS, hydrogen peroxide treated wool is the surface energy (wettability). Surface energy has influence on the spreading properties of Hercosett and wool/polymer interfacial adhesion. Resent researches have shown that this difference is associated with the removal of a fatty acid (lipid), namely IS-methyleicosanoic acid (IS-MEA), which is thought to be chemically bound to the surface of wool fibre by a thio-ester linkage. In common words, chlorination can remove this fatty acid but PMS and hydrogen peroxide treatments can not. The wool shrink-proofing research in this thesis is f<?cused on wool delipidisation. Total delipidisation (97 % of the IS-MEA was removed) is achieved by a cationic surfactant/nucleophile process. During the treatement, hydrophobic complexes between the cationic surfactant and nucleophile are formed which can diffuse into the wool lipid shell. The nucleophile will attack the eletrophilic thio-ester linkage of the wool lipid and liberate the free lipid as its carboxylate salt into water. The wool top after delipidisation, oxidative sulphitolysis and Hercosett 125 treatment shows some significant shrink resist properties when compared to the untreated wool fibre. The same wool top was spun, knitted and wash tested using the standard TM 31 wash test procedure. Such wool fabric has passed 3 x 5 A wash cycles. It was also worth mentioning that the same wool fabric has soft handle and bright shade when compared to the chlorine-Hercosett treated wool. Wool bleaching and photo-yellowing are also important subjects in wool research. The proportion of wool which is bleached is approximately IO% of the total world production. The photo-yellowing effect of ~unlighton bleached wool is greater than on untreated wool. The relationship ofwool bleaching and wool photo-yellowing is studied. FTIR studies shows that there are more wool disulphide bonds cleaved during the reduction bleaching than the oxidation bleaching. The photo-yellowing effect of sunlight on the reductive bleached wool is greater than on the oxidative bleached wool. The reduction in wool cystine residue content is a key effect in preventing photo-yellowing in bleached wool. The decomposition reaction of urea to isocyanic acid and the subsequent reaction of isocyanic acid with nucleophiles such as the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose are studied. The properties of the modified. carbamoylated cellulose have been investigated including the ease of bleaching it when tea stained and its dyeing properties with reactive dyes. The reaction of wool nucleophiles with isocyanic acid derived from sodium cyanate was studied. The properties of the modified wool were investigated. A novel method of colormetric labelling of the tyrosine residues was developed to follow the extent of modification oftyrosine in wool using isocyanic acid.
