Vas deferens sequence indexes (VDSI) of 4. 1 – 4. 9 were found in organisms from stations inside the lagoon, and 3. 6 – 4. 2 in the sea stations.

Delayed degradation of enamel matrix proteins or inhibited protein removal results in impaired and incomplete crystal growth, producing hypomineralized and porous enamel. Severely fluorosed teeth may undergo post-eruptive surface breakdown and post-eruptive dark brown to black staining. Methods: A 13 year old girl presented with severely discoloured maxillary central incisors. Initial aesthetic {{management of}} these teeth was conservative, including in-office tooth whitening, microabrasion and take-home whitening. Results: Dark brown to black staining of the teeth was reduced successfully without the need for gross mechanical preparation of the enamel. Further improvement of aesthetics was achieved with composite veneers. Conclusions: Conservative treatment options such as tooth whitening and microabrasion can dramatically improve severely discoloured fluorosed teeth. This can provide a satisfactory interim outcome or minimize the removal of discoloured enamel and dentine prior to the provision of composite veneers. The use of casein phospho-peptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACPTM) may enhance remineralization and decrease post-operative sensitivity following tooth whitening and microabrasion procedures in hypomineralized teeth.

Progeny groups (full-sib families) were obtained from the pairing of HR males and females and LR males and females. A third progeny group (US) was obtained by random pairing of parents which were not selected as HR or LR. Post-stress plasma cortisol levels in the progeny were first tested at 6 months after hatch and were significantly correlated with the response of the corresponding parental groups, HR>US>LR (178, 126, 81 ng ml- 1 respectively). The difference in responsiveness between LR and HR groups was demonstrated in all four subsequent tests over a 12 month period. There were no significant differences in baseline plasma cortisol levels in LR and HR groups prior to confinement. During a 4 h period of confinement, the differences in plasma cortisol levels between LR and HR fish were sustained throughout, indicating that the trait upon which the fish were selected was related to absolute maximum levels of circulating cortisol, not the rate of change of cortisol levels during exposure to a stressor. A moderately high heritability (h 2) for confinement-induced plasma cortisol of 0. 41 was obtained by a parent-progeny regression.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. It is {{well known}} that every linear operator, T : R[x] ! R[x], can be {{represented}} in the form, T := 1 Xk= 0 Qk(x) Dk; D := d dx; where fQk(x) g 1 k= 0 is a sequence of real polynomials. An outstanding open problem in the theory of distribution of zeros of polynomials is to characterize the sequence, fQk(x) g 1 k = 0, such that the operator T is hyperbolicity preserving; i. e., T maps polynomials with only real zeros to polynomials of the same kind. A large portion of this dissertation focuses on diagonal differential operators; that is, T[Bn(x) ] := 1 Xk= 0 Qk(x) Dk!Bn(x) = nBn(x); n 2 N 0; where fBn(x) g 1 n= 0 is a simple sequence of real polynomial eigenvectors and <b>f</b> <b>ng</b> 1 n= 0 is the corresponding sequence of real eigenvalues. Our analysis leads to new relations between the eigenvector sequence and the eigenvalue sequence in a diagonal differential operator. In particular, we develop new methods for determining the polynomial coefficients, fQk(x) g 1 k= 0, in cases of Hermite, Laguerre, or monomial linear transformations. We establish a new representation of linear operators and demonstrate novel hyperbolicity properties for this representation. We show that every Hermite or Laguerre multiplier sequence can be expressed as a sum of classical multiplier sequences. Using the Malo-Schur-Szeg}o Composition Theorem, we present a new proof of J. Borcea and P. Brändén's seminal result on the hyperbolicity preservation of finite order differential operators. The hyperbolicity preservation of order two differential operators is studied in minute detail; this leads to a new Turán-Wronskian inequality. In addition, a new algebraic characterization is given for the class of Hermite multiplier sequences. Moreover, we prove {{that in the case of}} a Hermite diagonal differential operator, T, the zeros of Qk(x) and Qk+ 1 (x) are interlacing, k 0. We generalize several results of D. Bleecker, G. Csordas, T. Forgács, and A. Piotrowski, partially answer a number of general open problems of T. Craven, G. Csordas, and S. Fisk, and solve a question of M. Chasse. This dissertation concludes with an outline of possible future research and a list of open questions...|$|R

Assume that {{the edges of}} KN have nonnegative weights and associate with each coalition S ` N of players as cost c(S) {{the weight of a}} minimal spanning tree on the node set S [f 0 g. Using reduction to EXACT COVER BY 3 -SETS, we exhibit the following problem to be NP-complete. Given the vector x 2 ! N with x(N) = c(N), decide whether there exists a coalition S such that x(S) ? c(S) ...|$|R

Manalo-San Juan (Lokal <b>ng</b> <b>F.</b> Manalo-San Juan), {{formerly}} Locale of Riverside (Lokal ng Riverside) is {{a chapel}} and former central office complex of the Philippine-based Christian sect, the Iglesia ni Cristo. Located at Barangay Santa Lucia, San Juan, it {{was completed in}} 1952, {{and it is the}} former central office complex and main house of worship of the church. The art-deco ensembles were designed by the national artist of architecture Juan Nakpil, who also built some of the standalone theaters in Rizal Avenue, UP Diliman Campus buildings and Quiapo Church.|$|R
