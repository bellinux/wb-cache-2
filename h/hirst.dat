5|$|Although {{both were}} invited, neither <b>Hirst</b> nor Rhodes toured Australia {{in the winter}} of 1901–02 with Archie MacLaren's team, as the Yorkshire {{committee}} wanted both players to be well rested before the new season. <b>Hirst</b> was statistically less successful in 1902, but he nevertheless returned to the Test team. The summer was very wet, resulting in many rain-affected pitches, known as sticky wickets, which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult. <b>Hirst</b> scored 1,413 runs in the season, at an average of 31.11 with two centuries. He took fewer wickets than the previous year, partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by Yorkshire before giving way to slow bowlers Rhodes and Schofield Haigh, who topped the national first-class bowling averages for the season. In total, <b>Hirst</b> took 83 wickets at an average of 20.33.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hirst</b> died on 3 February 2016 {{at the age}} of 73.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hirst</b> {{was born}} on 7 September 1871 in the Brown Cow Inn, Kirkheaton, a village close to Huddersfield. He {{was the last of}} 10 {{children}} born to James <b>Hirst</b> and his wife Sarah Maria Woolhouse. When his father died in 1880, <b>Hirst</b> lived with his sister Mary Elizabeth Woolhouse and her husband John Berry in Kirkheaton. After leaving school at 10 years of age, <b>Hirst</b> first worked for a hand-loom weaver in a local cottage, and then at a dyeing firm. He played rugby football as a full back during winter, and cricket with his friends and brothers in summer. By the age of 15, <b>Hirst</b> was playing regularly for the Kirkheaton cricket team and his batting and bowling performances regularly won prizes from a local newspaper. His reputation grew; when he was 18 he was a key player in the Kirkheaton team which won the Lumb Challenge Cup of 1889. In the final, watched by players from Yorkshire County Cricket Club, he took five wickets for 23 runs. Days later, invited to take part along with another local player, he appeared for Yorkshire against Cheshire in a non-first-class match in Huddersfield. He scored six runs in his only innings, and took three wickets in the match.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{a graphic}} artist and former {{research}} associate at the Royal College of Art, Robert Dixon, author of 'Mathographics', alleged that <b>Hirst's</b> print Valium had [...] "unmistakable similarities" [...] to one of his own designs. <b>Hirst's</b> manager contested this by explaining the origin of <b>Hirst's</b> piece was from a book The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry (1991)—not realising this was one place where Dixon's design had been published.|$|R
5|$|In four Tests, <b>Hirst</b> scored 157 runs at {{an average}} of 39.25 and took nine wickets {{at an average}} of 23.11. Apart from his Test appearances, <b>Hirst</b> also played twice for the Players against the Gentlemen and played for the same side against the Australians.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} match of the tour, <b>Hirst</b> scored 92 {{and used his}} pull shot more {{effectively}} than on other occasions. He followed this with 66 in the third match but did not take many wickets before the first Test. Warner considered he had nevertheless bowled well but was finding it difficult to maintain his energy in the hot conditions; his bowling lost pace and sting later in his bowling spells. <b>Hirst</b> played in all five Test matches, the first two of which were won by England. In the first game, <b>Hirst</b> took two wickets. In his first innings, he scored a duck and was dropped by Frank Laver before he had scored in the second. He survived to score 60 not out and his partnership with Tom Hayward guided England to victory after wickets had fallen early chasing a target of 194. <b>Hirst</b> scored 11 runs in the second match and took three wickets on a difficult batting pitch, badly affected by rain. Although this performance was not statistically impressive, Warner thought he bowled very well. During the third Test, <b>Hirst</b> took three wickets and, with innings of 58 and 44, {{was one of the}} few successful England batsmen in a poor performance which enabled Australia to win the match. England won the crucial fourth match to ensure the series victory. <b>Hirst</b> took two wickets and contributed scores of 25 and 18. Australia achieved a win in the final match in which <b>Hirst</b> scored 0 and 1, but after taking no wickets in the first innings he achieved his best Test figures of the tour in the second, with five for 48.|$|E
5|$|During the war <b>Hirst,</b> {{along with}} Rhodes and their team-mate Schofield Haigh, {{worked in a}} munitions factory in Huddersfield. <b>Hirst</b> and Rhodes were paid by Yorkshire to play in war-time cricket matches on {{a certain number of}} Saturdays. <b>Hirst</b> played in the Bradford League, and became known among cricketers for {{accepting}} minimal fees from financially struggling clubs. When first-class cricket restarted in 1919, <b>Hirst</b> resumed playing for Yorkshire. In the first match of the season he hit an aggressive unbeaten 180 against MCC, to secure a draw for the county; he followed this with two more centuries in {{the first two weeks of}} the season. Although his form later faltered, he played some substantial innings in difficult circumstances and ended the season with 1,441 runs at an average of 38.94. He bowled infrequently, taking 18 wickets at 29.27. During this season, <b>Hirst</b> accepted the position of coach at Eton College. In the last match of the season, at Scarborough, he was given a warm reception by the crowd, who did not expect to see him playing for Yorkshire again. However, he appeared on occasions during the school holidays in the next two seasons, although he did not score any centuries, did not average more than 24 with the bat and took only 21 wickets in total. At the end of the 1921 season <b>Hirst</b> retired as a Yorkshire player, and made what was expected to be his final first-class appearance in a Scarborough Festival match, in which he captained the Players against the Gentlemen. On the last day of the match, Hirst's 50th birthday, he took the final two wickets to secure victory for his side. The crowd gathered outside the pavilion and demanded to see him; he gave a farewell speech, and was moved by the reception given to him.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 1903 season, <b>Hirst</b> {{suffered}} a leg injury. This, coupled with other players' absences, was {{partly responsible for}} a poor start to the season by Yorkshire, and although the team recovered, it could only achieve third place in the County Championship. When <b>Hirst</b> returned his bowling speed was reduced, but during the season he rediscovered his swing bowling. In completing the first of 10 consecutive doubles, he took 128 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.94 and scored 1,844 runs at an average of 47.28. For Yorkshire, he topped both the batting and bowling averages and had the third highest batting average in the country. <b>Hirst</b> played in two end-of-season games for the Players against the Gentlemen; his 124 not out in the second match was his only century in the Players versus Gentlemen series.|$|E
5|$|George Herbert <b>Hirst</b> (7 September 1871– 10 May 1954) was a {{professional}} English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1891 and 1921, with a further appearance in 1929. He played in 24 Test matches for England between 1897 and 1909, touring Australia twice. One of the best all-rounders of his time, <b>Hirst</b> was a left arm medium-fast bowler and right-handed batsman. He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season 14 times, the second most of any cricketer after his contemporary and team-mate Wilfred Rhodes. One of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1901, <b>Hirst</b> scored 36,356 runs and took 2,742 wickets in first-class cricket. In Tests, he made 790 runs and captured 59 wickets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hirst</b> {{returned}} {{to play for}} Yorkshire after the war, but became a cricket coach at Eton College in 1920, where he remained until 1938. After making occasional appearances in 1920 and 1921, he retired from regular first-class cricket. He maintained his connections with Yorkshire {{for the rest of}} his life, coached young players and established an excellent reputation for developing players of all social backgrounds. A popular player, coach and personality with cricketers and spectators, <b>Hirst</b> died in 1954, aged 82.|$|E

5|$|In the Test series, <b>Hirst</b> scored 217 runs at {{an average}} of 24.11 and took 15 wickets {{at an average}} of 30.06. He scored 569 runs at 33.47 and took 36 wickets at 24.50 over all {{first-class}} games on the tour. His best bowling performance was five for 37 against Tasmania. Warner described <b>Hirst</b> as a very consistent batsman throughout the tour, and noted that while he was a less effective bowler in Australian conditions than at home, he was often unlucky.|$|E
5|$|Never {{an ivory}} tower academic, <b>Hirst</b> held {{a number of}} {{influential}} appointments {{during the course of}} his career. He {{was a member of the}} Prime Minister's Republic Advisory Committee, the chair of the Commonwealth Civics Education Group, a member of the Film Australia Board, a council member of the National Museum of Australia, and a member of the board of Old Parliament House in Canberra. He wrote the official history of Australia for new citizens and took a prominent part in the history summit convened by Prime Minister John Howard in 2006. <b>Hirst</b> advised the Victorian Government on the school history curriculum and was history adviser to the National Curriculum Authority.

5|$|While {{serving as}} the Eton coach, <b>Hirst</b> also worked with young Yorkshire players during the school holidays, and {{maintained}} his coaching connection with the county until shortly before his death. Despite {{the differences in the}} backgrounds of the players, <b>Hirst</b> was equally respected at Eton and when he acted as a coach to the Yorkshire team. At Yorkshire <b>Hirst</b> worked with young players in the cricket nets at Headingley, took charge of indoor trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players. One of Hirst's most notable achievements as a coach was improving the bowling of George Macaulay {{to the point where he}} became a key member of the Yorkshire team.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a player, <b>Hirst</b> occasionally umpired first-class matches, {{taking charge of}} at least one match at every Scarborough Festival between 1922 and 1938. He also umpired two matches on Yorkshire's tour of Jamaica in 1936, and a Minor Counties match between Yorkshire and Lancashire second teams.|$|E
5|$|For {{the winter}} of 1897–98, <b>Hirst</b> was {{selected}} as part of Andrew Stoddart's team to tour Australia. The team was outplayed and lost the Test matches 4–1, hampered by the poor form of the bowlers and ill health among the team, not least from Stoddart himself who missed several matches {{following the death of}} his mother. <b>Hirst,</b> suffering from a strained leg for some of the tour, was ineffective as a bowler. The hard Australian pitches favoured batsmen and did not suit Hirst's style of bowling. In all the first-class matches on the tour, he took only nine wickets at the very expensive average of 75.77. His batting was inconsistent and he scored 338 runs at an average of 21.12. His best scores came in minor matches. Nevertheless, he was selected for England in four of the five Test matches. His debut came in the first match, England's only victory, when he scored 62 batting at number six in the batting order. Despite bowling 41 overs in the game, he failed to take a wicket; his maiden Test match wicket came in the following Test, but he took only two wickets in the series. In the third Test, <b>Hirst</b> scored 85, which remained the highest Test score of his career, but in this series he reached double figures only once more. When the series ended, <b>Hirst</b> had scored 207 runs at an average of 29.57.|$|E

5|$|From 1990 onwards, Grossman {{has been}} {{involved}} in a side project, Ghostwriters, with Rob <b>Hirst</b> from Midnight Oil. Ghostwriters have released four albums with 2007's Political Animal on Sony BMG. Shepherd had played with Ghostwriters on their albums Ghostwriters in 1991 and Fibromoon in 1999. During 2001, Grossman performed 20 concerts with long-time friend Matt Moffitt (1956–2003) singer-songwriter and founder of Matt Finish. Grossman had been an early member of Matt Finish, he returned to perform and record Just a Short Note (Best of) released in December 2001. The Kelly Gang was a 2004 project Grossman formed with Jack Nolan, they brought in <b>Hirst</b> and Scott Aplin (Waikiki) to record Looking for the Sun; Shepherd performed as a session musician.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hirst</b> {{completed}} the 14th and final double {{of his career}} in 1913, leading the Yorkshire batting averages with 1,540 runs at an average of 35.81. His bowling was not as effective and he was no longer Yorkshire's main attacking bowler, as Alonzo Drake and Major Booth headed the averages. <b>Hirst</b> took 101 wickets at 20.13. During the following season, the last before the First World War, <b>Hirst</b> was further afflicted by injuries and missed some matches. He bowled far less frequently than in recent seasons and his 43 wickets, which cost 29.81, were his fewest since 1898; {{it was the first time}} since 1902 he failed to complete the double. His batting remained effective and he produced some good performances when his team were in difficult circumstances, although his two centuries were against the weaker bowling attacks of Northamptonshire and Somerset. He scored 1,670 runs at 41.75. In June, he was selected in a match to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the current Lord's ground, playing for the Rest of England against the MCC side which had toured South Africa the previous winter. The outbreak of war brought the season to an early close in August.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Yorkshire {{won their}} second County Championship. <b>Hirst</b> hit a century against Leicestershire and nine other scores over fifty; this {{improvement}} in his batting took him past 1,000 {{runs for the}} first time, and his average of 28.05 was substantially higher than he had achieved previously. With the ball he took 104 wickets, at the more expensive average of 21.61, to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the first time. However, some critics in Yorkshire were unhappy that his batting had improved, believing that the extra effort involved would diminish his effectiveness as a bowler. They considered a powerful bowling attack to be vital to the team's success, more so than a strong batting line-up, and expressed the opinion that <b>Hirst</b> should concentrate on one discipline rather than dividing his energy. Over the next few seasons, these fears were proven to some extent, Wisden noting in 1901 {{that he was a}} less effective bowler than previously. In 1897, <b>Hirst</b> completed the double again. He scored 1,535 runs at an average of 35.69, with a century and 11 fifties, and took 101 wickets at an average of 23.22. These performances were good enough to earn him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen in the prestigious matches at The Oval and Lord's, in both of which he scored half-centuries.|$|E
