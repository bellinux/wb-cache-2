50|$|It {{was noted}} in a study {{conducted}} by the University of Queensland that the use of telemedicine within pediatrics provided convenient access to specialist and pediatric services for rural areas lacking on-site pediatricians. Telepediatrics involves a wide range of telecommunication options. The most utilized methods are email, telephone correspondence, and videoconferences. Approximately 85 percent of all correspondences result in consultations by videoconference. Physicians are able to provide treatment counseling and diagnostic follow-ups by remote satellite conferences. In the study of telemedicine in remote Australian locations conducted by the University of Queensland, it was noted the benefit of telepediatrics spread to more than 35 different pediatric sub-specialties, including cardiology, nephrology, neurology, dermatology, oncology, and psychiatry. For example, remote teledermatology consultations have become commonplace at many medical centers. Many diagnostic dermatology evaluations for young children can be performed by using high-quality still images. Although standard video cameras used in teleconferencing systems may not provide enough detail to make a dermatologic diagnosis, special peripheral cameras termed <b>dermatoscopes</b> have proven adequate.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, a California {{medical device}} manufacturer, 3Gen, {{introduced}} the first polarized <b>dermatoscope,</b> the DermLite. Polarised illumination, {{coupled with a}} cross-polarised viewer, reduces (polarised) skin surface reflection, thus allowing visualisation of skin structures (the light from which is depolarised) without using an immersion fluid. Examination of several lesions is thus more convenient because physicians {{no longer have to}} stop and apply immersion oil, alcohol, or water to the skin before examining each lesion. With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin contact glass <b>dermatoscope,</b> they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass contact plate.|$|E

40|$|Alentejo {{covers a}} third of Portugal, yet {{it is home to}} only 5 % of the population. Residents of the region are poorer, older, and less educated {{than the rest of the}} country. There is a {{shortage}} of physicians in several specialties. The low population density, a concentration of specialized services, and a poor public transportation network all create barriers to access. Telemedicine was introduced in 1998 to help address these challenges. In this article, we provide an overview of the program and its current status, focusing on infrastructure, services, and activity volume. We also discuss the impact the program has had from the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals. From 1998 to 2011, there were 132, 546 episodes of service using telemedicine, including real-time teleconsultations, teleradiology, teleultrasound, and telepathology. At present, the network includes 20 primary care units and five hospitals, covering almost 30, 000 km 2 and 500, 000 people. Units have high-resolution videoconferencing equipment, access to patients' clinical records, an image archive, and peripherals, such as electronic <b>dermatoscopes</b> and phonendoscopes. Teleconsultations are available in 15 medical specialties and areas, ranging from neurology to pediatric surgery. In 2008, regional health authorities started a tele-education program, and by the end of 2011, 876 healthcare professionals, across 52 locations, had participated in remote learning sessions. More than a decade since telemedicine was introduced in Alentejo, it is now an integral part of everyday service provision.

40|$|Importance: Teledermatology is {{a topical}} {{clinical}} approach being trialled in Australia and overseas (1). With {{a majority of}} dermatologists residing in metropolitan areas, teledermatology provides an apparent low cost and convenient means of access for individuals living outside these areas (1, 2). It is important that any proposed new addition to a healthcare system is assessed on the ground of economic cost and effectiveness. Objective: To summarise and evaluate the current economic evidence comparing store-and-forward teledermatology (S&FTD) with conventional face-to-face (FTF) care. Evidence Review: Search terms with appropriate amendments were used to return S&FTD articles that included economic analysis. Six databases were searched; title, abstract and full text reviews were conducted by two researchers. References of all unique returned articles were searched by hand. (3) Findings: Eleven articles were selected for inclusion; consisting of once cost-analysis, five cost-minimisation analyses, three cost-effectiveness analyses and two cost-utility analyses. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist {{was used to evaluate}} quality, scores ranged from 7 to 21 out of a possible 24 points, with a median score of 17. Conclusions and Relevance: Current evidence is sparse, but suggests that S&FTD can be cost-effective. It appears to be cost-effective when it is used as a triage mechanism to reduce FTF appointment requirements. The cost-effectiveness of S&FTD increases when patients are required to travel further distances to access dermatology services. Further economic research is required for the emerging S&FTD which uses <b>dermatoscopes</b> in combination with smartphone applications, and around the possibility and consequences of patients self-capturing and transmitting images...|$|R

Methods The study was carried out by three dermatologists experienced {{in the use of the}} <b>dermatoscope.</b> Patients had been referred by primary care physicians to the pigmented lesion clinic and had melanocytic lesions considered by dermatologists to merit excision on clinical grounds. A set of 74 sequentially observed lesions referred for excision, 37 melanomas and 37 melanocytic naevi, was used as the initial set and, thereafter, a second set of 52 lesions comprising 32 melanomas and 20 melanocytic naevi was used to validate conclusions drawn from the original set. Clinical features such as appearance and history, and also <b>dermatoscope</b> features were included in the assessment. Results In both sets of lesions, the most powerful identifying feature of lesions subsequently shown on pathological examination to be melanoma was the presence of three or more colours seen in the lesion on dermatoscopy. In the initial set of lesions, the age of the patient, an irregular edge and largest diameter of the lesion also contributed to diagnosis; however, in the second set of lesions these variables contributed little additional discriminatory value.

Objectives: We assessed the use and barriers to adoption of dermoscopy among Taiwanese dermatologists to determine the relationship between dermoscopy use and the characteristics of dermoscopy users. Methods: A questionnaire of 20 items regarding demographic characteristics, dermoscopy training, and application was mailed to all dermatologists listed in the 2013 Taiwanese Dermatological Association registry. Results: Of the 950 mailed questionnaires, 202 were returned and 195 were identified to be eligible. Of the valid respondents, 51. 8 % used dermoscopy and 62. 1 % had attended courses for dermoscopy training. Dermoscopy use was significantly associated with women (pÂ =Â  0. 018), residents (pÂ <Â  0. 001), young age (pÂ <Â  0. 001), dermoscopy training (pÂ <Â  0. 001), and owning dermoscopy books (pÂ <Â  0. 001). The majority of dermoscopy users practiced in medical centers (pÂ <Â  0. 001) and were involved in resident teaching (pÂ <Â  0. 001).
