5|$|Geißhardt, then a Hauptmann (Captain), {{arrived at}} Wevelgem on 11 January 1943 {{to take over}} command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of the III. Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG26—26th Fighter Wing) from Major Josef Priller. Geißhardt's arrogance grated {{on some of the}} pilots, who felt that <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> his fellow pilots who had not yet earned the Knight's Cross with too much disdain.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, Anna Seward {{published}} a book about Sabrina's upbringing. Edgeworth followed up with his memoirs, in which he claimed Sabrina loved Day. Sabrina herself, on the other hand, said she was miserable with Day and that <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> her as a slave.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, {{its first}} foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> the {{population}} generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, {{although he did}} not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan Kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell into the hands of successive tyrants.|$|E

5|$|As a teenager, Landy {{aspired to}} show business, briefly {{serving as an}} early manager for George Benson. During the 1960s, he began {{studying}} psychology, earning his doctorate at the University of Oklahoma. After moving to Los Angeles, <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> many celebrity clients, including musician Alice Cooper and actors Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, Maureen McCormick, and Gig Young. He also developed an unorthodox 24-hour therapy intended to stabilize his patients by micromanaging their lives {{with a team of}} counselors and doctors.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS, during the 1980s and 1990s <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> many hundreds of HIV-positive people. During the height of the AIDS crisis, Sonnabend helped create several AIDS organisations, including the AIDS Medical Foundation (now amfAR), the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (now ACRIA), which pioneered community-based research, and the PWA Health Group, the first and largest formally recognised buyers' club.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as the {{defender of the}} Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction of}} the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> fairly, and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Thomas Reid’s {{theory of}} sensory {{perception}} {{has been widely}} examined in recent years. Commentators have been more or less united in the claim that Reid treats the visual perception of the shape, or figure, of objects in a way {{significantly different from the}} way in which <b>he</b> <b>treats</b> sensory perception through the other sense modalities, and even from the way in which <b>he</b> <b>treats</b> the visual perception of color. This paper argues that the recent secondary literature is mistaken in this regard. I argue that Reid treats the visual perception of shape no differently from the way in which <b>he</b> <b>treats,</b> say, the tactile perception of hardness...|$|R
5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} by Watanabe {{as an extension}} of his work on the television series, which <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> as a series of miniature films. So as not to alienate fans of the series, a large amount of aesthetic material was incorporated, while also adjusting it to make it accessible to newcomers. Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films and a higher animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated to contrast against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno's music.|$|E

5|$|Geographers in the Roman Empire such as Ptolemy {{provided}} a rough {{sketch of the}} eastern Indian Ocean, including the Malay Peninsula and beyond this the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Ptolemy's Cattigara was most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine-era Roman items have been found. Ancient Chinese geographers demonstrated a general knowledge of West Asia and Rome's eastern provinces. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of the contemporary reunification of northern and southern China, which <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> as separate nations recently at war. This mirrors both the conquest of Chen by Emperor Wen of Sui (reigned 581–604 AD) {{as well as the}} names Cathay and Mangi used by later medieval Europeans in China during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Han-Chinese Southern Song dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. <b>He</b> <b>treated</b> the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent {{in the shape of a}} church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
5|$|Lewis' {{presence}} on the Street infuriates Gail, who still holds a grudge for the way <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> Audrey. Gail hopes Lewis may have left for good when he attends court on charges of fraud. However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech {{about the way he}} let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service. The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Lewis turns on the charm and quickly wins the reviewer over. Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E

5|$|Under John, {{the monks}} of Bath became {{known for their}} scholarship, {{although}} he was not particularly noted for learning. William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the canons of Wells abominably. William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived to be old. At first <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them. John's canons of Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings {{as part of the}} movement of the see to Bath. A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office. John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert. Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{had been}} keen {{to return to}} {{excavation}} in Britain. Based on {{the one he had}} organised in India, Wheeler developed an archaeological training course, which he ran at Verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct British students in the methodologies of excavation. In summer 1950, he was invited by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments to direct a trial excavation at Bindon Hill in Dorset. It was a leisurely project which <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> as a seaside holiday. He was invited by the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works to excavate the Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications in North Riding, Yorkshire, which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952. Aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the British archaeological scene, he was joined by Alcock and Alcock's wife, among others. Wheeler published his report on the site in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At {{the end of the summer}} he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E

5|$|Neville {{was named}} Lord Chancellor of England on 17 May 1226. The {{appointment}} {{was made by}} the great council during the minority of King Henry III, and Neville obtained a grant of the office for life. Unlike Hubert de Burgh, who lost his offices when Henry III attained his majority and took control of the government, Neville remained chancellor with only slight disagreements until 1238, although a confirmation of the lifetime nature of his tenure was made in 1232. Under Neville, the first signs that the chancery was becoming a department of the government, rather than just a royal department {{that was part of the}} royal household, began to emerge. The contemporary writer Matthew Paris praised Neville for his actions as chancellor, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> all equally and was transparent in discharging his duties, which was important, as the chancellor's office controlled access to the king. Neville oversaw a number of changes in chancery procedures, splitting off the liberate rolls from the letters close in 1226 and reviving the keeping of the Charter Rolls in 1227. He also issued writs on his own authority, the so-called writs de cursu. Neville received a number of gifts and privileges from the king while chancellor, including the right of exemption from the seizure of his possessions by any royal or other secular official. The king also agreed not to interfere with the execution of Neville's last will and testament.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{potential}} of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job of the woman of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already very detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. James's education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a sixteen-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man John hired to instruct his son, except that <b>he</b> <b>treated</b> the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. John dismissed the tutor in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, sent James to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.|$|E
