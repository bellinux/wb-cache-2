40|$|Eutrophication {{is known}} as the most common problem in water bodies, caused by high {{concentrations}} of different nutrients leading to unbalanced growth of aquatic plants, among other symptoms. Hence, the possibility of eutrophication prediction can be beneficial to the sustainable management of these natural resources and create an opportunity to control their trophic conditions over time. A software package applied for generating these predictions is PAMOLARE with its different models (layers). The 1 -Layer model of this method was selected to investigate the trophic condition of hypertrophic Zaribar Lake. Prior to 1012, water samples were collected from six stations over a seven-year period. During the last year of this period, sediment samples were also collected. The concentrations of N and P were measured in the samples. The initial results showed that the Zaribar Lake is a <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>water</b> body. Applying the PAMOLARE 1 -Layer model showed that this model was not powerful enough to predict the trophic changes in this <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>water</b> body and suggested that other models should be examined and modified for use in these ecosystems. Alternatively, it is necessary to improve the software for the prediction of eutrophication in <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>water</b> bodies...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on {{determining}} the trophic status of the two basins of the Niwa Reservoir - Niwa I and Niwa II (Sawin commune, Lubelskie Province, SE Poland) at the sixth year of operation, by using partial TSI indexes – TSI(SD), TSI(TP), TSI(chl-a), as well as qualitative and quantitative structures of phytoplankton. As a supplementary, index TSI(TOC) was employed [Dunalska 2011]. We show that the phytoplankton abundance, as well as TSI(chl-a) and TSI(TP) were relatively low and typical for mesotrophic waters (with the exception of July TSI(TP) values for the Niwa II basin), although the evaluation of trophy based on other partial TSI indexes – TSI(SD), TSI(TOC) pointed to a eutrophic or even a <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>water</b> characteristic. The obtained results were discussed in detail and referenced to other, non-nutrient related trophy factors: morphometric features and geology of the basins, {{as well as the}} physicochemical properties of its water...|$|E
40|$|The {{aquatic plant}} {{communities}} of the Tiber River basin have been examined to evaluate their role as bioindicators of the water quality of the Italian peninsular rivers. The compatibility curves of phytocoenoses to water chemico-physical gradients show a correlation between the distribution pattern of the vegetation types and the water’s chemico-physical features, such as different levels of water pollution. In particular, Fontinaletum antipyreticae, Ranunculo-Sietum, Elodeo-Potametum crispi and Nasturtietum officinalis develop in meso-eutrophic and fairly clean water, Potamogeton nodosus community and Ceratophylletum demersi in eutrophic water of medium quality, while Myriophylletum spicati and especially Potametum pectinati and algal communities with Entheromorpha flexuosa are found in <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>water</b> of poor quality. These phytocoenoses can be utilised as valid bioindicators of water quality. On the contrary, Callitrichetum stagnalis, Myriophylletum verticillati, Najadetum marinae and algal communities with Cladophora glomerata are not effective bioindicators, showing a wide and sometimes unclear synecology...|$|E

40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{threaten}} {{the water quality}} of many eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes and cause severe ecological and economic damage worldwide. Dense blooms often deplete the dissolved CO 2 concentration and raise pH. Yet, quantitative prediction of the feedbacks between phytoplankton growth, CO 2 drawdown and the inorganic carbon chemistry of aquatic ecosystems has received surprisingly little attention. Here, we develop a mathematical model to predict dynamic changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH and alkalinity during phytoplankton bloom development. We tested the model in chemostat experiments with the freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa at different CO 2 levels. The experiments showed that dense blooms sequestered large amounts of atmospheric CO 2, not only by their own biomass production but also by inducing a high pH and alkalinity that enhanced the capacity for DIC storage in the system. We used the model to explore how phytoplankton blooms of eutrophic waters will respond to rising CO 2 levels. The model predicts that (1) dense phytoplankton blooms in low- and moderately alkaline waters can deplete the dissolved CO 2 concentration to limiting levels and raise the pH over a relatively wide range of atmospheric CO 2 conditions, (2) rising atmospheric CO 2 levels will enhance phytoplankton blooms in low- and moderately alkaline waters with high nutrient loads, and (3) above some threshold, rising atmospheric CO 2 will alleviate phytoplankton blooms from carbon limitation, resulting in less intense CO 2 depletion and a lesser increase in pH. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the model predictions were qualitatively robust. Quantitatively, the predictions were sensitive to variation in lake depth, DIC input and CO 2 gas transfer across the air-water interface, but relatively robust to variation in the carbon uptake mechanisms of phytoplankton. In total, these findings warn that rising CO 2 levels {{may result in a}} marked intensification of phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Urban water bodies {{frequently}} receive untreated {{sewage and}} water levels in such water bodies are maintained by daily inputs of sewage. They function as “variable-zone” anaerobic-aerobic lagoons suffering several macrophyte, biotic and abiotic stresses. We have studied two such lakes in Bangalore (Bellandur- 360 ha and Varthur- 220 ha) to understand whether such an occurrence {{could be made}} beneficial (maintaining water levels as well as treatment). Such <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>water</b> body receives sewage at 180 - 250 mg/L and is discharged at 25 - 80 mg/L COD/BOD in different seasons. In an earlier study we reported macrophyte altering the purification function of the water body. In this paper we studied the impact of phytoplankton dynamics and macrophyte cover on the functions such as organic load removal. Algal community analysis, algal biomass, macrophyte cover, water quality, nutrient status was studied seasonally during 2009 - 2010. Oxygen deficiency and sometimes anoxia, recorded from surface samples resulted in high quantities of NH 4 +-N (30 - 40 mg/L) and phosphate (0. 5 - 4 mg/L) -characteristics of anoxic hypertrophic urban lakes. The productiveness favoured high phytoplanktonic community characterized by small cells (< 10 μm; Chlorella sp. - highest numbers). The lake could be clearly demarcated into an initial anaerobic zone (40 % area), a facultative zone (20 %) and an aerobic zone (40 %) based on redox values and GIS/bathymetry. During summer the lake is covered by floating macrophytes converting the lake into an anoxic/anaerobic water pool subduing the water purification function as well as aesthetics. When macrophytes are controlled such sewage fed water bodies {{can be used for}} treating urban wastewater while also maintaining water sustainability in these semi-arid ecosystems. This paper reports the community dynamics of phytoplankton, their function and competition with macrophytes...|$|E
40|$|L'évolution spatio-temporelle, {{qualitative}} et quantitative du peuplement phytoplanctonique a été suivie au lac municipal de Yaoundé. Pour cela des prélèvements hebdomadaires ont été effectués de novembre 1996 à décembre 1997, {{au niveau}} d'une station de la zone centrale du lac. Trois descripteurs (indice de diversité spécifique, régularité et diagrammes rangs-fréquences) ont été utilisés pour l'analyse de la dynamique de la structure du peuplement. L'indice de diversité spécifique obtenu à partir des biomasses spécifiques, par la formule dérivée de celle de SHANNON et WEAVER (1949), est compris entre 0, 68 et 4, 64 bits/µg. La régularité (PIELOU, 1966) varie de 0, 14 à 0, 84; les faibles valeurs correspondant dans l'ensemble à la présence des espèces fortement dominantes. Les profils des diagrammes rangs-fréquences, établis en coordonnées log-log, associés aux faibles valeurs de la diversité, sont essentiellement caractéristiques des stades pionniers (1 et 1 ') de l'évolution d'un lac tel que décrits par MARGALEF (1967) et FRONTIER (1976). Le stade 2 est rare alors que le stade 3 est absent. Une analyse simultanée basée sur les variations spatio-temporelles de la densité cellulaire et de l'indice de diversité spécifique, sur les valeurs de la régularité, et sur les profils des diagrammes rangs-fréquences révèle le caractère immature permanent des populations phytoplanctoniques inféodées à ce biotope, et caractérise ainsi un milieu eutrophe à hypereutrophe où aucun stade d'équilibre n'est atteint. La richesse du milieu en éléments biogènes et sa faible profondeur (Zmax= 4, 3 m) sont à l'origine de sa vulnérabilité. L'événement susceptible d'interrompre la succession des populations s'est avéré être le brassage des eaux, provoqué aussi bien par les pluies que les vents dont l'énergie cinétique est fréquemment suffisante pour entraîner un brassage complet d'une colonne d'eau de hauteur aussi faible. The Yaounde municipal lake (3 ° 52 'N, 11 ° 32 'E) is a shallow <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>water</b> body (Z max= 4. 3 m), situated downstream from Yaounde. It is an artificial lake {{resulting from a}} dam constructed in 1951 across a small river named Mingoa. Like many other water bodies in urbanised areas, this ecosystem switched rapidly from being mesotrophic to hypertrophic during the 1980 's, due {{to the expansion of}} human activity and an inefficient treatment of wastewater in its catchment area. This study was carried out with the objective to analyse the ecological succession and the spatio-temporal fluctuations of the phytoplankton population structure in this shallow equatorial lake. Samples were collected at weekly intervals from November 1996 to December 1997, at a station near its central zone (depth= 3. 5 m), using an opaque horizontal PVC Van Dorn sampler. Sampling operations were conducted at the following levels: surface; - 0. 5 m; - 1 m; - 1. 5 m and - 2. 5 m. Individual phytoplankton from 1 % iodine acid preserved subsamples (BOURRELLY, 1990) were enumerated with an inverted microscope (Olympus CK 2) at 200 X magnification, using a Sedgwick-Rafter counting cell, according to UTHERMÖHL (1958). At least 400 individuals (colonies, bundles or trichomes, depending on existing life forms) were counted on each subsample. Specific biomass was then obtained using the biovolume method. To evaluate the population structure dynamics, the SHANNON and WEAVER (1949) specific diversity index method and the evenness (PIELOU, 1966) method were computerized using specific biomass, the evenness being the ratio between the real and the maximal diversity (log 2 S, where S is the number of species). Also, rank-frequency diagrams were carried out in logarithmic co-ordinates according to FRONTIER (1969), using integrated samples obtained from grab samples collected over the entire water column. Cell densities were highest in the uppermost meter of the water column {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season, due to the exponential development of species such as Planktothrix mougeotii, Chlamydomonas sp., Eudorina elegans, Euglena gracilis, Gonyostomum semen, Euglena texta, Phacus helicoïdes, Closterium limneticum, Cryptomonas ovata, Peridinium cf. gutwinskii, Trachelomonas hispida var. crenulatocollis and Cyclotella meneghiniana. The specific diversity index varied 0. 68 and 4. 64 bits/µg, and values gradually decreased from the first uppermost meter to the bottom of the water column. Evenness varied from 0. 14 to 0. 84 with a somewhat similar spatio-temporal variation as the diversity index. Low values of these descriptors generally correspond to the presence of a highly dominant species. The rank-frequency diagrams were mainly S-shaped, indicating the predominance of one species which in this study was either Chlamydomonas sp or Planktothrix mougeotii. A simultaneous analysis of the ecological succession and the spatio-temporal variations of the phytoplanktonic structure revealed that the functioning of this ecosystem was essentially allogenic in nature and was strongly influenced by the supply of decayed organic matter from the Mingoa stream, and effluents from ministerial buildings and hotels located near the lake. This permanent supply of abundant biogenic elements, coupled with the low depth of the ecosystem, makes it vulnerable. Ecological succession, frequently limited to the pioneer stages (1 and 1 '), reflected the briefness of the different phases of phytoplankton growth, and the consequences of disturbances regularly undergone by the phytoplankton community. The second stage was scarcely reached while the third was absent. These successions were mainly controlled by rainfall, as well as wind, which is responsible for the mixing of such a shallow water column. These results can be considered important for the Yaounde municipal lake and other water bodies close to densely populated areas in Cameroon for which there is no management plan. Urgent actions need to be carried out to rehabilitate this ecosystem that fluctuates between the eutrophic and hypertrophic status...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the role of}} natural and anthropogenic environmental perturbations in shaping the community structure and dynamics of pico- and nanophytoplankton in coastal waters. The distribution patterns of phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-CYAN) and phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-CYAN), autotrophic picoeukaryotes (PEUK) and nanophytoplankton (NANO) were examined {{over a period of}} 3 yr in 24 Mediterranean coastal lagoons displaying wide trophic gradients (from 0. 2 to 630 mu g chlorophyll a [chl a] l(- 1)) and salinity gradients (from fresh to marine waters). In summer, picoplanktonic abundances reached 3 x 10 (8) cells l(- 1), 5 x 10 (9) cells l(- 1) and 6 x 10 (10) cells l(- 1) for PE-CYAN, PC-CYAN and PEUK, respectively. PE-CYAN and PC-CYAN showed opposing responses to environmental gradients, resulting in a restricted dominance of PE-CYAN in oligotrophic marine lagoons and a dominance of PC-CYAN in some eutrophic brackish lagoons. Most lagoons exhibited steady-state nutrient conditions, giving competitive advantages to small eukaryotic algae, even in eutrophic and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>waters.</b> Among the picophytoplankton, picoeukaryotes (ca. 2 to 3 mu m) are the most competitive with increasing nutrient availability; in terms of abundance and biomass, their relative and absolute importance tended to increase with increasing total chl a biomass. Freshwater discharges resulted in large pulses of nutrient and more turbulent systems that altered the structure of the phytoplankton community and stimulated fast-growing NANO composed of phytoflagellates and diatoms (ca. 3 to 6 mu m, up to 1. 6 x 10 (9) cells l(- 1)). Members of the microphytoplankton (ca. 20 to 200 mu m) were rarely observed in eutrophic and hypertrophic lagoons and were composed of harmful dinoflagellates in oligotrophic lagoons. These results show that anthropogenic and meteorological changes are highly influential on the composition and size structure of phytoplankton communities...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} dinoflagellate resting cysts in surface {{sediment}} samples {{was carried out}} in Tokyo Bay, Japan, to document their horizontal distribution. At least 21 different cyst types were found. Dominant cyst types allowed the recognition of assemblages which form three different dinoflagellate cyst communities: the innermost part of the Bay, the central area and the mouth area. In all stations in Tokyo Bay, heterotrophic dinoflagellate cysts always occupied {{more than half of the}} cyst populations. Cysts of Polykrikos schwartzii/kofoidii are the most abundant heterotrophic species.

40|$|A 1 -year {{cycle of}} physico-chemical {{measurements}} {{was conducted in}} the Marano and Grado Lagoon (Adriatic Sea, Italy) with the aim to assess its trophic state. Some selected variables (nutrients, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity) were {{used to describe the}} system within the application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and to compare it with other Mediterranean environments. From an ecological point of view the Marano and Grado Lagoon {{is one of the best}} conserved wetlands in the whole Mediterranean area and is protected by several European environmental pieces of legislation. However, the neighbouring mainland hosts several socio-economic activities which can affect its water quality. The results obtained in this work highlighted considerable spatial and temporal variability of physico-chemical parameters. Specifically, a large amount of anthropogenic nutrients, mainly in form of nitrogen (N), was carried from inland through river discharges in the Marano basin (western sector). However, these inputs were offset by the water exchange with the adjacent open sea, which exerted a dynamic dilution effect, and induced low water residence time thus limiting nutrients enrichment and their accumulation for long time periods. The Molar Redfield ratio (DIN/SRP) was always higher than the optimum value of 16 (in some cases it was up to 2000), thus suggesting that the system is phosphorus (P) limited, as confirmed by low chlorophyll a content, rare algal blooms and good water oxygenation. Trophic state indices and threshold values (EEA method, Carlson Trophic Index, TRIX and ASSETS) were applied. A broad range of classes was found (from oligotrophic to <b>hypertrophic</b> depending on <b>water</b> bodies, method applied and period of the year), thus suggesting that an over simplification of this complex ecosystem should be avoided. Further studies will be conducted in order to define the Lagoon's ecological status sensu WFD and the adequate management implications...|$|R
