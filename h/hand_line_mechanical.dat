40|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>line</b> {{is the one}} {{of fishing}} gears that has been known and more used by {{fisherman}} at Tambelan island Kepulauan Riau. The fishing operation relied much {{on the use of}} rumpon (Fish Aggregating Device) as fishing device. The main catches of <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> were mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson). The aim of the research is to determine the productivity of <b>hand</b> <b>line.</b> The research method in used is survey method, on the fishing operation of four units <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> during 35 trips. The results indicated that the productivity average value of three units of boat <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> is 12. 8 kg on the ranges from 8. 2 to 17. 0 kg and productivity of two units of <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> is 12. 0 kg on the ranges from 6. 9 to 18. 8 kg.

40|$|A fishing {{productivity}} {{refers to}} production capability of a fishing gear in time, volume, or {{area of fishing}} ground. The principle of <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> fishing is fishing with a natural bait. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the productivity of <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> and to compare the fishing productivity based on fishing time. The research was a case study on one unit <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> during 30 trips in April ??? June 2014. The calculation of fishing productivity (total fish/minute) of <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> was based on the ratio between fish production and actual fishing time. Non-parametric Cruscal-Wallis were used to compare fishing productivity in different times. The regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between fishing productivity and number of natural bait and fishing time. The main production of <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> was Speckled-Fin Rockod (Epinephelus ongus). The area of the fishing ground was located at 5 ?? 19 ??? 30 ???- 5 ?? 36 ??? 47 ???

The productivity for first fishing ground was 0. 07673 fishes/minute, productivity for second fishing ground was 0. 09134 fishes/minute, and productivity for third fishing ground was 0. 06784 fishes/minute. According to Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, the results indicated no significant difference of fishing ground over fishing time.
