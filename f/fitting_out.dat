5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> offense. First, the Court held that the offense of <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> (as opposed to a complete <b>fitting</b> <b>out)</b> of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E

5|$|During {{the design}} and {{construction}} period, the project name for phase 2 was C Bay. Construction of phase 2 began in April 2007, and ended when {{the keys to the}} building were handed over at an official ceremony in September 2008, {{and the beginning of the}} <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> of the BBC Hoddinott Hall by BBC Wales.|$|E
5|$|HMS Cyclops {{was laid}} down on 10 September 1870 by the Thames Ironworks in London. She was {{launched}} on 18 July 1871 and commissioned in January 1872. The ship was towed to Devenport that same month for what {{proved to be}} a very lengthy <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> period that was not completed until 4 May 1877. Cyclops cost £156,782 to build.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hermione was {{the lead}} ship of a six-ship class of frigates {{designed}} by Edward Hunt and termed the Hermione class. She was launched on 9 September 1782 from Teast's of Bristol, having cost £11,350.14s.4d to build, with a further £4,570.2s.2d spent on dockyard expenses, and £723.16s.9d on <b>fitting</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Lagoon was {{approached}} along a grass-lined entrance drive, {{much like the}} housing estate in {{the picture of the}} site today.

60|$|The Marquess of Suffolk {{requested}} Sir Patrick {{to convey}} to young Douglas a free offer of <b>fitting</b> him <b>out</b> for the encounter, with armour and horse if needful, and even of conferring knighthood on him, {{so that he might}} take his place on equal terms in the lists.|$|R
60|$|They {{could give}} very little {{account of the}} fish which the rivers produced, though they {{sometimes}} catched a few in the smaller river; but, as they had neither fishing-hook or nets, which was the only omission in my <b>fitting</b> them <b>out,</b> they had no opportunity to furnish themselves.|$|R
5|$|On the 9 October 1906 she {{undertook}} her eight hour long {{full power}} contractor trials off Polperro on the Cornwell Coast {{during which she}} averaged 20.05 knots and 21.6 knots on the measured mile. She returned to Portsmouth for gun and torpedo trials before she completed her final <b>fitting</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|Situated {{at the end}} of a U-shaped <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> basin, {{the crane}} was used to {{construct}} some of the largest ships of the 20th century, including the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth 2. The Category A Listed historical structure was refurbished in 2007 as a tourist attraction and shipbuilding museum.|$|E
5|$|The dock {{was used}} for <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> vessels, and the crane would lift engines and boilers into ships. The lifting {{capacity}} of the Titan, {{and the location of}} the yard at the confluence of the River Clyde and River Cart, contributed {{to the success of the}} yard as it could build extremely large ships.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1721 Anstis {{broke off}} from Roberts {{and took the}} Good Fortune with him.

5|$|One of {{two ships}} built to a design by Sir William Rule, Amazon was ordered from Woolwich Dockyard on 27 April 1796 and laid down there that month. She was {{launched}} on 18 May 1799 and quickly put into service, having cost £33,972 to build, including <b>fitting</b> her <b>out.</b> She was commissioned in May 1799 under her first commander, Captain Edward Riou.|$|R

5|$|Two new {{catering}} {{facilities in}} the park opened in May 2012. The Lakeside Bistro near Beacon Pool and Chandlers Café at the Bird Street entrance to the park were built {{as part of the}} works following the £3.9 million grant and Chandlers Group spent £200,000 <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> the new facilities.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Chichagov, {{named for}} Admiral Vasily Chichagov, was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 20 November 1866. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E
5|$|Blücher {{spent most}} of November 1939 <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> and {{finishing}} additional improvements. By {{the end of the}} month, the ship was ready for sea trials; she steamed to Gotenhafen in the Baltic Sea. The trials lasted until mid-December, after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications. In January 1940, she resumed her exercises in the Baltic, but {{by the middle of the}} month, severe ice forced the ship to remain in port. On 5 April, she was deemed to be ready for action, and was therefore assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|E
25|$|Juno {{was ordered}} on 21 October 1778 and {{laid down in}} December that year at the yards of the {{shipbuilder}} Robert Batson & Co, of Limehouse. She was launched on 30 September 1780 and completed by 14 December 1780 that year at Deptford Dockyard. £8,500 1s 5d was paid to the builder, with a further £8,184 18s 1d being spent on <b>fitting</b> her <b>out</b> and having her coppered.|$|R
2500|$|By 25 September 1803, {{the letter}} of marque [...] was at Delagoa Bay {{on the east coast}} of Africa. There she {{captured}} two French whalers: Cyrus, and Ganges. At the time of her capture Cyrus was under the command of Archelaus Hammond. Scorpion then escorted both into St Helena. From there they sailed to Britain where they were sold, with their new owners <b>fitting</b> them <b>out</b> for whaling and arming them.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{efficient}} {{program for}} calculating nuclear magnetic shielding tensors {{at the level}} of density fitted Hartree-Fock theory is presented. London atomic orbitals are used as AO basis functions, while ordinary Gaussians are employed as auxiliary fitting functions for the density fitting. The errors due to density <b>fitting</b> turn <b>out</b> to be very small. Accuracy and efficiency of the program are demonstrated in calculations on several test molecules...|$|R
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} Oryol (Eagle) on 7 November 1899 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. The ship was laid down on 1 June 1900 and {{launched}} on 19 July 1902, {{in the presence}} of the Emperor. While <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> in Kronstadt in May 1904 in preparation for the installation of her armor, some temporary sheathing was removed that allowed water to enter and sank the ship five days later. The water was pumped out and the ship refloated without incident. She was completed in October 1904 at the cost of 13,404,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Potemkin {{began on}} 27 December 1897 {{and it was}} laid down at the Nikolayev Admiralty Shipyard on 10 October 1898. It was named in honour of Prince Grigory Potemkin, a Russian soldier and statesman. The ship was {{launched}} on 9 October 1900 and transferred to Sevastopol for <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> on 4 July 1902. It began sea trials in September 1903 and these continued, off and on, until early 1905 when its gun turrets were completed.|$|E

50|$|Centurion {{was ordered}} on 25 December 1770 and {{laid down in}} May 1771 at the yards of Barnard & Turner, of Harwich. She was {{launched}} on 22 May 1774 and had been completed by 9 September 1775. She cost a total of £20,537.17.9d, including masts and rigging, with a further £4,205.16.10d spent on <b>fitting</b> her <b>out</b> for sea. Centurion was commissioned in July 1775 under her first commander, Captain Richard Braithwaite.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Port Arthur in January 1905, Japanese engineers refloated Poltava on 22 July, and commissioned her as Tango a month later, {{taking her}} {{name from the}} ancient Japanese province of Tango, now a part of Kyoto Prefecture. Classified as a 1st class battleship, she departed for Maizuru Naval Arsenal two days later and arrived on 29 August. Except for participating in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905, she remained there under repair until November 1907. Tango then sailed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to complete <b>fitting</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final <b>fitting</b> <b>out.</b> Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper draught.|$|E
5|$|HMS Valiant {{was laid}} down 1 February 1861 by Westwood, Baillie in Cubitt Town. This company went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and was ultimately bought by Thames Ironworks, which delayed the ship's launching until 14 October 1863. In August 1865, after Valiant had been towed to Portsmouth for <b>fitting</b> <b>out,</b> {{the ship was}} inspected by French officers during a port visit by ironclads of the French Navy. Production of the new muzzle-loaded rifles was slow and ships already in commission had priority so Valiant was not commissioned until September 1868, nearly five years after she was launched.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the island}} fell to Union forces on 7 April, the Union gunboat [...] {{captured}} Red Rover. The Union forces repaired her, <b>fitting</b> her <b>out</b> {{as a summer}} hospital ship for the Army's Western Flotilla. Her role was to augment the limited Union medical facilities, to minimize the hazards to sick and wounded in fighting ships, and to facilitate delivery of medical supplies to and evacuation of personnel from forward areas.|$|R
60|$|The {{foot was}} so painful after tea {{that he could}} hardly bear his slipper on, and he went ashore in his working clothes to the chemist’s, preparatory to <b>fitting</b> himself <b>out</b> for Liston Street. The chemist, leaning over the counter, was {{inclined}} to take a serious view of it, {{and shaking his head}} with much solemnity, prepared a bottle of medicine, a bottle of lotion and a box of ointment.|$|R
6000|$|O, it {{was lovely}} on our stable-ship, {{chock full of}} stallions. She rolled heartily, rolled some of the <b>fittings</b> <b>out</b> of our state-room, and I think a more {{dangerous}} cruise (except that it was summer) {{it would be hard}} to imagine. But we enjoyed it to the masthead, all but Fanny; and even she perhaps a little. When we got in, we had run out of beer, stout, cocoa, soda-water, water, fresh meat, and (almost) of biscuit. But it was a thousandfold pleasanter than a great big Birmingham liner like a new hotel; and we liked the officers, and made friends with the quartermasters, and I (at least) made a friend of a baboon (for we carried a cargo of apes), whose embraces have pretty near cost me a coat. The passengers improved, and were a very good specimen lot, with no drunkard, no gambling that I saw, and less grumbling and backbiting than one would have asked of poor human nature. Apes, stallions, cows, matches, hay, and poor men-folk, all, or almost all, came successfully to land. - Yours ever, ...|$|R
