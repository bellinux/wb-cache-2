5|$|The Continental Army, which <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Quebec in September 1775, {{suffered}} a severe blow in the disastrous attack on Quebec City on New Year's Eve in 1775. Following that loss, Benedict Arnold and {{the remnants of}} the army besieged Quebec until May 1776.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm was disbanded on May 29, 1792. On that day, {{soon after}} {{learning}} that the Russian army <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Poland, the Sejm gave the commander-in-chief position to the king, and voted to end the session.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman troops entered Wallachia in the summer, {{but they}} were {{defeated}} by Michael the Brave at Călugăreni and by the united armies of the three principalities at Giurgiu. In the meantime, however, the Poles <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Moldavia and replaced Ştefan Răzvan by Ieremia Movilă (15951606). In June 1598 Michael the Brave recognized the suzerainty of Emperor Rudolph II, who had promised to grant subsidies to him to finance his mercenaries.|$|E

5|$|The Scythians were a {{group of}} north Iranian nomadic tribes, {{speaking}} an Iranian language (Scythian languages) who <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Media, killed Cyrus in battle, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and {{the shores of the}} Black Sea as they lived between the Danube River, River Don and the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|The princes {{arrived in}} Constantinople with little food and {{expected}} provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his {{experiences with the}} People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, Robert Guiscard, and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.|$|E
5|$|He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant-general on 25 April 1808, and in June was given command of 9,000 men set to invade revolutionary Spanish America. But in 1807, Napoleon <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Portugal, via Spain, intent on preventing its continued trade with Britain. He replaced the Spanish royal family with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, in May 1808. In Madrid, the people attempted a rebellion against the French occupation which spread across Spain resulting in mass executions in reprisal, leading both the Portuguese and Spanish juntas (local administrations) to call on British support.|$|E

5|$|In 1756, after over-running Saxony, Frederick campaigned in Bohemia; he {{defeated}} the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the Battle of Prague. Learning that French forces <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> his ally's territory of Hanover, Frederick moved west. On 5 November 1757, an infantry regiment of about 1,000 men and 1,500 of his cavalry destroyed the combined French and Austrian force of 30,000 at the Battle of Rossbach in a 90-minute battle. In his absence, though, the Austrians {{had managed to}} retake Silesia: the Empresses' brother-in-law, Prince Charles, took the city of Schweidnitz and had moved on Breslau in lower Silesia.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, Japan, which <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> and {{occupied}} French Indochina in 1941 during World War II, {{decided to take}} direct control and overthrew the French colonial regime.

One of his cellmates was Dương Văn Minh, then a junior officer in the French military forces with whom he would work {{over the next two}} decades. Thơ was released first and lobbied to have Minh released as well and the pair remained close friends.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{had mixed}} success in {{mainland}} Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched {{the first of}} two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province.|$|E

5|$|The Castello de Zanna {{is a small}} fortress, {{situated}} in the frazione of Majon. It consists of low white outer walls and two white corner towers, with a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The construction of the castle began in 1694, but on August 19, 1696 the works were interrupted; the building remained unfinished in 1809 when it was burned by French revolutionary troops who <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Ampezzo. Since then the castle has undergone restoration.|$|E
5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} to wage a successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
5|$|By the 2nd century AD {{the territories}} of Persia were {{controlled}} by the Arsacid dynasty and known as the Parthian Empire. Due {{in large part to}} their employment of powerful heavy cavalry and mobile horse archers, Parthia was the most formidable enemy of the Roman Empire in the east. As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Parthia, but he was killed and his army was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. In the years following Carrhae, the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians from 114–117 AD and briefly captured their capital Ctesiphon, putting the puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. However, rebellions in Babylonia and the Jewish revolts in Judea made it difficult to maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Coloman sent envoys to the Council of Guastalla, {{which had}} been convoked by Pope Paschal II. In October 1106 the envoys solemnly {{informed}} the pope of their king's renunciation of his royal prerogative to appoint the prelates of his realms. According to historians Ferenc Makk and Márta Font, without this declaration the Holy See would not have acknowledged Coloman's conquest of Dalmatia. During the civil war between BoleslawIII and his brother Zbigniew, Coloman intervened on the former's behalf and helped him overcome the latter's army in Mazovia in 1107. Coloman also sent Hungarian reinforcements to the Byzantine Emperor AlexiosI Komnenos against Bohemond I of Antioch, who <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Byzantine territories in October 1107. After suffering a sound defeat, Bohemond withdrew his troops and acknowledged the emperor's suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch in the Treaty of Devol in 1108.|$|E
5|$|Commodus {{continues}} to intimidate Oswald and murders him, causing {{a breakdown in}} negotiations. Meanwhile, Marius realizes that the band of barbarians he encountered years ago <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation {{as a means of}} eliminating a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with taking on the mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} centuries AD, Palmyra {{was a city}} {{subordinate}} to Rome {{and part of the}} province of Syria Phoenice. In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> the empire's eastern regions; Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa. Odaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian's son), was declared king of Palmyra. Launching successful campaigns against Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263. Odaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler. In addition to the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly corrector totius orientis (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine. In 267, when Zenobia was in her late twenties or early thirties, Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.|$|E

5|$|Henry was {{probably}} born in England in 1068, {{in either the}} summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly {{in the town of}} Selby in Yorkshire. His father was William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy, who <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> England in 1066 to become the King of England, establishing lands stretching into Wales. The invasion had created an Anglo-Norman elite, many with estates spread across both sides of the English Channel. These Anglo-Norman barons typically had close links to the kingdom of France, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king. Henry's mother, Matilda of Flanders, was the granddaughter of Robert II of France, and she probably named Henry after her uncle, King Henry I of France.|$|E
5|$|Isolationist Paraguay {{was more}} {{difficult}} to win over. Brazil made the initial overtures, becoming the first country to formally recognise Paraguayan independence in 1844. This soon led {{to the establishment of}} excellent diplomatic relations. The Brazilian ambassador in Paraguay, Pimenta Bueno, became a private councilor to President Carlos Antonio López. A defensive alliance was signed on 25 December 1850 between Brazil and Paraguay, in which López agreed to supply the Empire with horses for its army. But Paraguay refused to contribute troops to fight Rosas, believing that Justo José Urquiza (who <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Uruguay in 1839 and in 1845), the ruler of the Argentine Entre Rios province, secretly wished to annex Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Krasos was {{a battle}} in the Arab–Byzantine Wars {{that took place in}} August 804, between the Byzantines under Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802–811) and an Abbasid army under Ibrahim ibn Jibril. Nikephoros' {{accession}} in 802 resulted in a resumption of warfare between Byzantium and the Abbasid Caliphate. In late summer 804, the Abbasids <b>had</b> <b>invaded</b> Byzantine Asia Minor for one of their customary raids, and Nikephoros set out to meet them. He was surprised, however, at Krasos and heavily defeated, barely escaping with his own life. A truce and prisoner exchange were afterwards arranged. Despite his defeat, and a massive Abbasid invasion the next year, Nikephoros persevered until troubles in the eastern provinces of the Caliphate forced the Abbasids to conclude a peace.|$|E
