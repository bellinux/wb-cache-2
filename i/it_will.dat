5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{inclination}} of its orbit, Eris only passes through a few constellations of the traditional Zodiac; it {{is now in the}} constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 <b>it</b> <b>will</b> enter Pisces and stay there until 2065, when <b>it</b> <b>will</b> enter Aries. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.|$|E

5|$|I'll be {{offering}} my vision when my campaign begins. And <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be comprehensive and sweeping. And I hope that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be compelling enough to draw people toward it. I feel that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be. But <b>it</b> <b>will</b> emerge from my {{dialogue with the}} American people. I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years.

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become {{sufficiently}} hot to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> never become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be found on the asymptotic giant branch. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E

5|$|Just {{because an}} SSD {{supports}} the TRIM command {{does not necessarily}} mean <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be able to perform at top speed immediately after a TRIM command. The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance.|$|E
5|$|Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders {{are known}} to exhibit {{elaborate}} courtship displays.

5|$|Sirius appears bright {{because of}} its {{intrinsic}} luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so <b>it</b> <b>will</b> slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> become fainter, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.|$|E
