2500|$|First, Hutton's {{long and}} turgid Theory of the Earth (1795) was popularized {{by his friend}} John Playfair (1802). Not only did Playfair make up for Hutton's {{difficult}} prose, but he also modernized Hutton's theory by soft-pedaling both his [...] "denial of biblical history" [...] and his repeated appeals to final causes. Subsequently, Charles Lyell, who needed an empiricist hero for his own account of the warfare between science and religious bigotry, bolstered Hutton's image as a <b>fieldworker</b> who had no conceptual bias. Finally the legend was consolidated {{in the writings of}} later geologists, who rarely bothered to read Hutton in the original.|$|E

The participants, who eventually included more than fifty men, made audio recordings of their community's cultural traditions and folklore. The researchers and the men recorded the material in Bislama. All recordings and other records from the Vanuatu <b>Fieldworker</b> Programme were archived at the Vanuatu Cultural Centre in Port Vila.|$|E

40|$|This {{narrative}} review {{focuses on}} ethics related to nutrition-specific community-based research, {{within the framework}} of science for society, and focusing on the rights and well-being of <b>fieldworkers</b> and research participants. In addition to generally accepted conditions of scientific validity, such as adequate sample size, unbiased measurement outcome and suitable study population, research needs to be appropriate and feasible within the local context. Communities' suspicions about research can be overcome through community participation and clear dialogue. Recruitment of <b>fieldworkers</b> and research participants should be transparent and guided by project-specific selection criteria. <b>Fieldworkers</b> need to be adequately trained, their daily schedules and remuneration must be realistic, and their inputs to the study must be recognized. <b>Fieldworkers</b> may be negatively affected emotionally, financially and physically. Benefits to research participants may include physical and psychological benefits, minimal economic benefit, and health education; while risks may be of a physical, psychological, social, or economic nature. Targeting individuals in high-risk groups may result in social stigmatization. The time burden to the research participant can be minimized by careful attention to study procedures and questionnaire design. Potential benefits to the community, <b>fieldworkers</b> and research participants and anticipated knowledge to be gained should outweigh and justify the potential risks. Researchers should have an exit strategy for study participants. For effective dissemination of results to individual research participants, the host community and nutrition community, the language, format and level of presentation need to be appropriate for the target audience.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the power}} {{industry}} various companies have a crucial responsibility of sustaining infrastructure for electricity service. Maintenance and repair of electrical devices {{out in the}} field is potentially dangerous and sometimes complicated in nature. Effective and safe fieldwork requires clear and accurate communication between <b>fieldworkers</b> repairing and maintaining devices outdoors and operators monitoring and controlling the power grid in a control room. Operators and <b>fieldworkers</b> have to synchronize their activities for maintaining steady electricity service. Current Information and Communication Technology (ICT) support for fieldwork consist of mobile phones, mobile software applications and workforce management systems, but much of the necessary communication is still conducted orally over the phone. We propose ambient communication support that improves communication between operators and <b>fieldworkers</b> by digitalizing and automating trivial messaging. The concept is based on mobile navigation and work order management application, image-processing techniques for wearable sensor based activity recognition methods. In theory we can eliminate three of eight logical steps in a typical work scenario. We present work-in-progress in form of preliminary prototypes and discuss the technological advances needed to make the concept real...|$|R
