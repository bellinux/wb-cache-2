5|$|<b>EU</b> <b>legislation</b> {{makes no}} {{provision}} for the preservation and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under <b>EU</b> <b>legislation</b> because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current <b>EU</b> <b>legislation</b> with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E

5|$|European Union law (EU law) has {{prescribed}} {{the structure}} of and relationships between all European cattle herd books since 1977. However, {{it was not until}} 2007 that the French Limousin Herd Book began a process of restructuring to comply with relevant EU regulations, directives and decisions. EU law affecting stud cattle breeding in Europe derives principally from an EU objective to achieve free movement of goods between member countries, and to address farmer and consumer protectionist and interventionist actions that oppose the principles of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses an obstacle to free trade in European countries, which <b>EU</b> <b>legislation,</b> among other things, attempts to address.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of ocular toxicity, (i. e., eye irritation and serious eye damage) {{is important to}} ensure the safety of products and their components used in our daily life. In several <b>EU</b> <b>legislations</b> related to chemicals and products, the generation of information on eye irritation and serious eye damage represents a standard requirement. The traditional eye irritation test, also known as the Draize eye test. is performed on albino rabbits. Ethical and scientific considerations as well as legal requirements in <b>EU</b> <b>legislations</b> have triggered the development and validation of alternative methods to the Draize test. Since no in vitro test taken individually can nowadays fully replace the Draize eye test, testing schemes combining strengths of particular in vitro assays were proposed The conceptual framework of testing strategies based on a Bottom-Up or Top-Down approach, are described in this chapter. In addition, a summary of the most promising in vitro test methods as well as their validation and regulatory acceptance status is given. Finally some strategic proposals on the way forward in this area are made. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|R
