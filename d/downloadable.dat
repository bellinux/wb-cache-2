5|$|The game also {{supports}} <b>downloadable</b> tracks for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions; several free and for-cost <b>downloadable</b> songs and song packs {{are available on}} both the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store. In July 2008, Activision {{announced that it would}} release <b>downloadable</b> content for the Wii {{in the first quarter of}} 2008, but eventually was unable to do so because of limitations with the Wii's internal memory storage, an issue that was overcome in the sequel, Guitar Hero World Tour. When rock band Metallica released their album Death Magnetic on September 12, 2008, it was also made available as a <b>downloadable</b> song pack for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, Guitar Hero World Tour and the 2009 spin-off Guitar Hero Metallica. In addition, the compact disc soundtrack for the game offers a code used to redeem three exclusive playable tracks on the Xbox Live Marketplace.|$|E

5|$|Initially, it {{was stated}} that Unleashed {{was to be}} {{intended}} solely as a single-player experience, and would not offer any multiplayer or online modes. This was cast into doubt when references to online modes were alluded to around E3 2008, but later interviews re-iterated that Unleashed would have no online modes at all. However, <b>downloadable</b> content, including additional levels, would remain a possibility after the game's release. A demo version was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on December 8, 2008 and on the US and EU PlayStation Stores on December 18 and 24, 2008, respectively. The demo does not contain any of the Werehog stages. On March 12, 2009 Sega released Sonic Unleasheds first <b>downloadable</b> content for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, consisting of four Chun-nan daytime stages and two night stages in addition to two new missions. Since then, more <b>downloadable</b> levels have been added: Spagonia, Holoska, Mazuri, Apotos, Shamar, Empire city and Adabat.|$|E
5|$|Michael Myers and Laurie Strode both {{appeared}} as <b>downloadable</b> {{characters in the}} game Dead by Daylight.|$|E
5|$|Mortal Kombat was {{available}} for pre-order in three different editions: Standard, Kollector's Edition (includes {{a copy of the}} game, art book, Sub-Zero and Scorpion figurine bookends and a <b>downloadable</b> content (DLC) skin, dubbed a Mortal Kombat Klassic costume), and the Tournament Edition (includes a fight stick controller instead of the bookends and art book). A European version of the Kollector's Edition was also released, which includes the game, art book, a Scorpion & Sub-Zero figurine, a Steelbook case and <b>downloadable</b> skins.|$|E
5|$|New mixes will {{be added}} {{regularly}} to DJ Hero through <b>downloadable</b> content that can be purchased on the console's respective online stores; content was made available {{on the day of}} the game's release. Unlike Guitar Hero games' <b>downloadable</b> content, which costs approximately US$2 per track, each mix costs approximately $3 to download because of the additional effort needed to create the mixes. Furthermore, mixes are provided only as bundles for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users; the Wii's storefront prevents the selling of bundled packages; instead, each track is offered individually. Critics viewed the lack of individual song selection on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms as a way of limiting consumers' choice, as previous <b>downloadable</b> songs for games such as Guitar Hero allow players on these systems to select individual tracks to purchase from a bundle. The long time between the second <b>downloadable</b> pack (in November 2009) and the third pack (in March 2010) was also believed to be the result of a last-ditch effort by Activision to support the game, and that the few packs released did not meet expectations for the game.|$|E
5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online <b>downloadable</b> content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s <b>downloadable</b> content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized <b>downloadable</b> content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 2015, Geno {{became a}} <b>downloadable</b> Mii Fighter costume in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2011, Bethesda {{announced}} Fallout: New Vegas – Ultimate Edition, {{which includes}} the game {{and all of its}} <b>downloadable</b> content. It was released worldwide throughout February 2012.|$|E

5|$|PlayStation Plus, a subscription-based {{service on}} the PlayStation Network, {{compliments}} the standard PSN services. It enables an auto-download feature which allows the console to automatically download game patches and system software updates. Subscribers also gain early or exclusive access to some betas, game demos, premium <b>downloadable</b> content (such as full game trials of retail games like Infamous and LittleBigPlanet) and other PlayStation Store items, {{as well as a}} free subscription to Qore. Other <b>downloadable</b> items include PlayStation Store discounts and free PlayStation Network games, PS one Classics, PlayStation Minis, themes and avatars.|$|E
5|$|Rockstar, the game's developer, had {{a long-standing}} {{interest}} {{in creating a}} zombie game. They found the Red Dead Redemption universe and its American countryside to fit the cinematic heritage of the horror film genre. Rockstar wanted their additional content to function outside rather than within the base game's story but draw on its characters and atmosphere. The company released Undead Nightmare as <b>downloadable</b> content for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on October 26, 2010, and as a standalone retail disc bundle with other <b>downloadable</b> content packs in late November.|$|E
5|$|Saints Row IV was {{released}} in several summative editions. The Game of the Century edition included 20 <b>downloadable</b> content sets and {{was released}} May 9, 2014. The National Treasure Edition included 29 <b>downloadable</b> content sets and was released on July 8, 2014. High Voltage Software ported the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One {{with all of its}} <b>downloadable</b> content as Saints Row IV: Re-Elected. It was announced in late August 2014 alongside , a standalone Saints Row IV expansion developed by Volition in conjunction with High Voltage. Both were released in North America on January 20, 2015, and worldwide three days later, both separately and bundled together. The release included new features such as voice commands. A Linux port was presented in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Full Package, {{a version}} {{containing}} {{all of the}} game's <b>downloadable</b> content on disc alongside the main game, was released in November. Some of the smaller content items include costume, vehicle, and ability unlocks. THQ planned a standalone expansion of the game called Enter the Dominatrix. It was originally announced as an April Fool's joke, but was confirmed and later spun into Saints Row IVs <b>downloadable</b> content.|$|E
5|$|The October 17 {{press release}} set November 21, 2006 as the North American {{distribution}} {{date for the}} Xbox 360 and PC versions of Knights of the Nine. The European release for the Xbox 360 and PC was set two days later, on November 23. The European release was co-published by Bethesda and Ubisoft. On November 9, 2006, Bethesda clarified earlier statements regarding PC releases, declaring that, although the boxed retail PC edition of Knights of the Nine was set for release on November 21, the PC release <b>downloadable</b> from the company website wouldn't be available until December 4. This caused some consumer complaints, for although the Xbox 360 release was available on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points (the equivalent of US$10.00, or GB£6.80), for the time being, PC owners had only the US$19.99 boxed retail edition of the game. The increased price of the PC's boxed retail release (The Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of Nine Oblivion <b>Downloadable</b> Content Collection) resulted from its inclusion of Oblivions other previously released <b>downloadable</b> content. Such content {{was not included in}} either the <b>downloadable</b> PC release, the Xbox Marketplace download, or the PlayStation 3 edition of Oblivion. The <b>downloadable</b> release was ultimately issued on December 6 at the price of US$9.99. According to IGN Entertainment's GamerMetrics, a service based on compiled visitor activity information on IGN's website, the pack was the fourth most anticipated release of its release week, following , Superman Returns and College Hoops 2K7.|$|E
5|$|The song is {{featured}} as <b>downloadable</b> content {{on the dance}} rhythm game, Just Dance 2014.|$|E
5|$|The two {{additional}} episodes, Turnabout Reclaimed and Quiz Turnabout Deduction, were made available as <b>downloadable</b> content {{shortly after the}} game's Japanese release. Turnabout Reclaimed was released in the West on November 21, 2013, but Quiz Turnabout Deduction remained exclusive to Japan due to its dependency on in-depth knowledge of Japanese culture. <b>Downloadable</b> costumes for Phoenix, Athena and Apollo were made available for download upon the game's release. These costumes were available for free until August 15, 2013 in Japan, and until November 7, 2013 for the English versions, after which they were available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{completion}} of Just Cause 2, Avalanche teased a new project. A new <b>downloadable</b> title, called Renegade Ops, was announced on 30 March 2011. The team was approached by Sega {{to develop a new}} <b>downloadable</b> intellectual property using the Avalanche Engine. Compared to their past titles, the game's production and development periods were much shorter. Renegade Ops was released on 14 October 2011.|$|E
5|$|Valley of the Yetis is a <b>downloadable</b> {{additional}} {{chapter of}} content {{which takes place}} directly after Escape from Durgesh Prison.|$|E
5|$|A Game of the Year Edition {{containing}} all <b>downloadable</b> {{content was}} released for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 11 October 2011 in North America and on 14 October 2011 internationally. Additionally, Microsoft added {{the game to}} its backwards compatibility list for Xbox One platforms in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|A pinball minigame {{based upon}} Sonic the Hedgehog 2s Casino Night level was {{released}} as <b>downloadable</b> content via Steam on December 26, 2011. The minigame {{was included in}} the collector's edition and offered as a pre-order incentive for the console version.|$|E
5|$|According to interviews, the {{characters}} {{were chosen for}} their popularity, and for parallels between them from both universes. Boon has said that some of {{the characters}}' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been toned down to make them balanced within Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic. Boon revealed that two new characters were developed as <b>downloadable</b> content, Quan Chi from Mortal Kombat and Harley Quinn from DC comics but had been discarded. He had also hinted earlier at the prospect of Kung Lao and Doomsday being <b>downloadable</b> characters.|$|E
5|$|After Ensemble's closing, Robot Entertainment {{announced}} that it was developing <b>downloadable</b> content (DLC) for Halo Wars. Pottinger described support as ongoing rather than a one-time effort and compared it to Bungie's post-launch additions to Halo 3. He stated that Robot would also work on balance issues, bug fixes, and other patches.|$|E
5|$|Alien: Isolation was {{released}} on 7 October 2014, featuring two pre-order <b>downloadable</b> content missions that allow players to play two scenes from the original film. The first mission, entitled Crew Expendable, features the original crew of the Nostromo and involves the player controlling Ripley, Dallas or Parker attempting to flush the alien creature from the air vents and into the ship's airlock. The second mission, Last Survivor, is set during the film's finale and involves the player controlling Ripley {{as she tries to}} activate the Nostromos self-destruct sequence and reach the escape shuttle. Unlike the first mission, the second mission is only available for players who pre-ordered the game at certain retailers. Upon release, five additional <b>downloadable</b> content packs for the game were periodically released between October 2014 and March 2015. These packs expand the game's Survivor Mode with new characters, challenges, maps, and other features. A collection featuring the game and all the <b>downloadable</b> content packs {{was released}} for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in late 2015.|$|E
5|$|An {{enhanced}} version, subtitled Definitive Edition, {{was released}} on October 10, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It includes all the 24 previously released <b>downloadable</b> contents (DLCs) and features improved graphical resolution and gameplay, setting and audiovisual quality changes based on community feedback.|$|E
5|$|Being {{based on}} the same engine as the seventh {{generation}} versions of Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero Arcade features a set of 50 songs chosen from the main, bonus and <b>downloadable</b> content lists.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Undead Nightmare as a {{model for}} <b>downloadable</b> content {{especially}} in its balance of content and price. Neil Davey (The Guardian) said that it was the best purchase of 2010 at its price range, but staff of the Official Xbox Magazine found the price slightly too high. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar thought that the game's concept sounded like a ploy to make easy money without much work, but admitted how wrong and surprised he was at the game's depth. At the time of its 2010 release, the Official Xbox Magazine counted Undead Nightmare among the best <b>downloadable</b> content in existence. The standalone retail disc had sold two million units as of August 2011. No sales figures were released regarding the download pack itself.|$|E
5|$|Escape from Durgesh Prison is an {{additional}} chapter of the story available as <b>downloadable</b> content. It expands upon Ajay's escape from the Durgesh prison {{and return to the}} Golden Path, and on Yuma's planned insurrection against Pagan Min.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>downloadable</b> content (DLC) packs {{have been}} released: the T-Bone Content Bundle, Human Conditions, No Compromise, Root Access Bundle, and Psychedelic Pack. As per an {{exclusivity}} agreement with Sony Interactive Entertainment, all DLC for Watch Dogs 2 were timed exclusives for PlayStation 4.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{supports}} <b>downloadable</b> content; {{the first}} songs were made available {{shortly after the}} game's release. In addition, 152 of the 158 available <b>downloadable</b> songs for Guitar Hero World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero; the existing content is automatically upgraded to include all features new to these games and was immediately available to players upon release of Guitar Hero 5. Downloaded songs {{can be used in}} all game modes, provided all players have the song, including in the game's Career mode when players are given the option to select any song to play. The entire Guitar Hero 5 DLC library is also available in Band Hero, and vice versa, so both games embrace the same DLC library.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5s track list {{contains}} 85 {{songs by}} 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with {{works in the}} game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional <b>downloadable</b> content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing <b>downloadable</b> tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, , and spin-off game Band Hero.|$|E
