25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as damp proofing considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity,</b> load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E
500|$|After the Communion {{service is}} interrupted, the anthem Come, Holy Ghost is recited, {{as a prelude}} to the act of anointing. After this anthem, the Archbishop recites a prayer in {{preparation}} for the anointing. After this prayer, the hymn Zadok the Priest is sung by the choir; meanwhile, the crimson robe is removed, and the sovereign proceeds to the Coronation Chair for the anointing, which has been set in a prominent position, wearing the anointing gown. In 1953, the chair stood atop a dais of several steps. This mediaeval chair <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> in the base into which the Stone of Scone is fitted for the ceremony. Also known as the [...] "Stone of Destiny", it was used for ancient Scottish coronations until brought to England by EdwardI. It has been used for every coronation at Westminster Abbey since. Until 1996, the stone was kept with the chair in Westminster Abbey, but it was moved that year to Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, where it is displayed on the proviso that it be returned to England for use at future coronations.|$|E
2500|$|The medium {{material}} is usually {{soda lime glass}} or a ceramic. It is usually spherical in form, but angular shapes are also used. For plating, medium usage is usually 1 part medium for every workpiece, but for galvanization the ratio is 2:1. However, various sized media are used in each batch with a typical batch consisting of 50% [...] sized beads, 25% [...] sized beads, and 25% [...] sized beads. The smaller media are omitted when the workpiece <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> that the medium can get caught in, such as a fastener's recessed head. Note that the medium is reused many times.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} stone often <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> {{into which}} is placed {{a time capsule}} containing newspapers {{of the day or}} week of the ceremony plus other artifacts that are typical of the period of the construction: coins of the year may also be immured in the cavity or time capsule.|$|E
50|$|This nozzle type is {{fitted with}} a {{rotatable}} bolt assembly which <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> equal in size to the melt channel. In its open position, the bolt cavity is directly aligned with the melt stream. When the actuator rotates the bolt assembly, the cavity becomes misaligned and thus shuts of the melt flow.|$|E
50|$|A morula is {{distinct}} from a blastocyst in that a morula (3-4 days post fertilization) is a 16-cell mass in a spherical shape whereas a blastocyst (4-5 days post fertilization) <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> inside the zona pellucida along with an inner cell mass. A morula, if untouched and allowed to remain implanted, will eventually develop into a blastocyst.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally all Danish sockets were {{equipped}} with a switch to prevent touching live pins when connecting/disconnecting the plug. Today, sockets without switch are allowed, but then it is a requirement that the sockets <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> to prevent touching the live pins. The shape of the plugs generally {{makes it difficult to}} touch the pins when connecting/disconnecting.|$|R
50|$|The {{figure was}} found in the {{necropolis}} of Puig des Molins on the island of Ibiza in the Mediterranean. It was made using a mold and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> in the back, perhaps used for hanging it up. Probably a representation of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, it is richly ornamented in terms of clothing and jewelry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process can}} be used for {{near-net-shape}} casting, including in protocols where the final casting <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> {{in the shape of the}} casting pattern - in that case, the metal is poured into the cavity, which has been arranged to lie in the middle of a quantity of [...] "filler" [...] corresponding to the reaction product, and wicks itself to fill the pores in the filler.|$|E
50|$|In Swahili {{the name}} Mawe Mbili means 2 stones, {{referring}} to two lava ash monoliths, about 2 m in height, which rise {{from a small}} grassland clearing in the lava badlands. The Elmenteita Badlands are a Holocene Epoch volcanic lava flow.

50|$|The series ended {{without a}} single fight in the final episode, but rather Watta's {{elementary}} school graduation ceremony. There were episodes that focus not on the war, but on Watta's school life, such as him <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> filled during <b>a</b> physical examination, and him going {{on a field trip}} with his class. These scenes hold as much excitement as his battles in Trider G7.|$|R

50|$|The daxophone {{consists}} of a wooden piece called a tongue, approximately 330 mm in length, 30 mm in width, and 5 mm in height, and fixed to a wooden block (often attached to a tripod, but also clamped to a table top), which holds one or more contact microphones. This wooden block <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> which is carved with a chisel for the insertion of two contact microphones, and a snakewood soundboard laid on top with the contact microphones glued to it. A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on {{the shape of the}} tongue and the type of wood. The tongue shape is made with a bandsaw or jigsaw. Denser woods such as ebony and oak produce a mellower sound than light woods. These sounds are notable for their comical, often human sounds.|$|E

His best friend Paul, deserts him for Phillip Parker and Albert Moyo, and says Alexander therefore is his third best friend. At lunch, Phillip has two cupcakes for dessert, Albert has a Hershey's bar, and Paul has a jelly roll with coconut sprinkles. But since Alexander's mother had forgot to put in dessert, there is no dessert in his lunch bag. The dentist tells him he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity</b> (and thus Alexander {{is the only one who}} had one) and he has to come back next week so it can be fixed; the elevator door closes on his foot; Anthony pushes him into a mud puddle; Nick says he is a crybaby; he punches Nick in response, and their mother punishes him for being muddy and fighting Nick.|$|E

50|$|P. psammophila {{constructs}} {{and lives}} in a rigid, chitinous tube about 10 cm long, incorporating sand grains and detritus. The extended worm is up to 19 centimetres long but it can contract down to about one fifth of this length. The body is pinkish and {{is divided into two}} sections. The anterior part, the mesosome, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>cavity,</b> the mesocoel, that extends into the tentacles and keeps them rigid by hydrostatic pressure. The mesosome bears the lophophore, a specialist feeding structure which consists of a ring of up to 190 translucent tentacles arranged in a horseshoe-shape encircling the crescent-shaped mouth. The posterior and larger body section is the metasome and contains the metacoel. It is swollen at the base into an ampulla which may provide grip inside the tube. The gut is U-shaped and extends from the mouth to the ampulla before doubling back to the anus which is situated just below the mouth. The gonads are located in the metacoel. There are two blood vessels running along the ventral and dorsal sides of the body with capillaries in the tentacles. These are made easily visible by the haemoglobin in the red blood cells. There is a single nerve fibre {{on the left side of}} the body.|$|E
