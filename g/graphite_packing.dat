5000|$|Mechanical seals are {{generally}} classified into two main categories: [...] "Pusher" [...] or [...] "Non-Pusher". These distinctions refer {{to whether or}} not the secondary seal to the shaft/sleeve is dynamic or stationary. Pusher seals will employ a dynamic secondary seal (typically an o-ring) which moves axially with the primary seal face. Non-pusher seals will employ a static secondary seal (either an O-ring, high temperature <b>graphite</b> <b>packing,</b> elastomeric bellows or metal bellows). In this case, the face tracking is independent of the secondary seal which is always static against the shaft/sleeve.|$|E
50|$|Krupp {{continued}} {{theoretical research}} on {{a replacement for}} the Paris Gun during the Weimar Republic-era, {{but it was the}} Nazi government that finally authorized funding for experiments to solve some of its worst problems. The extremely high velocities used by the Paris Gun to attain the stratospheric heights necessary for extreme range caused enormous wear of the barrel, {{so much so that the}} shells had to be made in gradually increasing diameter to suit the rate of wear. Even then barrel life was merely 50 rounds. It is believed that the one Paris Gun destroyed by a premature detonation in the bore was caused by loading one of the serially-numbered shells out of order. Thus Krupp decided to use only eight grooves in the barrel and to machine matching ribs or splines on the shells to eliminate the need for a massive copper driving band to start the shell spinning without shearing off, which had been one of the prime causes of the excessive barrel wear in the earlier weapon. Gas sealing would be handled by a copper band, mounted in the place normally occupied by the driving band, with an asbestos and <b>graphite</b> <b>packing</b> to form the initial seal. Several test barrels, known as the 10.5 cm K 12 M, and shells were made in 1935 and were compared to a conventionally rifled barrel (the 10.5 cm K 12 MKu). The tests proved that Krupp's concept was correct.|$|E

3000|$|Graphene is a monoatomic {{layer of}} <b>graphite</b> densely <b>packed</b> into a {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) honeycomb lattice, [...] sp^ 2 bonded, with two nonequivalent triangular sublattices. Graphene sheet was first fabricated by Novoselov et al. [1, 2, 3, 4]. Charge carriers, i.e., electrons and holes {{close to the}} Dirac points [...] K [...] and [...] K^', in graphene are described by the massless Dirac equation where Fermi velocity ([...] v_F≈ 10 ^ 6 m/s) {{plays the role of}} speed of light [2, 5]. The Fermi velocity in graphene is almost 100 times the velocity in normal metal and thus the coulomb interaction is surely negligible comparing to kinetic energy in graphene [6, 7]. Due to the massless Dirac equation for charge carriers in graphene, tunneling through a barrier in graphene is described by Klein tunneling mechanism [8, 9, 10, 11]. Graphene exhibits numerous novel electronic and transport properties, for example, half-integer and unconventional quantum hall effect [4], ultrahigh carrier mobility [3], optical effect [12, 13], finite minimal electrical conductivity [4, 14, 15], special Andreev reflection [16] and so on.|$|R

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatography column (HPLC) Hypercarb® packed with porous graphite {{has proven to}} discriminate polyolefin molecules {{due to differences in}} their adsorption and desorption behaviour. While linear polyethylene (PE) and syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP) are adsorbed on the <b>graphite</b> <b>packing,</b> isotactic polypropylene (iPP) is not adsorbed. The column operates at 160 °C with 1 -decanol as sample solvent and mobile phase. We have now tested this HPLC system for separations of random propene/ 1 -alkene and ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymers: While copolymers of propene with 1 -butene, 1 -hexene and 1 -octene copolymers eluted in size exclusion mode without adsorption, propene/ 1 -octadecene and ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymers are strongly retained and eluted only after application of a linear gradient starting from 1 -decanol and ending with pure 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene. The retention of propene/ 1 -alkene (> 11 carbons in the side chain) copolymers increases with the concentration of comonomer, making this HPLC system suitable to separate these copolymers according to their chemical composition. In contrast, the retention of ethylene/ 1 -hexene samples decreases with increasing 1 -hexene content. Branching in this case shortens the length of continuous methylene sequences of the polymer backbone, which are expected to adsorb in a planar conformation to the graphite layers. This is the first report on the separation of short chain branched polyolefins by high-temperature adsorption liquid chromatography. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Site-specific glycoprofiling of N-linked glycopeptides using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization {{time-of-flight}} {{mass spectrometry}} (MALDI-TOF MS) is an emerging technique, but its quantitative accuracy lacks documentation. Thus, a systematic study of widely different glycopeptides {{was performed to}} determine {{the relationship between the}} relative abundances of the individual glycoforms and the MALDI-TOF MS signal strength. Glycopeptides derived from glycoproteins containing neutral glycans (ribonuclease B, IgG, and ovalbumin) were initially profiled and yielded excellent and reproducible quantitation (correlation coefficient r = 0. 9958, n = 5) when evaluated against a normal phase HPLC 2 -AB glycan profile. Similarly, precise quantitation was observed for various forms of N-glycans (free, permethylated, and fluorescence-labeled) using MS. In addition, three different sialoglycopeptides from fetuin were site-specifically profiled, and good correlation between peak intensities and relative abundances was found with only a minor loss of sialic acids (r = 0. 9664, n = 5). For glycopeptide purification, a range of hydrophilic and <b>graphite</b> materials <b>packed</b> in microcolumn format proved capable of performing desalting without loss of quantitative information, but highlighted the column capacity as a critical parameter. In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS signal strength of glycopeptides has been found to accurately reflect the relative quantities of glycoforms, providing that certain technical issues are considered, i. e., nonbiased sample handling, matrix choice, and instrumental settings. This enables rapid and sensitive site-specific glycoprofiling of N-glycan populations to promote biomarker discovery and elucidation of glycan structure/function relationships. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Friction stir {{processing}} {{was applied}} for fabricating an aluminum alloy based hybrid nano composite reinforced with nano sized Al 2 O 3 and micro sized graphite particles. A mixture of Al 2 O 3 and <b>graphite</b> particles was <b>packed</b> into a groove with 1 mm width and 4. 5 mm depth, which had been cut in 5083 aluminum plate of 10 mm thick. Packed groove was subjected to friction stir processing in order to implement powder mixture into the aluminum alloy matrix. Microstructural properties were investigated by means of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that reinforcement particle mixture was distributed uniformly in nugget zone. Wear resistance of composite was measured by dry sliding wear test. As a result, hybrid composite revealed significant reduction in wear rate in comparison with Al/AL 2 O 3 composite produced by friction stir processing.

40|$|The {{pressure}} {{infiltration of}} Al and Al– 12 wt. % Si–X alloys into preforms of <b>packed</b> <b>graphite</b> particles has been investigated. Compacts were prepared from particles of average diameter of 15, 27, 64, and 124 lm. While infiltration with pure Al at 750 °C was poor due to both gasification of graphite and reaction between C and Al, the lower infiltration temperature {{used for the}} Al–Si eutectic alloy improved infiltration performance. Results for the threshold pressure and infiltration kinetics {{are discussed in the}} light of previously published results. Ti (up to 1. 5 wt. %) and Cu (up to 1. 0 wt. %) additions were found to have no effect on pressure infiltration. However, Mg additions (up to 4 wt. %) significantly decreased the threshold pressure, {{as a consequence of the}} decrease in surface tension of Al promoted by this element. Coating the graphite particles with a chemical compound that dissolves the oxide layer reduces the threshold pressure, although this has limited technological applicability due to the increase in porosity. The compact permeability derived from infiltration of the alloys is compared with the intrinsic permeability obtained through infiltration of a wetting organic fluid.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{results for the}} {{flexural}} strength and the thermal properties of interpenetrated graphite preforms infiltrated with Al- 12 wt%Si are discussed and compared to those for <b>packed</b> <b>graphite</b> particles. To make this comparison relevant, graphite particles of four sizes in the range 15 – 124 μm, were obtained by grinding the graphite preform. Effects of the pressure applied to infiltrate the liquid alloy on composite properties were investigated. In spite of the largely different reinforcement volume fractions (90 % in volume in the preform and around 50 % in particle compacts) most properties are similar. Only the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion is 50 % smaller in the preform composites. Thermal conductivity of the preform composites (slightly below 100 W/m K), may be increased by reducing the graphite content, alloying, or increasing the infiltration pressure. The strength of particle composites follows Griffith criterion if the defect size is identified with the particle diameter. On the other hand, the composites strength remains increasing up to unusually high values of the infiltration pressure. This {{is consistent with the}} drainage curves measured in this work. Mg and Ti additions are those that produce the most significant improvements in performance. Although extensive development work remains to be done, it may be concluded that both mechanical and thermal properties make these materials suitable for the fabrication of piston engines.

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{has been}} performed for an Accelerator Transmutation of Waste (ATW) concept {{based on the}} use of the high temperature gas reactor technology. The concept has been proposed by General Atomics for the ATW system. The assessment was jointly conducted at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Los Alamos national laboratory to assess and to define the potential candidates for the ATW system. This report represents the assessment work performed at ANL. The concept uses recycled light water reactor (LWR) -discharge-transuranic extracted from irradiated oxide fuel in a critical and sub-critical accelerator driven gas-cooled transmuter. In this concept, the transmuter operates at 600 MWt first in the critical mode for three cycles and then operates in a subcritical accelerator-driven mode for a single cycle. The transmuter contains both thermal and fast spectrum transmutation zones. The thermal zone is fueled with the TRU oxide material in the form of coated particles, which are mixed with <b>graphite</b> powder, <b>packed</b> into cylindrical compacts, and loaded in hexagonal graphite blocks with cylindrical channels; the fast zone is fueled with TRU-oxide material in the form of coated particles without the graphite powder and the graphite blocks that has been burned in the thermal region for three critical cycles and one additional accelerator-driven cycle. The fuel loaded into the fast zone is irradiated for four additional cycles. This fuel management scheme is intended to achieve a high Pu isotopes consumption in the thermal spectrum zone, and to consume the minor actinides in the fast-spectrum zone. Monte Carlo and deterministic codes have been used to assess the system performance and to determine the feasibility of achieving high TRU consumption levels. The studies revealed the potential for high consumption of Pu- 239 (97 %), total Pu (71 %) and total TRU (64 %) in the system. The analyses confirmed the need for burnable absorber for both suppressing the initial excess reactivity and ensuring a negative temperature coefficient under all operating conditions. Additionally, current results suggest that it may be preferable to use a double strata thermal critical system and fast subcritical system to achieve nearly complete destruction of the TRU oxide fuel. The report gives a general description of the system proposed by General Atomics. The major design parameters (degrees of freedom), which can be altered to optimize the system design, and the constraints, which guide the design and the optimization studies are described. The deterministic and the Monte Carlo neutronics codes and models used for the neutronics analysis and assessment are presented. The results of fuel block and whole-core parametric studies performed to understand the physics are given including the effect of various fuel management schemes on the system performance. A point design is described including the system performance results for a single-batch and three-batch loading schemes. The major design issues, which need to be addressed during further studies, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Biofuel cells promise power {{generation}} with low cost and almost unlimited biocatalyst supply. This paper reports new {{perspectives on the}} characterization of immobilized thermostable (Pyrococcus,furiosus) hydrogenase electrodes in working configuration, {{using a combination of}} well defined electrochemical and spectrophotometric techniques. Electrodes based on porous pyrolytic carbon paper (PCP) and <b>packed</b> <b>graphite</b> columns (PGC) were fabricated for hydrogenase immobilization, which used a direct (hydrophilic adsorption) technique. Potentiostatic de polarization, dynamic potentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were combined with spectrophotometric detection of enzyme activity in order to characterize the electrodes and differentiate the relative contributions from enzyme loading, charge transfer, and mass transport to the limiting current density, which is a critical consideration for electrodes intended for fuel cell and bioelectrocatalytic application. Dynamic potentiometry proved useful as a rapid screening and characterization procedure for both blank electrodes and the presence of bound hydrogenase post-immobilization. Combining current density data determined via dc polarization (hydrogen oxidation currents of 30 muA cm(- 2) for PCP electrodes and 90 - 120 muA cm(- 2) PGC electrodes at 75 degreesC) with hydrogen mass transport limits determined via modeling and platinum electrode polarization (480 muA cm(- 2) at 75 degreesC), allowed determination that insufficient active enzyme was present to reach system mass transport limits to hydrogen supply for all electrodes. Additionally, spectrophotometric enzyme determination on the PCP electrode (0. 034 units cm(- 2)) was used to derive a theoretical maximum in hydrogen oxidation current (110 muA cm(- 2), assuming 100 % enzyme/support charge transfer efficiency), which when combined with current density data (30 muA cm(- 2)), allowed determination that actual charge transfer efficiency per unit total bound enzyme was significant (28 %). The EIS scans on immobilized PGC type electrodes suggest that mass transport might attribute the most to cell impedance at the low frequency regime. These combined results indicated that low bulk enzyme loading was the limiting factor to current density for thermostable hydrogenase electrodes fabricated for the study. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.
