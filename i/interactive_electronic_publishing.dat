Our paper offers a special focus on the different modes of stakeholder organization that exist in Japan and Europe, given that the main actors involved in the field of mobile Internet, i. e. telecom operators, handset manufacturers and content providers, interact very differently inthese two regions. There are marked distinctions between the Japanese model, which is strictly coordinated by one player, and the European model, which makes more use of open standards without a dominant party. The result has been that electronic publishing content has taken off rapidly in Japan, with an abundance of services available, while in Europe it is virtually non-existent. The relevance of the contrastive approach is important to follow the current developments of the mobile industry and the telecom joint ventures in the European Union, especially now that in 2003 the leading Japanese telecom players are beginning to act as stakeholders in the EU region. The authors conclude that neither the Japanese nor the EU models?being so different from one another, will predominate in the future; the best model will be one that combines business elements from both...|$|E

40|$|Paper-based {{publishing}} {{of scientific}} articles limits {{the types of}} presentations that can be used. The emergence of <b>electronic</b> <b>publishing</b> has created opportunities to increase the range of formats available for conveying scientific content. We introduce the Graphical Explanation Markup Language, GEML, implemented as an XML format for defining molecular documentaries which exploit the <b>interactive</b> capabilities of <b>electronic</b> <b>publishing.</b> GEML builds upon existing molecular structure definitions such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) standard file format. GEML provides a library of gestures (or actions) commonly used for structural explanations, and is extensible. XML allows us to separate explicit statements about how to highlight a molecular structure from the implementation of these instructions. We also present GEIS (Generator of Explanatory Interactive Systems), a program that takes as input a GEML documentary definition file and produces all the files necessary for an interactive, webbased molecular documentary. To demonstrate GEML and GEIS, we constructed a documentary capturing the difficult 3 D notions expressed in two selected published reports about human topoisomerase I. We have created a prototype Java application, GEMLBuilder, as an editor of GEML files. 1...|$|R
40|$|Opportunities, and Market Potential. (Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Traci May-Plumlee.) The developing area of <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> textiles is generating an abundance of literature within the textile industry. Presently, researchers {{in this area are}} working toward the development of interactive touch and voice activated wireless electronic textiles. Potentially, these specialized textiles will integrate many communication, entertainment, and safety devices directly into traditional textile and apparel products. The purpose of this research was to study the emerging area of <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> textiles. First, available literature was used to examine <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> technologies, the potential application areas for these technologies, and the potential market appeal for <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> textiles. Hypotheses were developed regarding expert perceptions of the potential technologies appropriate for mass-producing these products at affordable price points. To test the hypotheses, expert opinions regarding future opportunities, applications, and market appeal for <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> textiles were obtained via an Internet-based electronic survey. The results of the survey revealed that numerous viable technologies were being investigated for developing <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> textiles; health and safety, communication, and entertainment were perceived as major growth areas for these specialized textiles; and that product attributes, operation difficulty levels, and user concerns were considered to have important implications for <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> textiles market appeal...|$|R

Group competition is a useful method to cultivate originality and communication skills. Sharing the same space and the same large screen, and face-to-face communication with others are very important for group competition. We have designed a kanji pairing software package using the <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> whiteboard. Through experimental use of the application at two elementary schools, we confirmed the potential of this software to motivate children to learn and the necessity to adjust competitive factors according to children’s personalities. Moreover, the children kept their concentration and the teacher could get feedback of children’s study process. Therefore, the <b>interactive</b> <b>electronic</b> whiteboard and group competitive software can be effectively employed for classroom learning...|$|R

40|$|Scholarly <b>Electronic</b> <b>Publishing,</b> Library Space PlanningThere is {{legitimate}} enthusiasm for scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>publishing</b> and its potentials. However, {{the key question}} for libraries is not whether <b>electronic</b> <b>publishing</b> {{will continue to grow}} in importance, but rather how quickly it will displace printed books and journals in the specialized scholarly publishing marketplace. An increasing number of academic libraries face severe space problems, and supplementing print publications with electronic versions will not save library space [...] it will increase space needs in the near term as a growing number of workstations are added to provide access to electronic information. It is only when the library replaces print with electronic sources that the potential to save space emerges as a result of <b>electronic</b> <b>publishing.</b> If Nostradamus were alive, {{he might be able to}} predict when scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>publishing</b> will reach such a critical mass. This essay will not try to do so; however, it will briefly outline some critical factors that may slow the evolution of scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>publishing,</b> extend the life of the printed word, and necessitate the continued existence of physical library facilities...|$|R
