5|$|Freki {{is also a}} name {{applied to}} the monstrous wolf Fenrir in the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá. Folklorist John Lindow sees irony {{in the fact that}} Odin feeds one Freki at his dinner table and another—Fenrir—with <b>his</b> <b>flesh</b> during the events of Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|The {{western world}} learnt of Tiruvannamalai during the mid 20th century, {{through the work}} of Ramana Maharishi (1879–1950 CE). The cave where Ramana meditated is on the lower slopes of the Annamalai hills, with the ashram further down at the foothills. The {{basement}} of the raised hall inside the temple has the Patala Lingam, where Ramana attained supreme awareness while ants devoured <b>his</b> <b>flesh.</b> The place is also called a Mukthi Sthalam, meaning place of salvation, and saints like Seshadri Swamigal, Gugai Namachivayar and Yogi Ramsuratkumar {{have been associated with}} the temple.|$|E

5|$|We wretched and needy men reverently give thee thanks, almighty God, heavenly Father, for {{the food}} which thou hast sanctified and {{bestowed}} for the sustenance of the body, {{so that we may}} use it thankfully; {{at the same time we}} beseech thee that thou wouldst impart to us the food of angels, the true bread of heaven, the eternal word of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, so that our mind may feed on him and that through <b>his</b> <b>flesh</b> and blood we may be nourished, sustained and strengthened.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{doctrine}} of the Lord's Supper became a point of controversy between American Reformed theologians John Williamson Nevin and Charles Hodge. Nevin, influenced by German Lutheran Isaak August Dorner, wrote that through the Lord's Supper, Christians are mystically united to Christ's whole person, and that this union is through Christ's flesh. Hodge thought that Nevin overemphasized the idea of mystical union, and argued that when Christians are said to commune with Christ in the Supper, it is Christ's virtue as a sacrifice for their sins which is meant rather than a mystical union with <b>his</b> <b>flesh.</b> Hodge also taught that nothing is communicated in the Lord's Supper which is not communicated in the preaching of God's word. American Presbyterians generally agreed with Hodge. Nineteenth-century Reformed Congregationalist followers of the New England theology generally held a symbolic, memorial view of the Supper.|$|E
5|$|Mario and Princess Peach {{are walking}} {{together}} when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to help, Bowser Jr. appears, {{sneaking up on}} the Princess from behind and kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches {{up to them and}} confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from the young Koopa's clutches. At {{the end of the first}} world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns <b>his</b> <b>flesh,</b> leaving a skeleton.|$|E

5000|$|Mr. I. {{could hardly}} bear the changed {{appearances}} of people ("like animated gray statues") {{any more than}} he could bear his own changed appearance in the mirror: he shunned social intercourse and found sexual intercourse impossible. He saw people's <b>flesh,</b> <b>his</b> wife's <b>flesh,</b> <b>his</b> own <b>flesh,</b> as an abhorrent gray; [...] "flesh-colored" [...] now appeared [...] "rat-colored" [...] to him. This was so even when he closed his eyes, for his preternaturally vivid ("eidetic") visual imagery was preserved but now without color, and forced on him images, forced him to [...] "see" [...] but see internally with the wrongness of his achromatopsia. He found foods disgusting in their grayish, dead appearance and had to close his eyes to eat. But this did not help very much, for the mental image of a tomato was as black as its appearance.|$|R
5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} {{from the}} evidence at hand that something living in outer space has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, fuses it into <b>his</b> <b>flesh,</b> then kills the private investigator and absorbs all the forces of life in his body, leaving just a shrivelled husk. It does not take long for Judith to discover what is happening to her husband; Carroon flees and disappears into the London night, leaving her screaming outside the hospital, alive, unharmed, but entirely mad from fright.|$|E
5|$|Senior officer Mark (Robin Clarke) radios Sandy – his romantic {{interest}} – {{from the}} Operations Room to stall for time as Kate and operations chief Gary (Steven Grives) depart to requisition chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she mauls <b>his</b> <b>flesh.</b> Preparing {{for a final}} confrontation, Mark stumbles across Sandy's newborn, mutant twins. He entrusts them to Sharon as the mother blasts through the Operations Room door and destroys all the equipment inside, although {{it is evident that}} she no longer possesses unnatural strength. Crippled by an explosive charge, Kate is gored to death. In a last stand, Mark strangles and kills Sandy with a ripped-out cable. He returns to Sharon to discover one of the twins biting at her slit neck, before its sibling launches itself at him.|$|E

25|$|But Naaman's {{servants}} {{advised him}} that if Elisha had directed him to do some difficult thing {{he would have done}} it, so how much more should he do what Elisha directed when he said merely to wash and be clean.

25|$|The mediaeval Church of St Mary Assumed (Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta) in {{the small}} commune of Amaseno, Lazio, Italy houses the famous reliquary of the ampulla {{containing}} relics of St Lawrence, namely a quantum of his blood, a fragment of <b>his</b> <b>flesh,</b> some fat, and ashes. Annually on the Feast of St Lawrence and sometimes on other occasions, the blood in the ampulla miraculously liquefies during the Feast and re-coagulates by the following day.|$|E
25|$|Before being depowered, the Blob's mutant {{physiology}} granted him {{a number}} of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury due to a further mutation. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin proved {{to be difficult to}} penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even Wolverine's claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can lacerate <b>his</b> <b>flesh.</b> For instance, the Blob once sat on the X-Man, but jumped off in pain when Wolverine extended his sheathed claws into the Blob's rear. On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by Cyclops was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both Black Raazer and the Arabian Knight were able to harm him.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a {{fundamentally}} different, {{new kind of}} epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented as having a romantic and sexual relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised {{in the form of}} a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from <b>his</b> <b>flesh,</b> they are bound to one another ‒ if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong.|$|E

25|$|The man and {{the myth}} merge in this episode. His biography—and Iraqi television, which stages the story ad nasuem—tells of his {{familiarity}} with guns {{from the age of}} ten; his fearlessness and loyalty to the party during the 1959 operation; his bravery in saving his comrades by commandeering a car at gunpoint; the bullet that was gouged out of <b>his</b> <b>flesh</b> under his direction in hiding; the iron discipline that led him to draw a gun on weaker comrades who would have dropped off a seriously wounded member of the hit team at a hospital; the calculating shrewdness that helped him save himself minutes before the police broke in leaving his wounded comrades behind; and finally the long trek of a wounded man from house to house, city to town, across the desert to refuge in Syria.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, <b>his</b> <b>flesh</b> is falling away from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent to do before death.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's {{mutation}} also {{consists of}} animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced, and sharp fang-like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants {{created by the}} Weapon X program, the claws are later revealed to be {{a natural part of}} his body. The claws are not made of keratin, as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through <b>his</b> <b>flesh</b> every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them, and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.|$|E
