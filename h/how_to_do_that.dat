Disney CEO Bob Iger greenlit the series after watching the Marvel One-Shot short film Item 47. In April 2013, ABC announced that the series would be titled Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and it was officially picked up for a full season of 22 episodes in May 2013. Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell act as the series' showrunners, with Bell joining the show to help the inexperienced former pair with hiring crew members and [...] "navigating the politics of studios and networks", saying, [...] "My job is to help them learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> to steer the ship while they learn."

500|$|David Orr of The New York Times {{describes}} Jon as [...] "a complex, {{thoughtful and}} basically good character". David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the creators and executive {{producers of the}} television adaptation of the series, explain that Jon {{is one of several}} characters in the series who must [...] "face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths" [...] because [...] "The struggle many of them face is <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> without losing their grip on who they are." [...] Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch. Benioff and Weiss note that [...] "Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered." [...] Writing for Variety about the season 6 episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Laura Prudom suggests that Jon [...] "has the same shortcomings" [...] as his father: [...] "he fights with honor against opponents who are all too willing to use that predictable morality against him".|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} premiered, TV Guide called Harington a [...] "soulful heartthrob" [...] whose Jon is idolized by his younger {{siblings}} and who [...] "seeks purpose" [...] by joining the Night's Watch. Creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss later noted that Jon [...] "tries {{to live with}} honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered". They explained that {{he is one of}} several characters in the series who must [...] "face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths. The struggle many of them face is <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> without losing their grip on who they are." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN wrote in 2013 that while Jon and Daenerys' storylines in season 1 and season 2 [...] "felt very separate" [...] {{from the rest of the}} series' plot, for the first time in season 3, [...] "Jon's entire situation felt incorporated into the larger picture." [...] Fowler also added that Jon's [...] "oath-breaking romance with Ygritte added a lot of heat to the story". In May 2015, International Business Times called Jon [...] "clearly the most popular character" [...] of the series.|$|E
5000|$|.....to {{love the}} Lord our God {{with all our}} heart, all our words and all our deeds, and love our {{neighbour}} as ourselves struck me as an instruction, as a plea, and actually, as a necessity.

[...] Funding for this program was a Youth Advancement Through Music and Art (YATMA) grant. [...] YATMA, since 2006 called Educational Mentoring Through the Arts & Humanities (EMTAH), [...] "incorporates strength-based mentoring with progressive fine arts instruction, taps into and develops student potential by promoting creativity and providing early success. Stimulated by their progress, students learn to apply their new skills to other areas of their lives." [...] EMTAH was reviewed in December 2006 at WGBH's Open Source with Christopher Lydon, before the show's cancellation in July 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... {{he taught me how}} to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the world}} wars, the Marine Corps was headed by Major General John A. Lejeune, another popular commandant. The Marine Corps {{was searching for}} an {{expanded}} mission after World War I. [...] It was used in France as a junior version of the army infantry, and Marines realized that was a dead end. In the early 20th century they had acquired the new mission of police control of Central American countries partly occupied by the US. That mission became another dead end when the nation adopted a [...] "Good Neighbor Policy" [...] toward Latin America, and renounced further invasions. [...] The corps needed a new mission, one distinct from the army. It found one: {{it would be a}} fast-reacting, light infantry fighting force carried rapidly to far off locations by the navy. [...] Its special role was amphibious landings on enemy-held islands, but it took years to figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> [...] The Mahanian notion of a decisive fleet battle required forward bases for the navy close to the enemy. [...] After the Spanish-American War the Marines gained the mission of occupying and defending those forward bases, and they began a training program on Culebro Island, Puerto Rico. [...] The emphasis at first was on defending the forward base against enemy attack; they would be like the Turks who in 1915 inflicted 250,000 casualties on the British, Australian and New Zealand invaders of Gallipoli, forcing their withdrawal.|$|E

2500|$|Autechre use many {{different}} digital synths {{and a few}} analog synths in their production, as well as analog and digital drum machines, mixers, effects units and samplers. They have also made extensive use {{of a variety of}} computer based sequencers, software synthesisers, and other applications as a means of controlling those synths and processing the synthesized sounds. Much of the hardware and software they use has been customized by the band themselves. Autechre have also experimented in depth with development environments such as Max/MSP, and Kyma, amongst others, from 1997 onwards. From 2005 until 2009, they have used the Elektron Machinedrum and Monomachine, alongside Akai MPC and Nord Modular in their live performances. It has also been rumoured that Autechre have used military equipment in their work. In 2008, Sean Booth reported that if he were locked in a cell for a year with only one piece of software and one piece of hardware, he'd [...] "probably take a copy of Digital Performer and an AKG C 1000 microphone." [...] Other machines that Autechre have repeatedly mentioned in interviews are appreciated for their interface and aesthetics as much as their sound, including the Roland TR-606 and MC-202, and the Nord Lead. According to the 2016 interview to Resident Advisor, both members haven't bought a piece of equipment [...] "in the last 5 years", making MAX/MSP a primary production method, with Sean Booth stating that [...] "in Max I can generally build the thing I need, and if I don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> it'll generally be worthwhile learning." ...|$|E
