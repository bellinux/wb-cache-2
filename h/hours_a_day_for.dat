5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> {{the duration of the}} First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945.

In 1912, shortly after {{the founding of the}} Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E
5|$|Yao {{first tried}} {{out for the}} Shanghai Sharks junior team of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) when he was {{thirteen}} years old, and practiced ten <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> his acceptance. After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the senior team of the Sharks, where he averaged 10points and 8rebounds a game in his rookie season. His next season was cut short when he broke his foot {{for the second time}} in his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to six inches (10 to 15cm). The Sharks made the finals of the CBA in Yao's third season and again the next year, but lost both times to the Bayi Rockets. When Wang Zhizhi left the Bayi Rockets to become the first NBA player from China the following year, the Sharks finally won their first CBA championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9points and 20.2rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field, and made all 21 of his shots during one game in the finals.|$|E

25|$|In most mound-building species, males do {{most or all}} of {{the nest}} {{construction}} and maintenance.

25|$|The {{process of}} making {{charcoal}} demanded great skill and vast quantities of trees. During winter months, wood was cut and stacked.
