HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an <b>exoplanet</b> at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this <b>exoplanet,</b> known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th <b>exoplanet</b> to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|WASP-17b is an <b>exoplanet</b> in the {{constellation}} Scorpius that is orbiting the star WASP-17. Its discovery was announced on 11 August 2009. It is the first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction counter to the rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is the second-largest <b>exoplanet</b> discovered yet, and at half Jupiter's mass, this makes it the most puffy planet known. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in {{the atmosphere of the}} <b>exoplanet.</b>|$|E

40|$|Detecting <b>Exoplanets</b> at Utah State University Since {{the first}} {{observation}} {{of a planet}} orbiting another star in 1995, many more of these so called <b>exoplanets</b> have been discovered orbiting stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

Professional astronomers rely on amateur astronomers to verify Kepler’s findings and updating the registry. Research was done to determine the likelihood of confirming <b>exoplanets</b> from USU in Logan, UT using the existing observatory as well as with equipment purchased for this investigation.

40|$|International audienceAfter the {{discovery}} of more than 400 planets beyond our Solar System, the characterization of <b>exoplanets</b> {{as well as their}} host stars can be considered as {{one of the fastest growing}} fields in space science during the past decade. The characterization of <b>exoplanets</b> can only be carried out in a well coordinated interdisciplinary way which connects planetary science, solar/stellar physics and astrophysics. We present a status report on the characterization of <b>exoplanets</b> and their host stars by reviewing the relevant space- and ground-based projects. One finds that the previous strategy changed from space mission concepts which were designed to search, find and characterize Earth-like rocky <b>exoplanets</b> to: A statistical study of planetary objects in order to get information about their abundance, an identification of potential target and finally its analysis. Spectral analysis of <b>exoplanets</b> is mandatory, particularly to identify bio-signatures on Earth-like planets. Direct characterization of <b>exoplanets</b> should be done by spectroscopy, both in the visible and in the infrared spectral range. The way leading to the direct detection and characterization of <b>exoplanets</b> is then paved by several questions, either concerning the pre-required science or the associated observational strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the search for the {{satellites}} of the <b>exoplanets</b> (exomoons) is discussed recently. There are very many satellites in our Solar System. But in contrary of our Solar system, <b>exoplanets</b> have significant eccentricity. In process of planetary migration, <b>exoplanets</b> can cross some resonances with following growth of their orbital eccentricity. The stability of exomoons decreases, and many of satellites were lost. Here we give a simple example of loss satellite when eccentricity increased. Finally, we can conclude that exomoons must be rare due to observed large eccentricities of <b>exoplanets.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|There are {{relatively}} few stars within ten light-years of the Sun. The closest is the triple star system Alpha Centauri, {{which is about}} 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair {{at a distance of}} 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable <b>exoplanet</b> was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed <b>exoplanet</b> to the Sun.

5|$|According to {{a summary}} of the research, {{atmospheric}} water absorption in such an <b>exoplanet</b> renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum, compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Barman took Knutson's Hubble data on HD 209458 b, applied to his theoretical model, and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet's atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|<b>Exoplanets</b> {{are born}} and evolve in the {{radiation}} and particle environment created by their host star. The host star’s optical and infrared radiation heats the <b>exoplanet’s</b> lower atmosphere and surface, while the ultraviolet, extreme ultraviolet and X-radiation control the photochemistry and mass loss from the <b>exoplanet’s</b> upper atmosphere. Stellar radiation, {{especially at the}} shorter wavelengths, changes dramatically as a host star evolves leading {{to changes in the}} planet’s atmosphere and habitability. This paper reviews the present state of our knowledge concerning the time-dependent radiation emitted by stars with convective zones, that is stars with spectral types F, G, K, and M, which comprise nearly all of the host stars of detected <b>exoplanets...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} debated {{subjects}} in Astronomy since the discovery of <b>exoplanets</b> is how can we distinguish the most massive of such objects from very-low mass stars like Brown Dwarfs (BDs) ? We {{have been looking for}} evidences of a difference in physical characteristics that could be related to different formation processes. Using a new diagnostic diagram that compares the baryonic gravitational potential (BGP) with the distances from their host stars, we have classified a sample of 355 well-studied <b>exoplanets</b> according to their possible structures. We have then compared the <b>exoplanets</b> to a sample of 87 confirmed BDs, identifying a range in BGP that could be common to both objects. By analyzing the mass-radius relations (MRR) of the <b>exoplanets</b> and BDs in those different BGP ranges, we were able to distinguish different characteristic behaviors. By comparing with models in the literature, our results suggest that BDs and massive <b>exoplanets</b> might have similar structures dominated by liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) ...|$|R

5|$|Gliese 876 d is an <b>exoplanet</b> {{approximately}} 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876.

5|$|In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12.

50|$|The {{main goal}} of CHEOPS {{will be to}} {{accurately}} measure the radii of the <b>exoplanets</b> for which ground-based spectroscopic surveys have already provided mass estimates.

5|$|Wanting to {{understand}} the strange light pattern, Tabetha S. Boyajian put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an <b>exoplanet</b> transiting (eclipsing) its massive star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 to 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out any kind of an orbit for one celestial object.|$|E
