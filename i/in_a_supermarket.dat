25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>supermarket,</b> pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other.

Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E

500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>supermarket.</b> The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer. [...] Cicily Janus remarks that, [...] "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>supermarket.</b> Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were. Imagine the terror and the fear of being surrounded by these people who tell you that they are your family.
