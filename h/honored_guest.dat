5|$|After Emperor Mingzong died in 933, the Later Tang {{began to}} crumble {{from its own}} {{succession}} crisis. Mingzong's son and successor Li Conghou ruled for only five months {{before he was killed}} in 934 in a coup led by his adoptive brother Li Congke (Emperor Mo of Later Tang). Prince Bei, who was still an <b>honored</b> <b>guest</b> at the Tang court at the time, wrote to his brother Emperor Taizong (Yelü Deguang), advising him to invade the Tang. Instead, Taizong lent military support to a rebellion led by Shi Jingtang, a Tang governor and son-in-law of the former Emperor Mingzong. With Khitan help, in 936 Shi Jingtang succeeded in replacing the Later Tang with his own Later Jin. After some negotiation with the more powerful Khitans, he ceded sixteen border prefectures stretching from modern-day Datong (Shanxi province) to the coast of the Bohai Sea east of what is now Beijing, to the Liao. Since the Sixteen Prefectures contained numerous strategic passes and fortifications, the Khitans now had unrestricted access to the plains of northern China. Shi Jingtang also agreed to treat Emperor Taizong of Liao as his own father, a move that symbolically elevated Taizong and the Liao to a superior position.|$|E
25|$|The Puja {{practice}} is structured {{as an act}} of welcoming, hosting, honoring the deity of one's choice as one's <b>honored</b> <b>guest,</b> and remembering the spiritual and emotional significance the deity represents the devotee. Jan Gonda, as well as Diana L. Eck, states that a typical Puja involves one or more of 16 steps (Shodasha Upachara) traceable to ancient times: the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an <b>honored</b> <b>guest,</b> praise (hymns) with Dhupa or Aarti along with food (Naivedhya) is offered to the deity, after an expression of love and respect the host takes leave, and with affection expresses good bye to the deity. The worship practice may also involve reflecting on spiritual questions, with image serving as support for such meditation.|$|E

25|$|Virgil's {{contemporary}} Horace wrote {{often of}} wine, though no single work is devoted {{entirely to the}} subject. He espoused an Epicurean view of taking life's pleasures, including wine, in moderation. Among the earliest recorded examples of deliberately choosing a wine for a specific occasion, Horace's Odes included serving a wine from the birth-year vintage at a celebration of an <b>honored</b> <b>guest.</b> He writes of serving simple wines for everyday occasions and saving celebrated wines such as Caecuban for special events. Horace answered the question posed by the Alexandrian poet Callimachus as to whether water or wine was the preferred drink of poetic inspiration by enthusiastically siding with Cratinus and the wine drinkers. His affinity for wine was such that while contemplating his death, he expressed more dread {{at the thought of}} departing from his beloved wine cellar than his wife.|$|E

500|$|Despite Bei voluntarily relinquishing his claim, Deguang, who {{had assumed}} {{the title of}} Emperor Taizong of Liao, viewed Bei as a threat.

[...] Prince Bei himself was placed under surveillance by the Emperor. In 930 Prince Bei fled to the Later Tang, where he became an <b>honored</b> <b>guest</b> of Emperor Mingzong, who went as far as to bestow upon Prince Bei the Emperor's own surname of Li (李). There are two conflicting accounts of Prince Bei's death: he was assassinated either in 936 by Emperor Mo of Later Tang in retaliation for the Khitans' support in overthrowing the Tang and replacing it with the Later Jin, or in 937 by Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin (Shi Jingtang) as a show of loyalty to Emperor Taizong of Liao.|$|E

He completed his final assignment in June 1946, after which he became a civilian merchant shipping captain, opting to retire from the military. When his ship accidentally collided with and sank a freighter, he was forced to resign. Instead, he became a Shinto priest at a shrine in Kyoto. He was later interviewed by author Dan Kurzman for his 1990 book Fatal Voyage, in which Kurzman stated, [...] "Commander Hashimoto was amazed by the Americans. While penned up in his dormitory during the trial, he was treated more like an <b>honored</b> <b>guest</b> than an enemy officer who had caused the deaths of so many American boys." [...] Hashimoto later authored a book Sunk: The Story of the Japanese Submarine Fleet, 1941–1945 in which he detailed Japanese submarine operations in the war, including an account of the sinking of Indianapolis.|$|E
