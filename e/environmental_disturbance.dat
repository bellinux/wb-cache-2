In Tasmania it is {{threatened}} by nest disturbance, loss of suitable nesting habitat, shooting, poisoning, trapping, and collision with power lines and wind turbines, as well as entanglement and environmental pollution. Estuaries are a favoured habitat, and these are often subject to <b>environmental</b> <b>disturbance.</b> white-bellied sea eagles have been observed to increase their hunting ranges to include salmon fish farms, but {{the effect of this}} on breeding success is unknown.|$|E
500|$|While rodents are not {{the most}} seriously {{threatened}} order of mammals, there are 168 species in 126 genera that are said to warrant conservation attention {{in the face of}} limited appreciation by the public. Since 76 percent of rodent genera contain only one species, much phylogenetic diversity could be lost with a comparatively small number of extinctions. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of species at risk and accurate taxonomy, conservation must be based mainly on higher taxa (such as families rather than species) and geographical hot spots. Several species of rice rat have become extinct since the 19th century, probably through habitat loss and the introduction of alien species. In Colombia, the brown hairy dwarf porcupine was recorded from only two mountain localities in the 1920s, while the red crested soft-furred spiny rat is known only from its type locality on the Caribbean coast, so these species are considered vulnerable. The IUCN Species Survival Commission writes [...] "We can safely conclude that many South American rodents are seriously threatened, mainly by <b>environmental</b> <b>disturbance</b> and intensive hunting".|$|E

To steer ships to the desired position, an error feedback control law on account of Lyapunov functions is designed. Then, to satisfy the L 2 -gain disturbance rejection, proper parameters are chosen based on the system dissipative property.

We characterize the conditions on social welfare, resource growth, the discount rate, and the distribu-tion of <b>environmental</b> <b>disturbances</b> that are sufficient for conservation to be efficient. The productivity of the resource under the worst possible environmental conditions, the discount rate, and the welfare function are all crucial factors in determining {{the efficiency of}} conservation.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} {{the development of a}} control strategy for path following of underactuated marine surface vessels in the presence of ocean currents. The proposed control strategy is based on a modified Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance law with integral action and a pair of adaptive feedback controllers. Traditional LOS guidance has several nice properties and is widely used in practice for path following of marine vehicles. However, it has the drawback of being susceptible to <b>environmental</b> <b>disturbances.</b> In this work, we propose a modified LOS guidance law with integral action for counteracting <b>environmental</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Paired with a set of adaptive feedback controllers, we show that this approach guarantees global asymptotic path following of straight-line paths in the presence constant and irrotational ocean currents.
