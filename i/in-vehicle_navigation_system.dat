40|$|AbstractA {{significant}} {{characteristic of}} the UK’s rapidly ageing population is the high percentage of older adults who rely extensively on their private automobile to stay mobile. There are, however, functional declines that occur with ageing that affect an individual’s ability to drive safely. Additionally, navigating becomes more difficult as we age and can result in older adults reducing their driving on unfamiliar routes. Thus, understanding how older drivers currently plan and then way-find journeys will allow future <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> to be more appropriate {{for the needs of}} older adults. This paper reports on the findings of six focus groups with older drivers; three groups with those who use <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> and three groups with those who do not. The focus groups found that the use of <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> provide older drivers with an increased confidence on the roads, a form of companionship in the car and an element of pleasure in driving. When planning long distance trips, older drivers will use online planning tools that provide an initial familiarity with their traditional method of navigation. Some participants who do not currently use any driving aids reported the use of potentially unsafe navigating behaviours to assist them on road network indicating a clear need for assistance in navigating. Finally, there are some significant barriers for <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> to overcome before they can be considered beneficial for older drivers...|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{presented here}} allows {{to measure and}} monitor road congestion across Europe using data from TomTom <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> The approach {{is based on the}} analysis {{of a large number of}} real vehicle speeds that have been measured on each road link and the application of algorithms that allow the estimation of congestion indicators for specific types of roads during selected time periods. The results include the detailed mapping of recurrent congestion both geographically and temporally, as well as the comparison of the quality of service of road networks between different zones. The data used represent real speed measurements from <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> for different time periods and days of the week. The large number of "probes" (over 1 trillion of measurements) gives a highly accurate and representative picture of the actual driving conditions across the European road network. The data collected are clustered in groups of speed profiles which represent change in average speed behaviour along a road link in five-minute time intervals over a 24 -hour period. Each road link has a specific speed profile assigned per day of the week. The average speed on a specific link during a certain time period can be compared to the benchmark speed estimated for the link under free flow conditions or against selected threshold values. As a result, indicators of congestion for different time periods can be measured and compared across links, regions and countries. JRC. J. 1 -Economics of Climate Change, Energy and Transpor...|$|R

This paper describes an empirical, road-based investigation of the benefits to older and younger drivers of providing landmarks within the instructions presented by an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system.</b> Thirty two participants navigated a challenging urban route using either landmarks or distance information to identify the location of forthcoming manoeuvres. A range of driver behaviour measures were collected, including visual glance data, driving errors, driver workload, navigation errors, navigation confidence, and pre and post-trial driver attitudinal responses. Results show that, for older and younger drivers, landmarks reduced the time spent glancing to a visual display, reduced navigation and driving errors, and influenced driver confidence.

40|$|Attending to {{cultural}} diversity {{is important for}} products and technology intended for global placement, such as automobiles, yet many products (and associated interfaces) lack genuine cultural differentiation. For example, <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are typically identical in form and function across world markets, differing only in the local language and map database. To capture and explore culturally-salient design factors, we utilised a scenario-based design methodology, involving 6 experienced drivers from the UK and Malaysia. Participants were asked to portray their ideal <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> interface designs – by drawing pictograms and devising accompanying spoken messages – to direct drivers along 3 prescribed routes in the UK, Malaysia and Japan. Routes were presented using video and paper maps, with the order of presentation counterbalanced between groups; participants were not told in advance from which country each route was derived. Proposed designs highlight differences at a country level, which are consequently interpreted from a cultural perspective. For example, Malaysian drivers included a higher density of navigational elements in their designs, particularly in their home environment, compared to UK drivers. Malaysian drivers also created more incremental designs, particularly on the approach to a manoeuvre, suggesting a desire for greater navigational support {{at this point in}} the journey. Landmarks were consistently incorporated in designs, but differences were noted in cultural salience. Additionally, the phrasing of instructions (e. g. “go straight on”), nomenclature for road elements (e. g. ‘roundabout’) and distance declaration conventions (e. g. units) differed at a country level. The findings can be used to inform the design of culturally-attuned <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|One {{functionality}} of an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> is route planning. Given {{a set of}} origin-destination (O/D) pairs, {{there could}} be many possible routes for a driver. A useful routing system should {{have the capability to}} support the driver effectively in deciding on an optimum route to his preference. The objective of this work is to model the driver behavior in the area of route selection. In particular, the research focuses on an optimum route search function in a typical in-car navigation system or dynamic route guidance (DRG) system. In this work, we want to emphasize the need to orientate the route selection method on the driver's preference. Each feasible route has a set of attributes. A fuzzy-neural (FN) approach is used to represent the correlation of the attributes with the driver's route selection. A recommendation or route ranking can be provided to the driver.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 SAE International There is anecdotal {{evidence}} of drivers blindly following <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> (IVNS) commands. IVNSs have {{shown to be}} distracting and mishaps with the device have entered popular culture {{as a source of}} comedy. Manufactures have reacted by warning drivers of the dangers involved in operating the devices, and in some cases prevent address input while moving. While IVNSs are increasingly being used, do drivers perceive their use as distracting, potentially misleading and thus dangerous? We conducted an online survey of over 200 drivers to determine their attitudes toward safety while using these devices. This was followed by a series of interviews with an additional 20 drivers to provide more in-depth results. Drivers reported that distraction is not a big issue for them when using an IVNS, with only 8 % reporting that the device was too distracting at times. Over 90 % of respondents believe IVNSs do not have a harmful or potentially injurious effect and they are not wary of the device. They also placed more trust in directions from IVNSs than from people. There is a discrepancy between drives ’ attitudes towards safety and potential dangers of using an IVNS. Drivers may be unaware of how distraction affects their driving. Some did not feel using an IVNS was dangerous at all because they are ultimately responsible any incidents while driving...|$|E

40|$|This project {{evaluated}} how driver {{interaction with}} an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> (IVNS) affects driving performance and safety. Researchers collected measures of simulated driving performance during interaction by 13 different subjects with an IVNS digital map display, using a Honda Acura placed within a fixed-base wrap-around driving simulator. Subjects (Ss) navigated along a maze-like route laid out within a simulated road grid. Dummy Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, {{corresponding to the}} position of the vehicle in the grid, were transmitted to the IVNS and updated continuously as vehicle position in the simulation environment changed. A digital map of the grid, with an icon representing vehicle representing vehicle position superimposed, was displayed on a laptop computer placed in the Acura. Under the control condition, Ss were not given turn instructions. Results indicate that for the test relative to the control condition: * Visual interaction with the IVNS display was greater and task completion times longer. * More variability in vehicle control was observed for measures of average vehicle speed, peak speed, percent braking time, peak braking pressure, and vehicle heading. Subjective responses from simulated driving and a separate group of on-road Ss identify both navigation benefits and possible safety problems with the system. It is a reasonable assumption that increased variability in driving performance elevates driving accident risk. Both the simulated driving and subjective response results, therefore, point to possible safety implications in IVNS use for the driving public. The findings suggest that as IVNS use becomes more widespread, both navigation benefits and possible adverse driving safety effects of such systems need to be considered.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of driver distractions that {{negatively}} affect driver workload and performance. These distractions range attempting to light a cigarette, and putting on make-up, to eating or drinking, tuning the radio, using a cellular phone, or using an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system.</b> Of particular present interest are the distracting effects of telematic devices, which include traffic information systems, telecommunication, intelligent aid and control, and navigational systems. These devices can now be found on-board various types of U. S. and foreign automobiles. Despite having many potential benefits, there are also several behavioral problems resulting from poor use of these devices. The present research was designed to investigate the deleterious effects of telematics on driver performance. It was hypothesized that all the telematic systems used in this study would degrade driver performance and increase workload. A mixed-model factorial design (2 x 3) was used, with telematics being a between-subject factor and allocation phase a within-subject factor (repeated measures). All participants were required to drive three, four-minute simulated (pre, during, and post) allocation phases. In the preallocation phase, participants were required to drive while performing a secondary counting task, (counting and responding to a series of randomly presented visual signals). During the allocation phase, participants were required to drive and perform the secondary counting task while either talking on the phone or tuning a radio (distractibility task). In the post-allocation phase, participants were required to drive while performing the secondary counting task. Data from the counting task (number of correct, wrong, and misses) and driving errors (collisions, crossing the median, leaving the road, maintaining the speed limit, and lane deviations) were recorded and statistically analyzed. Thirty-four participants (nine males and 25 females) from the University of Central Florida participated in this study. A series of analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to test for the effects of telematics and workload on each of the dependent measures. A significant main effect of phase on lane deviations was observed, F(2, 64) = 10. 58, p 3 ̆c. 001, indicating that more lane deviations were made during the cell phone and radio tuning use (M = 9. 14) than during both of the pre-allocation (M = 4. 14) and post-allocation (M = 5. 88) phases. ANOVA also yielded a significant main effect of phase on crossing the median, F(3, 68) = 4. 63, p 3 ̆c. 05, indicating that more crossings were made during the allocation phase (M = 5. 05) than during the pre-allocation (M = 3. 05) and post-allocation (M = 4. 47) phases. Similarly, the results also showed a significant effect of phase on the distraction task performance, F(2, 64) = 5. 70, p 3 ̆c. 01, indicating that more errors were made during the allocation phase (M = 6. 50) than during the pre-allocation (M = 4. 50) and the post-allocation (M = 3. 38) phases. The present findings indicate that both cellular phone and radio systems are capacity demanding. The counting task results demonstrate the increased level of workload associated with these telematic devices. In addition, driving performance errors were also higher for both the cellular phone and the radio systems. Our findings suggest the need to regulate the use of such devices in order to avoid overloading the driver’s attentional spare capacity...|$|E

The case {{study was conducted}} using FASTCARS (Freeway and Arterial Street Traffic Conflict Arousal and Resolution Simulator), an interactive microcomputer-based travel choice simulator. The experiment was designed to both exhibit the value of using computer simulation for data collection and to explore factors that influence and induce changes in enroute driver behavior. A range of statistical methods were applied on both a driver and an enroute event basis to investigate underlying relationships between driver behavior and the selection and utilization of real-time information technologies. Logit models were developed for both primary and secondary diversion behavior, incorporating variables that capture the utility choice associated with enroute decision processes. Utility assessment modeling was performed to examine {{the potential benefits of}} <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> The analyses suggest that driver familiarity both with travel conditions and network layout strongly influences driver behavior and need to acquire information. The initial results indicate that although real-time information acquisition is generally useful for clarifying drivers' perceptions of travel conditions and assisting with route choice decisions, the value of information acquisition may decrease among more experienced drivers...|$|R

Each year brings new software packages from innovative developers that are easier to use, more powerful, and more easily adopted by users with minimal training. GIS and mapping tools are increasingly available on the World Wide Web (WWW), and an increasing number of sites oŒer advanced GIS services such as route � nding and geocoding. <b>In-vehicle</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> using GIS technology are becoming part of our daily lives (Cowen 1994). In the next two years cellphones in the US will be required to be geographically enabled—to be able to report their current location to an accuracy of 100 m—in the interests of accurate response to emergency calls. New imagery is becoming available from commercial sources with spatial resolutions as � ne as 1 m, and is being distributed through new mechanisms such as distributed geolibraries and spatial data clearinghouses (NRC 1993, 1999). New methods of data documentation are bein...|$|R
