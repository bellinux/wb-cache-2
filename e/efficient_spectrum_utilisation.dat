Under the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) environment the Third Generation (3 G) has many advantages such as highly <b>efficient</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> and variable user data rates. In this paper, we present the bit error rate (BER) performance analysis of Rake Receiver under UMTS environment with BPSK modulation technique and the convolutional coding at the transmitter and viterbi decoding at the receiver side. The Standard Gaussian Approximation (SGA) is used to evaluate the performance of Rake Receiver over a frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. The data is modulated, encoded, spread and transmitted through a frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. The transmitted signal is corrupted by multiple access interference, and is further corrupted by AWGN at the receiver. In the receiver, dispreading, decoded and demodulated. Rake Receiver, directive antenna are employed to improve the system performance. We examined the BER performance of Rake Receiver with, varying the number of users, spreading factor, Rake fingers, Interfering Cells, and the value of directivity of antenna at base Station. From the results we have seen that the BER performance of Rake Receiver is affected by varying these parameters and gives useful results...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment for {{the degree}} of Doctor of PhilosophyWith the rapid increase in wireless devices, an effective improvement in the demand of <b>efficient</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> for gaining better connectivity is needed. Cognitive Radio (CR) is an emerging technology that exploits the inefficient utilisation of the unused spectrum dynamically. Since spectrum sharing is responsible for coordinating channels’ access for Cognitive Users (CUs), the Common Control Channel (CCC) {{is one of the}} existing methods used to exchange the control information between CUs. However, the unique characteristics and parameters of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) present several possible threats targeting spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility leading to the deterioration of the network performance. Thus, protection and detection security mechanisms are essential to maintaining the CRNs. This thesis presents a novel decentralised CR MAC protocol that successfully utilises the unused portion of the licensed band. The protocol achieves improved performance; communication time and throughput when compared to two benchmark protocols. Less communication time and higher throughput are accomplished by the protocol due to performing fast switching to the selected available data channel for initiating data transmission. The proposed protocol is then extended to two different versions based on two authentication approaches applied to it; one using Digital Signature and another is based on Shared-Key. The two proposed secure protocols address the security requirements in CRNs leading to subsequent secure communication among CUs. The protocols function effectively in providing defence against several attacks related to the MAC layer such as; Spectrum Sensing Data Manipulation/Falsification, Data Tempering and Modification, Jamming attacks, Eavesdropping, Forgery and Fake control information attacks, MAC address spoofing, and unauthorised access attacks. The associated security algorithms ensure the successful secure communication between CUs in a cooperative approach. Moreover, the security protocols are investigated and analysed in terms of security flows by launching unauthorised access and modification attacks on the transmitted information. The testing results demonstrated that two protocols perform successful detection of threats and ensure secure communication in CRNs...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{wireless}} services and the breakneck proliferation of wireless devices continue to strain limited spectrum resource. While the need for efficient spectrum sharing mechanisms has been emphasized, opportunistic spectrum access has been considered as a promising mechanism for dynamic spectrum sharing. However, although the idle spectrum could exist, it is usually rather fragmented and distributed, and hence the secondary network users would face the difficulty in finding required contiguous spectrum. Spectrum aggregation can be exploited to provide effective wide bandwidth communication but {{at the cost of}} complexity and overhead. When a primary network uses spectrum dynamically, from the nature of opportunistic spectrum access, collisions can occur between primary and secondary transmissions and spectrum handoff can be utilised to provide reliable communication. However, collision occurrence results in spectrum handoff delay in a secondary network user (SU) along with short-term interference to a primary network user (PU). As a SU accesses more spectrum for higher data rates by spectrum aggregation, collisions can occur more frequently and frequent spectrum handoff will be required. While spectrum aggregation will allow the SU to have high flexibility in spectrum use and spectrum handoff can help improve the reliability of secondary transmissions, the SU faces a new spectrum allocation problem: How wide and which parts of spectrum opportunities should be aggregated while considering the complexity and the overhead for aggregation and for spectrum handoff? This thesis addresses the key challenge of opportunistic spectrum access, focusing on efficient spectrum sharing considering the fragmentation of spectrum opportunities in frequency and time domains. First, considering complexity and overhead for aggregation, the spectrum aggregation approach is investigated and guidelines are derived how to reduce spectrum fragmentation for the <b>efficient</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> based on simulation results. Second, the relationship between collision occurrence and spectrum aggregation is analysed. Collision probabilities between primary and secondary transmissions are derived and the impacts of spectrum aggregation on data rates and spectrum handoff are investigated. Then, a spectrum aggregation algorithm is proposed to maximise data rates for a given collision probability threshold. Third, when considering spectrum handoff, the impacts of spectrum aggregation on spectrum handoff and short-term interference to PUs are analysed. Then, the spectrum aggregation algorithm is designed with the aim to minimise collision. Finally, {{the results of this study}} are summarised, conclusions are presented and a number of future research topics are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Femtocell {{access points}} are inexpensive, {{plug and play}} home base {{stations}} designed to extend radio coverage and increase capacity within indoor environments. Their inherent uncoordinated and overlaid deployment however, means existing radio resource management (RRM) techniques are often inef-fectual. Recent advances in dynamic RRM have emphasised {{the need for more}} efficient resource management strategies. While centralised resource management offers improved coordination and operator control giving better interference management, it is not scalable for increasing nodes. Distributed management techniques in contrast, do afford scaled deployment, but at higher node densities incur performance degradation in both system throughput and link-quality because of poor coordination. The level of spectrum sharing mandated by macro-femto deployment also impacts on system throughput and is scenario dependant. This paper presents a new hybrid resource management algo-rithm(HRMA) for down-links in orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based systems, with the model analysed for a range of macro-femto deployment scenarios. HRMA employs a dynamic fractional frequency reuse scheme for macro-cell deploy-ment with frequency reuse defined for femto users depending on their location by making certain frequencies locally available based on macro-femto tier information sharing and <b>efficient</b> localised <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Quantitative performance results confirm the efficacy of the HRMA strategy for various key system metrics including interference minimisation, outage probability and throughput...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{proliferation}} of new wireless communication devices and services, {{the demand for}} the radio spectrum is increasing at a rapid rate, which leads to making the spectrum more and more crowded. The limited available spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage {{have led to the}} emergence of cognitive radio (CR) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technologies, which enable future wireless communication systems to exploit the empty spectrum in an opportunistic manner. To do so, future wireless devices should be aware of their surrounding radio environment in order to adapt their operating parameters according to the real-time conditions of the radio environment. From this viewpoint, spectrum sensing is becoming increasingly important to new and future wireless communication systems, which is designed to monitor the usage of the radio spectrum and reliably identify the unused bands to enable wireless devices to switch from one vacant band to another, thereby achieving flexible, reliable, and <b>efficient</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation.</b> This thesis focuses on issues related to local and cooperative spectrum sensing for CR networks, which need to be resolved. These include the problems of noise uncertainty and detection in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) environments in individual spectrum sensing. In addition to issues of energy consumption, sensing delay and reporting error in cooperative spectrum sensing. In this thesis, we investigate how to improve spectrum sensing algorithms to increase their detection performance and achieving energy efficiency. To this end, first, we propose a new spectrum sensing algorithm based on energy detection that increases the reliability of individual spectrum sensing. In {{spite of the fact that}} the energy detection is still the most common detection mechanism for spectrum sensing due to its simplicity. Energy detection does not require any prior knowledge of primary signals, but has the drawbacks of threshold selection, and poor performance due to noise uncertainty especially at low SNR. Therefore, a new adaptive optimal energy detection algorithm (AOED) is presented in this thesis. In comparison with the existing energy detection schemes the detection performance achieved through AOED algorithm is higher. Secondly, as cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) can give further improvement in the detection reliability, the AOED algorithm is extended to cooperative sensing; in which multiple cognitive users collaborate to detect the primary transmission. The new combined approach (AOED and CSS) is shown to be more reliable detection than the individual detection scheme, where the hidden terminal problem can be mitigated. Furthermore, an optimal fusion strategy for hard-fusion based cognitive radio networks is presented, which optimises sensing performance. Thirdly, the need for denser deployment of base stations to satisfy the estimated high traffic demand in future wireless networks leads to a significant increase in energy consumption. Moreover, in large-scale cognitive radio networks some of cooperative devices may be located far away from the fusion centre, which causes an increase in the error rate of reporting channel, and thus deteriorating the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing. To overcome these problems, a new multi-hop cluster based cooperative spectrum sensing (MHCCSS) scheme is proposed, where only cluster heads are allowed to send their cluster results to the fusion centre via successive cluster heads, based on higher SNR of communication channel between cluster heads. Furthermore, in decentralised CSS as in cognitive radio Ad Hoc networks (CRAHNs), where there is no fusion centre, each cognitive user performs the local spectrum sensing and shares the sensing information with its neighbours and then makes its decision on the spectrum availability based on its own sensing information and the neighbours’ information. However, cooperation between cognitive users consumes significant energy due to heavy communications. In addition to this, each CR user has asynchronous sensing and transmission schedules which add new challenges in implementing CSS in CRAHNs. In this thesis, a new multi-hop cluster based CSS scheme has been proposed for CRAHNs, which can enhance the cooperative sensing performance and reduce the energy consumption compared with other conventional decentralised cooperative spectrum sensing modes...|$|E

In light of this, spectral defragmentation technologies have been introduced in elastic optical networks, aiming to increase the <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation.</b> During the defragmentation operation, the available fragmented spectrum bands are consolidated by reallocating existing connections, either re-routing them along alternative routes and/or re-tuning them onto different spectrum portions. Obviously, spectral defragmentation increases network complexity and cost. Therefore, it is highly desirable to limit its application as much as possible, while keeping network performance within acceptable margins.

40|$|The radio {{frequency}} (RF) spectrum is a scarce natural resource, currently regulated by government agencies. With the explosive emergence of wireless applications, {{the demands for}} the RF spectrum are constantly increasing. On the other hand, {{it has been reported}} that localised temporal and geographic <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiency is extremely low. Cognitive radio is an innovative technology designed to improve <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> by exploiting those spectrum opportunities. This ability is dependent upon spectrum sensing, which is one of most critical components in a cognitive radio system. A significant challenge is to sense the whole RF spectrum at a particular physical location in a short observation time. Otherwise, performance degrades with longer observation times since the lagging response to spectrum holes implies low <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiency. Hence, developing an <b>efficient</b> wideband <b>spectrum</b> sensing technique is prime important. In this thesis, a multirate asynchronous sub-Nyquist sampling (MASS) system that employs multiple low-rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is developed that implements wideband spectrum sensing. The key features of the MASS system are, 1) low implementation complexity, 2) energy-efficiency for sharing spectrum sensing data, and 3) robustness against the lack of time synchronisation. The conditions under which recovery of the full spectrum is unique are presented using compressive sensing (CS) analysis. The MASS system is applied to both centralised and distributed cognitive radio networks. When the spectra of the cognitive radio nodes have a common spectral support, using one low-rate ADC in each cognitive radio node can successfully recover the full spectrum. This is obtained by applying a hybrid matching pursuit (HMP) algorithm - a synthesis of distributed compressive sensing simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (DCS-SOMP) and compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP). Moreover, a multirate spectrum detection (MSD) system is introduced to detect the primary users from a small number of measurements without ever reconstructing the full spectrum. To achieve a better detection performance, a data fusion strategy is developed for combining sensing data from all cognitive radio nodes. Theoretical bounds on detection performance are derived for distributed cognitive radio nodes suffering from additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh fading, and log-normal fading channels. In conclusion, MASS and MSD both have a low implementation complexity, high energy efficiency, good data compression capability, and are applicable to distributed cognitive radio networks.
