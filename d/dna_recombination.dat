2500|$|Many {{of these}} {{sequences}} regulate {{the structure of}} chromosomes by limiting the regions of heterochromatin formation and regulating structural features of the chromosomes, such as the telomeres and centromeres. Other noncoding regions serve as origins of DNA replication. Finally several regions are transcribed into functional noncoding RNA that regulate the expression of protein-coding genes (for example [...] ), mRNA translation and stability (see miRNA), chromatin structure (including histone modifications, for example [...] ), DNA methylation (for example [...] ), <b>DNA</b> <b>recombination</b> (for example [...] ), and cross-regulate other noncoding RNAs (for example [...] ). It is also likely that many transcribed noncoding regions do not serve any role and that this transcription {{is the product of}} non-specific RNA Polymerase activity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{formation}} of a bivalent occurs during the first division of meiosis (in the pachynema stage of meiotic prophase 1). In most organisms, each replicated chromosome (composed of two identical sister chromatids) elicits {{formation of}} DNA double-strand breaks during the leptotene phase. These breaks are repaired by homologous recombination, that uses the homologous chromosome as a template for repair. The search for the homologous target, helped by numerous proteins collectively referred as the synaptonemal complex, cause the two homologs to pair, between the leptotene and the pachytene phases of meiosis I. Resolution of the <b>DNA</b> <b>recombination</b> intermediate into a crossover exchanges DNA segments between the two homologous chromosomes at a site called a [...] This physical strand exchange and the cohesion between the sister chromatids along each chromosome ensure robust pairing of the homologs in diplotene phase. The structure, visible by microscopy, is called a bivalent.|$|E

40|$|Organisms {{must have}} {{efficient}} mechanisms of <b>DNA</b> repair and <b>recombination</b> to prevent alterations in their genetic information due to DNA damage. There is evidence for <b>DNA</b> repair and <b>recombination</b> in plastids of higher plants, although {{very little is}} known at the biochemical level. Many chloroplast proteins are of eubacterial ancestry, suggesting that {{the same could be}} true for the components of a <b>DNA</b> repair and <b>recombination</b> system. A 39 -kD protein, immunologically related to Escherichia coli RecA, is present in chloroplasts of pea (Pisum sativum L.). Bandshift gel assays suggest that it binds single-stranded DNA. Its steady-state level is increased by several DNA-damaging agents. These results are consistent with it being a plastid homolog of E. coli RecA protein, presumably involved in <b>DNA</b> repair and <b>recombination,</b> and with the existence of an SOS-like response in pea leaf cells. Experiments with protein synthesis inhibitors suggest that the 39 -kD chloroplast protein is encoded in the nucleus.
