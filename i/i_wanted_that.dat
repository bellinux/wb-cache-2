500|$|Koen found {{inspiration}} from {{her interest in}} the eighteenth century. Rather than use the [...] "virginity-sexual tango" [...] trope of most historical romance novels, Koen sought to circumvent the [...] "rules" [...] of the genre and concentrate on characterization. Koen engaged in an intensive research period on the eighteenth century using approximately 300 books, which she often obtained from a local university's library. She also traveled briefly to England and France. Koen found writing the novel to be [...] "a very intense thing" [...] and became very attached to her characters, even the villains. She sought to [...] "hook the readers emotionally and make them care. I guess it's soap opera (but) there's a kind of sigh you heave when you finish {{a certain type of}} book. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> sigh." [...] She added: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} substantial criticism for its strong violence and language. One scene that viewers found particularly unnerving was the ear-cutting scene; Madsen himself reportedly had great difficulty finishing it, especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea [...] "I've {{got a little}} kid at home." [...] Many people walked out during the film. During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including horror film director Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a [...] "compliment" [...] and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented {{about it at the}} time: [...] "It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> scene to be disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. [...] "I realized how direct and honest those records were – and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> here", said Chris.|$|E

500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the evening, {{at around}} 6 or 7pm, Dan and Joe kidnapped and handcuffed Anton Weekes, a German-Australian market {{gardener}} who lived nearby, reassuring {{him that he}} would not be hurt if he obeyed. They pushed him to the Sherritts' back door and Joe asked Weekes to knock, which he did. Sherritts' young wife asked: [...] "Who is there?", repeated by Sherritt. Prompted by Joe, Weekes replied: [...] "It is me, I have lost my way", to which Sherritt's wife opened the door. Aaron stood framed in the doorway and joked with his German neighbor. [...] "You must be drunk, Anton. You know that it's over that way", he laughed. As Sherritt raised his arm to point the way for Weekes, he almost immediately afterwards made a movement backwards and said, [...] "Who's that?". Two shots were then fired into the house and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the left side of the neck, severing his jugular. One of the shots narrowly missed Sherritt's wife. Byrne followed him in and fired again, hitting him in the chest, and Sherritt collapsed. Sherritt died within a few minutes without another saying a word. His mother-in-law, Ellen Barry, testified to the commission that at this point she knelt down by her son-in-law's head, and Byrne called her by her name (they were well acquainted, Ellen Barry had been a particular friend of Byrne's mother) and threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they did not reveal who was in the bedroom. She asked to go outside and when she did, Byrne took off Weekes' handcuffs, telling her [...] "I am satisfied now, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> fellow." [...] Ellen Barry said that she responded [...] "Well, Joe, I never heard Aaron say anything against you." [...] And he replied [...] "He would do me harm if he could; he did his best." ...|$|E
