50|$|<b>Iridodialysis,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a coredialysis, is a localized separation or tearing away of the iris from its attachment to the ciliary body.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{complications}} {{are known}} to occur following eye injury: corneal scarring, hyphema, <b>iridodialysis,</b> post-traumatic glaucoma, uveitis cataract, vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. The complications risk is high with retinal tears, penetrating injuries and severe blunt trauma.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, corneal {{tattooing}} {{is performed}} when it might improve eyesight. According to Dr. Samuel Lewis Ziegler, indications for treatment include albinism, aniridia, coloboma, <b>iridodialysis,</b> keratoconus, or diffused nebulae of the cornea. Corneal tattooing is also performed on patients who still have vision to reduce symptomatic glare associated with large iridectomies or traumatic iris loss.|$|E
50|$|Iridodialyses {{are usually}} caused by blunt {{trauma to the}} eye, but may also be caused by {{penetrating}} eye injuries. An <b>iridodialysis</b> may be an iatrogenic complication of any intraocular surgery and at one time they were created intentionally as part of intracapsular cataract extraction.Iridodialyses {{have been reported to}} have occurred from boxing, airbag deployments, high-pressure water jets, elastic bungee cords, bottle caps opened under pressure, water balloons, fireworks, and various types of balls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iridodialysis</b> {{causing an}} {{associated}} hyphema {{has to be}} carefully managed, and recurrent bleeds should be prevented by strict avoidance of all sporting activities. Management typically involves observation and bed rest. Red blood cells may decrease the outflow of aqueous humor, therefore the eye pressure should be kept low by giving oral acetazolamide(a diuretic given to reduce intraoccular pressure). Accidental trauma during sleep should be prevented by patching with an eye shield during night time. Avoid giving aspirin, heparin/warfarin and observe daily for resolution or progression. A large hyphema may require careful anterior chamber washout. Rebleeds may require additional intervention and therapy.|$|E
40|$|Mohamed Omar Yousif Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt Abstract: Managing large <b>iridodialysis</b> {{that may}} occur during {{phacoemulsification}} is challenging. I describe how a procedure to reposit a prolapsed iris while the anterior chamber is markedly inflated by a current of infusion fluid may inadvertently lead to large <b>iridodialysis,</b> and discuss how to avoid such a complication. I describe a fast and efficient technique for managing large <b>iridodialysis</b> both immediately, once it occurs, or as a secondary maneuver. My technique involved fixing the iris periphery back to its root at the anterior chamber angle using 10 - 0 polypropylene suture with two straight needles introduced directly through the cornea at distant points, and an insulin syringe as a guide track to a point 1. 5  mm from the limbus {{at the base of}} a triangular scleral flap that was designed to be centered on the area of <b>iridodialysis.</b> I confirmed the simplicity, efficacy, and safety of my technique through a 1 -year follow-up period.

40|$|BACKGROUND Ultrasound {{biomicroscopy}} (UBM) is a {{non-invasive procedure}} to visualise {{the structures of}} the anterior segment using high frequency ultrasound. Any abnormalities in the structures like the iris, ciliary body and zonules can be easily detected. In case of corneal oedema, the Descemet’s membrane can be detected with UBM than the slit-lamp biomicroscopy. It plays a useful diagnostic tool in glaucoma. It differentiates between open and closed angle closure. It also helps in the diagnosis of plateau iris configuration and malignant glaucoma. Bleb status and tenon’s cyst can be visualized by the UBM. It {{plays a major role}} to rule out angle recession or cyclodialysis cleft in cases of trauma. Zonular dialysis and <b>iridodialysis</b> as well as the integrity of the posterior capsule can be assessed with UBM. It is the only modality which can easily diagnose pars plannits or cyclitic membranes noninvasively. In cases of unexplained hypotony, it helps to diagnose ciliary body atrophy or traction on the ciliary body. This article is a short overview describing the indications and uses of anterior segment pathologies...|$|E
40|$|AIM Ocular {{injuries}} {{are common in}} all age groups, be it from blunt trauma like cricket ball, bat, etc or penetrating injury from pen, pencil or stick with cataract being the most common complication. Other complications like corneal perforation with or without iris prolapse, total hyphema, lens subluxation with or without posterior capsular rupture, <b>iridodialysis,</b> uveitis, vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, etc. may occur. The aim {{of the study was}} to find out the various causes of traumatic cataract and associated socio-demographic profile in western Odisha, in a single tertiary care centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective study was conducted on 76 patients who had traumatic cataract and were admitted to VSS Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, Odisha from March 2014 to March 2016, a total period of 2 years. Data related to the type of injury, duration of presentation, age, sex, occupation and initial visual acuity were taken. B-scans were done for all cases. X-ray and CT scans were done wherever required. RESULTS Traumatic injuries were most common in children and young adults. 27 cases (35. 52...|$|E
40|$|THE {{delicate}} {{tissue of}} the iris is atrophied {{in a number}} of conditions, such as chronic iridocyclitis, chronic glaucoma, <b>iridodialysis,</b> adherent leucoma, xeroderma pigment-osum, essential progressive atrophy of the iris, and in old age. The iris is bleached out and appears grey or greyish-white. The delicate markings on the anterior surface disappear and the blood vessels are dilated. Pupillary margin is thinned out with diminished reaction, and the iris tissue becomes fragile. However, the picture differs considerably, depending on the cause, and in some cases white circular patches of uniform size appear; this condition is called vitiligo iridis. Vitiligo iridis commonly results from variola infection (smallpox) and is due to circumscribed effacing of the iris pigment, resulting in rounded white spots on its anterior surface. Xeroderma pigmentosum may also give rise to a similar appear-ance (Fuchs, 1923). Loewenstein and Foster (1945) also observed this condition in patients affected by smallpox. Kriuckman described this condition in tuberculous iridocyclitis, and Roelofs found it after an attack of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (se...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the utility and safety of a mobile eye surgical unit (MESU) in providing quality cataract surgery for the indigent rural population with poor access to quality eye care. Materials and Methods: Two buses connected by a vestibule were built to meet the requirements for a self-sufficient operation theater (OT). In every camp, safe transportation of units, good alignment of buses, safe water, and maintenance of sterile environment were achieved with optimal utilization of OT. Results: Two thousand and twenty-one patients in 21 remote locations underwent cataract surgery in MESU between 2012 and 2015. Visual outcome was 6 / 9 or better in 79. 3 %, posterior capsular rupture in 0. 91 %, zonulardialysis in 0. 3 %, aphakia in 0. 2 %, <b>iridodialysis</b> in 0. 2 %, and there was no incidence of endophthalmitis.

40|$|Background: The weak zonule’s {{predisposition}} to complications during conventional cataract surgery {{is one of}} the common risk factor for poor visual acuity after surgery. The present study was conducted to determine the frequency and types of complications during cataract surgery in patients with Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome. Methods: A cross sectional descriptive study based on non probability sampling of patients having pseudoexfoliation syndrome admitted for cataract surgery in tertiary care hospitals was carried out spread over 4 years. The data of all variables of interest were entered and analyzed through SPSS version 15. 0. Results: A total of 200 eyes of 122 patients having Psuedoexfoliation were included in the study. Vitreal prolapse in 21 (10. 5 %) and posterior capsular rupture in 18 (9 %) patients were the most common complications seen in Pseudoexfoliation. Damage to sphincter pupillae in 16 (8 %), <b>iridodialysis</b> in 2 (1 %), decentration of IOL in 8 (4 %) and hyphaema in 2 (1 %) patients was seen.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{retrospectively}} evaluate the effect of cataract surgery on visual acuity (VA) and daily living acti-vities in participants aged over 80 years. METHODS: For eighty-three eyes from eighty three eligible patients aged 80 or above who had undergone cataract surgery between 2000 and 2005, preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), satisfaction score for daily living activities, surgical complications, and retinal pathologies affecting vision were recorded from the patient’s file. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 86. 80 ± 5. 24 years (range, 80 - 98). VA improved in the operated eye for patients aged 80 to 89 and for those over 90 years. Postoperative VA of 0. 5 or better was more frequently observed in those aged 80 to 89 than in those aged over 90 years (90. 6 % and 73. 4 %, respectively). Mean posto-perative scores for the daily living activities scale were significantly better in both groups as compared to preoperative levels, and were better in the 80 to 89 -year age group than for those older than 90. Intraoperative posterior capsule perforation occurred in two participants, cystoid macular edema in one, <b>iridodialysis</b> in one and postoperative refractory stromal edema occurred in one case.

40|$|Aims: To {{report the}} {{technique}} and outcomes of sutureless manual cataract extraction via a subconjunctival limbus oblique incision for mature cataracts. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study comprised of 112 eyes of 83 patients with mature cataract who all had manual cataract extraction via a subconjunctival limbus oblique incision. A transconjunctival tunnel is fashioned with a 3. 0 mm keratome, 0. 5 mm behind the limbal vascular arcades. A limbal tunnel, with a transverse extent of 9 mm in the cornea and 7. 0 mm in the limbus, is created beneath the conjunctival/Tenon′s tissue using an angled bevel-up crescent blade. Outcome measures included visual acuity, intraoperative complications, surgically induced astigmatism, endothelial cell loss rate and surgery time. Results: Self-sealing wound was achieved in 112 eyes (98. 2 %). The nucleus was delivered in whole in 108 eyes (96. 4 %). Intraoperative complications included hyphema in 3 eyes (2. 7 %), <b>iridodialysis</b> in 2 eyes 1. 8 %), posterior capsular rupture and zonular dialysis in 2 eyes (1. 8 %).

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{analyze the}} {{anatomic}} and functional consequences of wine-cork {{injury to the}} eye {{in relation to the}} patient's age and them type of cork and wine. METHODS. We retrospectively studied 13 patients, six Women and seven men, presenting to our department with-bottle-cork injury to the eye between January 1999 and June 2001. RESULTS. All patients presented with closed-globe injury according to Kuhn et al's classification. All the cases were injured by bottle corks from sparkling wine: white in ten cases and red in three. Mean visual acuity at admission was 201100 (range, hand motion to 20120). The most frequent early injury was anterior chamber hyphema (84. 6 %), followed by corneal injury (62. 2 %), ocular hypertension (46. 1 %), lens subluxation (30. 8 %), traumatic cataract (23. 1 %), and post-traumatic retinal edema (23. 1 %). Mean final visual acuity was 20125; the follow-up ranged from 3 to 29 months, averaging 16. 1 months. Late complications were as follows: pupil motility anomalies (38. 5 %), traumatic cataract (30. 8 %), <b>iridodialysis</b> (15. 4 %), traumatic optic neuropathy (7. 7 %), post-traumatic glaucoma (7. 7 %), and traumatic maculopathy (15. 4 %). Surgical treatment was necessary in two cases (15. 4 %). CONCLUSIONS. Bottle-cork eye injuries account for 10. 8 % of post-traumatic hospital admissions to our department. Most of them are due to sparkling white wine served at room temperature. There is no correlation between ocular injury and the eye-bottle distance or the type of cork...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the causes, associated ocular findings and visual acuity on presentation, complications and visual outcome following treatment in patients of hyphema due to blunt injury METHODS: A retrospective study {{was performed in}} 118 patients with hyphema due to blunt injury admitted in University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The gender, age, race, cause of blunt injury resulting in hyphema, eye involved, vision at admission, other associated ophthalmological findings, complications and visual outcome were noted from the case records of patients. The {{data were analyzed using}} SPSS programme. RESULTS: Males were more predominantly affected (93. 2 %). Two-thirds of patients (67. 8 %) were aged below 30 years. Sports related injury (38. 1 %) was the most common cause for hyphema. Hyphema disappeared within 5 days in 66. 9 % of patients. Iris injuries were very commonly associated in the form of mydriasis, sphincter tear and <b>iridodialysis.</b> Associated vitreous haemorrhage was noted in 11. 9 % of patients. During the hospital stay, secondary haemorrhage was observed in 3. 4 % of patients. The best corrected vision of 6 / 18 or better was noted in 85. 4 % of patients at the last follow-up. The follow-up of these subjects was very poor and thus the incidence of secondary glaucoma could not be established. Moderate blood staining of cornea occurred in 0. 8 % of patients. CONCLUSION: Sports related injury is {{the most common cause of}} hyphema in Malaysia. Good visual recovery, without serious complications, is possible with appropriate and in-time treatment in hyphema patients due to blunt injury...|$|E
40|$|Twelve eyes of 12 {{patients}} with refractory glaucoma {{were treated with}} internal sclerostomy using laser ablation of dyed sclera. The technique involves iontophoretic impregnation of the sclera at the limbal region with 1 % methylene blue and subsequent delivery of a pulsed dye laser beam to the stained area through a goniolens. The red wavelength of 664 nm generated by the laser is maximally absorbed by the stained sclera and creates a through and through sclerostomy. Successful complete sclerostomy was achieved in seven eyes (58. 3 %) but there was some reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in all cases. Mean prelaser IOP (of all 12 eyes) was 36. 6 mm Hg and 1 hour after therapy it was reduced to 20. 0 mm Hg. At {{the end of the}} follow-up period (mean 16 months) the mean IOP was 23. 7 mm Hg; five eyes (41 %) maintained their IOP below 22 mm Hg, and the average number of medications per eye came down from 3. 25 to 2. 25 per eye. Transient corneal burns with Descemet's membrane folds adjacent to the laser impact zone were detected in eight eyes (67 %). No major complications like IOP spike, hyphaema, <b>iridodialysis,</b> or retinal detachment have been detected. Clear cornea and dark blue scleral staining are essential for the mechanical success of this procedure. Gonioscopic laser internal sclerostomy of methylene blue dyed sclera is technically feasible and the preliminary results of IOP control in refractory glaucoma are promising. Modifications of the iontophoresis process and laser parameters are currently under investigation in order to improve these results...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} {{effects of the}} small incision non phacoemusification cataract surgery in 462 Sudanese cataract cases(536 eyes). METHODS:From September 2013 to August 2015, we analyzed the 462 Sudanese cataract cases(536 eyes) performed cataract surgery by {{the way of the}} small incision non phacoemusification with intraocular lens(IOL) implantation and summarized the intraoperative and postoperative complications, the eyesight and intraocular pressure(IOP) of the eyes in 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo after operation. RESULTS: Intraoperative complications: posterior capsular ruptured and vitreous prolapsed in 18 eyes(3. 4 %), iris prolapsed in 10 eyes(1. 9 %), suspensory ligament of the lens ruptured in 7 eyes(1. 3 %), not implanted IOL in 5 eyes(0. 9 %), descent's membrane detachment in 3 eyes(0. 6 %), <b>iridodialysis</b> in 1 eye(0. 2 %). Postoperative complications: corneal edema in 47 eyes(8. 8 %), anterior chamber inflammatory reaction in 32 eyes(6. 0 %), pupil oval or slightly upward in 12 eyes(2. 2 %), the upper iris incarcerated in the tunnel incision in 3 eyes(0. 6 %),hyphema in 2 eyes(0. 4 %), infective endophthalmitis in 1 eye(0. 2 %).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS) in cases of white cataract {{with the use of}} trypan blue as an adjunct for performing continuous curvilinear capsulorthexis (CCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study on 100 consecutive eyes of 100 patients with white cataract who had undergone MSICS with trypan blue assisted CCC. The nucleus was prolapsed into anterior chamber by using a sinskey hook and extracted out of the eye using irrigating vectis. Intraoperative and postoperative findings (according to OCTET classification) as well as postoperative visual outcomes were used as main measures to report {{the safety and}} efficacy of the surgery. RESULTS: Of the 100 eyes, 16 had intumescent, 67 had mature and 17 had hypermature cataract. Intraoperatively CCC was incomplete in 4 eyes (4 &#x 0025;) and had to be converted to canopener capsulotomy. None of the eyes had posterior capsular rupture or zonular dialysis and no eyes were converted to conventional Extra Capsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE). Postoperatively, 6 eyes (6 &#x 0025;) developed corneal oedema with > 10 Descemets folds and 7 eyes (7 &#x 0025;) had corneal oedema with < 10 Descemets folds. Mild iritis was seen in 6 eyes (6 &#x 0025;) and moderate iritis with fibrin membrane was seen in 3 eyes (3 &#x 0025;). <b>Iridodialysis</b> was observed in 1 eye (1 &#x 0025;).

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical effect of vitrectomy combined with cyclodialysis repair on primary stage for complicated ocular trauma with cyclodialysis. METHODS: The 13 consecutive cases(13 eyes) of complicated ocular trauma with cyclodialysis from January 1, 2011 to October 31, 2014, were treated and studied, including 2 contusions, 7 penetrating injuries and 4 rupture injuries. The concomitant symptoms were corneal laceration, limbus laceration, scleral laceration, hyphema, <b>iridodialysis,</b> mydriasis, traumatic cataract or lens dislocation, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal contusion, retinal detachment, choroid contusion, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, intraocular foreign body, etc. The preoperative visual acuity(VA) ranged from light perception(LP) to hand movement(HM) or before eye(BE). The cyclodialysis {{was determined by}} ultrasound bio-microscopy(UBM), three-mirror contact lens or was found in operation. The limits of cyclodialysis were about 2 : 00 ～ 6 : 00 o'clock. Intraocular pressures(IOP) of contusion eyes before surgeries were 5. 4 mmHg and 10. 2 mmHg. The operation opportunity was 6 h～ 3 d after injuries and the main operation stages included closing wound in cornea and sclera, vitrectomy, lensectomy, and/or removal of intraocular blood, retinal reattachment, cyclodialysis repair by suturing. The external scleral puncture and draining were carried out in suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Inert gas or silicon oil was tamponaded. RESULTS: The ciliary body reattached in all cases determined by UBM and three-mirror contact lens. The BCVA was improved to HM/BE～ 4. 7 and the IOP was 9. 8 ～ 24. 5 mmHg at 1 mo after surgeries, except that one eye was corneal edema after corneal laceration sutura. Retinal reattachment was determined by ultrasound or ophthalmoscope examination.

Methods: Medical records of 22 patients who underwent exoresection for uveal tumors between February 1999 and January 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Exoresection was considered for tumors with their epicenter in the iris or in the ciliary body. Results: Twenty-two patients {{with a mean age}} of 45. 9 years (range: 19 &ndash; 72 years) were included in this study. The histopathologic diagnosis was uveal malignant melanoma in 16 patients, iridociliary nevus in 2 patients, iris nevus in 2 patients, and iridociliary melanocytoma in 2 patients. Postoperative complications included cataract in 11 patients (50 %), scleral thinning in 4 patients (18 %), vitreous hemorrhage in 2 patients (9 %), hyphema in 2 patients (9 %), secondary glaucoma in 2 patients (9 %), <b>iridodialysis</b> in 1 patient (4. 5 %), bullous keratopathy in 1 patient (4. 5 %), and posterior synechiae in 1 patient (4. 5 %). At a mean follow-up of 40. 1 months (range: 1 &ndash; 98 months), there were no recurrences or metastatic events. Conclusions: Exoresection seems to be an effective treatment option in selected cases of iridociliary and ciliary body tumors.

40|$|AIM:To {{describe}} and evaluate a new ophthalmic endoscope surgical technique combined with phacoemulsification andintraocular lens (IOL) implantation to treat goniosynechialysis and manage primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). METHODS:Endoscope-assisted goniosynechialysis combined with phacoemulsification andIOL implantation {{was performed in}} 32 eyes of 29 patients with PACG. Regular follow-up was performed 1 week and 1 month, 3, and 6 months after surgery to assess complications, intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber depth, visual acuity, and anterior chamber angle. RESULTS:Preoperative mean IOP was 24. 88 ± 7. 22 mmHg with pharmacological treatment, and was 13. 70 ± 4. 02, 13. 06 ± 3. 74, 14. 29 ± 4. 70, and 14. 33 ± 5. 01 mmHg 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery, respectively. The postoperative decrease in IOP was significant (P< 0. 05). The rate for all eyes with IOP of 21 mmHg or less was 93. 8 % (30 eyes) at the final visit without ocular hypotensive agents. The average preoperative anterior chamber depth was 1. 60 ± 0. 64 mm, and this value significantly increased to 2. 72 ± 0. 62, 2. 76 ± 0. 70, 2. 73 ± 0. 68, and 2. 74 ± 0. 71 mm at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. Visual acuity was improved in 28 eyes (87. 5 %) at 6 months postoperatively. The anterior chamber angle had increased in 25 eyes (78. 1 %) at the final visit; it was adhesive 90 °- 180 ° in 6 eyes, 180 °- 270 ° in only 1 eye. Two eyes exhibited minimal hyphema in the early postoperative period, but it could gradually be absorbed. Fibrinous reaction was observed in five eyes and spontaneously disappeared within 7 days. No shallow anterior chamber, <b>iridodialysis,</b> choroidal detachment, or malignant glaucoma was found in any eyes. CONCLUSION:Endoscope-assisted goniosynechialysis combined with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation to manage PACG has several advantages, including optimized visualization, greater accuracy, and improved safety.

Patient’s age, gender, duration of hospitalization, type of treatment and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall 92 patients with ocular injuries caused by airsoft gun pellets were hospitalized in tenyear period. In all patients only one eye was injured and there were 72 (78. 3 %) male patients. Injuries involved ocular adnexa, anterior and posterior segment of the eye. On initial examination 41 (44. 6 %) patients were presented with subconjunctival hemorrhages, 42 (45. 6 %) with corneal abrasion, 42 (45. 6 %) patients had corneal edema, 6 (6. 5 %) had traumatic mydriasis, 90 (97. 8 %) patients exhibited hyphema, 10 (10. 9 %) <b>iridodialysis,</b> in 27 (29. 3 %) patients high intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured, one patient had subluxation of intraocular lens (IOL) and one patient had traumatic cataract. Posterior segment findings included vitreous hemorrhage in 3 (3. 3 %) patients, retinal hemorrhage in 15 (16. 3 %) patients, retinal edema in 35 (38. 0 %) patients and one patient had globe rupture. Average duration of hospitalization was 5. 7 days (range from 1 to 18 days). Three patients (3. 3 %) required eye surgery, eight patients (8. 7 %) had anterior chamber washout while rest of the patients were conservatively managed. Visual acuity at hospital release was significantly improved comparing to initial visual acuity, ranging from counting fingers at 1 meter to 20 / 60 in 7 (8. 6 %) patients, from 20 / 50 to 20 / 30 in 13 (16. 0 %) patients and from 20 / 25 to 20 / 20 in 61 (75. 3 %) patients. In 11 patients testing the visual acuity was not possible because of their young age. CONCLUSION: Injuries attributed to airsoft guns were confined mostly to anterior segment. There was also high percentage of severe posterior segment trauma requiring hospital admission. The most important factors in preventing such injuries are restricting access to airsoft guns, especially to minors, as well as mandatory use of protective equipment such as protective eyeglasses...|$|E
