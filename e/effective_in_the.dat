40|$|ABSTRACT: Of the {{fourteen}} fungicides of different groups evaluated in-vitro against Rhizoctonia solani, Metalaxyl (0. 1 %), Mancozeb (0. 1 %), Tricyclazole (0. 1 %), Thiophenate methyl (0. 1 %), Carbendizm+ Mancozeb (0. 1 %) were {{proved to be}} most <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> inhibiting <b>the</b> growth of the fungus.

5|$|The new ball rule {{also meant}} that spin bowling was less <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tests, so Australia only used one {{full-time}} spinner in the Tests, off spinner Johnson, until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring. Together they took only eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's bowling method {{relied on}} {{accuracy}} and conceding few runs; {{several of his}} best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed {{that he was no}} longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E

5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to be most <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Peel {{made his}} Test debut and played all five matches. His first Test began on 12 December 1884.

He was less <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining games, ending the series with 21 wickets {{at an average of}} 21.47, and scored 37 runs at an average of 7.40. He was not selected in the next Test matches played by England, against Australia in 1886, and missed the next English tour of Australia, in the winter of 1886–87, again organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E
5|$|In early 1872, Macdonald {{submitted}} the treaty for ratification, and {{it passed the}} Commons with a majority of 66. The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, {{for the most part}}, on one day). Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the secret ballot would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8.

5|$|In the 1996–1997 NBA season, Rodman won {{his sixth}} {{rebounding}} title {{in a row}} with 16.7boards per game, along with 5.7points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up. However, he made more headlines for his notorious behavior. On January 15, 1997, {{he was involved in}} an incident during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos, Rodman kicked Amos in the groin. Though he was not assessed a technical foul at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000settlement, and the league suspended Rodman for 11games without pay. Thus, he effectively lost $1 million. Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, Rodman was not as <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1997 NBA Playoffs, in which the Bulls reached the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. He struggled to slow down Jazz power forward Karl Malone, but did his share to complete the six-game Bulls victory.|$|E

He accepted the latter post reluctantly, fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing.
