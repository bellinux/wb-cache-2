50|$|However, {{since the}} <b>inductive</b> <b>impedance</b> {{increases}} proportionally with frequency, {{so does the}} EMF, so the current tends to a limit when the resistance is small relative to the <b>inductive</b> <b>impedance.</b> This also limits the lift force.

However there are also eddy currents due to the finite size of conductors used in the coils, and these continue to grow with frequency.|$|E
40|$|A ladder {{oscillator}} {{composed of}} capacitive and <b>inductive</b> <b>impedances</b> connected {{together to form}} a ladder network which has a chosen number N oscillation modes at N different frequencies. Each oscillation mode is characterized by a unique standing wave voltage pattern along the nodes of the ladder oscillator, with the mode in which the ladder oscillator is oscillating being determinable from the amplitudes or phase of the oscillations at the nodes. A logic circuit may be connected to the nodes of the oscillator to compare the phases of selected nodes and thereby determine which mode the oscillator is oscillating in. A ladder oscillator composed of passive capacitive and <b>inductive</b> <b>impedances</b> can be utilized as a frequency recognition device, since the passive ladder oscillator will display the characteristic standing wave patterns if an input signal impressed upon the ladder oscillator is close to one of the mode frequencies of the oscillator. A CL ladder oscillator having series capacitive <b>impedances</b> and shunt <b>inductive</b> <b>impedances</b> can exhibit sustained and autonomous oscillations if active nonlinear devices are connected in parallel with the shunt <b>inductive</b> <b>impedances.</b> The active CL ladder oscillator can be synchronized to input frequencies impressed upon the oscillator, and will continue to oscillate after the input signal has been removed at a mode frequency which is, in general, nearest to the input signal frequency.

The effect of the nonideal characteristics of the operational amplifier such as finite frequencydependent gain and output impedance on the performance of the negative impedances is analyzed. Detailed equivalent circuits showing the additional positive or negative <b>inductive</b> <b>impedances</b> due to the nonideal characteristics are given for negative resistance and negative capacitance realizations, and their relative performances are compared. The experimental results confirm the validity of the equivalent circuits. The effect of the slew rate of the operational amplifier on the maximum signal-handling capability (SHC) of the negative impedances at high frequencies is studied. Practical design considerations for achieving wider bandwidth as well as improved SHC are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the field}} and {{potentials}} are out of phase, both attractive and repulsive forces are produced, {{and it might be}} expected that no net lift would be generated. However, although the EMF is at 90 degrees to the applied magnetic field, the loop inevitably has inductance. This <b>inductive</b> <b>impedance</b> tends to delay the peak current, by a phase angle dependent on the frequency (since the <b>inductive</b> <b>impedance</b> of any loop increases with frequency).|$|E
50|$|Thus at low frequencies, {{the phases}} are largely {{orthogonal}} {{and the current}}s lower, and no significant lift is generated. But at sufficiently high frequency, the <b>inductive</b> <b>impedance</b> dominates and the current and the applied field are virtually in line, and this current generates a magnetic field that is opposed to the applied one, and this permits levitation.|$|E

50|$|If {{the burden}} {{resistance}} {{is much less}} than <b>inductive</b> <b>impedance</b> of the secondary winding at the measurement frequency then the current in the secondary tracks the primary current and the transformer provides a current output that {{is proportional to the}} measured current. On the other hand, if that condition is not true, then the transformer is inductive and gives a differential output. The Rogowski coil uses this effect and requires an external integrator in order to provide a voltage output that is proportional to the measured current.|$|E
5000|$|When neodymium-iron-boron {{permanent}} magnets are used, levitation is achieved at low speeds. The test model levitated at speeds above 22 mph, but Richard Post believes that, on real tracks, levitation {{could be achieved}} at [...] "as little as 1 to 2 mph". [...] Below the transition speed the magnetic drag increases with vehicle speed; above the transition speed, the magnetic drag decreases with speed. [...] For example, at 500 km/h the lift to drag ratio is 200:1, far higher than any aircraft but much lower than classic steel on steel rail which reaches 1000:1 (rolling resistance). This occurs because the <b>inductive</b> <b>impedance</b> increases proportionately with speed which compensates for the faster rate of change of the field seen by the coils, thus giving a constant current flow and power consumption for the levitation.|$|E

The <b>inductive</b> source <b>impedance</b> inherent {{in this type of}} transducer makes it less linear than other forms of pickups, such as piezo-electric or optical.

Generally, “vibration energy” could be converted into electrical energy by three techniques: electrostatic charge, magnetic fields and piezoelectric.
