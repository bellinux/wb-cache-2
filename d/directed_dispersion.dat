40|$|Toxicological {{testing of}} {{nanomaterials}} often involves {{in vitro studies}} of nanoscale powders, which, therefore, need to be dispersed. Various dispersion approaches have been described in the literature, with the main differences between them being the sonication method, the medium, and the additives used. In the present study, five dispersion approaches were compared using titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Aeroxide TiO 2 P 25). Three of the selected approaches were two- or multi-step processes consisting of dispersion in water followed by transfer to cell culture media, while the two other procedures include only the dispersion in water or in media. One approach was based on bath sonication, whereas the others used direct sonication through insertion of a probe into the sample. The main finding arising out of the comparison of the <b>direct</b> <b>dispersion</b> methods was that the specific energy input {{played a crucial role}} in determining the achievable particle size (133 - 182 nm). A low volume of liquid and a relatively low power in conjunction with a long pulsed dispersion time were found to be favorable for minimizing the side effects of ultrasonication like radical formation or material degradation. The resulting size in the cell culture media showed a strong dependence on the dilution method. Predilution with water before addition to the media prevented the agglomeration of the TiO 2 particles under physiological conditions. <b>Direct</b> <b>dispersion</b> in media resulted in the smallest dispersible size.

For pABA, both the canonical (pABA-c) and zwitterionic (pABA-z) forms have been investigated. Owing to strongly distinct charge distributions, the two forms of pABA enable us to mimic different interaction modes with Bz. In this work, we assessed the performances of dispersion-corrected DFT methods, {{as well as of}} long-range corrected exchange-correlation functionals. It follows from the SAPT analysis that both the structure and the interaction energy of the first complex (pABA-c center dot center dot center dot Bz) is mainly controlled by dispersion interactions whereas, in the second complex (pABA-z center dot center dot center dot Bz), electrostatic and induction forces play also an important role.

Rotor diameter, stator inner diameter, and minimum free area of RDC were modified to achieve maximum contact between dispersed liquid phase and gas feed phase, which was necessary to achieve maximum mass transfer. The problem of rupture of the emulsion droplet due to pressure created by <b>direct</b> <b>dispersion</b> of gas {{at the bottom of}} conventional RDC extraction system was addressed by adding an impeller at the bottom compartment of RDC. The impeller provided continuous mixing of emulsion and a gas sparger was fitted along the impeller's side that maintained the dispersed aqueous phase miscible in system. The hydrodynamic behavior of a modified RDC was optimized for CO 2 absorption from natural gas in ELM, which indicated that modified design dimensions can provide a maximum liquid-gas contact. Beside the concentration of CO 2 in natural gas feed, it was observed that the speed of RDC and run time significantly influence CO 2 absorption from natural gas using ELM. When all the parameters optimized for CO 2 absorption from natural gas feed this study is useful in extending the application of RDC in liquid-gas system.

40|$|A molecular-statistical {{theory for}} the entire {{sequence}} of the chiral tilted smectic phases is derived. Uniaxial and biaxial subphases {{were found to be}} stable in different temperature ranges depending on the molecular parameters. The model of a chiral molecule possessing a strong transverse terminal dipole moment and a quadrupole moment located in the molecular core was used. <b>Direct</b> <b>dispersion</b> and electrostatic interactions modulated by shape between molecules located in the same or in the neighboring smectic layers are taken into account. An effective long-range interaction arises after the minimization of the free energy with respect to polarization vectors. If the molecular quadrupole moment is small, only uniaxial phases with different periodicities arise. Their periodicity may be tens and hundreds of layers Sm-C*, or approximately two layers Sm-CA *, or several layers Sm-C *. In the presence of the nonpolar biaxial ordering in addition to polarization there is a cap-shaped border in the phase diagram that separates Sm-CA *, Sm-C*, and Sm-C *. If the molecules are nonchiral, Sm-CA, Sm-C, and the de Vries?s phases arise instead of the three phases mentioned above. If the molecular quadrupole moment is large, the left ?arm? of the border breaks into two lines, and a sequence of biaxial subphases arises in the area between these two lines. Among these biaxial subphases, the one with periodicity of three smectic layers appears to be the broadest in the temperature range. In addition, the subphases with different periodicities were found to be stable in narrow temperature ranges. The long helical rotation in every biaxial subphase is calculated. It is found to change sign between the three-layer subphase and Sm-C*, and may diverge in the four-layer subphase if it arises.

Array beamforming analysis of the ambient noise data shows that ambient noise sources are unevenly distributed and the most energetic ambient noise mainly comes from azimuths of 40 °– 70 °. As {{a consequence of the}} strong directional noise sources, surface wave components of the cross-correlations at 1 – 5 Hz show clearly azimuthal dependence, and <b>direct</b> <b>dispersion</b> measurements from cross-correlations are strongly biased by the dominant noise energy. This bias renders that the dispersion measurements from cross-correlations do not accurately reflect the interstation velocities of surface waves propagating directly from one station to the other, that is, the cross-correlation functions do not retrieve empirical Green's functions accurately. To correct the bias caused by unevenly distributed noise sources, we adopt an iterative inversion procedure. The iterative inversion procedure, based on plane-wave modeling, includes three steps: (1) surface wave tomography, (2) estimation of ambient noise energy and biases and (3) phase velocities correction. First, we use synthesized data to test the efficiency and stability of the iterative procedure for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. The testing results show that: (1) the amplitudes of phase velocity bias caused by directional noise sources are significant, reaching ∼ 2 and ∼ 10 per cent for homogeneous and heterogeneous media, respectively; (2) phase velocity bias can be corrected by the iterative inversion procedure and the convergence of inversion depends on the starting phase velocity map and the complexity of the media. By applying the iterative approach to the real data in Karamay, we further show that phase velocity maps converge after 10 iterations and the phase velocity maps obtained using corrected interstation dispersion measurements are more consistent with results from geology surveys than those based on uncorrected data. As ambient noise in high-frequency band (> 1 Hz) is mostly related to human activities or climate events, both of which have strong directivity, the iterative approach demonstrated here helps improve the accuracy and resolution of ANT in imaging shallow earth structures. 13 page(s...|$|R

Moreover, several processing (i. e., extrusion) parameters were varied to obtain different degrees of filler dispersion. Experimental results reveal that fracture toughness increases significantly when CB particle size is smaller and as the extent of dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix is better. Fracture toughness depends on the thermo-mechanical degradation of the polymer matrix that occurs during extrusion. In the second part of this project, creep behaviour of PE-based composites was investigated at several temperatures with assistance from the principle of time-temperature superposition. In particular, the effect of filler dimensions was analyzed by comparing viscoelastic results for composites that contain micrometric copper particles (with an average diameter of 15 and 45 μm) and nanometric carbon blacks (with an average diameter of 15 and 30 nm). In general, these fillers substantially increase the creep resistance of PE, and this phenomenon was more prominent at smaller particle size. This effect was detectable in the linear viscoelastic region (i. e. at low stresses or temperatures), and it became more evident in the non-linear viscoelastic region (i. e. at high stresses or temperatures). In particular, creep compliance and creep rate decrease at smaller particle size. It is postulated that filler particles function as physical crosslink junctions which hinder polymer chain motion and reduce creep deformation. When particle size is reduced at constant filler volume fraction, the physical crosslink density increases such that chain mobility decreases significantly under stress. Finally, the creep behaviour of PE-MWCNT composites were investigated via <b>direct</b> <b>dispersion</b> of MWCNT in the polymer matrix and by using a commercial masterbatch of MWCNT. In all cases, the increase in creep resistance is statistically significant in the linear viscoelastic region (i. e. at low stresses or temperatures) when sufficient dispersion of the nanotubes is achieved. Interestingly enough, creep resistance increases in the non-linear viscoelastic region (i. e. at high stresses or temperatures) regardless of the degree of nanotube dispersion in the matrix. This phenomenon is attributed to nanotube orientation induced by high levels of stress...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Provisional {{restorative}} {{treatment is}} an essential part of fixed prosthodontics. Incorporation of adequately constructed provisional restorations will enhance the success rate of definitive restorations. Repairing or replacing failed provisional restorations is a concern for both clinicians and patients. The objective of this investigation was to study the effects of alumina nanofibers reinforcement on the mechanical properties of commercially available provisional fixed partial denture PMMA material. The hypothesis was that the addition of alumina nanofibers to commercially available PMMA resin will significantly increase its flexural strength, fracture toughness, and microhardness. Alumina nanofibers at 0. 0 wt %, 0. 5 wt %, 1. 0 wt %, and 2. 5 wt % were added to commercially available provisional fixed partial material (Jet Tooth Shade). A quaternary ammonium acetate dispersant (CC- 59, Goldschmidt, Janesville, WI) was added to the acrylic monomer at 0. 0 wt %, 1. 0 wt %, 2. 0 wt % and 5. 0 wt % of the nanofiber weight (12 test groups, 1 control). Samples from each group were evaluated for flexural strength, flexural modulus, fracture toughness, and microhardness. The samples were tested after storing in distilled water for 24 hours and 7 days at 37 ºC. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the effects of storage time and combinations of alumina nanofiber level and quaternary ammonium acetate dispersant level on the flexural strength, fracture toughness, and microhardness of the provisional PMMA resin. Pair-wise comparisons between groups were performed using Tukey’s multiple comparisons procedure to control the overall significance level at 5 percent. Three fracture toughness samples/group were randomly selected for Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) to qualitatively evaluate the dispersion of the fibers. The data obtained from this study showed that control sample values were in the acceptance range compared with previous research. The experimental samples did not reinforce the provisional resin in the flexural strength, modulus, fracture toughness, or microhardness. There are several factors may attribute to these results, such as poor bonding at the filler/matrix interface. The more homogeneous the mixture of PMMA and fiber, the stronger the acrylic resin. In fact, the presence of poorly bonded fibers, to which little load is transferred, can be almost equivalent to voids. In addition, as seen with EDS images, alumina nanofibers had a tendency to agglomerate. The use of a magnetic stirrer was not effective in physically separating nanofibers agglomerates. <b>Direct</b> <b>dispersion</b> of alumina nanofibers in methyl methacrylate monomer and quaternary ammonium acetate dispersant was not effective in separating the nanofibers into nano-scaled single crystals. The presence of fiber agglomerates acts as a structural defect that detrimentally affects the mechanical properties. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of fibers, dispersion techniques, and coupling agents to enhance the mechanical properties of the provisional PMMA resin...|$|R
