Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 113 units of active <b>dry</b> <b>cleaner</b> units. WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) index was selected for heat stress evaluation. In order to measure the requisite parameters, WBGT meter made of Casella Company had been used according to ISO 7243. Data had been analyzed according to Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) with SPSS V. 16, using analysis of variance, independent T and LSD tests. 			Results: The average of WBGT index in Qom <b>dry</b> <b>cleaner</b> units of Iran were 28. 98 ± 1. 64 °C. The average of WBGT index in 66. 4 % of units was up to 28 °C. The average of relative humidity was 42. 86 %, the average of wet bulb temperature and globe temperature were 25. 56 °C and 36. 72 °C, respectively. The findings showed a significant correlation between the average of WBGT index and the standard recommendation level (p< 0. 0001). In <b>dry</b> <b>cleaner</b> units with less than 10 m 2 area, heat stress was higher than other units  significantly (p< 0. 05). 			 		 	 Conclusions: Heat stress in many <b>dry</b> <b>cleaner</b> units in Qom, Iran, was more than recommended OELs. Because of wet bulb and globe temperature in units were high value, the most important measures to heat controls, are technical engineering controls such as  radiation shield, insulation on boilers and modify the cooling systems...|$|R

500|$|The Dumas's {{business}} and those like it were criticized {{by a number}} of people who sought to reform the red light district.

[...] Biederwolf held revival services for residents which attracted [...] "rounders, gamblers and habitués of the red light district".

The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers, frequent the city's <b>dry</b> <b>cleaners</b> and would patronize Chinese herbalists, looking for birth control potions and venereal disease remedies. To ensure that their operations were unhampered, the girls at the Dumas would pay the city's police and governance five dollar [...] "fines". Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district, the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high-necked blouses and that they [...] "refrain from any indecent exposures." [...] After these ordinances were put in place, the Butte Miner reported that [...] "nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces. What the women say about the matter is not fit for publication." [...] By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district; with the district contributing two thousand dollars to the city's coffers every month, the efforts eventually died.|$|E
