5|$|Hebron {{glass was}} {{traditionally}} produced using sand {{from the village}} of Bani Na'im, east of Hebron, and sodium carbonate taken from the Dead Sea. Instead of sand, recycled <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> the primary raw material used to make Hebron glass today.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{very important for}} manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> pulled to reduce {{the diameter of the}} fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
30|$|The {{translucent}} glass vessels {{of this study}} are consistent with and typical of 1 st millennium BCE Hellenistic production in the eastern Mediterranean region. Vessel form, style, manufacture method and colour are independent of reduced <b>glass</b> composition. <b>Glasses</b> <b>are</b> decoloured with manganese, which also produced one purple <b>glass.</b> Blue <b>is</b> produced in one sample by cobalt with a little copper, and one green and one blue <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> coloured by copper. Other bluish and green <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> the result of iron contamination in the batch. Amber <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> likely the result of the presence of iron and sulphur in a ferri-sulphide complex.|$|R
30|$|Transparent sodium {{silicate}} glass, manufactured in a {{float glass process}} on liquid tin and with local prints of ceramic frit was evaluated. Three different surfaces of the <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> studied, the tin side that during the manufacturing process was {{in contact with the}} tin bath, the fire side that was exposed to the atmosphere and a ceramic frit surface printed on the fire side. Three different automotive <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> studied {{in the first part of}} the project and the results were then verified on a demonstrator. The first two <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> a reference <b>glass</b> and a similar from another batch manufactured in Europe of Belgian sand. The third <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> a similar <b>glass</b> but manufactured in China from local sand. In the final part a demonstrator <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> used, a European windscreen similar to the reference. The <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> provided by Sekurit Saint Gobain (Herzogenrath, Germany). All sides of <b>glass</b> <b>were</b> initially evaluated, but the tin and ceramic side where the most difficult to bond to and are therefore the focus here.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> born in Lachva, Russia.

30|$|First, the FTO <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> washed with {{deionized}} {{water and then}} dried at 80  °C for 10  min.

40|$|Chalcogenide glasses, {{especially}} sulphide <b>glasses,</b> <b>are</b> {{becoming more}} and more important for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices {{in part because of the}} high nonlinearity, strong photosensitivity and several other unique properties they have.

5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
5|$|After the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes {{and kills}} Henry. Glass uses Henry's corpse {{on his horse}} as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a {{riverbank}} where they engage in a brutal fight. <b>Glass</b> <b>is</b> about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream {{into the hands of}} the Arikara. The chief kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara spare Glass. Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> very brittle in its solid state, it {{is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
50|$|Watch <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> named {{so because}} they {{are similar to the}} glass used for the front of old-fashioned pocket watches. In {{reference}} to this, large watch <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> occasionally known as clock glasses.|$|R

5|$|Cobalt {{has been}} used to color glass since the Bronze Age. The {{excavation}} of the Uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue glass, cast during the 14th century BC.

5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>is</b> badly mauled by {{a grizzly}} bear and left close to death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the {{abandoned}} pelts.|$|E
5|$|Hebron <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> an {{attraction}} for {{both domestic and}} foreign tourists.
