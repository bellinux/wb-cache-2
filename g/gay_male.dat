5|$|As one of {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS, during the 1980s and 1990s he treated many hundreds of HIV-positive people. During the height of the AIDS crisis, Sonnabend helped create several AIDS organisations, including the AIDS Medical Foundation (now amfAR), the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (now ACRIA), which pioneered community-based research, and the PWA Health Group, the first and largest formally recognised buyers' club.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{differences}} in four aspects of job satisfaction between gay males/lesbians and heterosexuals. <b>Gay</b> <b>males</b> and lesbians {{are found to be}} less satisfied, according to all job satisfaction measures considered. Moreover, <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> and lesbians whose orientation was known at their workplace had higher job satisfaction than <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> and lesbians who had not disclosed their orientation. Furthermore, <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> and lesbians were found to become more satisfied with their jobs with time after disclosing their sexual orientation...|$|R
50|$|Rectal douching is {{commonly}} used by people who engage in anal sex. <b>Gay</b> <b>males</b> as a demographic {{are more likely to}} engage in anal sex than many other broad demographics, and because of this, anal douching practices and effects are more studied in relation to <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> than other populations.|$|R
40|$|Men’s {{bodies have}} {{increasingly}} been {{placed under the}} gaze of contemporary Western society. <b>Gay</b> <b>males,</b> in particular, {{appear to be a}} group most at risk of succumbing to body based concerns due to a predominantly aesthetically oriented gay culture. Recent debate has focussed more on young <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> as {{it has been argued that}} such a demographic are more likely to be impacted by the “look”, which is centred around body physique, fashion and personal grooming. Older <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> have been overlooked in this discussion. In an attempt to redress this concern, this paper highlights emergent body based issues for older gay men. Rich descriptive data from three <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> over the age of 44 years were attained through extensive individual in-depth interviews. Emergent themes identify that older gay men also have concerns about their bodies. However, these concerns are tempered with the notion of inevitability, which ultimately provides a positive life perspective...|$|R
5|$|Homosexuals were {{portrayed in}} such pre-Code films as Our Betters (1933), Footlight Parade (1933), Only Yesterday (1933), Sailor's Luck (1933), and Cavalcade (1933). Although the topic was dealt {{with much more}} openly than in the decades that followed, the {{characterizations}} {{of gay and lesbian}} characters were usually derogatory. <b>Gay</b> <b>male</b> characters were portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{style of}} manga called Bara, which is {{typically}} written by gay men for a <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> adult audience. Bara often has more realistic themes than yaoi and {{is more likely to}} acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres.|$|E
5|$|Bisexual actress Marlene Dietrich {{cultivated}} a cross-gender {{fan base}} {{and started a}} trend when she began wearing men's suits. She caused a commotion when she appeared at the premiere of The Sign of the Cross in 1932 in a tuxedo, complete with top hat and cane.Siegel & Siegel, pg. 124. The appearance of homosexual characters was at its height in 1933; in that year, Hays declared that all <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> characters would be removed from pictures. Paramount {{took advantage of the}} negative publicity Dietrich generated by signing a largely meaningless agreement stating that they would not portray women in male attire.|$|E

Among gay men, another study (Yee N., 2002) reported <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> who identify as [...] "only tops" [...] prefer less hairy men, while <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> who identify as [...] "only bottoms" [...] prefer hairier men.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gay</b> <b>males</b> {{have higher}} than average rates of suicidal ideation, which has been {{attributed}} {{in part to the}} pressure to conform to societal religious norms. Using the theoretical frameworks of Durkheim and of Pescosolido and Georgianna, the purpose of this quantitative study was to explore the role of religiosity as a factor of suicidal ideation in <b>gay</b> <b>males.</b> In this study, 113 <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> completed an online survey regarding their level of religiosity as measured by the Religious Background and Behaviors Questionnaire, past suicidal ideation as measured by the Suicidal Ideation Measure, and certain predictor variables, including being 2 ̆ 2 out 2 ̆ 2 to family members, family being supportive, age, religious affiliation (current and during childhood), ethnicity, and population of town during childhood. Regression analyses found no direct statistical significance between level of religiosity and suicidal ideation. There was a predictive relationship, however, between level of family support, level of religiosity, and suicidal ideation. These findings support the Pescosolido and Georgianna theory that belongingness reduces suicidal ideation. The implications for positive social change include the need for mental health professionals to highlight the importance of positive support for <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> as a potential buffer to suicidal ideation...|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{piercing}} of any body part had become uncommon in the West. After World War II, it began increasing in popularity among the <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> subculture. Even ear piercing for a time was culturally unacceptable for women, but that relatively common form of piercing began growing in popularity from the 1960s. In the 1970s, piercing began to expand, as the punk movement embraced it, featuring nontraditional adornment such as safety pins; and Fakir Musafar began popularizing it as a form of Modern Primitivism, which incorporated piercing elements from other cultures, such as stretching.|$|E
5|$|One analyst {{reasoned}} the {{recurrence of}} lesbian chic {{was due to}} the often-used homoerotic subtexts of <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> subculture being considered off limits because of AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions. All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men.|$|E
5|$|Sonnabend {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS. His background in microbiology, virology, infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, independently of government agencies that were slow to react and often at his own expense, and in 1983 he was founding editor one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend was fired from the journal).|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> ambassador-spies {{attempt to}} {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E
5|$|Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally {{held at the}} Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The {{demonstration}} was {{in response}} to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.|$|E
5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film not {{directed}} by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> gangster Hilly Blue in Trouble in Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the stereotype of simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} a rich new data source, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the author {{examines}} {{the sensitivity of the}} estimated earnings penalty faced by sexual minorities to 1) the use of multiple measures of sexual orientation, including both identity/attraction and behaviorally based definitions, and 2) controls for family and individual heterogeneity. Baseline regression results show that <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> and bisexuals earn less than their heterosexual counterparts, a result that persists after controlling for family-level observables. However, after controlling for personality and isolating self-identified sexual minorities {{who are most likely to}} be observed as such by employers, the estimated wage penalty for bisexuals falls sharply in absolute magnitude while the wage penalty for <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> persists. Preferred specifications show that relative to heterosexual <b>males,</b> <b>gay</b> <b>males</b> earn wages that are 13. 1 % lower, a result that is consistent with labor market discrimination. Neither lesbians nor bisexual females earn significantly less than their heterosexual counterparts...|$|R
25|$|However, some gay {{men such as}} Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg {{are also}} {{critical}} of sadomasochism and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book <b>Gay</b> <b>Male</b> Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination, advancing the idea that <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws. He uses radical feminist theory {{to make the case}} that <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> pornography reinforces misogyny and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|Leather {{has been}} a {{predominantly}} <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> term to refer to one fetish, but it can stand for many more. Members of the <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> leather community may wear leathers such as Motorcycle leathers, or may be attracted to men wearing leather. Leather and BDSM are seen as two parts of one whole. Much of the BDSM culture {{can be traced back}} to the <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> leather culture, which formalized itself out of the group of men who were soldiers returning home after World War II (1939–1945). WWII was the setting where countless homosexual men and women tasted the life among homosexual peers. Post-war, homosexual individuals congregated in larger cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. They formed leather clubs and bike clubs, some were fraternal services. The establishment of Mr. Leather Contest and Mr. Drummer Contest were made around this time. This was the genesis of the <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> leather community. Many of the members were attracted to extreme forms of sexuality, for which peak expression was in the pre-AIDS 1970s. This subculture is epitomized by the Leatherman's Handbook by Larry Townsend, published in 1972, which describes in detail the practices and culture of <b>gay</b> <b>male</b> sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
