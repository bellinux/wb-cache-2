5000|$|Tim Be Told {{released}} {{their debut}} LP, titled Getting By in 2007. Their second project was an EP titled From the Inside, which {{was released in}} 2009. The album was positively compared by critics {{to the likes of}} The Fray and Maroon 5, and was critically considered to be a leap forward for the band, due to what many considered to be a [...] "more mature sound". After their second album was released, Tim Be Told was featured in Audrey magazine and The Hook Magazine, as well as played regularly on 106.1 the Corner and KBIF. Throughout the tour following From the <b>Inside</b> <b>release,</b> Tim Be Told became more well known around college campuses, as well as the online Christian community.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{publications}} {{have shown}} that the combination of Î±-calcium sulfate hemihydrate, the densest form of hydrates and hydroxyapatite (HA) particles gives good clinical outcome in various applications. It has large potential as bone substitute since the material transforms to bone throughout the entire volume and not only by creeping substitution, from the surface toward the <b>inside.</b> <b>Release</b> of important proteins for osteogenesis has been observed around implanted material and is speculated to be due to fast dissolution of the calcium sulfate phase in combination with the osteoconductive and bioactive nature of HA. In diabetic foot infection, the osteoconductive HA/calcium sulfate material has been successfully used loaded with antibiotics and since it is injectable, the application is minimally invasive, easy and precise. It is a bone substitute for the future...|$|E
40|$|These {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} examine short-range dispersal by the small whitefly parasitoid Eretmocerus eremicus that takes place {{within the confines of}} a specifically defined habitat. We were specifically concerned with the impacts of sex and mating status on their dispersal. We hoped to construct predictive models concerning dispersal. In a vertical flight chamber we found that female flight duration was significantly longer (11 times) than that of males and that unmated parasitoids flew approximately three times longer than mated individuals. In field studies 87 % of the 4, 153 parasitoids captured were males. This occurred in spite of sex ratios being near 1 : 1 upon release. The difference in dispersal characteristics between males and females may be resource based. It is felt that certain requirements were met within our field plots for males that were not met for females. It is important for males to find mates and they may have done so <b>inside</b> <b>release</b> containers or in close proximity to release sites. While females have a similar requirement, they must also find whitefly hosts to parasitize. It can be assumed that each sex took active steps to accomplish different goals. Males were searching the immediate area of the release sites where mates were plentiful, while females were leaving the 33 ft. radius plots in search of whitefly hosts. We were able to verify models for male dispersal (75 % of males were predicted to disperse within 13. 5 ft.). Our models predicted that 50 % of females would be found within 82 ft. This information will useful when describing movement by E. eremicus and other small insects. It should prove useful when defining release techniques for parasitoids being used as biological control agents...|$|E
