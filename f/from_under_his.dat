5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of a}} supercard {{featuring}} the two top promotions of the Monday Night Wars {{was considered to be}} a dream match scenario {{in the eyes of many}} fans, as it would allow the fans to see which promotion would be superior in storyline. The angle began when Mr. McMahon's son, Shane McMahon, announced as part of the storyline on WWF's Raw Is War and the final episode of WCW's Nitro (which merged into a simulcast) that he had bought WCW <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> father's nose. This led to several run-in appearances of WCW wrestlers during Raw Is War and SmackDown! over the months after WrestleMania X-Seven.|$|E

500|$|In Miller's Falls, Massachusetts, an exterminator {{inspects}} {{the basement}} of Dr. Jeff Eckerle, having been hired to eradicate a cockroach infestation. The exterminator sprays a roach, knocks {{it down to the}} ground, and attempts to crush it underfoot. However, upon doing so, he begins to succumb to anaphylaxis, clutching his heart and collapsing against a wall, while the roach crawls out <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> boot, unscathed. When Eckerle returns, he finds the exterminator's body covered with roaches. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is coincidentally nearby, investigating reported UFO sightings in Miller's Grove. While on the phone with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Mulder is approached by the local sheriff, Frass, who reveals that a series of [...] "roach attacks" [...] have taken place in the town. Frass allows Mulder onto the scene at Eckerle's residence.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the Supreme Court {{revisited}} {{questions about}} the constitutionality of involuntary bodily intrusions in several key cases. In 1973, the Court ruled in Cupp v. Murphy {{that the police were}} permitted to extract a tissue sample from underneath a suspect’s fingernails to recover [...] "evanescent" [...] physical evidence. The suspect in Cupp was suspected of strangling his wife and voluntarily went to a police station to answer questions. Officers noticed bloodstains under the suspect’s fingernails and detained him, but did not place him under arrest. Against the suspect’s wishes, the police scraped out a tissue sample <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> fingernails to retrieve the evidence. The biological material found under the suspect’s fingernails was later found to have come from the victim. Citing Schmerber, the Court held that this warrantless search was justified under the exigent circumstances exemption of the Fourth Amendment because the search was necessary to preserve the “highly evanescent evidence” under the defendant’s fingernails.|$|E
500|$|Cicadas {{have been}} {{featured}} in literature {{since the time of}} Homer's Iliad, and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese Shang dynasty (1766–1122 BC.). They are described by Aristotle in his History of Animals and by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History; their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by Hesiod in his poem Works and Days [...] "when the Skolymus flowers, and the tuneful Tettix sitting on his tree in the weary summer season pours forth <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> wings his shrill song". In the classic 14th-century Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Diaochan took her name from the sable (diāo) tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas (chán), which adorned the hats of high-level officials. In the Japanese novel The Tale of Genji, the title character poetically likens one of his many love interests to a cicada for the way she delicately sheds her robe the way a cicada sheds its shell when molting. A cicada exuviae plays a role in the manga Winter Cicada. Cicadas are a frequent subject of haiku, where, depending on type, they can indicate spring, summer or autumn.|$|E

500|$|Captain Davy Jones had {{originally}} been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown tentacles; {{the skin of the}} character incorporates the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup among other elements. To portray Jones on set, Bill Nighy wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at Industrial Light & Magic did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth to splice into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> [...] "beard" [...] as he sleeps. To create the CG version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act as limbs for the character.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{televised}} debate, Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate on TV3, saw moderator Vincent Browne challenge Sinn Féin candidate Martin McGuinness on the post-1974 {{membership of}} the Irish Republican Army (IRA), that McGuinness repeatedly denied, by producing eight books <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> desk that claimed otherwise. Fine Gael candidate Gay Mitchell suffered from lack of recognition by many voters, and suffered heavily for his controversial views on suicide and on Ireland joining the Commonwealth. Labour candidate Michael D. Higgins was pursued by his past links to the unpopular Fianna Fáil and his admission that he had smoked cannabis. Independent candidate Dana Rosemary Scallon interrupted the Prime Time debate, moderated by Miriam O'Callaghan, to read out a statement condemning a [...] "malicious" [...] and [...] "false" [...] accusation that she had heard had been made against her family. Seán Gallagher, {{a former member of}} the Fianna Fáil national executive, was leading the opinion polls ahead of the final televised debate, moderated by Pat Kenny on The Frontline. However, Gallagher's campaign came undone when he admitted live on air to collecting a €5,000 cheque for a Fianna Fáil fundraiser event from a man he described as a [...] "convicted criminal and fuel smuggler".|$|E
