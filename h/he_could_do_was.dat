25|$|The {{truth about}} Dumbledore's death is {{revealed}} through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore {{made a terrible}} error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use {{to allow him to}} apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had {{little more than a year}} to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time came because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be the one to kill him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.|$|E
2500|$|The same year, Raffles {{appointed}} John Crawfurd as Resident of Singapore. Crawfurd {{doubted the}} legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a Court of Requests overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident's Court hearing all other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on [...] "general principles of English law", taking into account so far as he could the [...] "character and manners of the different classes" [...] of local inhabitants. Unfortunately, Crawfurd's courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to banish them from the island.|$|E
2500|$|Kamaal/The Abstract {{contains}} introspective lyrical themes. Opening {{with the}} album's only rock chord, the opening track [...] "Feelin' It" [...] {{is one of}} the album's few tracks with him rapping and it contains one verse about common life experiences and hassles. It introduces Q-Tip {{on his way to a}} recording studio, during which he is stopped by a police officer who profiles him: [...] "This profiling cop with his profiling ass / Figured the best thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> find a cat to harass. / The little kitten was me, not that one in the tree / The black one with the promise and the wish to be free". The lyrics are based on an experience that Q-Tip had with a policeman. John Murph of Jazz Times interpreted the song's verse as a metaphor for Q-Tip's struggles for absolute creative freedom without resulting in critical backlash. Tiny Mix Tapess Brendan Mahoney interpreted the [...] "profilin' cop" [...] in the song as [...] "another mundane and too-predictable distraction in a world full of them".|$|E

2500|$|... "Mok-qua Bennette was {{his real}} name. On {{the way to}} Beaver Bay in 1870 he spied a bear (named Mok-qua) sunning itself under a large spruce. Because of weather {{conditions}} - three feet of snow - {{it was impossible for}} the bear to move fast. The bear looked like good meat to the Indian who, unfortunately, didn't have a gun with him. He took a ten foot stick and attached a butcher knife to it thinking he would stab the bear to death. All <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> tickle the bear. Seeing his method didn't work he cut a piece from a birch sapling with his tomahawk and tried to kill the bear by clubbing him to death. After the first blow he fell back while drawing away and got tangled in the limbs of the fallen tree. Mok-qua attacked the Indian, clawing his shoulder and arms. He did not bite him. The bear left the Indian who was unconscious. The Indian regained consciousness at night and when he did he was very sick and almost frozen. He somehow dragged himself to the farm of Jacob Hangarner who, after warming and feeding him, brough him to Beaver Bay. The Indian suffered more from exposure than from the attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hook {{tries to}} comfort Emma by {{telling her that}} when his brother died all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> live in the moment. But Emma wonders how she can be still alive if Snow died. All of a sudden, a ladybug buzzes around Hook and just as {{he is about to}} kill the insect, Charming shouts “wait!” Charming takes the ladybug, places it on his hand and it is {{transformed}} back into Snow White by the Blue Fairy, thanks to a special form of fairy dust. The Blue Fairy is also aware that Emma wasn't Leia all along, but says it’s all right, her secrets can be hers. Snow is startled when Emma hugs her with tears in her eyes, shouting, “You’re alive.” Snow and Charming seem to be warming up to each other, causing a slight restoration in the timeline. Emma looks at the prisoner and suggests that she and Hook take her with them back to Storybrooke, but the woman is not happy about that idea, prompting Emma to knock her out to kidnap her. As Emma, Hook, and their additional guest go their separate ways, both Snow and Charming reach the troll bridge, but thanks to the altered timeline Snow doesn’t have her dust as a weapon to defeat the trolls, so she goes towards them and bluffs. They drop their weapons and take off. The timeline is back on track as Charming is now smitten with Snow before they go their separate ways, with Snow holding on to the ring and trying it on. [...] Emma watches from a distance and gets weepy. Hook says, “It’s ok, Swan. Not everyone gets a chance to watch their parents fall in love.” Emma opens the book, and discovers a picture of Snow and Charming getting married, and as expected Regina still seeking vengeance on Snow, resulting in the timeline being restored, only this time Regina turns the trolls into bugs with the dark magic and squashes them.|$|E
6000|$|He {{rolled his}} eyes round heavily, {{but he was too}} far gone to express surprise. All <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to utter one word, [...] "Brandy." ...|$|E
6000|$|To open vistas for the {{imagination}} through the blind {{wall of the}} [...] senses as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> sometimes <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> the supreme function of poetry.|$|R
5000|$|His wife Helen {{said that}} despite {{his success in}} business, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not cook steak, and [...] "the best <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> peanut butter {{sandwiches}} or frying eggs".|$|R
50|$|Now Takata's vision {{comes of}} meeting with Mary after the war, and meeting Mary and Freddy's young daughter, Joanie. Joanie touches the {{scar on his}} temple, and as she smiles and looks into his eyes, he is {{reminded}} of a refugee girl that he had rescued in the battle which had resulted in the head wound. Takata gives Mary the engagement ring, and explains that, since Freddy had given his life to save Takata's, the least <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to bring it home for her. He comforts her as she cries.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Weatherley paused. Mr. Jarvis did {{his best}} to grasp the situation, but failed. All that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to {{maintain}} his attitude of intelligent interest.|$|E
60|$|After {{thinking}} over {{it alone}} there in Feemy's sitting-room for an hour, he determined that all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to go back}} again to his only friend, Father John.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Rightbody {{looked at}} this flesh of his flesh, pretty and palpable flesh as it was; but, being confronted as equally with the brain of his brain, all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to say meekly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Hardwick and Ferris {{had gone}} long before, and below all looked deserted. It was still snowing heavily, and Hal {{made up his}} mind that the best thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> to return to his boarding-house.|$|R
6000|$|... "George Kettle {{opened the}} door wot led into the kitchen, and then ’e sprang back with such a shout that {{the man with the}} scythe tried to escape, taking Henery Walker along with ’im. George Kettle tried to speak, but couldn’t. All <b>’e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to point with ’is finger at Bob Pretty’s kitchen—and Bob Pretty’s kitchen was {{for all the world like}} a pork-butcher’s shop. There was joints o’ pork ’anging from the ceiling, two brine tubs as full as they could be, and quite a string of fowls and ducks all ready for market.|$|R
60|$|His {{fears were}} realised. The boot-cupboard was empty. It {{seemed to him}} that, for the time being, the best thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> to place the boot in safe hiding, until he should have thought out a scheme.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well he {{just took}} a look at me, gents, winked with one eye, as much as to say, 'I see you,' and went down again. There warn't nothing else as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>was</b> there?" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{moment of}} {{reflection}} convinced Ben {{that the best}} thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to go back part of the distance they had come, and make an endeavor to cross the little stream at another point.|$|E
60|$|It was {{no longer}} possible, now he was alone, to move the larger logs, and all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to hew them into shape, without an attempt to remove the timbers {{to the site of}} the mill.|$|E
60|$|But before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> caught {{from behind}} and his rifle was {{wrenched}} from his grasp.|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} to Andy {{that the best}} thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> to get home at once and interview his uncle. For the time being he lost his interest in looking for work, and also lost his desire to go gunning.|$|R
50|$|Uncanny X-Men #350 (December 1997) {{reveals that}} it was Gambit who had {{organized}} the modern day Marauders, although he was never actually a member. It also says {{that it was}} he who brought them down to the Morlock tunnels. He had no idea of their intentions, and when they started killing all of them, all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> save a little girl named Sarah (later Marrow). This contradicts with previous versions of the story since in Uncanny X-Men #210, it was shown that the Marauders followed a young Morlock girl, Tommy. This is one of several contradictions between the two versions of the story.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{would you}} believe, Bella,' {{interposed}} his wife, coming to resume her nurse's place at his side, for {{he never got}} on well without her: 'that on our wedding day {{he told me he}} almost thought the best thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>was</b> to die?' ...|$|E
60|$|Close {{beside the}} sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now {{luminous}} and suggestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay the Morning Post, the advertisement columns {{of which he had}} promised her to explore. The least <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to begin at once.|$|E
60|$|And adding {{example to}} his words, {{he began to}} run, dodging among the willows, and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock. He {{had no time to}} look for his direction; all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to turn his back upon the river, and put all his heart to running.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Weston, laughing, [...] "perhaps the {{greatest}} good <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> them, would <b>be</b> to give Jane such a respectable home." ...|$|R
60|$|Denton waved that aside. He {{began talking}} {{of the work}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> not very {{explicit}} what it would be; but he was quite sure {{that there was something}} to keep them comfortably in the happy middle class, whose way of life was the only one they knew.|$|R
60|$|Since {{there was}} no other course than to learn to ride, Toby wisely {{concluded}} that the best thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> to obey his new master without question; so he began to take off his clothes with as much alacrity as if learning to ride was the one thing upon which he had long set his heart.|$|R
60|$|After this, {{had it been}} possible, Bob {{would have}} hurried the work still faster along, but he had already urged matters on as fast as possible, and all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to insist on Ralph, Jim and Dick doing as much work {{as one of the}} laborers, he setting the example.|$|E
60|$|Between us we {{stretched}} the cub out, {{so that all}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> struggle and paw the air and utter strange cries. Hiram tied his rope to a tree, and then ran back to relieve me. It was high time. He took my rope and fastened it to a stout bush.|$|E
6000|$|The {{relief from}} the nervous strain under {{which he had been}} laboring for so long, left Smith-Oldwick {{suddenly}} as weak as a babe, so that he was forced to grasp the ape-man's arm for support--and when he found his voice all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to repeat: [...] "You? You? I thought you were dead!" ...|$|E
60|$|And Evan Williams, lying back in {{his chair}} with the paper on his knees, envied them. The best thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> to publish, with Macmillans, his {{monograph}} upon the foreign policy of Chatham. But confound this tumid, queasy feeling--this restlessness, swelling, and heat--it was jealousy! jealousy! jealousy! which he had sworn never to feel again.|$|R
5000|$|Chucky's callous {{request of}} her to wash the dishes (and Jade's {{reminder}} of her morals by stating [...] "You were nice enough to cook for him, the least <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> wash a dish.") sparks Tiffany's fury and leads to an explosive argument between the two that involves the couple throwing sexual insults, plates, and a cookie at one another. Jade then {{takes advantage of the}} situation and Tiffany's distractions by kicking her into the oven. Chucky screams in rage and shoots at Jade but misses, after which Jesse shoves Chucky through the window. As Chucky is flying out the window, though, he shoots at Jesse {{at the same time and}} causes Jesse to drive the mobile home off the highway and crashes it, nearly destroying the vehicle.|$|R
60|$|Whatever Amelius {{might think}} of the {{situation}} in which he now found himself, the one thing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> honourably <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to say nothing, and submit to it. He remained quietly by the fire. No imaginable consideration (he mentally resolved) should induce him to consent to a second confidential interview in Mrs. Farnaby's room.|$|R
