500|$|The final {{track of}} the DVD, [...] "Raining Blood", culminates with the band drenched by stage blood. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{came up with the}} idea of the blood two years after Reign in Bloods release, but the band lacked the funding to do so. The {{beginning}} of the film Blade (released in 1998) features a [...] "bloodbath" [...] with vampires dancing in a club with blood coming from the roof via a sprinkler system. The scene revived Jeff Hanneman and guitarist Kerry King's interest, and since the band released a DVD the previous year [...] War at the Warfield [...] they decided to add something different for the new DVD [...] raining blood. King asserted that since Lombardo was not on the previous DVD, this one was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important.</b> Due to the short length of the DVD, director Dean Karr chose an additional bonus six songs from the same show as he thought certain members excelled in the performances.|$|E

Theroux, who wrote the screenplay for Iron Man 2, was able to show Casey [...] "a fairly finalized script" [...] before the two began work on the tie-in. In May 2010, Alejandro Arbona, who oversaw {{the creation of the}} comic, explained that the story of the tie-ins had to come [...] "organically from the stuff that happened in Iron Man —what would happen to a man who'd just revealed his super hero identity to the world?—and it had to move us toward the stuff we knew was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in Iron Man 2". In September 2010, Casey noted that writing an MCU tie-in comic required working within the boundaries of the movie continuity and Marvel Studios' plan, as well as writing the characters as portrayed in the films (the [...] "movie version of Stark has a specific attitude" [...] that Casey tried to put in the comic, for example).|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "...while I can’t say I LOVED “The Bear King”, I {{can at least}} say I {{respected}} what it was going for: It’s clear that Merida (Amy Manson) is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> to the endgame of this King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) storyline, so we needed to establish why and to what degree. And this is easier said than done, considering Merida is a character who, up until this point, hasn’t even been particularly likable. I like Amy Manson {{in the role of}} Merida, but she hasn’t always been given the best material, often coming across as unnecessarily combative and standoffish. And so this episode was necessary to soften the character and illustrate why she’s as hard-nosed as she is. This episode also gave Manson the opportunity to really shine, while also bringing back some OUAT alums I didn’t realize I’d missed, such as Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Ruby (Meghan Ory). We also get to meet more of Merida’s family, such as Queen Elinor (Caroline Morahan), and — through flashbacks — the late King Fergus (Glenn Keogh). It’s a story that details how Merida is shaped into a warrior and a ruler who inspires leadership in her people, and from that standpoint, it’s one of the season’s more effective character studies." ...|$|E
