On Whirlpool Lake, Deep Lake, Lake Katherine, and back-country lakes, only non-motorized boats can be used. All personal water crafts are banned within Riding Mountain National Park. As of 2008, only four-stroke and <b>direct</b> <b>injected</b> two-stroke equipped motor boats will be permitted on Clear Lake.

40|$|The {{field of}} <b>direct</b> <b>inject</b> mass {{spectrometry}} includes a massive host of ambient ionization techniques that are especially useful for forensic analysts. Whether {{the sample is}} trace amounts of drugs or explosives or bulk amounts of synthetic drugs from a clandestine laboratory, the analysis of forensic evidence requires minimal sample preparation, evidence preservation, and high sensitivity. <b>Direct</b> <b>inject</b> mass spectrometry techniques can rarely provide all of these. Direct analyte-probed nanoextraction coupled to nanospray ionization mass spectrometry, however, is certainly capable of achieving these goals. As a multifaceted tool developed in the Verbeck laboratory, many forensic applications have since been investigated (trace drug and explosives analysis). <b>Direct</b> <b>inject</b> mass spectrometry can also be easily coupled to assays to obtain additional information about the analytes in question. By performing a parallel artificial membrane assay or a cell membrane stationary phase extraction prior to direct infusion of the sample, membrane permeability data and receptor activity data can be obtained {{in addition to the}} mass spectral data that was already being collected. This is particularly useful for characterizing illicit drugs and their analogues for a biologically relevant way to schedule new psychoactive substances...|$|R

50|$|In any matrix {{which has}} some porosity, the pore spaces {{will be filled}} with a fluid of oil, gas (either {{hydrocarbon}} or otherwise) or formation water (sometimes referred to as connate water). This fluid will saturate the rock and change its electrical properties. A wireline resistivity tool <b>direct</b> <b>injects</b> current(lateralog-type tools for conductive water based muds) or induces (induction-type tools for resistive or oil based muds) an electric current into the surrounding rock and determines the resistivity via ohm's law. The resistivity of the formation is used primarily to identify pay zones containing highly resistive hydrocarbons {{as opposed to those}} containing water, which is generally more conductive. It is also useful for determining the location of the oil-water contact in a reservoir. Most wireline tools are able to measure the resistivity at several depths of investigation into the bore hole wall, allowing log analysts to accurately predict the level of fluid invasion from the drilling mud, and thus determine a qualitative measurement of permeability.|$|R
