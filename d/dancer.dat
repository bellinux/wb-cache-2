40|$|Research {{into the}} {{psychology}} of theatrical <b>dancers</b> has indicated that as a group, <b>dancers</b> may be a high-risk population for psychological disorders. The majority of this research however, has only sampled ballet <b>dancers.</b> In consideration {{of the fact that}} contemporary dance is philosophically and aesthetically different from ballet, it is proposed that the experience of contemporary <b>dancers</b> may be different from that of ballet <b>dancers</b> and thus their psychological experience and potential problems may also be different. It is suggested, therefore, that results from studies on ballet <b>dancers</b> may not generalize to contemporary <b>dancers.</b> In support of this proposition, {{the purpose of this study}} is to explore the notion that there is a difference in the psychological distress, potentially experienced by ballet <b>dancers</b> compared to contemporary <b>dancers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{function}} of the honey bee tremble dance and how it attracts signal receivers is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that tremble followers and waggle followers exhibit the same dance-following behavior. If correct, this could unify our understanding of dance following, provide insight into dance information transfer, and offer a way to identify the signal receivers of tremble dance information. Followers showed similar initial attraction to and tracking of <b>dancers.</b> However, waggle <b>dancers</b> were faster than tremble <b>dancers,</b> and follower-forward, -sideways, and -angular velocities were generally similar to the velocities of their respective <b>dancers.</b> Waggle <b>dancers</b> attracted followers from 1. 3 -fold greater distances away than tremble <b>dancers.</b> Both follower types were attracted to the lateral sides of <b>dancers,</b> but tremble followers were more attracted to the <b>dancer's</b> head, and waggle followers were more attracted to the <b>dancer's</b> abdomen. Tremble <b>dancers</b> engaged in 4 -fold more brief food exchanges with their followers than waggle <b>dancers.</b> The behaviors of both follower types are therefore relatively conserved. Researchers can now take the next steps, observing tremble followers to determine their subsequent behaviors and testing the broader question of whether follower attraction and tracking is conserved {{in a wide range}} of social insects...|$|R
