50|$|A servo <b>drive</b> <b>turret</b> {{punch press}} uses twin AC servo drives {{directly}} coupled to the drive shaft. This drive system combines {{the simplicity of}} the original clutch and brake technology with the speed of a hydraulic ram driven system. This results in high performance, reliability, and lower operating costs. A servo drive press system has no complex hydraulics or oil-cooling chillers, thus reducing maintenance and repair costs. A turret press can be equipped with advanced technology that stores and reuses energy generated during ram deceleration, providing extended electrical power savings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of servo direct <b>drive</b> <b>turret</b> punch press is presented. A {{servomotor}} to drive the eccentric-toggle mechanism is used in our design, which combines the advantages of mechanical and hydraulic turret punch press. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the punch are calculated, through the kinematics analysis. So, {{the motion of the}} punch is controllable through the rotation of the servomotor. Then, the inverse kinematics analysis is studied in detail, and the corresponding motion of the servomotor can be gotten, for different punch motion curves, according to the production requirement. For example, when we design a motion of the punch for a particular stamping process, the motion of servomotor can be obtained through the inverse kinematics analysis. Finally, Output force is acquired by static force analysis, which decides the working capability of the mechanism...|$|E

5000|$|The main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} an improved {{version of the}} 47 mm/L32 main gun, known as the 47 mm/L40. It was mounted in a fully rotating, electrically <b>driven</b> <b>turret,</b> and had an elevation of 20 degrees, and a depression of 10 degrees. The gun was capable of firing hollow charge, high explosive, and armour piercing rounds. The secondary armament consisted of five Breda 38 machine guns (two mounted in the hull, another two in a coaxial mount, and the fifth {{on top of the}} tank in an anti-aircraft mount.) ...|$|R
500|$|Each carried eight BL 12-inch (305mm) Mk X guns in four {{hydraulically}} powered BVIII twin turrets, except for Invincible which mounted her guns in two BIX and two BX electrically <b>driven</b> <b>turrets.</b> Two turrets were mounted {{fore and aft}} on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. Two turrets were mounted amidships between {{the second and third}} funnels, identified as 'P' and 'Q'. 'P' turret was mounted on the port side and normally faced forward, 'Q' turret was mounted on the starboard side and normally faced aft (rearwards). 'P' and 'Q' turrets were staggered—'P' was forward of 'Q', enabling 'P' to fire in a limited arc to the starboard side and 'Q' to likewise fire in a limited arc towards the port side. These were the same guns as those mounted in the British , the [...] and the , and for a brief period the Invincibles equalled the firepower of any other nations' battleships.|$|R
50|$|Abhay {{features}} an all-electrical <b>turret</b> <b>drive</b> {{system and a}} 40 mm high-velocity cannon capable of firing APFSDS and High explosive rounds.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{introduction}} of the B-24J, all three of the Liberator manufacturing plants converted to the production of this version. The B-24J incorporated a hydraulically <b>driven</b> tail <b>turret</b> and other defensive armament modifications in the nose of the aircraft. The bomber plant produced its first B-24J in April 1944; 1587 were built at Willow Run.|$|R
500|$|All three ships entered {{service from}} {{the second half of}} 1908. Initially, Invincible and Inflexible were {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet, while Indomitable took the Prince of Wales (later King George V) to the tercentennial celebrations in Canada, before also joining the Home Fleet. Invincibles electrically <b>driven</b> <b>turrets</b> proved to be a failure despite two lengthy refits in 1909 and 1911 and were converted to hydraulic power during her refit in early 1914 at the enormous cost of £151,200. The situation was so bad during her gunnery trials in October 1908 that the captain of , the Royal Navy's gunnery school described their operation thusly: [...] "When the order was given to train the turret, elevate or run a gun in or out, it was only necessary to push a button, or move a switch, but the result was often a flash of blue flame which seemed to fill the turret." ...|$|R
50|$|Phase 3 {{improvements}} {{include a}} laser range finder, the latest generation thermal imager, 24 V DC electric <b>drive</b> for the <b>turret</b> and improved suspension for the hull.|$|R
5000|$|The Il-28 {{design was}} {{conventional}} in layout, with high, unswept wings and a swept horizontal tail and fin. The engines were carried in bulky engine nacelles slung {{directly under the}} wings. The nosewheel retracted rearwards, while the mainwheels retracted forwards into the engine nacelles. The crew of three were accommodated in separate, pressurised compartments. The navigator, who also acted as bombardier, was accommodated in the glazed nose compartment and was provided with an OPB-5 bombsight based on the American Norden bombsight of the Second World War, while the pilot sat under a sideways opening bubble canopy with an armoured windscreen. The gunner sat in a separate compartment {{at the rear of}} the fuselage, operating a power <b>driven</b> <b>turret</b> armed with two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 23 mm cannons with 250 rounds each. In service, the turret was sometimes removed as a weight saving measure. [...] While the pilot and navigator sat on ejector seats, the gunner had to parachute out of a hatch in the floor in the event of an emergency. Two more fixed, forward-firing 23 mm cannon with 100 rounds each were mounted under the nose and fired by the pilot, while a bomb bay was located under the wing, capable of holding four 100 kg (220 lb) bombs in individual containers, or single large bombs of up to 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) slung from a beam in the bomb bay.|$|R
2500|$|The {{testing at}} Aberdeen {{revealed}} other problems as well. The <b>turret</b> <b>drive</b> also suffered from poor reliability. The use of poorly machined, low quality steel side friction clutches and the T-34's outdated and poorly manufactured transmission meant frequent mechanical failure occurred {{and that they}} [...] "create an inhuman harshness for the driver". A lack of properly installed and shielded radios – if they existed at all – restricted their operational range to under [...]|$|R
2500|$|The British firm OVIK has {{designed}} a vehicle named [...] "Meerkat" [...] {{based on the}} CVR(T), anticipating {{that large numbers of}} these will become available for refurbishment in future years when they are replaced in British service, and perhaps several other armed forces. The hull has been redesigned, and the driver has been moved back into a central position - sitting side-by-side with his primary crewman. The vehicle is steered using a conventional steering wheel system - which can be swapped from left to right - to allow either crewman to drive or command the vehicle. The engine {{has been replaced by a}} Cummins 6.7-litre diesel engine whilst the transmission has been uprated to DB TN15E+ and STORMER final <b>drives.</b> The <b>turret</b> has been replaced by a modular weapon [...] "cassette" [...] that will mount remote weapon stations, armed with, for example, a [...]50" [...] M2 HB machine gun.|$|R
50|$|In 1982-1985, 293 {{surviving}} Centurions of the Jordanian Army were refitted {{with the}} diesel engine and {{transmission of the}} M60A1 tank {{in place of the}} original Meteor petrol engine, Belgian SABCA computerized fire-control system, which incorporated a laser range-finder and passive night sight for the gunner, Cadillac Gage electro-hydraulic <b>turret</b> <b>drive</b> and stabilization system and a new Teledyne Continental hydropneumatic suspension in place of the Hortsman units. These upgraded vehicles were called the Tariq. After retirement from service with the arrival of ex-British Challenger tanks in the late 1990s, several Tariqs were converted into heavy APCs.|$|R
50|$|The V-200 was {{essentially}} an enlarged {{version of the}} V-100 and utilized many components of the U.S. Army's 5-ton trucks. This version was designed to the specifications of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and entered service in 1968. It was fitted with a custom diesel engine and was notably heavier than the V-100. ST Kinetics upgraded the Singaporean fleet of V-200 vehicles in 2002 with electric <b>turret</b> <b>drives</b> and made some detail improvements to both the engine and transmission. The Singapore Army continued to hold two hundred V-200s in reserve until 2015, when they were formally retired and replaced by the Peacekeeper Protected Response Vehicle (PRV).|$|R
50|$|The Equalizer {{was also}} {{used as the basis}} for the Sea Vulcan 25, a turret mounted gun for naval ship self-defense, {{although}} not as a Close-In Weapon System, as the gun was not automatic nor did it use radar tracking. Instead the gun was manually aimed using a digital gun sight and fire control. Sea Vulcan consisted of a 540-round helical drum magazine, a one-piece aluminum turret that can be opened with just a screwdriver, and the main gun. One unique advantage of the system was that it was capable of operating independently of ships power; the gun and ammunition magazine were powered by a 3,000 psi pneumatic <b>drive</b> and the <b>turret</b> motor by twin lead-acid batteries.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} main armament {{consists of a}} M134 minigun mount, open <b>turret</b> <b>drive</b> shafts rotational unit - external or air flow. The firing rate can be adjusted from 300 to 6,000 rounds per minute. Total mount weight is 22.7 kg without the ammunition feed system. Primary ordonance is the 7.62×51mm NATO. Ammunition capacity can range from 1,500 (total weight 58 kg) to 4,500 (total weight 134 kg) rounds. Optionally the standard armament can be a 12.7×108 mm DShK or NSV machine gun. The latest variants have DRWS-1 remote weapon stations equipped with twinned 12.7 mm machineguns and one 7.62 mm lmg attached. Alternatively grenade launchers, ATGMs and short range low-altitude air defence systems can be fitted on the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The Challenger 2 {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily {{armoured}} and best protected tanks in the world. The turret and hull are protected by second generation of Chobham armour (also known as Dorchester), the details of which are classified but which is said to be more than twice as strong as steel. Crew safety was paramount in the design, using a solid state electric <b>drive</b> for its <b>turret</b> and gun movement, thus removing the traditional risk of hydraulic rupture into the crew compartment. Explosive reactive armour kits are also fitted as necessary along with additional bar armour. The nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection system is located in the turret bustle. The tank's shape is also designed with stealth technology to reduce radar signature.|$|R
40|$|The development, implementation, {{and results}} of a pilot-in-the-loop fixed-base {{simulation}} investigating yaw-axis handling qualities and vehicle maneuverability requirements for the task of single-pilot helicopter air combat at terrain-flight altitudes are presented. Experimental variables included yaw-axis natural frequency and damping. Weapon system type was also varied to include a full- and limited-traverse <b>turret</b> <b>driven</b> by a helmet-mounted sight and a fixed-forward gun. Results indicated that a high yaw natural frequency (omega n = 1. 5 - 2. 0 rad/sec) and high yaw damping (zeta approx. 1. 4) were desirable for Level 1 handling qualities. Pilot ratings generally decreased {{and the effect of}} the yaw dynamic characteristics became more pronounced and the weapon system became more restrictive. Other analyses discussed are the vehicle maneuver envelope usage, turret envelope usage, tracking performance, and pilot commentary. [URL] Army (USA) author...|$|R
40|$|Driver {{mechanism}} {{with two}} {{degree of freedom}} (MP 2 -DK) is a robotic device {{that can be used}} for various applications such as <b>turret</b> <b>drive</b> system, gutling gun, launcer, radar antennas, and satellite communications. The precision and the speed of a MP 2 -DK are determined by its control system. The calculation inverse angle due to interference in six degree of freedom is necessary to control a MP 2 DK. This paper analyses three calculation methods of inverse angle which are iteration method using Jacobian matrix, reduction of matrix equations using positioning geometry, and an analytical derivation using a rotation matrix. The simulation results of the three methods showed that the first and the third methods could visually demonstrate three rotational disturbances, whereas the second method could only demonstrate the pitch and yaw (PY) disturbances. The third method required less processing time than the first and the second methods. The best method based on this research was the method of rotation matrix</p...|$|R
40|$|The permanent-magnet ac (PMAC) motor {{requires}} accurate {{position information}} to be supplied to the controller so that the applied currents can be modulated in synchronism with the rotor. In the flux-weakening region of operation, accurate rotor position information is critical to control the relative phase of the applied stator voltages. The design of controllers, which can operate without direct position feedback, {{have been the subject}} of intense development. The most commonly cited justifications for the elimination of the absolute position encoder are those of cost, and the reduction of the overall dimensions of the motor. However, certain military specifications apply stringent constraints to the use of both sensors and estimation techniques. Absolute encoders are frequently prohibited for applications such as tank <b>turret</b> <b>drives</b> due to their relatively fragile nature. Fully sensorless operation has been the focus of development for all classes of electric motors, but again is precluded not only in certain military applications, but also in traction applications for a number of manufacturers...|$|R
50|$|In mid-1973 a new turret was {{designed}} by Wegmann saving 1.5 t weight. It was nicknamed the Spitzmaus-Turm (shrew turret) due to the highly sloped front. This design was only possible with the new EMES-13 optical rangefinder, which required a base length of only 350 mm instead of the previous 1720 mm. Based on experiences in the Yom Kippur War, {{a higher level of}} protection than the prototypes' heavily sloped spaced armour was demanded in late 1973 and the Spitzmaus-Turm was never produced. The weight limit was increased from MLC50 to MLC60, which equals approximately 55 t. The turret T14 was modified to test a new armour configuration, taking on a blockier-looking appearance as a result of using vertical modules of spaced multilayer armour. It was also used to test the new EMES-13 optical rangefinder. The modified turret T14 was designated T14 mod. and was fitted with a fully electric <b>turret</b> <b>drive</b> and stabilization system, which was developed together by the companies General Electric and AEG Telefunken.|$|R
5000|$|The hull was crowned by a flat-domed cast {{superstructure}} that superficially {{resembled a}} circular conventional turret. In reality however {{it was at}} first planned to be fixed; the 47 mm gun was supposed to traverse through a horizontal slit like in a pill-box, rotating on a pivot fixed to the hull floor, a proposal made by Colonel Balland. In a second version of this design by engineer Jean Restany, the [...] "pseudo-turret" [...] was traversable, but simply carried along by the electrically <b>driven</b> gun-mount; the <b>turret</b> therefore {{would not have to}} be equipped with a heavy gun-mantlet and, not bearing the weight of the armament, could be much lighter. On {{the right side of the}} superstructure a vertical cylinder protruded, on top of which a small rotating commander's cupola was fitted, that was armed with dual co-axial machine guns. The superstructure, with the commander/gunner on the right and the loader on the left, had sufficient room to hold a Schneider 47 mm antitank gun that was much more powerful than the shorter 47 mm SA 35 gun equipping the standard APX1 and APX4 turrets. Expecting that this superior firepower would give his design a clear advantage leading to a quick production contract, as had so often happened in the past, Renault was unpleasantly surprised when lobbying by Poniatowski contributed to a change in specifications to the effect that a 75 mm gun had to be carried in the hull. The ACK1 hull was simply too flat for this. To save his project Renault started a strong counter-lobby. Part of this was proposing, already on 10 December 1936, that as an alternative option the turret should hold a longer (at least L/29) main 75 mm armament. It was also claimed that the weight of the projects, 24 tonnes, could be reduced to 19.6 tonnes by limiting the armament to a single gun.|$|R
50|$|As the 1990s began, Rheinmetall began {{developing}} a 140 mm smoothbore cannon {{as a future}} tank cannon. This was intended to counter new developments in Soviet-bloc armoured fighting vehicles, most especially persistent rumours that the next-generation Soviet main battle tank would be armed with either a 135 mm or 152 mm cannon. This program was contemplated as the third stage in the KWS program of modernizing Leopard 2 tanks. KWS I was {{the replacement of the}} L44 120 mm cannon with the 55-calibre model, KWS II was a modernization program that became the Leopard 2A5, and KWS III was {{the development of a new}} turret including a 140 mm smoothbore weapon system and an automatic loader, which would have resulted in the reduction of the crew to three soldiers. The final project design contained a lateral loading mechanism and had the main gun moved in the left turret side. Ammunition load for the main gun was 32 rounds, which were stored in a large ammunition bunker, covering the full turret rear. Moving the ammunition out of the crew's compartment would have resulted in a higher survivability in case of a penetration. The planned protection level was to be equal to the Leopard 2A5 or better. Command and control of the tank was supposed to be improved by the introduction of the ISIS system in its latest version. The KWS III was not adopted then, but development continued on the 140 mm weapon system, with Rheinmetall coordinating with Royal Ordnance from the UK and GIAT from France. To test out the weapon's capabilities, the 140 mm gun was mounted to a Leopard 2. The tank was not equipped with the new turret armour of the KWS III improvement program, nor with an automatic loader, and it also still had the electro-hydraulic <b>turret</b> <b>drive.</b> To cope with the extra weight of the main gun, counterweights were added to the turret rear. The tests were partially successful, with the gun showing superior penetration power, but also some difficulties with the handling.|$|R
