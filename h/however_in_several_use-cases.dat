We describe a word retrieval engine inspired by recent word-spotting advances on ancient manuscripts.

Even though this problem has several commune features with peer-to-peer routing, the additional sensible parameters of MANETs make wired solutions unfit to this case; therefore, we propose a content routing/delivery protocol inherently de- signed for the ad-hoc wireless case, exploiting the intrinsic broadcast {{property of the}} medium. We provided an implementation of this pro- tocol and we tested it <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>use-cases,</b> observing how it assures availability, robustness, and scalability...|$|R
40|$|Plastic surgery {{procedures}} {{can significantly}} alter facial appearance, thereby posing {{a serious challenge}} even to the state-of-the-art face matching algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the challenges involved in automatic matching of faces across plastic surgery variations. In the proposed formulation, partwise facial characterization is combined with the recently popular sparse representation approach to address these challenges. The sparse representation approach requires several images per subject in the gallery to function effectively which is often not available <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>use-cases,</b> as <b>in</b> the problem we address in this work. The proposed formulation utilizes images from sequestered non-gallery subjects with similar local facial characteristics to fulfill this requirement. Extensive experiments conducted on a recently introduced plastic surgery database [17] consisting of 900 subjects highlight {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGame-theoretic Demand-Side Management (DSM) systems {{represent}} a promising solution {{to control the}} electrical appliances of residential consumers. Such frameworks allow indeed for the optimal management of loads without any centralized coordination since decisions are taken locally and directly by users. In this paper, we focus our analysis on a game-theoretic DSM framework designed to reduce the bill {{of a group of}} users. In order to converge to the equilibrium of the game, we adopt an efficient learning algorithm proposed in the literature, Exp 3, along with two variants that we propose to speed up convergence. In defining these methods, we model the appliances scheduling problem as a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, a classical formulation of decision theory. We analyze the proposed learning methods based on realistic instances <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>use-case</b> scenarios and show numerically their effectiveness in improving the performance of next generation smart grid systems...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDemand-Side Management (DSM) systems {{represent}} an efficient method {{to improve the}} performance of Smart Grid infrastructures by controlling users’ power loads. In this paper, we focus our analysis on fully distributed DSM systems especially designed to reduce the peak demand of groups of residential users. In our proposed scheme, each appliance decides autonomously its scheduling using only limited information on the energy price fixed by the retailer, thus greatly reducing the system complexity {{as well as the}} need of information exchanges. We develop two schedule-selection policies based on the Proportional Imitation Rule, where at each iteration all appliances switch to a new schedule with a probability proportional to the cost difference between the actual and cheapest schedules of the previous iteration. We analyze the proposed learning methods based on realistic instances <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>use-case</b> scenarios, and show their effectiveness in terms of cost reductions (both local and system-wide) as well as convergence speed to stable and efficient system equilibria...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{can significantly}} improve efficiency in Internet utilization and data management. Several cloud applications (file sharing, backup, data up/download etc.) imply transfers of {{large amount of}} data without real-time requirements. <b>In</b> <b>several</b> <b>use-cases</b> cloud-computing solutions reduce operational costs and guarantee target QoS. These solutions become critical when satellite systems are utilized, since resources are limited, network latency is huge and bandwidth costs are high. Using satellite capacity for cloud-computing bulk traffic, keeping acceptable performance of interactive applications, is very important and can limit the connectivity costs. This goal can be achieved installing in the Set Top Box (STB) a proxy agent, to differentiate traffic and assign bandwidth according to priority, leaving spare capacity to bulk cloud computing traffic. This aim is typically reached using a specific QoS architecture, adding functional blocks at network or lower layers. We propose to manage such a process at transport layer only. The endpoint proxy implements a new transport protocol called TCP Noordwijk+, introducing a flow control differentiation capability. The proxy includes TPCN+ which efficiently transfers low-priority bulk data and handles interactive data, keeping {{a high degree of}} friendliness. The outcomes of Ns- 2 simulations confirm applicability and good performance of the proposed solution...|$|R
