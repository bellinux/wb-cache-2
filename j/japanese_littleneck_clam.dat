40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 46 - 47. The bivalve, Tapes philippinarum Adams and Reeve, 1867, was introduced. in Hawaii around 1900 (Bryan, 1918). The clam {{originally}} {{came from}} Japan where, according to Cahn (1951), {{it is one}} of the most important commercial species of shellfish. It is cultured in bays throughout Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. T-apes was accidentally introduced to the Pacific coast of North America when Japanese oysters, Crassostrea gigas, were brought there early in the century (Bonnot, 1935). The clam spread rapidly and is now one of the more important commercial clams there. Tapes philippinarum is a member of the family Veneridae and appears in the literature under a variety of names including T. semidecussata Adams and Reeve 1864, and T. japonica Deshayes, 1853. Various generic names are also applied: Venerupis, Venus, Ruditapes and Paphia. The clam has been identified for me as Tapes philippinarum by Dr. E. A. Kay, who compared Hawaiian shells with type material at the British Museum (Natural History) and will be so called throughout this paper. A common name, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>littleneck</b> <b>clam,</b> is almost universally accepted; "Asari" is the Japanese name. The most extensive work concerning life history and ecology of Tapes was done by Cahn (1951) who summarizes the Japanese literature. Its natural history and shell pattern were described by Shaw (1950). Other references are limited to mention of its first appearance on the Pacific Coast (Keen, 1947; Kincaid, 1947 a, 1947 b; Neave, 1944). After its introduction to Hawaii the clam apparently spread rapidly in shallow bays on Oahu and was used extensively as food. Bryan (1918) reported that it became well established in the Kalihi and Moanalua mud-flats. Ostergaard, (1930) and Dall, (1938) confirmed its successful establishment. Edmondson, (1946) also stated that after its introduction, Tapes philippinarum multiplied rapidly in shallow bays about Oahu and was common in Honolulu fish markets. Distribution of Tapes throughout the islands today is poorly known, but its abundance appears to have declined since the initial spread. The beds in the Kalihi, Moanalua, and Pearl Harbor mud-flats have disappeared (personal communication [...] Mr. Sam Okamura, Hawaii Institute of :Marine Biology, and Mr. Henry Sakuda, State Division of Fish and Games). "'Kaneohe Bay, Oahu is the only area where there are enough -for exploitation. The earliest recorded planting in Kaneohe Bay occurred in 1920 (Dall, 1938). The clam became successfully established and, though there is no documented information, presumably spread considerably. At present it is abundant on the shallow water reef :platforms of the southeast Bay and is harvested extensively during a short clam season regulated by the State Division of Fish and Game. The waters of southeastern Kaneohe Bay have undergone change recently because of extensive building ashore which has increased the flow from the two streams which empty here (Bathen, 1968). In addition, two recently constructed sewer outfalls discharge treated sewage into the southeast section. Exchange with ocean water is slow leading to accumulation of sewage and water from run-off (Bathen, 1968). Accompanying these changes have been undocumented reports of atypical phytoplankton blooms, an increase in the abundance of Tapes, and a decrease in the population of the bra-chiopod Lingula reevii. These changes could be caused by increased run-off and pollution in this sector of the bay although there is no documentation. With these factors in mind, this study was made to: (1) to collect relevant ecological data particularly on the distribution and growth of clams in various parts of the bay in order to determine what limits distribution, and any effects pollution may have on the clam beds; (2) to determine interaction of Tapes with other species, particularly predators and L. reevii, a co-occurring filter feeder; and (3) to study the effects of harvesting on abundance and population structure...|$|E

40|$|Maintaining food {{production}} while sustaining productive ecosystems {{is among the}} central challenges of our time, yet, {{it has been for}} millennia. Ancient clam gardens, intertidal rock-walled terraces constructed by humans during the late Holocene, are thought to have improved the growing conditions for clams. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the beach slope, intertidal height, and biomass and density of bivalves at replicate clam garden and non-walled clam beaches in British Columbia, Canada. We also quantified the variation in growth and survival rates of <b>littleneck</b> <b>clams</b> (Leukoma staminea) we experimentally transplanted across these two beach types. We found that clam gardens had significantly shallower slopes than non-walled beaches and greater densities of L. staminea and Saxidomus giganteus, particularly at smaller size classes. Overall, clam gardens contained 4 times as many butter clams and over twice as many <b>littleneck</b> <b>clams</b> relative to non-walled beaches. As predicted, this relationship varied as a function of intertidal height, whereby clam density and biomass tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to non-walled beaches at relatively higher intertidal heights. Transplanted juvenile L. staminea grew 1. 7 times faster and smaller size classes were more likely to survive in clam gardens than non-walled beaches, specifically at {{the top and bottom of}} beaches. Consequently, we provide strong evidence that ancient clam gardens likely increased clam productivity by altering the slope of soft-sediment beaches, expanding optimal intertidal clam habitat, thereby enhancing growing conditions for clams. These results reveal how ancient shellfish aquaculture practices may have supported food security strategies in the past and provide insight into tools for the conservation, management, and governance of intertidal seascapes today...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{concern about the}} potential for long-term effects to marine organisms from chlorinated sea water. As part of a larger study to investigate the effects of materials resulting from seawater chlorination on marine organisms, groups of <b>littleneck</b> <b>clams,</b> Protothaca staminea, were exposed to sea water that had been chlorinated. Two experiments were conducted. In one test, groups of <b>littleneck</b> <b>clams</b> were exposed to dilutions of chlorinated sea water that had average chlorine produced oxidant (CPO) concentrations of 16 {micro}g/l or less. In the second test, groups of clams were exposed to chlorinated seawater-unchlorinated seawater mixtures that had target CPO concentrations of 0, 6, 12, 25, 50 and 100 {micro}g/l. In the first experiment, length measurements were made on all clams at approximately one-month intervals for three months. In the second test, length, weight, depth, width and edge etching were used to measure growth, and subsamples were harvested and measured at one-month intervals. In addition, clams were preserved for histological examination. The clams in the first experiment all had negative growth. In the second test, growth was inhibited under all conditions through the first four months of exposure. During the last four months, there was positive signs of growth at the 0, 6 and 12 {micro}g/l CPO test conditions. Histological examination indicates that P. staminea does not adapt well to being held in aquaria. Most clams, tram all test and control conditions, showed evidence of necrosis at one month.

40|$|Variation in {{terrestrial}} mammalian craniodental morphology and skull {{shape is}} known to constrain feeding performance, which in turn influences dietary habits and ultimately fitness. Otters have evolved two feeding specializations: underwater raptorial capture of prey (mouth-oriented) and capture of prey by hand (hand-oriented), which likely correspond to craniodental morphology and bite performance. However, feeding biomechanics and performance data for otters, aquatic mustelids that consume prey above water, are sparse. The first goal {{of the study was}} to investigate the relationship between feeding morphology and bite performance between two mouth-oriented piscivores (giant river otters and North American river otters) and two hand-oriented invertebrate specialists (sea otters and Asian small-clawed otters) using morphometric approaches. The second goal was to investigate fluctuating asymmetry in the cranium of otters. The third goal was to characterize feeding mechanisms (kinematics and jaw musculature) and role of bite performance in the trophic ecology of sea otters. Mouth-oriented piscivores possessed longer skulls and mandibles, with jaws designed for increased velocity at the expense of bite capability. Hand-oriented possessed more blunt skulls and mandibles designed for increased bite capability. Sea otters displayed a greater degree of fluctuating asymmetry of the skull, which is likely linked to environmental stresses. Bite performance and durophagous feeding behavior in sea otters was characterized in detail in the feeding kinematics. Estimated bite forces of sea otters were large enough to crush all size classes of butter and <b>littleneck</b> <b>clams</b> tested in the lab. However, sea otters are size selective predators and generally choose bivalves of small to medium size. Medium sized butter and <b>littleneck</b> <b>clams</b> required an intermediate breaking force, and are buried at a shallower depth than larger clams. Clams requiring an intermediate breaking force could decrease consumption time, thus overall handling time...|$|R

We found that clam gardens had significantly shallower slopes, significantly greater densities of L. staminea and Saxidomus giganteus, and higher growth of transplanted L. staminea.

The mean values of DBT, TBT and TPT in all samples were 1. 8, 3. 7 and 1. 8 ppb, respectively. When all fish and shellfish were classified according to the kind, the mean value of TBT and TPT was decreased in the order of shellfish, fish, crustacean and cephalopod.
