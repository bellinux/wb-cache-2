5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Express escorted the minelayers Teviot Bank, , and the Dutch [...] as {{they laid}} {{defensive}} minefield around Singapore. On 24 December, she laid 18 mines {{of her own}} to block Japanese access to the harbour of Penang. The ship also escorted convoys to and from Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Express {{was transferred to the}} China Force, which controlled all convoys in the ABDACOM area, on 20 January 1942. Despite a boiler room fire on 6 February that damaged some of her <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> and fuel tanks, the ship remained on escort duties until she arrived at Simonstown, South Africa, on 25 April to begin repairs that lasted until 26 June.|$|E

2500|$|Oriskany was {{the first}} United States warship slated to become an {{artificial}} reef, under authority granted by the fiscal 2004 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 108-136). Oriskany was towed to Pensacola in December 2004 and was originally scheduled to be sunk with controlled charges [...] south of Pensacola by June 2005. Exhaustive ecological and human health studies were conducted by Navy scientists {{in consultation with the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to demonstrate no adverse impact from reefing the ship. Failure to gain EPA [...] approval caused a delay, so Oriskany was then towed back to Texas in June to ride out the 2005 hurricane season. [...] Completion and peer review of a complex Prospective Risk Assessment Model developed in consultation with EPA, the first for any ship reefing project, was necessary to support EPA's February 2006 decision to issue a risk-based PCB disposal approval for the estimated 750lb (340kg) of polychlorinated biphenyls contained in solid form, mostly integral in the insulation layers of the <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> throughout the ship.|$|E

50|$|Note, {{when you}} are using an {{automation}} system, {{there is no need}} to install any <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> to the light switches. In a traditional electrical installation without automation the lights in a room would be wired back to the light switch which in turn would be wired back to the switchboard or some similar arrangement, so keep reading.|$|E
50|$|ElectricalThis is cabling {{installed}} {{from the}} electrical switchboard {{to the light}} fitting or any other device {{that is to be}} controlled by the automation system. For example, if you have four down lights in a room and you wish to control each light individually, then each light will be wired back using <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> back to the electrical switchboard. This means you will have four electrical cables installed from the electrical switchboard to the location where the light fittings will be installed. Each cable will be a three core active, neutral and earth cable.If in that room you also have a free standing lamp plugged into a power point and you also want to control this from your automation system, you will need to have that power point individually wired back to the electrical switchboard.So if you want to individually control every light fitting and every power point or power outlets then each one of these devices must be individually wired back to the electrical switchboard. As you can see this start to become quite a lot of <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> so planning is essential.|$|E

5000|$|These {{innovative}} techniques allow a large ship, such as Ramage, to be {{built in}} three separate hull and superstructure modules and later joined to form the complete ship. Heavy machinery, such as propulsion equipment, as well as piping, duct work, and <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> were installed in hundreds of sub-assemblies, which were joined to form dozens of assemblies. These assemblies were then joined to form the three hull modules. The ship's superstructure, or [...] "deck house", was lifted atop the mid-body module early in the assembly process.|$|E
