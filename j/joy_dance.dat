Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version whilst Prithviraj played the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai also in the cast. Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously but revealed he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions. Vikram revealed that he and Abhishek Bachchan played the roles in the respective versions without inspiration from one another. Despite being a non-speaker and making his debut in Hindi, he dubbed his lines in the language remarking jovially it was the [...] "most difficult thing in the world". After promotions at the Cannes Film Festival and a premiere at Leicester Square in London, the two versions and the dubbed Telugu version released simultaneously in 2,200 screens worldwide and took a big opening on day one earning 20 crores. The Tamil version, Raavanan won rave reviews from critics with The Hindu calling it a [...] "masterstroke" [...] and claiming Vikram [...] "raises the bar higher with every venture". The critic cited that [...] "emotions of love, animus, anguish and <b>joy</b> <b>dance</b> on his face in quick succession", concluding that [...] "Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level". The critic from Sify labelled it as a [...] "astonishing portrayal", while the critic from the Hindustan Times praised Vikram's [...] "ability to get into Veeraiya's skin and emote with conviction". The Tamil version consequently {{went on to become}} a commercial success, with Vikram's performance leading to him winning the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor among other accolades. In contrast, the Hindi version fetched mixed reviews with critics agreeing that Vikram's performance as the tribal leader was more convincing than Bachchan's. Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express rated the film 4/5 and said [...] "Raavan falls for Sita (and vice versa) in an intriguingly idiosyncratic take on the Ramayana– if you can get past the lead performances, that is" [...] whereas Taran Adarsh, writing for Bollywood Hungama rated it 1.5/5 and said, [...] "On the whole, Raavan is a king-sized disappointment, in terms of content" [...] though mentioning that Vikram was [...] "first-rate, although the role isn't substantial enough".
