40|$|Abstract Many torque {{carrying}} {{members have}} circular sections such as shafts. However, {{there are certain}} structural members like automotive chassis <b>frames,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> and machine <b>frames</b> which are often subjected to twisting loads and their cross sections are non circular. several methods were developed to analyze such sections such as Saint Venant’s semi inverse method, Prandtl’s elastic membrane analogy [...] . etc. In this paper, the second order partial differential stress function equation for non-circular torsional members is applied on a rectangular section for different b/h (height /width of section) values and the solutions for maximum torsional shear stress are found by employing second order finite difference method. The results are compared to the results obtained from commercial finite element software (ANSYS 10) and by direct solution of the stress function equation using analytical correlations available for rectangular sections. The results obtained by different approaches are in close congruence with a percentage deviation of only 3. 22. It is observed that, in implementing second order finite difference scheme, the error in estimating stress is proportional to S 2. Where “S” is the grid size.   Keywords: Non-Circular Section, Prandtl’s stress function, Finite difference scheme, Grid size</p...|$|R
50|$|The 1978 Fleetwood Brougham {{was built}} as body on frame construction.

An important feature is that all connections are bolted, so removing the need for onsite welding.|$|R

40|$|Elasto-plastic {{behavior}} of steel reinforced concrete (SRC) space frames subjected to constant axial thrust and repeated biaxial bending with shear is investigated experimentally, {{in order to}} establish an evaluation method for the earthquake resistance ability of SRC structures. Frame specimen consists of a column and four beams arranged in two directions, which modelizes beam-and-column subassemblage in a real building <b>frame.</b> <b>Cross</b> sections of <b>members</b> are made of H-steel (column : 2 H- 150 x 30 x 6 x 9, beam : H- 180 x 50 x 6 x 9) and four main reinforcements encased in concrete. In the test, constant vertical load at the column top and constant beam loads at tips of beams in one-direction are first applied, the latter simulating the long-term load. Then, antisymmetric, alternately repeated shear loads are applied at tips of beams in the order-direction simulating the earthquake load. Experimental parameters selected are axial thrust ratio, intensity and pattern of beam loads corresponding to the long-term load, and failure modes (column-failure type and panel-failure type). The paper discusses the effect of three-dimensional loading on the maximum strength, deformation capacity, energy dissipation capacity, and failure modes, with presenting the test results...|$|R

40|$|The tube {{hydroforming}} {{process is}} a relatively complex manufacturing process; the performance of this process depends on various factors and requires proper combination of part design, material selection and boundary conditions, In manufacturing of automotive parts, such as engine cradles, <b>frames</b> rails, sub-frames, <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> and other parts from circular tubes, pre-bending and per-forming operations are often required prior to the subsequent tubular hydroforming process to fit the tubular blank in the complex die shape. Due to these pre-hydroforming operations, some of the strains are already developed {{before going to the}} actual hydroforming process. Such developed strains before hydroforming process in the part is called as prestrain. In this paper the study of effect of prestrain on formability and forming limit strains during tube hydroforming is done by simulation by taking the material prestrain value. The forming limit strains of pre-strained tube during hydroforming are predicted. A series of tube bulge tests for tube hydroforming are simulated by a commercial finite element solver to predict the limit strains. Numerical simulation of forming limit strains in tube hydroforming with different internal pressure and different simulation set up with or without axial feeding are considered to develop wide range of strain paths in the present work. The effects of process conditions on the forming limit strains are detailed. In this paper the forming limit strains during tube hydroforming are simulated for pre-strain and compared with zero prestrain. Prediction of limits strains is based on a novel thickness based necking criterion...|$|R
40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into {{the roof and}} a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> that ties the angled bolts together. The load on the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{infrared}} (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of advanced high-strength steels (AHSSs). Though the IR local heating method saves heating energy because it utilizes focused IR rays to heat only the plastic deformation zone, there has yet to be an attempt to show that the heating method can be applied to industrial manufacturing processes. In this work, the IR local heating method is used to manufacture a seat <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> Seat <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> require high strength because they are responsible for protecting passengers from broadside collisions. Although AHSS is preferred in seat <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> the large amount of springback of AHSS makes a problem in the accuracy of the shape. This work verifies that the IR local heating method is able to make the seat <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> with the target shape in the manufacturing process. A thermo-mechanical analysis was also conducted with the finite element method to discuss the springback results...|$|R
