[...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press.

[...] But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". [...] Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. [...] He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself, in 1976. [...] A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the [...] "first", [...] "most ambitious", or [...] "most adequate" [...] attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising {{in the wake of the}} New Left.

Its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by All About Eve, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: [...] "It slowly <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond." ...|$|E

2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming.

6000|$|With my last {{flickering}} ray {{of consciousness}} I turned mechanically toward the distance meter. It stood at exactly five {{hundred miles from}} the earth's surface--and then {{of a sudden the}} huge thing that bore us came to a stop. The rattle of hurtling rock through the hollow jacket ceased. The wild racing of the giant drill betokened that it was running loose in AIR--and then another truth flashed upon me. The point of the prospector was ABOVE us. Slowly it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> since passing through the ice strata it had been above. We had turned in the ice and sped upward toward the earth's crust. Thank God!

It was one thing to risk a broken limb when danger appeared to threaten Bonaventure, but quite another to do so for the sake of an unscrupulous adversary. It would have been well for me had I obeyed the first impulse which prompted me--and turned my back upon the fire.|$|E

There was something timely -- and timeless -- about it, something that had a direct bearing on life today. To me it was {{the story of a man}} who must make a decision according to his conscience. His town -- symbol of a democracy gone soft -- faces a horrendous threat to its people's way of life. Determined to resist, and in deep trouble, he moves all over the place looking for support but finding that there is nobody who will help him; each has a reason of his own for not getting involved. In the end, he must meet his chosen fate all by himself, his town's doors and windows firmly locked against him. It is a story that still happens everywhere, every day.|$|R
60|$|And while I don't {{remember}} anything my uncle said or {{did at the}} wedding, I do remember very distinctly certain little things, scrutiny, solicitude, a curious rare flash of intimacy in my aunt's eyes. It <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't hiding anything from her at all. She was dressed very smartly, wearing a big-plumed hat that made her neck seem longer and slenderer than ever, and when she walked up the aisle with that rolling stride of hers and her eye all on Marion, perplexed into self-forgetfulness, it wasn't somehow funny. She was, I do believe, giving my marriage more thought than I had done, she was concerned beyond measure at my black rage and Marion's blindness, she was looking with eyes that knew what loving is--for love.|$|E

I was a little fascinated by it--and then, could I have argued with him? You don't argue against such evidence, and besides it would have looked as if I had wanted to claim all the merit. Already his gratitude was simply frightful. Funny position, wasn't it? The boredom came later, when we lived together on board his ship. I had, {{in a moment of}} inadvertence, created for myself a tie. How to define it precisely I don't know. One gets attached in a way to people one has done something for. But is that friendship? I am not sure what it was. I only know that he who forms a tie is lost. The germ of corruption has entered into his soul." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mata {{had been}} seated near the presidential {{compartment}} and was half-asleep {{at the time}} of the crash. He was initially rendered unconscious after the crash, and came to a few hours later. Mata later recounted: I found myself on the side of a steep cliff among dried bushes…. Agonizing with pain, I was completely at a loss what to do. About three meters away from me were parts of the plane. They were still burning. Meanwhile, I heard the distant howling of a dog. It was only then that I felt hopeful of being rescued. Thinking that there were probably people living not far away from where I lay moaning with pain, I made an effort to shout. I noticed that my voice echoed in the nearby mountains.After that, I began shouting, [...] "Mr. President! Mr. President! Mr. President!" [...] When no answer came, I shouted for Pablo Bautista, the reporter of the Liwayway magazine. [...] "Pabling! Pabling!" [...] Still no answer.

6000|$|I shall find {{a quality}} of dissatisfaction {{throughout}} all these days. I shall come to see this period more and more distinctly as a pause, as a waiting interlude, {{and the idea of}} an encounter with my double, which came at first {{as if it were a}} witticism, as something verbal and surprising, begins to take substance. The idea grows in my mind that after all this is the [...] "someone" [...] I am seeking, this Utopian self of mine. I had at first an idea of a grotesque encounter, as of something happening in a looking glass, but presently it <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my Utopian self must be a very different person from me. His training will be different, his mental content different. But between us there will be a strange link of essential identity, a sympathy, an understanding. I find the thing rising suddenly to a preponderance in my mind. I find the interest of details dwindling to the vanishing point. That I have come to Utopia is the lesser thing now; the greater is that I have come to meet myself.|$|R

"Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{a custom}} {{in this society}} that the {{president}} for the year opens the proceedings not by any general toast of sentiment, but by calling upon each member to give a brief account of his trade. We then drink to that calling and to all who follow it. It is my business, as the senior member, to open by stating my claim to membership of this club. Years ago, gentlemen, I was a judge; I did my best in that capacity to do justice and to administer the law. But it gradually <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in my work, as it was, I was not touching even the fringe of justice. I was seated in {{the seat of the}} mighty, I was robed in scarlet and ermine; nevertheless, I held a small and lowly and futile post. I had to go by a mean rule as much as a postman, and my red and gold was worth no more than his. Daily there passed before me taut and passionate problems, the stringency of which I had to pretend to relieve by silly imprisonments or silly damages, while I knew all the time, by the light of my living common sense, that they would have been far better relieved by a kiss or a thrashing, or a few words of explanation, or a duel, or a tour in the West Highlands. Then, as this grew on me, there grew on me continuously the sense of a mountainous frivolity. Every word said in the court, a whisper or an oath, seemed more connected with life than the words I had to say. Then came the time when I publicly blasphemed the whole bosh, was classed as a madman and melted from public life." ...|$|E

These men are his sons. They went out to America, and got up in the world. They told me the whole story of how they had knocked about everywhere, last evening, but I was too sleepy to enter into it much, though I daresay it was curious enough; successful speculations and hair's-breadth escapes seemed to come very thick one upon another, but all I am clear about is that this poor boy, Fernando's mother was a Mexican heiress, they--one of them, I mean--managed to marry, her father English, but her mother old Spanish blood allied to the old Caciques, he says; whether it is a boast I don't know, but the boy looks like it--such a handsome fellow; delicate straight profile, slender limbs, beautifully made, inky-black hair and brows, pure olive skin--the two doctors were both in raptures. Well, they thought affairs in Mexico insecure, so they sold the poor woman's estate and carried her off to Texas. No; was it? I really can't remember where; but, at any rate, Diego stuck to her wherever she went, and when she died, to her child; nursed him like an old woman, and-- In short, it was that touching negro love that one sometimes hears of. Now they seem to have grown very rich--the American Vice-Consul, who came over this morning from Dearport, knew all about them--and they came home partly on business, and partly to leave Fernando to be made into an English gentleman, who, Mr. Travis says, if he has money to spend, does whip creation. He's English enough for that still. Well, they have got a telegram that makes them both want to sail by the next steamer.' ...|$|E
