5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of <b>flooded</b> <b>forest</b> around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, {{but it is also}} found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E

P. tigrinum occurs in estuarine zones, mainly upstream of the first rapids up to the basin's headwaters. They live in the main bed of slow or fast zones, and the juveniles particularly live in <b>flooded</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R

25|$|Diversity of {{terrestrial}} wildlife and fishes in igapó is highly influenced by flooding. During periods of inundation, {{vast numbers of}} aquatic species migrate into the <b>flooded</b> <b>forest</b> in search of food. Fish populations are highest during maximum fruiting periods and river dolphins and giant otters move in to prey upon them. Compared to terra firme forests, Igapó features lower nutrients and favors slow-growing plants with low fleshy fruit production, which {{has resulted in a}} lower diversity and abundance of animals.|$|E
25|$|Landforms {{present in}} this region include the upland terra firme (non-flooded) mostly on nutrient-poor {{lateritic}} soils, ancient alluvial plains (mostly non-flooded) on nutrient-rich soils, and present alluvial plains (várzea, seasonally flooded) of super-rich sediments renewed with each annual flood. Floristically, distinct lowland humid forest types occur {{on each of these}} landforms with the terra firme mature forests and late successional, seasonally <b>flooded</b> <b>forest</b> being the two major types. Permanent swamp forests are common on the alluvial plains. Pockets of nutrient-poor white sand soils are found here that host forests of lower height, a more open forest canopy, and lower alpha diversity, but with many endemics. The forests are mostly dense tropical rain forest, but some patches of open forest exist.|$|E
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is the igapó <b>flooded</b> <b>forest,</b> where it hunts for insects and {{invertebrates}} in the understory. It is most {{abundant in the}} Cantão wetlands, which form the largest <b>flooded</b> <b>forest</b> of the southeastern Amazon.|$|E

3000|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by the importance of Amazon forests {{and the lack of}} seed rain studies known to be key to its dynamics. In addition I wanted to better understand the spatial heterogeneity (six different forest types common in the Amazonian landscape) and temporal heterogeneity (over a one year period) of the seed rain throughout the Amazon. Therefore I sampled seed rain in three unflooded forests and in three <b>flooded</b> <b>forests</b> of the Western Amazon in Peru. I address these questions: (1) What species of seed are dispersed in these common Amazon forest types, and are there species in common?, (2) How does the number of seeds vary over a one year time period within the three unflooded forests, within the three <b>flooded</b> <b>forests,</b> and between the unflooded <b>forests</b> and the <b>flooded</b> <b>forests?,</b> (3) Does the seed rain of common unflooded forests in the Amazon differ significantly in total number of seeds, species richness, species evenness, and Fisher’s α diversity over a one year sampling?, (4) Does the seed rain of common <b>flooded</b> <b>forests</b> in the Amazon differ significantly in total number of seeds, species richness, species evenness, and Fisher’s α diversity over a one year sampling?, and (5) Does the seed rain of the unflooded forests taken together, and the seed rain of the <b>flooded</b> <b>forests</b> taken together, differ significantly in total number of seeds, species richness, species evenness, and Fisher’s α diversity over a one year sampling?
