5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only {{for a short period}} after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E

25|$|Hilke Kuhlmann's Living Walden Two {{possesses}} many {{subtle and}} not-so-subtle {{criticisms of the}} original Walden Two which {{are related to the}} actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Tibetan architecture <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses and monasteries {{are built on}} elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.|$|E
25|$|Kiarostami {{directed}} The Wind Will Carry Us in 1999, {{which won}} the Grand Jury Prize (Silver Lion) at the Venice International Film Festival. The film contrasted rural and urban views on the dignity of labor, addressing themes of gender equality {{and the benefits of}} progress, by means of a stranger's sojourn in a remote Kurdish village. An unusual feature of the movie <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters are heard but not seen; at least thirteen to fourteen speaking characters in the film are never seen.|$|E
50|$|One way {{in which}} the {{importance}} of the queens can <b>be</b> seen <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them <b>are</b> named on coins; typically the king's name would be on the obverse of the coin and the queen's on the reverse.|$|R

25|$|Beaujolais Blanc & Beaujolais Rosé - A {{small amount}} of white wine made from Chardonnay is grown {{in the region and}} used to produce Beaujolais Blanc or Beaujolais-Villages Blanc. The {{vineyards}} to produces these wines are normally found in the limestone soils of the far northern extremities of the region. Part of the reason for the small production of these wines <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vineyards overlap into the Mâconnais regions and producers will usually choose to label their wines under the more marketable and well known Mâcon Blanc designation. There is also regulations in several Beaujolais communes restricting growers to dedicating no more than 10% of their vineyard space to white wine grape varieties. Beaujolais Rosé made from Gamay is permitted in the Beaujolais AOC but is rarely produced.|$|E
25|$|TCR {{rearrangement}} {{occurs in}} two steps. First the TCRβ chain is rearranged at the DN3 stage of T cell development. The TCRβ chain is paired with the pre-Tα {{to generate the}} pre-TCR. The cellular disadvantage in the rearrangement process <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combinations of the T cell receptor gene fragments are non-functional. To eliminate thymocytes which have made a non-functional T cell receptor, only cells that have successfully rearranged the beta chain to produce a functional pre-TCR are allowed to develop beyond the DN3 stage. Cells that fail to produce a functional pre-TCR are eliminated by apoptosis. This process {{is referred to as}} the beta-selection checkpoint. Successful beta-selection requires that TCRβ is produced, TCRβ is capable of pairing with pre-Tα to generate the pre-TCR, and that the pre-TCR can interact on the cell surface with the TCR signalling proteins.|$|E
25|$|Counties {{have since}} {{gone out of}} use in Australia, and are rarely used or even known {{by most of the}} {{population}} today. Part of the reason is that counties are based on the size of land, rather than population, so in a large country where most of the population live in cities on the coast while the countryside has a very low population density, they have little relevance. The counties which contain the capital cities have millions of people, while those in remote areas have a very small population. The County of Adelaide, for instance, has a larger population than all the other counties in South Australia combined. Another reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counties' borders follow rivers, having been proclaimed before settlements developed, which means that towns which typically grow up on rivers often find themselves in more than one county. Wangaratta, for instance, is located at the junction of the Ovens and King rivers, and is thus in three counties; Moira, Delatite and Bogong.|$|E
50|$|The {{eventual}} result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Spiegle's panel {{drawings of}} Garner were eerily exact, while his later ones of Jack Kelly as Bart, Roger Moore as Beau, and Robert Colbert as Brent, bore practically {{no resemblance to}} the actual actors.|$|R
50|$|A {{second factor}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his {{theories}} <b>were</b> not empirically testable. Although Witmer {{was a major}} advocate for scientific procedures, he often presented his theories as facts, rather than hypotheses. He then often failed to provide methods for testing his theories.|$|R
50|$|A baal teshuva {{movement}} has emerged {{with a significant}} number of Jews from non-traditional homes returning to the observance of grandparents and great grandparents.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this heavy tasks, Görgei went again to Királyrév to hurry its occupation. He saw here {{that the cause of}} the lack of success of his troops <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers and even some officers, instead of fighting, hid themselves in the corn-field near by. He disciplined them, than sent them to join the attack, and finally, {{with the help of the}} artillery, they managed to take Királyrév, and to start the crossing of the bridge from Aszódpuszta. After this Görgei sent order to Leiningen to Zsigárd that the III. corps immediately to start the advancement. But in the meanwhile the II. corps was forced by Austrian and Russian troops to retreat from Pered to Királyrév, and the news coming from Leiningen weren't good either, the III. corps got around from right by a strong enemy column, so he had to order the retreat from Zsigárd towards Farkasd. Hearing these news, Görgei understood that he had lost the right banks of the Vág river and with this the battle.|$|E
25|$|The calvary has {{suffered}} much erosion over the years, not surprisingly {{in view of}} its proximity to {{the sea and the}} sea's winds. This erosion does make some of the parts of the statuary difficult to interpret although it was restored in 2001. The calvary comprises a large rectangular granite pedestal or base which measures 4.50 m by 3.15 m. Around this base are two friezes on which are various sculptures, single or in groups, which recount some incidents in Jesus' life beginning with the Annunciation when the Archangel Gabriel tells the Virgin Mary that she is pregnant with Jesus Christ. The bulk of these statues are in granite except for the Visitation (Christianity), the Nativity of Jesus and the Adoration of the Magi where the local Kersanton stone was used. Kersanton is easier to carve and very resistant to erosion. Research suggests that several masons and workshops were responsible for these sculptures. There is clear evidence that the calvary was originally painted. Another oddity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sculptures are carved in blocks and some have suggested that they were originally carved for display as part of a church wall rather than for a calvary. On {{the eastern side of the}} calvary there is evidence that there had originally been some form of altar table there.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{and protein}} nomenclature are not separate endeavors; they are {{aspects of the}} same whole. Any name or symbol used for a protein can potentially {{also be used for}} the gene that encodes it, and vice versa. But owing to the nature of how science has developed (with knowledge being uncovered bit by bit over decades), proteins and their corresponding genes have not always been discovered simultaneously (and not always physiologically understood when discovered), which is the largest reason why protein and gene names do not always match, or why scientists tend to favor one symbol or name for the protein and another for the gene. Another reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms of life are the same or very similar across species, genera, orders, and phyla, so that a given protein may be produced in many kinds of organisms; and thus scientists naturally often use the same symbol and name for a given protein in one species (for example, mice) as in another species (for example, humans). Regarding the first duality (same symbol and name for gene or protein), the context usually makes the sense clear to scientific readers, and the nomenclatural systems also provide for some specificity by using italic for a symbol when the gene is meant and plain (roman) for when the protein is meant. Regarding the second duality (a given protein is endogenous in many kinds of organisms), the nomenclatural systems also provide for at least human-versus-nonhuman specificity by using different capitalization, although scientists often ignore this distinction, given that it is often biologically irrelevant.|$|E
