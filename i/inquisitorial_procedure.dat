50|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} rise in frequency of trials regarding magic in the later fourteenth century was due to a change from parchment to a cheaper medium of paper. This made it cheaper for more information to be recorded and preserved, therefore we have a greater volume of documented information from this era. While this may have caused {{a slight increase in}} trials against magic, the main reason was in fact the new <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedure</b> of trial and prosecution as mentioned above.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} decision rules and information acquisition in decision-making processes. The setting under consideration is one where information acquisition and decision making are assigned to different agents and the decision-maker’s preferences are not observable. The paper argues that {{the choice of the}} optimal organizational structure at the information acquisition stage depends on the degree of discretion granted to the decision-maker. High discretion ensures more flexibility but requires that information acquisition is assigned to the parties directly involved in the decision. Since they have conflicting interests, the parties provide a check against abusive decisions although at the cost of information manipulation. Low discretion introduces rigidity but allows the delegation of information acquisition to an unbiased agent who ensures truthful reports. Which of these two “optimal combinations ” is preferable is then shown to depend on the probability of finding information when an agent searches. Our analysis sheds light on the stylized fact that Civil Law systems are generally associated with <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedures</b> whereas Common Law systems are combine...|$|R

50|$|Several {{significant}} changes in legal procedures {{had been made by}} 1230 that affected later trials, especially those of the Templars. No longer did a witness need fear reprisals if his accusations were proved untrue. Instead, a new system relying on the testimony of witnesses, judicial latitudes and the <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedure</b> began to dominate criminal trials in most of Europe. In France, the issuance of Cupientes in 1229 by Louis IX of France, Philip's grandfather, gave the kings of France the duty to eliminate heresy in his kingdom. Additionally, from 1230 on, the inquisitors in northern Italy had been given special powers by Pope Honorius III which allowed them to examine even the exempted and protected orders of the Hospitallers, Cistercians and Templars, but only in cases where heresy was suspected. When the Albigensian Crusade was over, these special powers were never revoked but simply forgotten. So Philip's royal lawyers concentrated their charges to this one vulnerable exception, that of heresy, to an otherwise untouchable order, one which answered only to the pope.|$|E

Some scholars view the bull as [...] "clearly political". [...] The bull failed {{to ensure that}} Kramer obtained the support he had hoped for, in fact he was subsequently expelled {{from the city of}} Innsbruck by the local bishop, George Golzer, who ordered Kramer to stop making false accusations. Golzer described Kramer as senile in letters written shortly after the incident. This rebuke led Kramer to write a justification of his views on witchcraft in his book Malleus Maleficarum, written in 1486. In the book, Kramer stated his view that witchcraft was to blame for bad weather. The book is also noted for its animus against women. Despite Kramer's claim that the book gained acceptance from the clergy at the university of Cologne, it was in fact condemned by the clergy at Cologne for advocating views that violated Catholic doctrine and standard <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedure.</b> In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said.|$|E

In contrast, under the adversarial procedure, investigative expenditures will be mainly constrained by individual wealth, leading to inefficient justice levels, higher social cost, and potentially large inequalities. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} written from the {{perspective}} of a court president in The Netherlands, a so called civil law country. In theory, in a civil law country, judges and lawyers in civil and commercial cases base their actions on the application of the law and its interpretation. Moreover, in criminal matters, the courts use <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedures</b> which differ from the adversarial procedures used in common law countries. The field of court management is not highly developed because of the tension between the need for judicial independence and judicial organization. There are many examples of this tension, including the fact that courts may be subject to budgetary limits which themselves may intrude upon judicial independence. For instance, suppose that a judge believes it necessary to appoint an expert to answer a certain scientific question, but the expert is expensive and budgetary considerations preclude the appointment. When I was involved in the process of the budgets of prosecutors’ offices and courts, this question frequently arose. In an effort to deal with this problem, part of the courts’ budgets were treated as open-ended even though courts rarely spent these open-ended budgets lavishly. </span...|$|R
50|$|The {{stereotype}} of the witch finally solidified in the late Middle Ages. Numerous texts singled out women to be especially inclined to witchcraft. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, women defendants outnumbered men two to one. This difference only became more pronounced in the following centuries. The disparity {{between women and men}} defendants was primarily due to the position women held in late medieval society. Women in this era were far less trusted than men, as they were presumably weak minded and easily dissuaded. General misogynist stereotypes further encouraged their prosecution, which lead to a more stiffened {{stereotype of}} witches. Massive witch trials swept across Europe {{in the second half of}} the fifteenth century. In 1428, more than 100 people were burned for killing others, destroying crops, and working harm by means of magic. This trial in the Valais provided the first evidence for the fully developed stereotype of a witch, including flight through the air, transforming humans into animals, eating babies and the veneration of the Devil. The unrestricted use of torture in combination with the adoption of <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedures</b> as well as the development of the witch stereotype and a dramatic rise in public suspicion ultimately caused the swelling fervor and frequency of these sweeping witch hunts.|$|R
5000|$|The sect was doctrinally {{related with}} the earlier Brethren of the Free Spirit. It taught the {{eventual}} salvation of all human beings and even of the demons, maintained that the soul of man cannot be defiled by bodily sin, and believed in a mystical state of illumination and union with God so perfect that it exempted from all subjection to moral and ecclesiastical laws and was an infallible pledge of salvation. Both its leaders, Egidius Cantoris, an illiterate layman, and the Carmelite William of Hildernissen, near Bergen-op-Zoom, gloried in the visions with which they {{claimed to have been}} favoured. Cantoris in a moment of religious exaltation {{went so far as to}} run nude through the streets of Brussels, declaring himself the saviour of mankind. About 1410 Peter d'Ailly, Bishop of Cambrai, seems to have taken the first steps towards the suppression of the heresy. William of Hildernissen consented to a retraction, the sincerity of which appeared doubtful. In 1411, a second investigation resulted in another retraction, but also in a sentence compelling William to return permanently to an extra-diocesan Carmelite monastery after three years' detention in one of the episcopal castles. No information has reached us respecting the result of the <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedure</b> against the other members of the sect.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} magic was further {{developed}} in the high and late Middle Ages. The rise of legal commentaries and consultations during this time lead to the inclusion of law in Universities’ curricula. This fueled a detailed reflection of the principles underlying prosecution for magic. The early fourteenth century brought about the pinnacle of trials involving magic. In this time, several individuals were charged with using magic against both Pope John XXII and the King of France. These trials only enhanced the already growing concern about magic, and thus perpetuated the increasing severity of punishments for such actions. The increase in trials in the late Middle Ages was also {{in part due to}} the shift from accusatory to inquisitorial procedures. In accusatory procedures, the accuser had to provide ample evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. If the accuser failed to do so, or did not have any proof, he or she would have to face the punishment that would have been assigned to the accused had he/she been found guilty. The <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedure</b> allowed judges to undertake prosecution on their own initiative without consequences. This made it easier for the accuser to secure conviction for sorcery, and {{not have to worry about}} having insufficient evidence thus putting their own innocence in jeopardy. Inquisitorial interrogation took many forms, including experiments with reflecting surfaces, invocation of demons, use of human heads to obtain love or hatred, and more.|$|E

On one hand, looking at the medieval origins {{of the office of}} notary throws new light on the early history of notaries and written law in the West as a whole. In Gascony, as in Aragon, Navarre and {{probably}} Castile, the law of Fors and Fueros (local liberties) appears to be extremely ancient Roman law, which in the 13 th century led to a body of "Pyrenean" notaries who were quite different from classic Mediterranean notaries. Moreover, in this region straddling the Pyrenees, the institution of the notary public was superimposed on other structures organised around escrivans or escribanos, and it arrived late. In addition, Pyrenean notaries, whose practices and activity were quite groundbreaking, are far from having been simple public scribes or practitioners of writing. Their tasks were many and varied. They were, first and foremost, jurists and men of law, often the sources who wrote out compendiums of the fors, and even manuals or codes analysing Roman law. They moreover took on an important role in public justice and its <b>inquisitorial</b> <b>procedures,</b> assumed administrative tasks [...] fiscal ones, for example [...] and are revealed to be at the heart of political discourse, writings and the assemblies.

That it terrifies and silence young victim and witnesses from giving evidence. The inquisitorial elements present in South African criminal procedure such as in bail proceedings, plea proceedings, powers of the presiding officer to call, recall and examine witnesses, powers of the presiding officer to exclude inadmissible evidence, evidence on sentence, and investigation on unreasonable delay on trials are discussed. The international instruments pertaining to children {{in conflict with the}} law and child witnesses are examined, together with their impact in our laws relating to children.

5000|$|Through further {{conducted}} research and available evidence, the Roman Inquisition {{were seen in}} a different light. In contrast with feminist arguments, historians like Clarke Garrett, Brian Levack, John Tedeschi, Matteo Duni, and Diane Purkiss pointed out that most witch-trials and executions were conducted by local and secular authorities. Clarke Garrett mentioned the quick decline and insignificance of the Malleus Maleficarum. In-depth historical research regarding minor details {{of different types of}} magic, theological heresies, and political climate of The Reformation further revealed that <b>Inquisitorial</b> <b>procedures</b> greatly restrained witch-hunting in Italy. Scholars specialized in the Renaissance and Early Modern period such as Guido Ruggiero, Christopher F. Black, and Mary O'Neil also discussed the importance of proper procedures and sparse use of torture. The low rate of torture and lawful interrogation, Black argued, means that trials tended to focus more on individual accusation, instead of groups. For the same reason, the notion of the Black Sabbath was much less believed in contemporary Italian popular culture. The Holy Office's function in the disenchantment of popular culture also helped advance rationalism by getting rid of superstitions. Another scholar who combats the claim of the feminist retort of the Inquisition being {{responsible for the death of}} so many women, is Jeffrey R. Watt. Watt points out that in 1588 the Roman Curia stated it would only allow testimony about participation in a Sabbath by the practitioner themselves and not outside witnesses. Additionally, the Inquisition would eventually ban torture for the procurement of a witchcraft confession. [...] The Holy Office also begun seeking punishment for witches to be less harsh and viewed witches as those who had simply lost their way and who could be redeem; not as apostates deserving death.|$|R

These preconditions were largely fulfilled on the Continent, while they were only partially fulfilled in England and in Scotland, and more-so in Scotland than in England.

The majority opinion by Justice Scalia created a dual track system for applying the right of confrontation to hearsay evidence. The first track subjected evidence the opinion called “testimonial” to a severe standard; the evidence was inadmissible unless the declarant was unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Non-”testimonial” evidence ran down the other track to an uncertain destination. The author has argued elsewhere [see forthcoming article at [URL]] that the Court might have found some support for a dual-track right of confrontation {{in the history of}} the Confrontation Clause where the Founders drew a distinction between “accusers” and “witnesses. ” The present essay documents the interpretation of Crawford by state and lower federal courts in the year after the Supreme Court’s decision.

Commencing with a description of the Cape colony’s <b>inquisitorial</b> criminal <b>procedures,</b> the analysis—following Foucault (2000) —conceives of these as powers (political techniques) through which the British claimed an exclusive capacity to enunciate legal “truths” about specific criminal events.

These provide a sense of the judge’s knowledge of crime and criminal punishment in a social context that imagined itself through social differentiation and hierarchy. Third, it reads these colonial power-knowledge formations as generating three congruent political logics that in hybrid combinations have nurtured segmented, racially orientated, and group-based criminal justice arenas.
