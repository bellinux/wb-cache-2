5|$|Further {{successful}} German airborne offensive {{operations were}} carried out in Luxembourg which seized five crossings and communication routes leading into central Belgium. The offensive, carried out by 125 volunteers of the 34th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} Wenner Hedderich, achieved their missions by flying to their objectives using Fieseler Fi 156 Störche. The cost was the loss of five aircraft and 30 dead. With the fort breached, the Belgian 4th and 7th Infantry Divisions were confronted by the prospect of fighting an enemy on relatively sound terrain (for armour operations). The 7th Division, with its 2nd and 18th Grenadier Regiments and 2nd Carabineers, struggled to hold their positions and contain the German infantry on the west bank. The Belgian tactical units engaged in several counterattacks. At one point, at Briegden, they succeeded in retaking the bridge and blowing <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> the other points, Vroenhoven and Veldwezelt, the Germans had had time to establish strong bridgeheads and repulsed the attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Regional Championship matched Tennessee {{with the}} 2nd-seeded Tar Heels, who were coming {{off of a}} 6-point victory over 3rd-seeded Illinois. Summitt's team started off with a 17–11 lead, only to falter and allow Carolina to tie <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 21. Tennessee responded with a 12–6 run to end the first, but Carolina {{answered}} by opening the second half with the first seven points, giving them a one-point lead, 34–33, {{and the first time}} an opponent had held a lead over Tennessee in over three months. Carolina slowly extended the lead as the game continued, until they were eventually leading 61–49, at which point Summitt sent several players, including Holdsclaw (who was on the bench due to a poor shooting performance) back onto the floor. A minute later, Tennessee had cut the deficit to five, and by the five-minute mark the game was tied again, at 62. The teams traded baskets, tying the game at 64 and 66, before Tennessee reached a 70–67 lead, with less than ninety seconds remaining. Carolina was soon forced to start fouling the Lady Vols, who made their free throws and advanced to the Final Four, 76–70. Holdsclaw once again led all scorers, this time with 29, and Semeka Randall had 20. North Carolina was led by Wright and Reid, who had 21 and 20.|$|E

25|$|The ace {{race was}} still on; Boelcke {{became the first}} Überkanone with his 10th victory on 12 March; the {{following}} day, even as he scored, Immelmann scored {{one of the first}} double victories of the war to tie <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 11 all. The dead heat lasted for a week; on 19 March, Boelcke used his usual tactics of pointblank fire to kill the enemy pilot and saw off his Farman's wing with machine gun fire, for win number 12. Immelmann telephoned to congratulate him and ask him for an opportunity to catch up; Boelcke jokingly offered him a week's grace. Boelcke's victory two days later may be seen as symptomatic of his disregard for Immelmann.|$|E
25|$|Alabama {{opened the}} 2006 season by {{defeating}} the Hawaiʻi Warriors 25–17 {{in their first}} all-time visit to Bryant–Denny Stadium. Hawaii got on the board first when Dan Kelly connected on a 42-yard field goal to give the Warriors a 3–0 lead. Alabama tied <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 3–3 on a 31-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal later in the first quarter. The Crimson Tide then took a 10–3 lead of the evening when Tim Castille scored on a three-yard touchdown run {{early in the second}} quarter. Alabama then extended their lead to 15–3 at halftime after the Hawaii punter Kurt Milne knocked the ball out of the endzone because of a bad snap for a safety and Tiffin connected on a 23-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|For {{their last}} road {{game of the}} season, in week 16 the Lions {{traveled}} west to San Francisco to play the San Francisco 49ers.

The 49ers tied <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} first quarter with a 33-yard field goal by Ricky Schmitt. The only score of the 2nd quarter was a 39-yard 49ers field goal just before halftime. In the third quarter came 2 San Francisco TD's. First a 2-yard catch by Vernon Davis, then a 1-yard run by Frank Gore. The Lions kicked another field goal late in the 4th quarter from 38 yards out.

The Sharks tied <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 9:34 on Justin Braun's goal after receiving a pass from Joe Thornton. The Penguins got their second lead {{of the game in}} the second period with Ben Lovejoy's point shot being tipped in off forward Patric Hornqvist's stick. In the third period, Penguins forward Nick Bonino high-sticked Thornton (resulting in some blood being spilled) causing a four-minute power play for the Sharks. In the dying seconds of the power play, Joel Ward fired a slap shot that got past Matt Murray. In overtime, Joonas Donskoi fired a shot that went high over Murray into the net for the game winner.|$|E
25|$|Anthony Crane {{appears to}} have been {{associated}} with religious reform as early as 1572, and after his death in 1583, Elizabeth Crane continued to assist Puritan writers and printers. According to the later testimony of her servant, Nicholas Tompkins, when the Puritan printer Robert Waldegrave's press and type were being destroyed by officers of the Stationers' Company in May 1588 {{as a result of his}} having printed John Udall's The State of the Church of England Laid Open, commonly referred to as Diotrephes' Dialogue, she allowed Waldegrave to bring a case of type, hidden under his cloak, to her London home in St Mary Aldermanbury. The Puritan preacher and pamphleteer John Penry secretly obtained a new press for Waldegrave, and in the late spring of 1588 she allowed Penry and Waldegrave to set <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her country home at East Molesey, Surrey, across the Thames from Hampton Court Palace. The first tract to be printed on the secret press was Udall's Demonstration of Discipline.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken dock worker, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed before, managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Despite the structure, {{interference}} {{has become}} common inside the Elimination Chamber. At New Year's Revolution 2005, Ric Flair distracted guest referee Shawn Michaels allowing Batista {{who had been}} eliminated to attack Randy Orton so Triple H could win the match. At No Way Out 2009, Edge attacked Kofi Kingston during his entrance and locked himself {{in one of the}} pods becoming a participant in the match for the World Heavyweight Championship after losing the WWE Championship earlier in the night. At Elimination Chamber 2010, Cody Rhodes passed Ted DiBiase Jr. a metal pipe which he used to eliminate Randy Orton in the match for the WWE Championship. Later in the night, Shawn Michaels broke into the Chamber match to cost The Undertaker his World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Jericho. At the 2013 Elimination Chamber event, Mark Henry took out the remaining participants in the Chamber match for a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 29 after being eliminated until SmackDown GM Booker T broke <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> the 2014 Elimination Chamber for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, The Wyatt Family interfered by attacking John Cena, which would lead to his eventual elimination. Kane would come out to help escort The Wyatt Family out of the Chamber match, but would then interfere costing Daniel Bryan the match to Randy Orton.|$|E
25|$|After {{a disappointing}} {{end to the}} 2010 season, Nebraska began 2011 with wins in its first four games against Chattanooga, Fresno State, Washington, and Wyoming. Nebraska was {{defeated}} by the Wisconsin Badgers in the Cornhuskers' first Big Ten Conference game. The Cornhuskers came out strong tying <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 14–14 with four minutes {{to go in the}} 2nd quarter, but Wisconsin's offense dominated Nebraska in the 2nd half and ending up winning the game with a score of 48–17. Nebraska rebounded by winning three games in a row, including a 21-point second half comeback – the largest in school history – against Ohio State and a 24–3 win versus #9 Michigan State. After that winning streak they were upset by the unranked Northwestern Wildcats where they suffered two fumbles inside the Northwestern 30 yard line. Following the loss came the game against #12 Penn State. The week leading up to the game had much of the national focus revolving the firing of coach Joe Paterno and the sexual assault charges in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. A prayer was held before the game for both teams by Nebraska running backs coach Ron Brown. The Cornhuskers would win the game 17–14. January 2, 2012, Nebraska lost the 2012 Capital One Bowl to the South Carolina Gamecocks, 13–30.|$|E
