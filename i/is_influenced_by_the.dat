5|$|The {{climate of}} the Itcha Range <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt {{the flow of the}} prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, casting a rain shadow over the Itcha Range.|$|E

5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability {{for the various}} prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E

5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem's {{average annual}} {{relative}} humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels {{are at their}} lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.|$|E
5|$|Social {{behaviour}} <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{climate and}} geography; as such, the impala are territorial {{at certain times}} of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different {{times of the year}}. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E

5|$|The Andes prevent rain-bearing clouds {{from the}} Pacific Ocean from moving in, while its {{latitude}} {{puts it in}} a band of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping the region dry. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged. The Cuyo region <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> subtropical, semi–permanent South Atlantic High to the east in the Atlantic, the semi-permanent South Pacific High {{to the west of}} the Andes, and the development of the Chaco Low and westerlies in the southern parts of the region. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer due to the stronger interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic High.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Level Mountain <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt {{the flow of the}} prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, casting a rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and flat profile, it has subtle differences in climate, particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates from which to choose.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{proximity}} of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate {{from that of the}} rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E

5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E
5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can be talked with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, the demon will attack. Once a demon is won over, they are given a loyalty meter which <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> player's actions. If the demon is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, the demon will begin to disobey the protagonist, then leave. Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. Demon fusion is governed by a comparability system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better demon compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after {{a certain point in}} the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E
5|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} contains orexinergic neurons {{that control}} appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system. The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through {{the release of}} peptides such as oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as dopamine into the median eminence. Through the autonomic projections, the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, sweating, and other homeostatic mechanisms. The hypothalamus also {{plays a role in}} thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever. The hypothalamus <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> kidneys – when blood pressure falls, the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink. The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals, and hormone release by the digestive system.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, {{and the lack of}} judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for Jordanian hospitality and <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served {{towards the end of}} a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird usually nests on {{isolated}} cliff faces, {{in loose}} colonies. It uses a simple scrape nest, {{located in a}} place it can easily take off from. The age of first breeding is usually five years, although this age is variable; a three-year-old tropicbird was once seen breeding. In some locations, breeding happens year-round, while in others, breeding occurs seasonally. For example, for islands in the California Current, breeding starts in November or December, while it occurs year-round in the Galapagos. Breeding <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> availability of food, {{with an increase in}} food generally causing an increase in breeding. Individually, this bird only breeds every nine to twelve months. A breeding bird usually returns to its partner and nest location from the previous breeding cycle.|$|E
