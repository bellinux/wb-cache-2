This consists {{of a series of}} horizontal rasp bars fixed across the path of the crop and {{in the shape of a}} quarter cylinder. Moving rasp bars or rub bars pull the crop through concaved grates that separate the grain and chaff from the straw. The grain heads fall through the fixed concaves. What happens next is dependent on the type of combine in question. In most modern combines, the grain is transported to the shoe by a set of 2, 3, or 4 (possibly more on the largest machines) augers, set parallel or semi-parallel to the rotor on axial mounted rotors and perpendicular Flow" [...] combines.) In older Gleaner machines, these augers were not present. These combines are unique in that the cylinder and concave is set inside <b>feederhouse</b> instead of in the machine directly behind the <b>feederhouse.</b> Consequently, the material was moved by a [...] "raddle chain" [...] from underneath the concave to the walkers. The clean grain fell between the raddle and the walkers onto the shoe, while the straw, being longer and lighter, floated across onto the walkers to be expelled. On most other older machines, the cylinder was placed higher and farther back in the machine, and the grain moved to the shoe by falling down a [...] "clean grain pan", and the straw [...] "floated" [...] across the concaves to the back of the walkers.|$|E

Knowledge of where grain resides in a combine, cleaning labor requirements, and resulting purity levels would assist producers. Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain. The greatest amounts of corn and soybean material (17 to 74 lb) {{were found in the}} grain tank and rock trap. Intermediate amounts were found in the head or <b>feederhouse,</b> elevators, and at times the cylinder/rotor (soybeans), the unloading auger (soybeans, oats), and rear axle/chopper area. The least amounts were found in the cleaning shoe and straw walkers (cylinder-type machine). Time spent to clean the combine varied from about two hours to seven hours. Cleaning the head, grain tank, threshing rotor/cylinder, and cleaning shoe required more time than other areas. Immediately after cleaning, small amounts of prior (commingled) grain and foreign material, 0. 2 to 2. 5 lb, were found in the first bushel of subsequent grain harvested. Following clean-outs, commingled grain levels dropped below 0. 5 % after 20 bu were harvested. Over 14 lb of wheat were found during the first clean-out of a combine following 50 ac of oat harvest (no physical clean-out prior to oat harvest) ...|$|E
