5|$|While The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig {{appears to}} be the quintessential Ulster Cycle story in theme and narrative, there are certain unusual {{elements}} of the extant forms which suggest it may have a more satiric quality, parodying the heroic genre of the Ulster Cycle. The eponymous pig of Mac Da Thó may be mythic in origin, but its highly exaggerated size may also be satiric. In the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the Ulaid and Connachta go to war over a mythic best, the finest bull in Ireland, whereas <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to blows over a dog.|$|E
25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - {{harmful to}} the ozone layer; emitted from {{products}} are currently banned from use. These are gases which are released from air conditioners, refrigerators, aerosol sprays, etc. On release into the air, CFCs rise to the stratosphere. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> in contact with other gases and damage the ozone layer. This allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the earth's surface. This can lead to skin cancer, eye disease and can even cause damage to plants.|$|E
500|$|When he {{finishes}} writing his script, Barton celebrates by dancing at a USO show. The song {{used in this}} scene is a rendition of [...] "Down South Camp Meeting", a swing tune. Its lyrics (unheard in the film) state: [...] "Git ready (Sing) / <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come!</b> The choir's all set". These lines echo the title of Barton's play, Bare Ruined Choirs. As the celebration erupts into a melee, {{the intensity of the}} music increases, and the camera zooms into the cavernous hollow of a trumpet. This sequence mirrors the camera's zoom into a sink drain just before Audrey is murdered earlier in the film.|$|E
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> {{suddenly}} on {{the body}} of a man, the feet and limbs of which were dreadfully mangled, showing that the miserable wretch had perished under the bastinado.|$|R
60|$|All were willing, {{and soon}} the {{vicinity}} was left far behind. Then <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to where a fair sized brook flowed into Bass Lake, and <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to anchor and began to fish, while Powell took several photographs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly. There was an American family named Endicott over <b>here.</b> <b>They</b> <b>came</b> {{from somewhere}} out West. They had a {{daughter}} about Laura's age, and the two were chums. I think your sister sailed with the Endicotts for the States." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "And {{it looks}} as if they were winning the way the Offaly men are just {{dithering}} and dawdling there...and <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come.</b> [...] This is Liam Connor the full-back...a high, lobbing, dropping ball in towards the goalmouth...a shot and a GOAL, a GOAL, a GOAL FOR OFFALY! [...] There was a goal in the game! [...] A goal. Oh, what a goal!" [...] - O'Hehir's reaction as Séamus Darby scores the winning goal for Offaly in the 1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, denying Kerry a famous fifth consecutive All-Ireland title.|$|E
2500|$|... "I really {{believed}} in the horse. I was going so fast in the last 300 metres I knew no other horse would pass me. I had the best horse and I wanted to show how good he is. His record is unbelievable and he {{is probably the best}} horse I have ridden". Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said [...] "It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England - that's what it's about. When you're drawn wide, if you stay wide for a long time, you can run your own little race and not be bothered by anyone and then slot across. It was perfect as we sat behind the pacemaker and then kicked because as Frankie says, if you don't kick at a certain time <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> like arrows at your back". He also suggested that the horse might make a final appearance in the Breeders' Cup Turf, saying [...] "The owner is keen on the Breeders' Cup. It's a month away. If he's in good order, there's no reason we couldn't go there".|$|E
60|$|Guta. See <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> Dame Isentrudis {{and your}} children, all Safe down the cliff path, through the {{whirling}} snow-drifts.|$|E
50|$|They also beat Sporting Clube de Portugal and Anderlecht to amazingly {{reach the}} European Cup semi-final, <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> up against cup favourites A.C Milan who {{proved to be}} too strong for Dundee, Milan went on to lift the trophy at Wembley Stadium.|$|R
60|$|The ten galleys went {{on without}} observing any thing {{remarkable}} {{until they reached}} the island of Sciathus. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> in sight of three Greek ships, a sort of advanced guard, which had been stationed there to watch the movements of the enemy.|$|R
60|$|But {{distances}} in {{the open}} air are deceiving, and the boys rode along over the plains for the best part of an hour before they reached a spot where the trail branched in several directions. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to a halt, wondering which way to turn next.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whom {{could they}} thus intimidate, but their own wives and children? But, <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> in a noble body, {{and we can}} speak to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{see them}} Pullman porters, [...] Dolled up with scented waters [...] Bought with their dimes and quarters! [...] See, <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come!</b> Here they come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, as you say, you can {{be married}} again, Arnold, which would {{certainly}} be best in all respects, and might save litigation some day. But <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> I think." ...|$|E
60|$|Hardly {{daring to}} breathe, Henry awaited their close approach, {{his left hand}} holding down the bushes and his right on his gun. Soon the warriors were {{at the spot where}} Mrs. Risley had fainted. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to a halt and began to talk in low tones.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were four}} Indians {{about a mile}} south from <b>here.</b> <b>They</b> <b>came</b> from the city last night, and are searching. It was {{possible}} to hear them talk. The sentinels near the coast have been doubled in number, {{and there is little}} hope we could pass them." ...|$|R
6000|$|LONG--[Excitedly.] Church is out. <b>'Ere</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> the bleedin' swine. [After {{a glance}} at Yank's {{lowering}} face--uneasily.] Easy goes, Comrade. Keep yer bloomin' temper. Remember force defeats itself. It ain't our weapon. We must impress our demands through peaceful means--the votes of the on-marching proletarians of the bloody world! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your name is Greatson, is it not--Arnold Greatson? You were {{pointed out}} to me once at the Vagabonds' Club, and I never forget a face. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come!</b> Look! Look!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's the old stager for me. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> again! He's got {{a pretty}} style, and he covers his points well, but it isn't the best looking that wins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See, baas, <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> {{the white}} people {{on one side and}} the black on the other, just like the goats and the sheep at Judgment Day in the Book." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{followed}} the trail for fully half a mile, through {{something of a}} hollow between the mountains. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> on quite a pond, much to their surprise. The pond was filled with lilies and other flowers, and on one side {{was a series of}} rocks leading to quite a cliff.|$|R
60|$|It was no {{easy task}} to turn the team and the boxsled around without {{spilling}} everything again. But it was accomplished at last, and then slowly and painfully they climbed along the hill {{until they reached the}} point where there had been another split in the road. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to a halt.|$|R
60|$|A long, melodious whistle was {{floating}} through the outside air, and Dave and Roger knew {{it came from}} Phil Lawrence. They hurried from the broad porch to the garden path, and {{around the corner of}} the carriage shed. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> upon their chum, carrying on his shoulder an old door upon which he had painted the upright figure of what was supposed to be a bear.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's an old dodge," [...] {{observed}} Joseph Morris. [...] "They {{want us to}} {{look for}} them on that side while they make a dash on this. See, <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The men is {{bringing}} {{him up the}} road. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> now. You'd better go back, and kinder break the news to the folks. I'm terribly gritty--as gritty as any man--but I can't do that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That won't matter," [...] {{declared}} Ozma. [...] "The {{old life}} can {{have very little}} to interest them, and the sooner they begin the new life here the happier they will be. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> my dear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, señor," [...] Maria said; [...] "but {{when they}} find that they can't get in <b>here,</b> <b>they</b> will <b>come</b> in through the {{openings}} above." ...|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the deer and the hare were lashed to the sledge--which the Irishman {{asserted}} was a great improvement, inasmuch as the carcass of the former made an excellent seat--and they were off again at full gallop over the floes. They travelled without further interruption or mishap until they drew near to the open water, when suddenly <b>they</b> <b>came</b> upon a deep fissure or crack in the ice, about four feet wide, with water in the bottom. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to a dead stop.|$|R
60|$|After {{leaving the}} {{vicinity}} of the cabin, the Comanches struck a trail leading through a cedar brake over the hill back of the cattle shed. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> together, and without halting swept straight along the Guadalupe River, as previously mentioned. They felt that the whites would follow them, and their one hope of safety lay in gaining the wilderness about San Saba Hill, sixty to seventy miles north of San Antonio.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> and they've got a bear!" [...] shrieked Belle, who {{saw them}} first, {{and all the}} inmates of the {{bungalows}} hurried to the scene, even Mr. Lawrence hobbling up {{with the aid of}} a cane.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is a bad}} cut," [...] Ronald smiled, [...] "but a cut is of no {{consequence}} {{one way or the}} other. Now let us {{join the}} others. Ah, <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> with Kreta showing them the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Catch me! no, darling; but don't {{be afraid}} of them. They won't hurt you, Minnie, and they can't hurt me--except {{in the way of}} cutting short our interview. Ha! <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>come.</b> Goodbye, dearest; I'll see you soon again." ...|$|E
60|$|Ralph {{was more}} than willing to do this--anything to learn what had really become of his game, and so they {{continued}} up the river bank for the best part of half a mile. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to a creek, leading directly west, and saw that the footprints followed this new water-course. Along the creek the way was rocky and uneven, and it was plain to see where the deer had been dragged along.|$|R
6000|$|... "If that's the case," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "all {{we can do}} is to wait <b>here</b> till <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> and {{get them}} to send us away in their ship. But whether they've just gone or are just a-comin' back depends, I suppose, on whether they live in a freezin' or a burnin' country; and if they don't like our bein' <b>here</b> when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> back, there's one thing they can make up their minds to, and that is that I'm never goin' to leave this place on a life-preserver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why {{can we not}} {{run away}} at once?" [...] Virginie said. [...] "Why should we wait <b>here</b> till <b>they</b> <b>come</b> and take us and carry us away and kill us?" ...|$|R
