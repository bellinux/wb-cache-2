5|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> {{investigation}} in Kenya or {{the situation in}} the Republic of Kenya is an ongoing investigation by the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> (ICC) into the responsibility for the 2007–2008 post-election violence in Kenya. The 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis followed the presidential election that was held on 27 December 2007. The Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected; supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to many deaths, injuries and displacements.|$|E

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{argument of}} this thesis is that, contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have, to varying degrees, exerted significant impacts on judicial, legislative, and executive, thoughts, processes, and actions within conflict, post-conflict and non-conflict {{states in the}} Commonwealth. This thesis analyzes evidence of these impacts by examining states in the Commonwealth, where contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have operational and jurisdictional relevance. It does this by categorizing such states into four groups of states, conflict, post-conflict, non-conflict states and states where contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have made marginal impacts. The thesis evaluates the impacts of contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals in these states by analyzing evidence, garnered from a study of judicial, legislative and executive actions and processes influenced directly or indirectly by contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals with operational and jurisdictional relevance in the Commonwealth. The thesis also undertakes {{an assessment of the}} overall impact of contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals in the Commonwealth on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, actions and processes. In assessing the impact, the thesis is framed by two overarching arguments which {{set the tone for the}} discussions and analysis undertaken here. The first is that, certain factors such as engagement by the different courts and tribunals with states, the role of states actors and institutions; have helped contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals exert marginal to major influences on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, processes and actions within the Commonwealth. The second overarching argument made in the thesis in assessing the impact of these contemporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals is that, certain factors such as the poor visibility of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals within Commonwealth States, conflicting visions of justice that these courts and tribunals ought to dispense by relevant stakeholders and the non-transposition of the norms of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> law and <b>international</b> humanitarian law within Commonwealth States; have inhibited the impact of these courts and tribunals on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, processes and actions within the Commonwealth. It concludes by noting that <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have had different levels of impacts on states across the Commonwealth due to the coalescence of the foregoing factors...|$|R

At the event he discussed the role of Christianity in the United States public life and delivered his stump speech.

5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court,</b> were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E

From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> law is {{relatively}} new and rapidly developing. This dissertation examines whether <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> enable defence counsel to conduct an effective defence. When the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda (the ad hoc Tribunals) were {{set up in the}} mid-nineties to prosecute those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law, not much thought had been given to the organisation of the defence. The Statutes of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> are concise about the right to legal assistance {{and the role of the}} defence in its proceedings. <b>International</b> <b>criminal</b> trials generally involve highly complicated issues of <b>criminal,</b> <b>international</b> and international humanitarian law. Therefore, the assignment of only one counsel is insufficient to guarantee a fair trial to the accused. Currently, two defence counsel, one or two investigators and one or two legal assistants are generally assigned to defence teams at <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts.</b> This dissertation examines the position of the defence at <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> given the sui generis character of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> proceedings. It analyzes important defence issues, such as legal aid, equality of arms, professional ethics and disciplinary law and the right to self-representation...|$|R

5|$|Madagascar has {{historically}} been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being {{a founding member of}} the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina. Madagascar is a member of the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military. Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers {{to continue its}} illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E

40|$|SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN ARMED CONFLICT - THE ROLE OF THE <b>INTERNATIONAL</b> <b>CRIMINAL</b> COURTS The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} the phenomenon of sexual violence against women in armed conflicts and to describe {{the influence of the}} <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> in understanding of this phenomenon. Sexual violence appears in almost every armed conflict. Until the establishment of the <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> in the ninetees the issue of sexual violence against women in armed conflict was overlooked. The prohibition of such treatment was existing, for example The Hague Convention or The Geneva Convention, however no efficient sanction mechanism to punish the perpetrators was existing. The violence against woman was moreover understood as her honour attack without any consequences for the community and the society as a whole. It was a private crime. Mass violation of the human rights in the area of Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda made the United Nations to begin with prosecuting and punishing such treatment. Rape and other forms of sexual violence was recognized as a war crime and the crime against humanity {{on the basis of the}} judgements of the <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts.</b> Rape can, under certain circumstances, fulfill the fact of the case of genocide. The <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> strongly made [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Professor Damaska {{contends that}} without an {{understanding}} of the particular goals and contexts of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> adjudication, it is difficult to assess the adequacy of the substantive and procedural law used by <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts.</b> He analyzes the broad array of objectives judges have set for themselves in <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and show that they are often, in his view, conflicting. He explains what consequences this has for <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> litigation. His proposed solution is to abandon some of these ambitious goals and to modify others in order to make adjudication in these courts effective. Runtime: 01 : 21 : 5...|$|R
5|$|In the conflict's {{early months}} it {{appeared}} that Gaddafi's government—with its greater fire-power—would be victorious. Both sides disregarded the laws of war, committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks. On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians. In March, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation. Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents, and along with France and the United Arab Emirates provided the NTC with weaponry and training. NATO {{announced that it would}} enforce the no-fly zone. On 30 April a NATO air strike killed Gaddafi's sixth son and three of his grandsons in Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2010, a {{week after}} the ICC Prosecutor {{announced}} the individuals he was seeking to prosecute, the Kenyan National Assembly passed a motion seeking to withdraw Kenya as a State Party to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court.</b> The motion, which was introduced by Assembly Member Isaac Ruto had previously been thrown out of the National Assembly by Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim who ruled it was unconstitutional; however an amended version was introduced the following day and passed. During the debate, the Minister for Energy Kiraitu Murungi claimed the ICC was a colonialist, imperialist court. This motion did not itself affect Kenya's status as a State Party to the Rome Statute, but rather obliges ministers to move to repeal Kenya's International Crimes Act which ratified the Rome Statute and made necessarily changes to Kenyan's criminal code. In February 2011, Kenya appealed to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to defer the trials at The Hague. Some critics in Kenya have also questioned the constitutionality of the Rome Statute, arguing that it is incompatible with the Constitution of Kenya, which was passed by a referendum in 2010.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{proliferation}} of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> has inspired {{human rights activists}} and votaries of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> justice to make triumphant gestures. Their jubilation is readily understandable, since these courts have added teeth-even if milk ones-to norms that outline internationally punishable conduct. As a result, the view that such attempts to enforce <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> law are lubberly invasions by people in wigs and gowns into an area that should be left open to the play of political forces has been seriously called into question. Despite the justified glee of devotees of international justice, however, {{it would be wrong}} to close our eyes to the shortcomings of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts.</b> Some of these shortcomings are, at present, inevitable. Because no cluster of effective supranational institutions yet exists to enforce <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> law, the effective operation of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> must depend on the unstable reserve of political will, especially in world capitals. Without the cooperation and support of individual states, international courts are doomed to impotence: for example, they have no power to arrest, to compel the production of evidence, nor to enforce judgments. For these reasons alone, a rigorous system for the rule of law cannot at present be established; justice cannot meaningfully be administered without regard to the volatile and complex world of international politics. Powerful actors in the international arena are in position to ignore the demands of international courts, and the sword of justice tends to be used most against individuals from states that occupy a lowly place in the de facto existing hierarchy of states. Absent outside pressures by well-endowed nations, even weak states can defy the mandates of international courts with impunity. 1 But some weaknesses of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> can be reduced, or eliminated, even in the present state of international relations. These curable weaknesses have many sources. An important one, to which the following pages will be devoted, springs from the array of goals <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> have set for themselves...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyse the {{influence}} of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> law, as applied by <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts,</b> specifically in the field of pronounced or executed sentences. This influence is neither direct nor explicit. Therefore, it is interesting to compare the treatment of sentencing by <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> tribunals with the criteria established by the ECtHR, especially in relation to long-term sentences. This com- parison raises three important questions: proportionality, legality and the issue of life imprisonment. Regarding proportionality and legality it seems that most ECtHR criteria are not respected by <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts.</b> Regarding life imprisonment, this article gives me the opportunity to discuss whether this type of sentence ç as provided by the statutes of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> tribunals ç could constitute inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of the European Convention on Human Rights. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Then it will take inspiration from classical and recent theories in legal sociology and legal anthropology to assess whether there is a theoretical basis for the demand for democracy. It concludes that there is no viable argument that would support requiring a direct democratic basis for <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts,</b> but there are clear points of departure for insisting that they should pursue wider social aims, for identifying these aims, and for identifying principles that can guide the conduct of relationships with affected populations...|$|R
