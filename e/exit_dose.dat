50|$|In {{the field}} of medical procedures, Proton therapy, or proton beam therapy {{is a type of}} {{particle}} therapy that uses a beam of protons to irradiate diseased tissue, most often in the treatment of cancer. The chief advantage of proton therapy over other types of external beam radiotherapy is that as a charged particle the dose is deposited over a narrow range and there is minimal <b>exit</b> <b>dose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Radiation Oncologists {{have been}} using proton therapy to treat cancer since the 1950s. Long {{recognized}} for their targeting capability, proton beams achieve greater precision than traditional X-rays, while exposing healthy tissue to less radiation. This allows physicians to deliver high doses of radiation even when tumors are close to sensitive organs and tissue. A proton therapy beam’s powerful energy is focused directly on a patient’s tumor. Once released, the energy stops - there is no <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> and no additional radiation unlike X-ray beams and gamma knife rays.|$|E

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Scanditronix EDP- 20 diodes and 7 LiF thermoluminescent chips, irradiated in a 8 MV linac, were studied with similar build-up cap geometries and materials in order to assure an equivalent electronic equilibrium. Identical calibration methodology was applied to both detectors for the dose determination in clinical conditions. RESULTS: For the entrance dose evaluation over 249 field measurements, {{the ratio of the}} measured dose to the expected dose, calculated from tabulated tissue maximum ratios, was equal to 1. 010 +/- 0. 028 (1 s. d.) from diodes and 1. 013 +/- 0. 041 from thermoluminescent crystals. For the <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> measurements, these ratios were equal to 0. 998 +/- 0. 049 and 1. 016 +/- 0. 070 for diodes and TLDs, respectively, after application of a simple inhomogeneity correction to the calculation of the expected <b>exit</b> <b>dose.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Thermoluminescence and semiconductors led to identical results for entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> evaluation but TLDs were characterised by a lower reproducibility inherent to the TL process itself and to the acquisition and annihilation procedures...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To use portal images {{acquired}} in routine circumstances for assessment of midplane dose {{variations in the}} patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Optical density readings are performed on routinely acquired Verification films of breast and ear-nose-throat (ENT) cancer patients and these readings are converted into relative doses with the sensitometric curve. (1) The impact of redistribution is evaluated on films taken close to the patient exit surface and at routine focus film distance. (2) Midplane doses are estimated from film readings to assess dose variations in the patient. The influence of wedges is evaluated. Film measurements doses are compared with calculated <b>exit</b> <b>doses.</b> RESULTS: (1) In regions with large variations in {{the distance between the}} patient exit surface and the film but without inhomogeneities in tissue density, the relative doses distributions read on films acquired at large focus-film-distance (FFD) are proportional to <b>exit</b> <b>doses.</b> In regions with flat exit surfaces but with inhomogeneities in tissue density, the redistribution has only a small impact. (2) Large variations in relative midplane doses were found in both breast (85 - 115 %) and ENT (- 3. 6 to + 15 %) patients. The application of a wedge was shown to increase dose homogeneity in the midplane. A good agreement (differences < 3 %) was found between <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> obtained from film readings and <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> calculated with the treatment planning system (TPS). CONCLUSION: Films {{acquired in}} routine circumstances at large FFD can be used to obtain information on <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> and to assess midplane doses in breast and ENT, without the use of a TPS. Film dosimetry can also provide a quality assurance tool to check actually delivered doses in patients by comparing <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> estimated on film to expected <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> calculated by the TPS. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> are {{commonly}} measured in in vivo dosimetry for comparison with expected values, usually {{generated by the}} treatment planning system (TPS), to verify accuracy of treatment delivery. This report aims to evaluate the accuracy of six TPS algorithms in computing entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> for a 6 MV beam. The algorithms tested were: pencil beam convolution (Eclipse PBC), analytical anisotropic algorithm (Eclipse AAA), AcurosXB (Eclipse AXB), FFT convolution (XiO Convolution), multigrid superposition (XiO Superposition), and Monte Carlo photon (Monaco MC). Measurements with ionization chamber (IC) and diode detector in water phantoms were used as a reference. Comparisons were done in terms of central axis point dose, 1 D relative profiles, and 2 D absolute gamma analysis. Entrance doses computed by all TPS algorithms agreed to within 2 % of the measured values. <b>Exit</b> <b>doses</b> computed by XiO Convolution, XiO Superposition, Eclipse AXB, and Monaco MC agreed with the IC measured doses to within 2 %- 3 %. Meanwhile, Eclipse PBC and Eclipse AAA computed <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> were higher than the IC measured doses by up to 5. 3 % and 4. 8 %, respectively. Both algorithms assume that full backscatter exists even at the exit level, leading to an overestimation of <b>exit</b> <b>doses.</b> Despite good agreements at the central axis for Eclipse AXB and Monaco MC, 1 D relative comparisons showed profiles mismatched at depths beyond 11. 5 cm. Overall, the 2 D absolute gamma (3 %/ 3 mm) pass rates were better for Monaco MC, while Eclipse AXB failed mostly at the outer 20 % of the field area.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermoluminescence {{dosimeters}} (TLDs) {{are widely}} used for quality assurance in radiation therapy. To avoid steep dose gradients, such measurements are usually made at either the depth of maximum dose Dmax or at the exit skin surface, to assess in vivo the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> respectively. The build-up caps to be used have, among others, to induce minimal perturbation to the treatment field and the registered dose to be {{as close as possible}} to that to be assessed in order to reduce the size of the possible errors of the measurement. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence on the TL signal of the geometrical characteristics of cylindrical caps made of various materials at various photon fields. Cylindrical caps of various sizes made of plexiglas, aluminum, copper and stainless steel were constructed to accommodate four 3. 1 x 3. 1 x 0. 9 mm LiF: Mg, Ti TLDs per cap. The relationships between the doses registered by the TLDs and the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> measured in phantoms with ionization chambers in 6 and 15 MV fields, were determined. The deviations from the dose registered by the TLDs and those measured by ionization chambers, increased with increasing material density. The ratio of the measured dose to the expected dose was equal to 2. 5 %. The signal increased with build-up cap atomic number. On the other hand, build-up caps made up of Cu were found to be optimum for high-energy photon fields and caps made up of Plexiglas for low energy fields...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{describes}} a two dimensional electronic portal imaging device (EPID) transit dosimetry model that can predict either: (1) in-phantom <b>exit</b> <b>dose,</b> or (2) EPID transit dose, for treatment verification.

In this study, two sets of quadratic equation coefficients were derived from calibration dose planes measured with EPID and ionization chamber in water under reference conditions. With two sets of coefficients, EPL can be calculated from either EPID or treatment planning system (TPS) dose planes. Consequently, either the in-phantom <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> or the EPID transit dose can be predicted from the EPL.

40|$|During a {{radiotherapy}} treatment, a dosimetric verification or a geometric localization can be done, {{in order}} to assess the quality of the treatment. The dosimetric verification is generally performed measuring the dose at some points inside (natural cavities) or outside the patient, and comparing it to the dose at the same points calculated and predicted by the treatment planning system. This can be done either with thermoluminescent or diodes dosimeters or with ionization chambers. The geometric localization can be done acquiring a portal image of the patient. Portal imaging can be performed either with films placed between metallic screens, or with an electronic portal imaging device such as fluoroscopic systems, solid state devices or matrix ionization chamber systems. In order to assess possible field placement errors, the portal images have to be compared with images have to be compared with images obtained with the simulator in the same geometric conditions and/or with the digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) obtained with the treatment planning system. In particular, when using matrix ionization chamber systems, the portal images contain also information regarding the <b>exit</b> <b>dose.</b> This means that this kind of imaging device can be used both for geometric localization and for dosimetric verification. In this case, the <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> measured by the portal image can be compared with the <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> calculated and predicted by the treatment planning system.

40|$|In vivo {{dosimetry}} {{is one of}} {{the quality}} assurance tools used in radiotherapy to monitor the dose delivered to the patient. Electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images for a set of solid water phantoms of varying thicknesses were acquired and the data fitted onto a quadratic equation, which relates the reduction in photon beam intensity to the attenuation coefficient and material thickness at a reference condition. The quadratic model is used to convert the measured grey scale value into water equivalent path length (EPL) at each pixel for any material imaged by the detector. For any other non-reference conditions, scatter, field size and MU variation effects on the image were corrected by relative measurements using an ionization chamber and an EPID. The 2 D EPL is linked to the percentage <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> table, for different thicknesses and field sizes, thereby converting the plane pixel values at each point into a 2 D dose map. The off-axis ratio is corrected using envelope and boundary profiles generated from the treatment planning system (TPS). The method requires field size, monitor unit and source-to-surface distance (SSD) as clinical input parameters to predict the <b>exit</b> <b>dose,</b> which is then used to determine the entrance dose. The measured pixel dose maps were compared with calculated doses from TPS for both entrance and exit depth of phantom. The gamma index at 3 % dose difference (DD) and 3 mm distance to agreement (DTA) resulted in an average of 97 % passing for the square fields of 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm. The <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> EPID dose distributions predicted by the algorithm were in better agreement with TPS-calculated doses than phantom entrance dose distributions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To survey {{structural}} {{designs of}} x-ray rooms and compliance to shielding design goals of three x-ray imaging facilities. Methods and Materials: The {{survey was conducted}} in three radiodiagnostic centers in South East Nigeria, labeled X, Y and Z for anonymity. A stretchable non-elastic meter rule {{was used to measure}} x-ray room dimensions. A Vernier caliper was used to measure lead thickness while a calibrated digital survey meter Radalert 100 x was used for radiation survey of controlled and uncontrolled areas. Simple statistical tools such as mean and standard deviation were used for analysis with the aid of Microsoft Excel version 2007. Results: Center X had a room dimension of 2. 4 m × 2. 1 m, Center Y had an x-ray room dimension of 3. 6 m × 3. 3 m, and Center Z had two x-ray rooms with identical dimensions of 6. 3 m × 3. 6 m.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In view {{of using}} portal images for exit dosimetry, an {{experimental}} study is performed of relative transit dose profiles at different distances behind patients (and phantoms) {{and of their}} relation to the <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Irregular, homogeneous polystyrene phantoms with a variable thickness to simulate head and neck (H&N) treatments (6 -MV photon beam) are investigated by ionization chamber measurements performed close to the exit surface and at various distances behind the phantom (10, 20 and 30 cm). Similar measurements are performed for a rectangular phantom with large inhomogeneities (A 1 and air). For one irregular homogeneous phantom and an irregular phantom containing an A 1 inhomogeneity, ionization chamber measurements are performed at the exit surface, and a portal film image is taken at 30 cm behind the phantom. Portal films of a patient treated for a head and neck malignancy are evaluated for different air gaps behind the patient. RESULTS: For the irregular phantoms, deviations up to 15 % and more are observed between the <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> profile (along the shaped surface of the phantom) and the transit profile close to the phantom (perpendicular to the beam axis). There is, however, a good agreement [...] within 3 % [...] between the exit profile and the transit profile at 30 cm. For the rectangular, inhomogeneous phantom, the deviation between the exit profile and the transit dose profile at 30 cm does not exceed 5 %; transit dose profiles overestimate the <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> for the air cavity and underestimate the dose for the A 1 inhomogeneity. Measurements on portal films of a H&N patient for different air gaps confirm the order of magnitude of the difference observed between transit dose profiles close to the patient and transit dose profiles at some distance behind the patient. CONCLUSIONS: For 6 -MV photon beam treatments with significant thickness variations (H&N), large variations (> 10 %) are observed in transit dose profiles {{as a function of}} the air gap between the patient and the portal film. For this energy, a good agreement is found between the exit profile and the transit profile at about 30 cm behind the patient. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In September 1991 a {{protocol}} for quality control of large shaped irradiation fields {{was started in}} our department. In vivo dosimetry with semiconductor detectors {{was used to measure}} the absorbed dose and patient positioning was checked with portal films weekly. First, we set a computed dosimetric system yielding dosimetric values in real time and allowing their easy storage. Then, we calibrated the diodes and determined the correction factors for each of them outside standard conditions. Entrance dose, <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> and midline dose were measured in 62 patients undergoing supradiaphragmatic radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. The exist dose was measured weekly to assess treatment repeatability. High agreement was observed between measured and calculated doses; repeatability was also high, since only 6 % of <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> measurements exceeded 5 % of the first determination. In 33 patients portal films were obtained in the first treatment session, and thereafter weekly, to assess mispositioning relative to simulation (reproducibility) and from one session to another (repeatability).

40|$|Purpose: The {{main focus}} of this work is to {{continue}} investigations into the Monte Carlo predicted skin doses seen in MRI-guided radiotherapy. In particular, the authors aim to characterize the 70  μm skin doses over a larger range of magnetic field strength and x-ray field size than in the current literature. The effect of surface orientation on both the entry and exit sides is also studied. Finally, the use of exit bolus is also investigated for minimizing {{the negative effects of}} the electron return effect (ERE) on the <b>exit</b> skin <b>dose.</b> Methods: High resolution GEANT 4 Monte Carlo simulations of a water phantom exposed to a 6 MV x-ray beam (Varian 2100 C) have been performed. Transverse magnetic fields of strengths between 0 and 3 T have been applied to a 30 × 30 × 20  cm 3 phantom. This phantom is also altered to have variable entry and exit surfaces with respect to the beam central axis and they range from − 75 ° to + 75 °. The exit bolus simulated is a 1 cm thick (water equivalent) slab located on the beam exit side. Results: On the entry side, significant skin doses at the beam central axis are reported for large positive surface angles and strong magnetic fields. However, over the entry surface angle range of − 30 ° to − 60 °, the entry skin dose is comparable to or less than the zero magnetic field skin dose, regardless of magnetic field strength and field size. On the exit side, moderate to high central axis skin dose increases are expected except at large positive surface angles. For exit bolus of 1 cm thickness, the central axis <b>exit</b> skin <b>dose</b> becomes an almost consistent value regardless of magnetic field strength or exit surface angle. This is due to the almost complete absorption of the ERE electrons by the bolus. Conclusions: There is an ideal entry angle range of − 30 ° to − 60 ° where entry skin dose is comparable to or less than the zero magnetic field skin dose. Other than this, the entry skin dose increases are significant, especially at higher magnetic fields. On the exit side there is mostly moderate to high skin dose increases for 0. 2 – 3 T with the only exception being large positive angles. Exit bolus of 1 cm thickness will {{have a significant impact on}} lowering such <b>exit</b> skin <b>dose</b> increases that occur as a result of the ERE...|$|R
40|$|A {{dosimetry}} {{system based on}} radioluminescence (RL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) from carbon doped aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 :C) crystals was developed for in vivo absorbed dose measurements in mammography. A small cylindrical crystal of Al 2 O 3 :C (diameter 0. 48 mm and length 2 mm) was coupled {{to the end of}} a 1 mm diameter optical fibre cable. Owing to their small size and characteristic shape, these probes can be placed on the body surface in the field of view during the examination, without compromising the reading of the mammogram. Our new technique was tested with a mammography unit (Siemens Mammomat 3000) and screen-film technique over a range of clinically relevant X-ray energies. The results were compared with those obtained from an ionization chamber usually used for the determination of absorbed dose in mammography. The reproducibility of measurements was around 3 % (1 standard deviation) at 4. 5 mGy for both RL and OSL data. The dose response was found to be linear between 4. 5 mGy and 30 mGy. The energy dependence of the system is around 18 % between 23 kV and 35 kV. In vivo measurements were performed during three patient examinations.

40|$|Optically stimulated {{luminescence}} (OSL) was studied using {{a commercial}} OSL dosimetry system developed by Landauer (Landauer Inc.,USA) to analyse {{the possibility of}} using OSL dosimetry for external beam radiotherapy planning checks and in-vivo dosimetry. Experiments were performed to determine signal sensitivity, dose response range, beam type and energy dependency, reproducibility and linearity. Optical annealing processes to test OSL material reusability were also studied. OSL clinical usability was assessed by verifying IMRT dose distributions in a phantom and measuring <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> for in-vivo dosimetry. Experimental results show that OSL dosimetry provides a wide dose response range as well as good linearity and reproducibility for doses up to 600 cGy, and up to 800 cGy shows a 2. 0 % maximum deviation from linearity. The standard deviation in the response of screened dosimeters was 2. 0 %. As this needs {{to be taken into account}} when OSLDs are used clinically, multiple readings of each irradiated OSLD are recommended. OSLDs can be reused when an optical annealing process is applied, which can restore the OSLD to its original state. After optical annealing using incandescent light, the readout intensity decreased by approximately 98 % in the first 30 minutes, decreasing further after repeated optical annealing according to the power law, I ∝t (- 1. 3), where I is the light intensity. Quantitative comparisons were made between treatment planning system (TPS) calculated dose and OSL measurement points dose using a custom-designed spherical phantom. Three clinical IMRT cases were used: Nasopharynx, Prostate and Lung. Although quantitative comparisons are highly dependent on the calibration accuracy and dose range of OSLDs, experimental results showed that the OSL dose is within 3 % of the TPS calculated dose with careful calibration. Quantitative comparisons were made between various bactscatter material conditions when performing <b>exit</b> dosimetry. OSLD <b>dose</b> was 5. 7 % lower when no backscatter material was added compared to full backscatter. Adding 0. 5 cm to 1. 0 cm water equivalent material reduced the dose by 2 %. The reduction in dose may vary due to the density of the tissue in the primary beam path. These measurements demonstrated the importance of adding appropriate backscatter material to improve the accuracy of the readings. One made quantitative comparisons between OSL measurements and the depth dose data from linear accelerator commissioning and those of a Markus ion chamber by using a custom-designed heterogeneous phantom. Compared to the depth dose data, OSL dose is 1 % lower in the full backscatter condition, 2 % with a 1 cm backscatter and there is a maximum of 6 % reduction with no additional backscatter added. Compared to the Markus ion chamber OSL readings show an insignificantly lower dose. Added backscatter thickness, field size, energy, tissue or a tumour. s size and density along the primary beam path-length, as well as the control/calibration dose will all affect OSL response in in-vivo dosimetry. The research work shows that OSL dosimetry can be an alternative dosimetry technique for use in radiotherapy, especially for patient specific Quality Assurance (QA) including skin dose measurement, IMRT plan checks, and linear accelerator QA. In conclusion, OSL dosimetry can provide an alternative dosimetry technique for use in radiotherapy if rigorous measurement protocols are established...|$|R
40|$|Background. Mammography aims {{to obtain}} mammograms of best {{possible}} image quality with least possible radiation dose. 1 Theoretically, {{an increase in}} breast compression gives a reduction in thickness, without changing the density, resulting in improved image quality and reduced radiation dose. Aim. 	This study aims to investigate the relationship between compression force, phantom thickness, image quality and radiation dose. The existence of a compression point beyond which increased compression gives a change in density rather than thickness is also considered. Method. Image quality is assessed with a contrast-detail phantom within Superflab phantom on a computed radiography (CR) mammography unit using automatic exposure control (AEC). Image quality is determined by visual inspection and image quality figure (IQF) scoring. The effect of compression and lesion depth on image quality is determined. Entrance and exit doses are calculated. The relationship between entrance dose, compression and thickness is investigated, as is {{the existence of a}} compression point beyond which a change in phantom density occurs. The average glandular dose (AGD) is calculated from the scanning average level (SAL) and logarithmic mean (LgM) according to Koen et al, 2 and compared to the allowable limit. Results. 	The geometry effect was not observed. An improvement in image quality with increased compression was found. Entrance dose did decrease with increased compression.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of the metallic reservoir and the use of gas within the Aeroform™ tissue expander with respect to the radiation dose distribution. Methods : Dosimetric effects of using a metallic reservoir within a breast tissue expander during external beam radiotherapy were investigated. To view the internal components of the reservoir, it was removed from the tissue expander and imaged on a Varian AS 500 electronic portal imager. To calculate the relative density of each component within the reservoir, an ionization chamber within solid water was used to measure the dose and compared to a simulation within the Pinnacle treatment planning system (TPS). To examine the relative dose profile along the length of the reservoir, the reservoir was exposed on EBT 3 film and analyzed using SNC Patient ™. In-vivo Dosimetry was performed using a RANDO ® Woman phantom. Thermo-luminescent dosimeters were placed within the wax bolus enveloping the tissue expander. Results: Imaging the reservoir on the electronic portal imager revealed it consists of 3 distinct components. The densities assigned in the TPS, which resulted in calculated doses which matched the measured doses were; Section 1 = 0 g/cm 3, Section 2 = 2. 8 g/cm 3 and Section 3 = 0. 7 g/cm 3. Relative dose reductions were observed due to the metallic case; Section 1 = 20 %, Section 2 = 40 % and Section 3 = 30 %. Entrance doses ranged from 2. 39 - 2. 53 Gy for both the medial and lateral beams. <b>Exit</b> <b>doses</b> ranging from 1. 10 - 1. 71 Gy were observed in both beams. There was a significant difference in measured and calculated <b>doses</b> at <b>exit</b> locations in the beam. Conclusion : Dosimetric effects due to the metallic reservoir within the Aeroform breast tissue expander have been demonstrated and have been observed to be significant. To increase the dosimetric accuracy when contouring, individual components of the reservoir should be distinguished. Our in-vivo experiment showed that dose homogeneity was difficult due to the metallic reservoir and we recommend stringent patient dose monitoring when using this expander during radiotherapy.

40|$|Mammography {{refers to}} the X-ray {{examination}} of the human breast, and is considered {{the single most important}} diagnostic tool in the early detection of breast cancer, which {{is by far the most}} common cancer among women. There is good evidence from clinical trials, that mammographic screening can reduce the breast cancer mortality with about 30 %. The side effects include a small and age related risk of carcinogenesis due to the exposure of the glandular tissues in the breast to ionising radiation. As for all X-ray examinations, and of special importance when investigating large populations of asymptomatic women, the relationship between radiation risk and diagnostic accuracy in mammography must be optimised.

The study showed that the AGD values for a “standard breast” became 5 ± 2 % (total variation 0 ? 9 %) higher at clinical settings, when estimated according to the European protocol. For the Sectra MDM, a digital mammography (DM) unit with a scanning geometry, it was impossible to follow procedures for characterisation of the X-ray beam (HVL=half value layer) specified in the European protocol. In an experimental setup, it was shown that non-invasive measurements of HVL can be performed accurately with a sensitive and well collimated semiconductor detector with simultaneous correction for the energy dependence. AGD values could then be estimated according to 3 different dose protocols. A dosimetry system based on radioluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence from Al 2 O 3 :C crystals was developed and tested for in vivo absorbed dose measurements. It was shown that both entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>doses</b> could be measured and that the dosemeters did not disturb the reading of the mammograms. A Monte Carlo study showed that the energy dependence could be reduced, primarily by reducing the diameter of the crystal. It is proposed that radiation scattered forward towards the breast from the compression paddle, a scanning device etc, should be considered with greater clarity in the breast dosimetry protocols, and be described with a forward-scatter factor, FSF, for the various geometries and conditions proposed. Low contrast-detail (CD) phantoms of simulated glandularity 30, 50 or 70 %, and thickness 3, 5 or 7 cm, were used to compare three different mammography systems. The same number of perceivable objects was visible for the full-field DM system at 20 - 60 % of the AGD necessary for the screen-film (SFM) system, with the largest dose reduction potential for the thickest phantoms with the highest glandularity. However, more recent research shows that CD phantoms with a homogeneous background, as used here, must be used with care due to the presence of “anatomical noise” in the real clinical situation. Image quality criteria (IQC) recommended in a European Guideline 1996 for SFM were adjusted to be relevant also for DM images. The new set of IQC was tested in two different studies using clinical images from DM and SFM, respectively. The results indicate that the new set of IQC has a higher discriminative power than the old set. The results also suggest that AGD for the DM system used may be reduced...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Numerous {{parameters}} {{are involved in}} dynamic perfusion CT (PCT). We assessed {{the influence of the}} temporal sampling rate and the volume of contrast material. METHODS: Sixty patients with ischemic hemispheric stroke lasting> 12 hours underwent PCT. Groups of 15 patients each received 30, 40, 50, or 60 mL of contrast agent. Regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), mean transit time (MTT), and time-to-peak (TTP) maps were calculated for temporal sampling intervals of 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 seconds. Results were statistically compared. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), duration of arterial entrance to venous <b>exit,</b> and radiation <b>dose</b> were also assessed. RESULTS: Increasing temporal sampling intervals lead to significant overestimation of rCBV, rCBF, and TTP and significant underestimation of MTT compared with values for an interval of 1 second. Maximal allowable intervals to avoid these effects were 2, 3, 3, and 4 seconds for 30, 40, 50, and 60 -mL boluses, respectively. Venous exit of contrast material occurred in 97. 5 % of patients after 36, 42, 42, and 48 seconds, respectively, for the four volumes. SNRs did not differ with volume. The effective radiation dose varied between 0. 852 and 1. 86...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the main}} stay of epileptic therapy is {{pharmacological}} {{certain forms of}} epilepsy such as temporal lobe epilepsy and epilepsy associated with benign diseases of the brain can also be successfully managed surgically. A neurosurgical procedure {{has the advantage of}} an immediate therapeutic result. When surgery is not possible, therapeutic irradiation is an option, but there is always a latent time between the radiation and the improvement in the epilepsy. This radiation is under the form of photon radiation produced by Cobalt sources in a Gamma knife® or by Linear accelerators. Special beam collimation techniques produce a sharp beam allowing for a high dose to be delivered to the target without side effects on the normal surrounding brain. The desired therapeutic effect comes from the late radiation effects, and hence is not immediate. The absorption in tissue of photon radiation is such that there is always an <b>exit</b> <b>dose,</b> and this contributes to radiation side effects on normal tissue. Particle radiation beams such as a proton beam have a dose absorption advantage over photons because there is a lower entry dose and no <b>exit</b> <b>dose.</b> This has the potential to treat the brain with a lower risk of side effects, and a lower integral dose. Presently radiation dose selection is aimed at causing tissue destruction in the target volume. Dose schedules that do not cause tissue necrosis but have a neurophysiologic therapeutic effect are presently under investigation. New irradiation technologies such as micro photon beams using synchrotron radiation and mini proton beams are been studied especially for their potential in epilepsy therapy. These technologies could greatly improve the therapeutic ratio as they cause no damage to brain tissue. If proven to have a therapeutic effect these new developments would expand the role of radiation in managing epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{proton therapy}} {{is being used}} for the cancer {{treatment}} at 11 centers in the United States of America [1], {{and there is an}} increasing interest in using proton therapy at many other institutions, which have proton centers either at the planning stage or under construction. [1] The primary reasons of using protons over photons for the cancer treatment is because of proton's physical properties such as finite beam range, near-zero <b>exit</b> <b>dose,</b> and sharp lateral penumbra. [2, 3] Treatment planning in proton therapy is done with an aim of depositing the majority of the dose in the tumor, which is typically covered by the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) and avoiding the proton beam ranging into the critical structure.

40|$|Description The target {{equivalence}} range (TEQR) {{design is}} a frequentist {{implementation of the}} modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design and a competitor to the standard 3 + 3 design (3 + 3). The 3 + 3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe <b>dose</b> <b>exits,</b> but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The TEQR {{is better than the}} 3 + 3 when compared on: 1) the number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) the number of subjects assigned to doses levels, at or nearest the MTD, and 3) the overall trial DLT rate. TEQR more accurately and more precisely estimates the rate of toxicity at the MTD because a larger number of subjects are studied at the MTD dose. The TEQR on average uses fewer subjects and provide reasonably comparable results to the continual reassessment method (CRM) in the number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD and the number of subjects assigned doses, at, or nearest the target and in overall DLT rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{amorphous}} silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID) was originally designed for positional verification in radiotherapy. Several {{feature of the}} a-Si EPID, such as the high-resolution detector array and ease of operation, have made this imaging device an attractive tool for dose measurements. The main challenge with a-Si EPID dosimetry is the deviation in scatter and dose response characteristics from a water-equivalent detector that makes the conversion of EPID signal to dose not straightforward. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} model to perform 2 D transit dosimetry for patient-specific treatment verification with a-Si EPID. The transit model can be used for both pre-treatment and actual treatment verification to ensure safety in different stages of the radiotherapy process. The model was based on a quadratic equation that relates the reduction in radiation intensity, represented by the ratio of <b>exit</b> to entrance <b>dose,</b> to the water-equivalent path length (EPL) of the attenuator. Coefficients in the quadratic equation were derived from a set of calibration dose planes measured for a reference beam with water phantoms of known thicknesses. Two sets of coefficients were derived separately from calibration dose planes measured with EPID and ionisation chamber (IC) in water. Consequently, with two sets of coefficients, the EPL of any attenuator can be calculated using either EPID measured dose planes or treatment planning system (TPS) computed dose planes for the treatment field to be verified. The calculated EPL, which is a property of the attenuator and independent of the dosimeter, was used to link the different dosimetry systems and provide a two-way relationship for either: (Path 1) reconstruction of in-phantom or in-vivo dose from EPID measured dose planes, for comparison with TPS planned dose; or (Path 2) prediction of EPID transit dose from TPS computed dose planes, for comparison with EPID measurement during treatment. The developed model was first tested with homogeneous and heterogeneous slab phantoms using open, enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields. Results showed that the model could accurately detect deviation between delivered and planned doses. Further evaluation with an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom and 65 test fields (open, 3 D conformal, EDW, IMRT) at different gantry angles showed a mean gamma pass rate (4...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{determination}} of the dose delivered to the body during Total Body Irradiation (TBI) is not easy, as direct measurements are impossible. This article presents the intention to develop a systematic and simple method for absorbed dose determination in 60 Co TBI using mid plane dose factors (MDF) and external measurements, i. e. entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> readings by semiconductor detectors. In order to perform the radiation field analysis prior to TBI treatment, a special silicon n-type detector with increased sensitivity (1200 nC/Gy) was used. The dependence of the calibration factor of this detector exposed to different dose rates in standard and TBI conditions was investigated. A theoretical model of anthropomorphic phantoms of cylindrical ellipsoid shape was established. The software {{made it possible to}} generalize the applicability of TBI dosimetry to any individual case of real patient data. A quality assurance analysis of dosimetric results of 350 patients, who underwent TBI during a 17 year period, was performed...|$|E
40|$|In patient {{radiation}} therapy, it {{is important}} to know that the diseased area is included in the treatment field and that normal anatomy is properly shielded or excluded. Since 1969, a film technique developed for imaging of the complete patient radiation exposure has been applied for treatment verification and for the detection and evaluation of localization errors that may occur during treatment. The technique basically consists of placing a film under the patient during the entire radiation exposure. This film should have proper sensitivity and contrast in the <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> exposure range encountered in radiotherapy. In this communication, we describe how various exit doses fit the characteristic curve of the film; examples of films exposed to various exit doses; the technique for using the film to determine the spatial distribution of the absorbed exit dose; and types of errors commonly detected. Results are presented illustrating that, as the frequency of use of this film technique is increased, localization error is reduced significantly. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} {{comprehensive}} IMSRT QA procedure that examined, using EPID dosimetry and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, each step in the treatment planning and delivery process. These steps included verification of the field shaping, treatment planning system (RTPS) dose calculations, and patient dose delivery. Verification of each step in the treatment process is assumed to result in correct dose delivery to the patient. ^ The accelerator MC model was verified against commissioning data for field sizes from 0. 8 × 0. 8 cm 2 to 10 × 10 cm 2. Depth doses were within 2 % local percent difference (LPD) in low gradient regions and 1 mm distance to agreement (DTA) in high gradient regions. Lateral profiles were within 2 % LPD in low gradient regions and 1 mm DTA in high gradient regions. Calculated output factors were within 1 % of measurement for field sizes ≥ 1 × 1 cm 2. ^ The measured and calculated pretreatment EPID dose patterns were compared using criteria of 5 % LPD, 1 mm DTA, or 2 % of central axis pixel value with ≥ 95 % of compared points required to pass for successful verification. Pretreatment field verification resulted in 97 % percent of the points passing. ^ The RTPS and Monte Carlo phantom dose calculations were compared using 5 % LPD, 2 mm DTA, or 2 % of the maximum dose with ≥ 95 % of compared points required passing for successful verification. RTPS calculation verification resulted in 97 % percent of the points passing. ^ The measured and calculated EPID <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> patterns were compared using criteria of 5 % LPD, 1 mm DTA, or 2 % of central axis pixel value with ≥ 95 % of compared points required to pass for successful verification. <b>Exit</b> <b>dose</b> verification resulted in 97 % percent of the points passing. ^ Each of the processes above verified an individual step in the treatment planning and delivery process. The combination of these verification steps ensures accurate treatment delivery to the patient. This work shows that Monte Carlo calculations and EPID dosimetry can be used to quantitatively verify IMSRT treatments resulting in improved patient care and, potentially, improved clinical outcome. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{problematic}} elements of radiation therapy is the determination of contour data or treatment depth which may vary due to various parameters. The provision of this data is crucial for treatment calculations and setup. The present study {{is devoted to the}} assessment of discrepancies between the water equivalent (effective) diameter and patient diameter of the dose delivered to the target. Combined entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> measurements were carried out on patients treated for thorax, abdomen, and pelvic cancers by 60 Co gamma rays, using silicon diodes. The effective diameter and target dose were evaluated on the basis of dose transmission data. Our study reveals that the most influential parameter leading to discrepancies in target dose delivery is the difference between effective depth and patient depth. A difference of more than 5 % in the target dose is bound to happen when the difference between the effective and contour diameters is greater than 10 %. Therefore, using the effective diameter for treatment calculations provides a more realistic value of the target dose, since it incorporates the impact of all contributing factors...|$|E
40|$|An inverse {{planning}} technique using 6 -MV intensity-modulated photon beams {{was developed}} for treating large-size patients with prostate cancer. Comparisons of treatment plans using 6 -MV and 18 -MV intensity-modulated beams were carried out for a cohort of 10 patient cases. For these cases, we analyzed the dependence of plan quality on the beam energies. We found that 6 -MV beams resulted in plans equivalent to those for 18 -MV beams both for targets and for critical structures such as the rectum and bladder. The differences between the plans in the integral dose and the mean dose to the normal tissue surrounding the target {{were found to be}} small, in contrast to those for 3 D conformal plans. Our findings showed that the low entrance dose of the high-energy photon beams is mostly compensated by the high <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> for even exceptionally large patients. In conclusion, 6 -MV intensity-modulated beams are a feasible choice for treating large-size patients with prostate cancer, provided that proper inverse planning techniques are adopted...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAimIn vivo {{dosimetry}} is {{an essential}} tool of quality assurance programmes in radiotherapy. In fact, {{the assessment of the}} final uncertainty between the prescribed dose and the dose actually delivered to the patient is an effective way of checking the entire dosimetric procedure. Metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) have recently been proposed for use in radiation therapy. The purpose of this work is to study the performance characteristics and to carry out the commissioning of MOSFET as an in-vivo dosimeter for high-energy photon external beam radiation therapy. Material and MethodsCharacterization and commissioning of low sensitivity TN 502 RD and high sensitivity TN 1002 RD MOSFETs for entrance and exit dosimetry respectively for application in in-vivo dosimetry in radiotherapy was carried out. The MOSFETs were characterized in terms of reproducibility, short-term constancy, long-term constancy, linearity, angular dependence, energy dependence, source to skin distance (SSD) dependence and field size dependence. ResultsThe reproducibility of standard sensitivity MOSFET is about 1. 4 % (1 SD) and 1. 98 % (1 SD) for high sensitivity detectors. The linearity of both MOSFETs was excellent (R 2 = 0. 996). The response of MOSFETs varies linearly for square fields from 3 × 3 cm 2 to 30 × 30 cm 2. For beam incidence ranging from ± 45 ° the MOSFET response varies within ± 3 %. Commissioning of both MOSFETs was carried out in terms of entrance dose calibration factor, <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> calibration factor, SSD correction factor, field size correction factor, wedge correction factor and shielding tray correction factor. The average calibration factor for low and high sensitivity MOSFET detectors is 0. 9065 cGy/mV and 0. 3412 cGy/mV respectively. The average SSD correction factors are quite small and vary between 0. 968 and 1. 027 for both types of detectors for the range of clinical SSDs from 80 cm to 120 cm. The field size correction factor varies from 1. 00 to 1. 02 for both types of detectors. The wedge and the shielding tray correction factors for both the detectors also show quite small variation. MOSFET characteristics are suitable for in vivo dosimetry of entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> measurement relevant to 6 MV treatment. ConclusionIt can be concluded that MOSFET dosimetry's low energy dependence, high sensitivity and immediate readout make it a good replacement for TLD in radiation therapy dosimetry...|$|E
40|$|Radiation induced {{secondary}} malignancies are a significant, yet uncommon {{cause of}} {{morbidity and mortality}} among cancer survivors. Secondary malignancy risk is dependent upon multiple factors including patient age, the biological and genetic predisposition of the individual, the volume and location of tissue irradiated, and the dose of radiation received. Proton therapy is an advanced particle therapy with unique dosimetric properties resulting in reduced entrance dose and minimal to no <b>exit</b> <b>dose</b> when compared with standard photon radiation therapy. Multiple dosimetric studies in varying cancer subtypes have demonstrated that proton therapy enables the delivery of adequate target volume coverage with reduced integral dose delivered to surrounding tissues, and modeling studies taking into account dosimetry and radiation cell biology have estimated a significantly reduced risk of radiation induced secondary malignancy with proton therapy. Clinical data is emerging supporting the lower incidence of secondary malignancies after proton therapy compared with historical photon data, though longer follow-up in proton treated cohorts is awaited. This article reviews the current dosimetric and clinical literature evaluating the incidence of and risk factors associated with radiation induced secondary malignancy following proton therapy...|$|E
