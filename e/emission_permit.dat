40|$|Tradable {{emission}} permits may {{be considered}} as a policy instrument that gives incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost efficient way. Due to transaction costs it may not be cost efficient to include sectors in which there are many small emission sources.

If the residential sector is not included in a tradable <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> system but the power or district-heating sector is included some technologies for residential heating, like heat pumps and district heating are affected since fuel for production of electricity to heat pumps and fuel for district heating are used in the trading sector while the heat is used in the residential sector.

40|$|The ambient permit system {{proposed}} in the literature for cost-effective pollution reduction is difficult to implement and may result in lower net benefits than using another instrument. The article develops a model for comparing the environmental net benefits of three policy instruments for Santiago, Chile, when the policy problem is to meet a given ambient quality standard. Two market-based instruments [...] the ambient permit system and a simpler <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> system [...] are examined along with an emission standard, a command and control instrument usually favored by regulators. Both <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> system and emission standard are costlier than the ambient permit system, sometimes {{in large part because}} they improve ambient emission concentrations beyond the required target in much of the city, but the ambient permit system requires a lower degree of control to comply with the standard. The somewhat costlier <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> system and emission standard provide much higher net benefits than the ambient permit system when the health benefits of their "excessive" air quality improvements are taken into account. These benefits are different from the fact that an ambient permit system is administratively costlier to implement. Copyright The Author 2007.

40|$|To {{the extent}} that <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> have been {{allocated}} using market mechanisms, this has been done using a sealed-bid auction design, typically with discriminatory price. <b>Emission</b> <b>permits,</b> being a homogenous good with a fixed supply within a certain period, can be allocated using an auction design which {{can be considered as}} a "share auction", where the bidders receive fractional shares of the item at a sale price that equates the demand and supply of "shares". Since marketable <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> is an exclusive right where signals from competing bidders can refine own bid estimates, the ascending multi-round auction format has been recommended over the sealed bid format by several authors for the allocation of <b>emissions</b> <b>permits.</b> Basically, two "competing" designs have been recommended, i. e. the standard ascending-clock auction and an ascending-clock implementation of Vickrey-pricing. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate pros and cons of these two formats, particularly in a setting where the authorities wish to allocate exclusive rights, e. g. <b>emission</b> <b>permits,</b> efficiently, and where the allocation of these exclusive rights has consequences for the level of production as well as market shares.

40|$|Welfare maximizing <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> {{allocations}} under constraints ∗ This paper examines {{equity and}} efficiency properties of voluntary international environmental agreements. A classical welfare economics framework is used while focusing {{on one particular}} instrument, i. e. emissions trading. It is demonstrated that if <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> allocations face no constraints, that is if the allocation of ‘hot air’ and negative permit endowments are allowed, the classical efficiency rule is preserved and we obtain a ‘first best ’ solution. This result however breaks down when permit allocation constraints are imposed. If one of these constraints is binding, the global abatement target and the permit distribution are determined simultaneously. An empirical application confirms this result and reveals that binding allocation constraints shift the abatement target away from the first best solution. When more stringent stability concepts are imposed, the constraints on endowments become less binding. The welfare loss due to these constraints however gets larger as we become more inequality averse...|$|E

For each group, if countries are symmetric, their individual incentives to join a group are identical across the two regimes of environmental coalitions: the non-transferable utility (NTU) regime and transferable utility (TU) regime. If member countries are asymmetric, however, groups are more stable under the TU regime than under the NTU regime since the former regime enables the member countries to pool their incentives.

It {{is well known that}} a competitive permits market achieves the cost minimizing distribution of abatement effort among the polluting firms for a given reduction in emissions. However, when the product market is oligopolistic, it may redistribute production inefficiently among firms.

Spain's deviation from EU's intermediate emission goals is more serious than for most other EU countries, and the unemployment is also well above the EU average. We use a CGE model that includes a matching model with two types of labour, and which allows for different pricing rules and returns-to-scale assumptions. We find that abatement reduces unemployment due to beneficial impacts of recycling the revenue from permit sales. Unemployment is more effectively abated when revenues are used to reduce labour taxes rather than indirect taxes.

This reform is the most successful both in increasing demand and in dampening the supply response to rising wages.

40|$|Draft- {{not to be}} quoted without {{permission}} of the author The evaluation {{of the cost of}} reduction for the different region and the resulting <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> prices is a typical model application. The usual approach to analyze emission trading is to obtain marginal emission reduction cost curves from the models and subsequently carry out a static, expost analysis of emission trading based on these cost curves. The drawback of this approach is that effects resulting from the introduction of different carbon constraints (change in prices, demands, etc) are not taken into account and ambiguity remains surrounding the timing of emission reductions and the introduction of shadow carbon values or permit prices. These drawbacks can be overcome by endogenizing the permit prices. The equilibrium <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> price is being calculated within the model for each point in time (ie each year) for the given constraints. The results are time profiles for permit prices which in themselves are analytically significant. This ‘dynamic ’ permit prices approach opens the way for analysis involving permit banking and enables discounting in the calculation of both emission reduction costs and the value of permit sales/purchases...|$|E

On <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> markets we explore the strategic behavior of oligopolistic firms operating in polluting industrial sectors that are regulated by cap and trade systems.

A partial equilibrium model is developed for this purpose with specific abatement cost functions. In Chapter 2 we use the model to explain some of the most relevant literature results. In Chapter 3 the model is used to analyze different oligopolistic structures in the product market under the assumption of competitive permits market. There are two significant findings.

With an applied model that comprises twelve world regions we investigate: (i) a benchmark without transfers, (ii) scenarios with allocation-based rules where coalition members receive tradable <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> proportional to initial or future emissions, (iii) scenarios with outcome-based rules where the coalition surplus is distributed proportional to emissions, and (iv) a scenario based on an optimal sharing rule where the coalition surplus is distributed proportional to outside option payoffs. We find that well-designed transfer schemes can stabilise larger coalitions and increase global abatement levels. In our applied setting we find that for allocation-based and outcome-based rules only small coalitions are stable, and, {{in the case of}} grandfathered <b>emission</b> <b>permits,</b> there is no stable coalition at all.
