5|$|Johnson's {{early works}} and early life have been {{neglected}} topics within Johnson scholarship. As a result, he is primarily {{known for the}} events surrounding his later life and later works like A Dictionary of the English Language. This imbalance originates in the failure of James Boswell, Johnson's friend and companion, to <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> great detail Johnson's childhood {{and the beginning of}} his career within the Life of Samuel Johnson, the most famous biography on Johnson. In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's early politics and political writings which show a concern with Sir Robert Walpole's political administration.|$|E

25|$|The War Cabinet met (8 April) to <b>discuss,</b> <b>in</b> Hankey's words, “the {{desirability}} {{of getting rid}} of Haig”, who had recently offered to resign. Hankey recorded that sentiment was “unanimously agst Haig” but Wilson’s opinion was that there was no obvious successor and that he suggested waiting for Haig’s report on the March retreat before making a decision. However, in his own diary Wilson later claimed (11 May) he had urged that Haig be sacked, and told Haig so (20 May). Haig and Wilson gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and Lloyd George was soon complaining that one was Scotch and one Irish, but both were whiskies.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the Greek New Comedy of Menander and its similarities to Plautus, it is necessary to <b>discuss,</b> <b>in</b> juxtaposition with it, the days of Greek Old Comedy and its evolution into New Comedy. The ancient Greek playwright who best embodies Old Comedy is Aristophanes. A playwright of 5th century Athens, he wrote works of political satire such as The Wasps, The Birds, and The Clouds. Aristophanes' work is noted for its critical commentary on politics and societal values, which is the key component of Old Comedy: consciousness {{of the world in which}} it is written, and analysis of this world. Comedy and theater were means for the political commentary of the time—the public conscience.|$|E
25|$|Certain transhumanist {{philosophers}} {{hold that}} since all assumptions about what others experience are fallible, {{and that therefore}} all attempts to help or protect beings that are not capable of correcting what others assume about them no matter how well-intentioned {{are in danger of}} actually hurting them, all sentient beings deserve to be sapient. These thinkers argue that the ability to <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> a falsification-based way constitutes a threshold that is not arbitrary at which it becomes possible for an individual to speak for themself {{in a way that is}} not dependent on exterior assumptions. They also argue that all beings capable of experiencing something deserve to be elevated to this threshold if they are not at it, typically stating that the underlying change that leads to the threshold is an increase in the preciseness of the brain's ability to discriminate. This includes increasing the neuron count and connectivity in animals as well as accelerating the development of connectivity in order to shorten or ideally skip non-sapient childhood incapable of independently deciding for oneself. Transhumanists of this description stress that the genetic engineering that they advocate is general insertion into both the somatic cells of living beings and in germ cells, and not purging of individuals without the modifications, deeming the latter not only unethical but also unnecessary due to the possibilities of efficient genetic engineering.|$|E

25|$|Italy {{was also}} {{affected}} by the Enlightenment, a movement which was {{a consequence of the}} Renaissance and changed the road of Italian philosophy. Followers of the group often met to <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of Milan, Rome and Venice. Cities with important universities such as Padua, Bologna and Naples, however, also remained great centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as Giambattista Vico (1668–1744) (who is widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy) and Antonio Genovesi. Italian society also dramatically changed during the Enlightenment, with rulers such as Leopold II of Tuscany abolishing the death penalty. The church's power was significantly reduced, and it was a period of great thought and invention, with scientists such as Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani discovering new things and greatly contributing to Western science. Cesare Beccaria {{was also one of the}} greatest Italian Enlightenment writers and now considered one of the fathers of classical criminal theory as well as modern penology. Beccaria is famous for his masterpiece On Crimes and Punishments (1764), a treatise (later translated into 22 languages) that served as one of the earliest prominent condemnations of torture and the death penalty and thus a landmark work in anti-death penalty philosophy.|$|E
25|$|His {{successor}} at the Lyceum was Theophrastus, {{who wrote}} valuable books describing {{plant and animal}} life. His works are regarded as the first to put botany and zoology on a systematic footing. He also produced {{one of the very}} first works on mineralogy, with descriptions of ores and minerals known to the world at that time. He made some shrewd observations of their properties. For example, he made the first known reference to the phenomenon of pyroelectricity, noting that the mineral tourmaline becomes charged when heated. Pliny the Elder makes clear references to his use of the work in his Naturalis Historia of 77 AD, while updating and making much new information available on minerals himself. From both these early texts was to emerge the science of mineralogy, and ultimately geology. Both authors describe the sources of the minerals they <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> the various mines exploited in their time, so their works should be regarded not just as early scientific texts, but also important for the history of engineering and the history of technology. Pliny is especially significant because he provides full bibliographic details of the earlier authors and their works he uses and consults. Because his encyclopedia survived the Dark Ages, we know of these lost works, even if the texts themselves have disappeared. The book {{was one of the first}} to be printed in 1489, and became a standard reference work for Renaissance scholars, as well as an inspiration for the development of a scientific and rational approach to the world.|$|E
500|$|Jack Neo's {{inspiration}} for the film was the Iranian movie Children of Heaven. Neo {{and his wife were}} moved to [...] "holding hands and crying after seeing the love shared by the children", which motivated him to make his own movie about youth.

[...] This problem formed the core of his film, which he called I Not Stupid in reference to the social stigma that streaming places on students.|$|E

500|$|Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had {{no plans}} for series to {{crossover}} across networks. Specifically for the similarly themed Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors, and Runaways, which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted [...] "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... {{things that are happening}} in L.A. [...] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and {{trying to find a way}} for it to be able to <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> a way that makes sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E

When discussing another song from 1974, [...] "Simply Shady", Harrison later referred to this time as [...] "a bit of a bender", while his marriage to Pattie Boyd finally fell apart.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, an {{extremely}} high tax burden was imposed on Armenian, Greek and Jewish citizens of Turkey, and tax assessors had {{a free hand}} in determining the amount, often amounts {{that could not be}} paid. In the winter of 1942, hundreds who could not pay, including elderly men, were brought to the town of Aşkale, with very harsh winters, and made to shovel snow continually for as much as five months. Some were able to pay locals to perform the labor for them, and some succumbed to the cold and conditions, sleeping in barns, coffeehouses, or anywhere else they could get shelter. The book [...] "You Rejoice My Heart" [...] by Turkish author Kemal Yalçın includes a visit by the author to Aşkale in the 1990s to learn first hand about the tax and the labor camps, the conditions and the victims at a time when this incident was dangerous and taboo to <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> Turkey.|$|E
