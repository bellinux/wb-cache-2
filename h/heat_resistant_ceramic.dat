40|$|During {{the joint}} {{research}} project a pilot {{system for the}} fabrication of thin-film solar modules consisting of crystalline silicon on <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>ceramic</b> substrates has been set up. The following processes for the module fabrication on large areas have been developed: (1) A CVD deposition process for SiC-barrier layers on ceramics and areas up to 20 x 20 cm" 2. The specific resistance of the SiC-layers is adjusted by means of boron doping {{in a range of}} 10 " 4 to 10 " 8 #OMEGA#cm. (2) A patented CVD Si-deposition process for large areas (40 x 40 cm" 2), which uses the formation of a convection roll in the reaction volume. The system is working, the Si layers are not approved yet. (3) An integrated series connection using dry etching processes in large area microwave plasma systems. Different designs for the monolithic series connection have been realised. (4) A H-passivation process based on microwave plasma excitation of H_ 2. A significant enhancement of the Si material quality (L_e_f_f) was proven. (5) A back-side reflector consisting of porous silicon. An additional current output of 4 % was realised. (6) A novel, patented characterization method for the measurement of charge carrier lifetimes (#tau#_e_f_f) in semiconductors. The rapid and touchless infrared measuring technique with a high resolution is superior to state-of-the-art methods. All processes are applicable to large areas. Different solar modules have been fabricated: (1) Interconnected modules on SOI-wafers with a 15 #mu#m thick monocrystalline Si layer. The voltage of the module is 5. 4 V, the efficiency 11 % on an area of 10 x 10 cm" 2. (2) Interconnected modules on oxidized Si wafers with a 15 #mu#m-thick re-crystallised Si-layer. The voltage of the module consisting of 9 single cells is 4. 9 V, the efficiency 6. 3 %. (orig.)

40|$|Bacterial {{endospore}} formers {{can produce}} spores that {{are resistant to}} many food processing conditions, including heat. Some spores may survive heating processes aimed at production of commercially sterile foods. Recently, it was shown that a spoVA operon, designated spoVA 2 mob, present on a Tn 1546 transposon in Bacillus subtilis, leads to profoundly increased wet heat resistance of B. subtilis spores. Such Tn 1546 transposon elements including the spoVA 2 mob operon were also found in several strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus licheniformis, and these strains were shown to produce spores with significantly higher resistances to wet heat than their counterparts lacking this transposon. In this study, the locations and compositions of Tn 1546 transposons encompassing the spoVA 2 mob operons in B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis were analyzed. Introduction of these spoVA 2 mob operons into B. subtilis 168 (producing spores that are not highly <b>heat</b> <b>resistant)</b> rendered mutant 168 strains that produced high-level <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> spores, demonstrating that these elements in B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis are responsible for high level heat resistance of spores.

40|$|Alloy {{design by}} the {{traditional}} trial and error approach {{is known to be}} a time consuming and a highly cost procedure, especially for the design of <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steel where the feedback time is intrinsically long. The significant developments in computational simulation techniques in the last decades have made a theory-guided computational alloy design possible. Such a computational approach can substantially decrease the development time costs. In this thesis a computational alloy design approach coupling thermodynamics, kinetics and a genetic algorithm has been developed to design the non-corroding ferritic, martensitic and austenitic <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steels for use at a high service temperature. In the design of <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steels, the evolution of the microstructure and hence properties, depends on service time and temperature and should be considered carefully. For <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steels deriving part of their high strength on precipitates the coarsening of the precipitates at high temperature is considered as the most important factor and this process features highly in the design. Novel steel compositions (involving typically 9 alloying elements) and associated key heat treatment parameters are considered and optimised. The calculated optimal compositions are unlikely to be perfect and free of experimental problems but form an excellent start to initiate experimental development programs and to substantially shorten the development time of new high performance steel grades.
