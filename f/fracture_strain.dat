The aim is to understand the roles of particle shape, volume fraction and distribution over the post-necking deformation and fracture of AA 5754 -O sheet materials. For models containing one single particle, the post-necking deformation decreases when the particle varies from circular to elliptical. The inter-particle spacing, the major parameter of distribution {{to determine whether a}} pair of particles belongs to a stringer or not, was varied for models with two particles of circular or elliptical shape. The general trend is that the post-necking deformation and <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> decrease with decreasing spacing between particles. There is considerable difference in terms of both <b>fracture</b> topographies and <b>strains</b> for models containing 16 particles when distributions varied from random/uniform to stringer distributions. The post-necking deformation and <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> monotonically decrease with particle volume fractions for models with 4 – 64 particles of random or stringer distribution. This indicates that the post-necking behavior for AA 5754 -O alloys where the matrix material is rather ductile is not solely controlled by a single or pair of particles although they may become initiation places of damage. Multiple damaging sources such as stringers or large particles can act cooperatively and speed up the damaging propagation of the material, and therefore produce small post-necking deformation and early fracture. The center clustering of particles can be beneficial for post-necking behavior and bendability of sheet materials...|$|R

There has been an enormous interest in the research and application of conventional fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) in RC column seismic retrofitting. However, due to low <b>fracturing</b> <b>strain</b> capacity of conventional FRPs, the fiber materials tend to fail sooner due to fiber breakage. New fiber materials such as polyacetal fiber (PAF), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have properties of large <b>fracturing</b> <b>strain</b> and low stiffness in comparison to aramid, carbon, and glass fibers.

In this project, uniaxial tensile test was performed for three difference material that is aluminum, brass and mild steel. The objective of the test is to identify the value of uniaxial <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> for these three difference materials. The specimens have been divided into three difference area: L, P-lateral and S-middle zones. The zones are measured using optical microscope {{before and after the}} tensile test to determine the value of ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> at those zones. However, the result from tensile test gives an average value of ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain.</b> The second step was to determine the suitable point or area to get the accurate uniaxial ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain.</b> The element of the material with stress triaxiality,k = 0. 33 is the location where the uniaxial <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> was occurred. Finite element analysis using MSC Patran/Marc 2008 r 1 software was used to determine the element with stress triaxiality,k = 0. 33. In MSC Patran software, the specimen was divided into several nodes to represent the study location for lateral and middle zones. In this project, the model was divided into eleven points.

We suggest that the differences in sweetness intensity in gels containing sucrose heterogeneously distributed in layers and differing in fracture properties result from differences in the frequency of stimulation of taste receptors.

40|$|International audienceExperiments {{have shown}} that in porous ductile materials, cyclic {{loadings}} lead to lower <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> than monotone ones. The effect has been tentatively ascribed to a continued increase of the mean porosity during each cycle {{with the number of}} cycles (" ratcheting of the porosity "). In this work, we first perform finite-element-based micromechanical simulations of elementary hollow cells. These cells are initially spherical, contain an initially spherical void and are loaded cyclically through conditions of homogeneous boundary strain rate; the triaxiality is held constant throughout in absolute value. These simulations fully confirm the interpretation of the reduced <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> under cyclic loadings just mentioned. The modelling of the ratcheting of the porosity is then discussed. Gurson (1977) 's classical model is shown {{not to be able to}} predict such an effect, the evolution of the porosity being stabilized right from the first semi-cycle. The so-called LPD model due to Leblond et al. (1995), an improved variant of Gurson (1977) 's model with a more refined description of strain hardening, makes a better job but fails to accurately reproduce the results of the micromechanical simulations. One explanation of the discrepancy is the assumption of positively proportional straining made in this model, which is basically inadequate for cyclic loadings. An improved version of the LPD model is introduced; this version discards this assumption, at the expense of introduction and radial discretization of an underlying spherical " microcell " at each material point. It is not significantly more com-putationally expensive than the old one and permits a satisfactory reproduction of the results of the micromechanical simulations. This paves the way to simulations of ductile rupture under cyclic loadings within the framework of Gurson-like models...|$|R
