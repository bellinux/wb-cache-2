5|$|After an {{inconclusive}} skirmish in late June at Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk and {{his band}} fled the approaching militia through Wisconsin. They had passed through what are now Beloit and Janesville, then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh, where they <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> toward the Four Lakes region (near modern-day Madison). The band camped for the night near Pheasant Branch.|$|E
5|$|Prior to independence, {{there had}} only been a few {{scattered}} Dutch farmers settled on the Hudson above Albany. In 1787, a group of New Englanders <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> and persuaded one Jacob Vanderhyden to sell them a large tract which they then subdivided and named Troy. The dividing line {{between two of the}} family's farms was called Grand Division Street, later shortened to Grand Street.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{carried out}} Bonaparte's {{plan in the}} Battle of Saorgio in April 1794, and then {{advanced}} to seize Ormea in the mountains. From Ormea, they <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte {{on a mission to}} the Republic of Genoa to determine that country's intentions towards France.|$|E

5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December, Carlson sent Companies C, D, and E east {{towards the}} Tenaru river while Companies A, B, and F <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> towards Mount Austen. Companies C, D, and E reached the lower Tenaru and entered {{friendly}} lines at Lunga Point without incident. Companies A, B, and F, however, encountered a Japanese patrol near {{the summit of}} Mount Austen. In a close-quarters fight in the jungle, 25Japanese were killed and four Marines were seriously wounded, one of whom died later.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of what is}} now NY427 was {{originally}} designated as NY17D in the 1930 renumbering. NY17D began at the intersection of East Water Street (NY17) and Madison Avenue (NY14 and NY17) in downtown Elmira. NY17D <b>headed</b> <b>west,</b> overlapping NY14 along Water Street to Lake Street, where NY17D turned south and followed Lake Street and Pennsylvania Avenue over the Chemung River to Maple Avenue. Here, NY17D turned to the southeast to follow Maple Avenue through southern Elmira. At Cedar Street, NY17D joined the modern alignment of NY427. From this point east, NY17D followed what is now NY427 to Wyncoop Creek Road in Chemung, where it continued on Wilawana Road to the Pennsylvania border.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{carried out}} security and occupation duties, until handing {{over to the}} 384th Field Artillery Battalion on 17 May. It was then ordered to prepare for redeployment to the Pacific Theater of Operations, via the United States. In mid-June, the 824th <b>headed</b> <b>west,</b> leaving their vehicles at depots in northern France, and sailed from Le Havre aboard the SS John Howland and SS Thomas Cresap on 1 July. On arrival, the men were given one month of leave; on 18 August, however, the battalion was notified {{that it would be}} demobilized due to the surrender of Japan. Three weeks later, on 11 September, the battalion was formally demobilized at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{after an}} {{inconclusive}} skirmish at Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk {{and his band}} fled the approaching militia through modern-day Wisconsin. The Sinsinawa Mound raid occurred on 29 June, {{five days after the}} Battle of Apple River Fort. As the band fled the pursuing militia, they passed through what are now Beloit and Janesville, then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh, where they <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> toward the Four Lakes region, near modern-day Madison. On 21 July 1832, the militia caught up with Black Hawk's band as they attempted to cross the Wisconsin River, near the present-day Town of Roxbury, in Dane County, Wisconsin, resulting in the Battle of Wisconsin Heights.|$|E
5|$|With the {{creation}} of the U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926, US 213 was designated to run from the Atlantic Ocean in Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The route <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> from Ocean City through Berlin and Salisbury (where it intersected its parent route US 13), before it turned northwest to Mardela Springs. Here, US 213 turned to the north and ran to Eldorado, where it continued northwest through Hurlock and Preston to Easton. From Easton, the route continued north to Wye Mills and followed the present alignment of MD 213 to Elkton. A new Dover Bridge over the Choptank River east of Easton, replacing a bridge built in the 19th century, was completed in 1932.|$|E

5|$|By 1932, US-36 <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> from Norton toward Oberlin {{instead of}} {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1806 Jennings <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He {{moved to}} Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate on the sale of public lands.|$|E
5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a {{coalition}} of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and <b>headed</b> <b>west,</b> hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by {{a coalition}} of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1846, almost 500 wagons <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> from Independence. At {{the rear of the}} train, a group of nine wagons {{containing}} 32members of the Reed and Donner families and their employees left on May12. George Donner, born in North Carolina, had gradually moved west to Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois, with a one-year sojourn to Texas. In early 1846, he was about 60 years old. With him were his 44-year-old wife Tamsen and their three daughters Frances (6), Georgia (4), and Eliza (3), and George's daughters from a previous marriage: Elitha (14) and Leanna (12). George's younger brother Jacob (56) also joined the party with his wife Elizabeth (45), teenaged stepsons Solomon Hook (14) and William Hook (12), and five children: George (9), Mary (7), Isaac (6), Lewis (4), and Samuel (1). Also traveling with the Donner brothers were teamsters Hiram O. Miller (29), Samuel Shoemaker (25), Noah James (16), Charles Burger (30), John Denton (28), and Augustus Spitzer (30).|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 January, armor/engineer {{elements}} of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> on Route 9 while the brigade's infantry elements were helilifted directly into the Khe Sanh area. By 5 February, Route 9 had been secured up to the Laotian frontier. Simultaneously, the 101st Airborne Division began a feint into the A Shau Valley in order to draw PAVN attention away from Khe Sanh. At the combat base, poor weather, obstacles, land mines, and unexploded ordnance pushed the rehabilitation of the airstrip (estimated by U.S. engineers at four days) a week behind schedule. As a response, a completely new airstrip had to be built and the first aircraft arrived on 15 February. PAVN resistance was almost nonexistent and American casualties were light; with no previous allied presence around Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese had seen no need to maintain large forces in the area. However, General Sutherland believed that the advance to Khe Sanh had been a race between American and PAVN forces, and the U.S. had won.|$|E
5|$|Smith <b>headed</b> <b>west,</b> {{across the}} Ligurian Alps, towards {{southern}} France, which he knew {{had just been}} invaded by Allied troops, principally Americans, Free French and British. He and Bill were assisted along the way by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that because it would be too risky to try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would go first, with the Frenchman, Austrian and Pole following the next day.|$|E

5|$|The Ways of Fate is a 1913 American silent short romance film {{produced}} by the American Film Manufacturing Company. The film's directorial and producer roles have been both attributed to Allan Dwan, but other sources point to Wallace Reid as director. The film's fictional plot is centered on Jim Conway, who grew up wanting to avenge his father's death and <b>headed</b> <b>West</b> to seek his father's killer. Lost in the mountains, he is saved by a young woman and the two fall in love. After a few weeks with her, Conway reveals the reason he came west and the young woman's father overhears it. The old man confesses to killing Conway's father, over a game of cards, and bares his chest. Conway refuses to take revenge, because love had diminished such feelings. The film was released on April 19, 1913 {{and it had a}} widespread national release. It is not known whether the film currently survives, but it is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Triton put to sea on her {{shakedown}} cruise on 15 February 1960, {{bound for}} the South Atlantic. She arrived in the middle Atlantic off St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks on 24 February to commence a history-making voyage. Having remained submerged since her departure from the east coast, Triton continued on south towards Cape Horn, rounded the tip of South America, and <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> across the Pacific. After transiting the Philippine and Indonesian archipelagos and crossing the Indian Ocean, she rounded the Cape of Good Hope and arrived off the St. Peter and Paul Rocks on 10 April—60 days and 21 hours after departing the mid-ocean landmark. Only once did her sail break {{the surface of the}} sea, when she transferred a sick sailor to Macon (CA-132) off Montevideo, Uruguay, on 6 March. She arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 10 May, having completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the earth.|$|E
5|$|US113Alternate {{continued}} north across Isaac Branch at Moores Lake {{and entered}} the city of Dover just south of its underpass of Puncheon Run Connector and crossing of Puncheon Run. Just north of the stream and highway, the alternate route intersected US13 (DuPont Highway). While South State Street continued north toward the Dover Green Historic District and the Delaware State Capitol, US113Alternate turned east to run concurrently with US13. The two highways crossed the St. Jones River and intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which <b>headed</b> <b>west</b> toward the state capitol and east {{to provide access to}} US 113 (Bay Road). Immediately to the north of Court Street, US113Alternate and US113 reached their joint termini at US 13's directional intersection with Bay Road; US 13 continued north along DuPont Highway. There was no direct access between US 113 Alt. and US 113 at the terminal intersection.|$|E
