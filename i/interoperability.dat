5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of <b>interoperability.</b> In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic <b>interoperability</b> unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, {{the brigade}} {{served as the}} command and control element for Saber Strike 11, a {{cooperative}} training effort aimed at improving <b>interoperability</b> and preparing Latvian, Estonian, Lithuanian and U.S. troops for upcoming deployments {{in support of the}} International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) is a {{component}} {{command of the}} USSOCOM and is charged to study special operations requirements and techniques to ensure <b>interoperability</b> and equipment standardization, plan and conduct special operations exercises and training, and develop Joint Special Operations Tactics. It was established in 1980 on recommendation of Col. Charlie Beckwith, {{in the aftermath of}} the failure of Operation Eagle Claw.|$|E
5|$|Neversoft's Brian Bright {{revealed}} {{that the use of}} Guitar Hero guitar controllers within DJ Hero arose when they tried to create mixes of guitar-heavy and rock tracks in the game; they felt something was missing in these mixes and added in the Guitar Hero-style of play alongside it. Bright has stated that, while too late for the planned release of Guitar Hero 5, they are looking towards future instrument controller <b>interoperability,</b> including use of the DJ Hero controller into gameplay for future Guitar Hero titles, or using drum controllers within DJ Hero.|$|E
5|$|Nødnett ensures 100% {{coverage}} of populated and surrounding areas, which exceeds {{any of the}} existing GSM networks. This includes good coverage indoors, to aid fire fighters, as well as full {{coverage of}} the coastline and coverage up to 2,500meters (8,000ft) height for aircraft. Nødnett gives full coverage along all national and county roads. The system also allows <b>interoperability</b> towards the maritime radio. The network also allows for transmission of data at a speed of 12-13 kbit/s.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground station}} is {{connected}} to KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and SvalSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses <b>interoperability</b> and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} {{capabilities of}} the SBS and the SAS are broadly similar. However, the SBS (being the principal Royal Navy contribution to UKSF) has the additional training and equipment required to lead in the maritime, amphibious and riverine environments. Both units come under the operational command of HQ Directorate of Special Forces (DSF) and undergo an identical selection process. They enjoy significant <b>interoperability</b> in training and on operations.|$|E
5|$|All ground {{stations}} {{are connected to}} KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses <b>interoperability</b> and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
25|$|Article 7 bis A {{introduced}} a loophole for designers of technical measures of protection {{who do not}} desire to share them for <b>interoperability.</b> It states that the mission of this administrative authority is to prevent lack of <b>interoperability</b> and other limitations when these are not desired by the copyright holder. It thus seems possible that designers of technical measures can work around the <b>interoperability</b> requirement by showing that lack of <b>interoperability</b> was desired by the copyright holders.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} ensure global <b>interoperability</b> of products, several {{organizations}} have set up additional standards for RFID testing. These standards include conformance, performance and <b>interoperability</b> tests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interoperability</b> has {{the effect}} of making the network bigger and thus {{increases}} the external value of the network to consumers. <b>Interoperability</b> achieves this primarily by increasing potential connections and secondarily by attracting new participants to the network. Other benefits of <b>interoperability</b> include reduced uncertainty, reduced lock-in, commoditization and competition based on price.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interoperability</b> can be {{achieved}} through standardization or other cooperation. Companies involved in fostering <b>interoperability</b> face a tension between cooperating with their competitors to grow the potential market for products and competing for market share.|$|E
25|$|Representatives from Apple {{were heard}} by the Senate Commission for Cultural affairs. The Commission {{subsequently}} recommended that the <b>interoperability</b> provisions should be substantially reworked, and proposed amendments, {{most of which were}} adopted by the Senate. A notable exception is that the Senate rejected (by 11 votes against 10) an amendment from the Commission which suppressed the right to work around DRMs for reasons of <b>interoperability.</b> The text from the Senate introduces an administrative authority capable of adjudicating the possibility of reading DRM contents in order to achieve <b>interoperability.</b>|$|E
25|$|KDE {{participates in}} freedesktop.org, {{an effort to}} {{standardize}} Unix desktop <b>interoperability.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the first}} Interop conference focused on network <b>interoperability</b> by broader {{adoption}} of TCP/IP. The conference {{was founded by}} Dan Lynch, an early Internet activist. From the beginning, large corporations, such as IBM and DEC, attended the meeting. <b>Interoperability</b> conferences have been held every year since then. Every year from 1985 through 1993, the number of attendees tripled.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand is {{a member}} of the ABCA Armies {{standardisation}} programme, the naval AUSCANNZUKUS forum, the Air and Space <b>Interoperability</b> Council (ASIC, the former ASCC, which, among other tasks, allocates NATO reporting names) and other Western 'Five Eyes' fora for sharing signals intelligence information and achieving <b>interoperability</b> with like-minded armed forces, such as The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP).|$|E
25|$|Codenamed SIMFIRE – <b>interoperability</b> {{testing tool}} for the Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware (DASH) open architecture.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Egis {{was also}} {{selected}} {{to provide a}} central system to enable <b>interoperability</b> between different electronic toll collection systems in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} organization may adopt certain standards to, for example, ensure openness {{within the}} organization and towards external parties, maximizing <b>interoperability</b> between services/systems, etc.|$|E
25|$|Directorate of the Joint Staff, JDAT conducts field {{analysis}} of C2 information systems and procedures producing decision-quality data to improve Joint C2 integration and <b>interoperability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unix <b>interoperability</b> was {{sought by}} {{establishing}} the POSIX standard. The POSIX standard {{can be applied}} to any operating system, although it was originally created for various Unix variants.|$|E
25|$|The {{aim of this}} EU Directive is {{to achieve}} the <b>interoperability</b> of the European {{high-speed}} train network at the various stages of its design, construction and operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{exercise}} is tasked with boosting cooperation and <b>interoperability</b> between the Russian and Indian navies. The word INDRA is a portmanteau of the participants' respective countries.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008 the {{governmental}} IT-Board of the Bundesregierung {{decided to make}} use of the ODF-Format in the Federal administration in order to improve IT-security and <b>interoperability.</b>|$|E
25|$|This greatly enhances our two navies’ <b>interoperability,</b> {{which is}} very {{important}} to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions, as well as issues of maritime security and piracy.|$|E
25|$|An {{emerging}} standard from HL7, Fast Healthcare <b>Interoperability</b> Resources (FHIR), {{is designed}} {{to make it easier}} for developers of personal health record applications to access relevant medical records.|$|E
25|$|Some {{amendments}} to the bill, not present in the original version, would potentially require manufacturers to share their proprietary digital music formats with other software developers (by way {{of the need to}} provide the documentation necessary for <b>interoperability).</b> Because of this, a controversy arose with Apple Computer and associated US industry groups, who loudly protested in the US press; therefore, the DADVSI bill was sometimes referred to as the iTunes law or iPod law in the English-language press (see <b>Interoperability</b> and Apple controversy), although the law is not referred to in this way in France.|$|E
25|$|In general, graceful {{security}} degradation for {{the sake}} of <b>interoperability</b> is difficult to carry out in a way that cannot be exploited. This is challenging especially in domains where fragmentation is high.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 the {{developers}} determined {{that although the}} Buk missile system is the successor to the Kub missile system, both systems could share some <b>interoperability.</b> The result of this decision was the 9K37-1 Buk-1 system. <b>Interoperability</b> between Buk TELAR and Kub TEL meant {{an increase in the}} number of fire control channels and available missiles for each system, as well as faster entry of Buk system components into service. The Buk-1 was adopted into service in 1978 following completion of state trials, while the complete Buk missile system was accepted into service in 1980 after state trials took place between 1977 and 1979.|$|E
25|$|Version 4.0 was {{released}} 23 July 2013. Features include merging the Symphony code drop, reimplementing the sidebar-style interface from Symphony, improved install, MS Office <b>interoperability</b> enhancements, and performance improvements. 4.0.1 added nine new languages.|$|E
25|$|The home {{broadband}} {{and voice}} service {{is powered by}} WiMAX (Worldwide <b>Interoperability</b> for Microwave Access) technology. Ooredoo Oman was first to deploy 3G+ in Oman {{and is the only}} operator to deploy WiMAX commercially in Oman.|$|E
25|$|ASTM Continuity of Care Record - {{a patient}} health summary {{standard}} based upon XML, the CCR can be created, read and interpreted by various EHR or Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, allowing easy <b>interoperability</b> between otherwise disparate entities.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, filenames allowed any {{character}} in their filenames {{as long as}} they were file system safe. Although this permitted the use of any encoding, and thus allowed the representation of any local text on any local system, it caused many <b>interoperability</b> issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{exercise}} {{is designed to}} test the combat readiness of the Indian naval units, {{as well as the}} Indian Air Force, Indian Army and the Indian Coast Guard. It also seeks to strengthen <b>interoperability</b> and joint operations in a complex environment.|$|E
25|$|The lack of gating <b>interoperability</b> has {{traditionally}} been a bottleneck preventing reproducibility of flow cytometry data analysis and the usage of multiple analytical tools. To address this shortcoming, ISAC developed Gating-ML, an XML-based mechanism to formally describe gates and related data (scale) transformations.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 NMCI {{became the}} first network to deploy the Global Address List (GAL), a {{multiservice}} address list that increases <b>interoperability</b> by enabling Navy and Marine Corps users to access the Defense Information Systems Agency's Joint Enterprise Directory Services (JEDS) contact list.|$|E
