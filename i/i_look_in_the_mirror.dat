5000|$|In March 2012 when Papoose {{was asked}} if he would change the name of the album he responded with [...] This isn’t just an album for me. This is my life story. This is how I grew up in this country. The title of my album is Nacirema Dream. “Nacirema” is the word “American” spelled backwards. Some people get up to go to work. Some people hustle. People come from all {{different}} corners of the Earth, risk their life getting here in search of that American dream. My struggle growing up in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, being successful in the music industry, and going through all the trials and tribulations I went through in my life - Nacirema Dream is a reflection of that. I can’t change my face when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> I can’t change my album title. This isn’t just an album title for entertainment. This is real! It won’t be changed. It’s definitely going to come out under that title.|$|E

She was the second cast member to be announced following Steven R. McQueen, who plays Elena's brother Jeremy Gilbert. Steve West Cinema Blend said the vampire brothers' battle over Elena will wreak havoc on the entire town.". Executive producer Kevin Williamson recalled Dobrev auditioning while having the flu, which he described as the [...] "best audition ever", and they [...] "didn't even look at her a second time". Dobrev went back home to Canada, yet, still wanting the part, she submitted a videotape audition, which saw her cast as Elena Gilbert.|$|E
40|$|The causal {{powers that}} I have, {{such as the}} ability to go to the store for cold beer, for {{instance}} are the same causal powers as those had by the human animal closely associated with me. That is, the biological organism that invariably stares back at me, whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Thus, if I want to avoid gratuitous causal overdetermination – i. e. if I want to avoid positing two separate individuals with identical, and thus redundant, causal powers – as I justifiably do, then I should adopt animalism.

40|$|I {{would like}} to {{dedicate}} this thesis to DEB. You will always be {{one of my favorites}} as well. I have been blessed to know so many wonderful people already in my life, but I have found a sort of bittersweet pattern of meeting some of the most extraordinary people of my life just a short time before I’m due to move on to a new chapter. If ever that pattern was the case, it is here, with you. I cannot put into words the impact you made on my life from the first time I talked to you at the department picnic to the conversations in your office to the conversations at the bakery. My work, my experience, and my life are all the better for knowing you. You pushed me to produce papers I didn’t know I was capable of writing. You pushed me to submit my work for publishing when I didn’t have the courage to believe in my own abilities. Because I’ve known you, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and I see myself through your eyes. I see potential. I see capability. The saying is so very true that we all stand on the shoulders of giants, and I {{want you to know that}} in my memory you will always be one of the tallest.

I floated to the ceiling from where I watched the little girl stripped of her dignity the blood of my shattered innocence forever staining my nursery. Uncannily he picked my body and carried it to the temple where I kneeled before the alter of Hindu gods and goddesses and repeated after him, “My papa loves me. My papa will always love me. ” My Glass Bangles I had lost the freedom to dress my body With the beautiful outfits, elegant dresses and frilly skirts At age seven when I wore for the very last time A patterned dress filled with rainbow colors.

Even now when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> I can see my dark black hair pulled back With my favorite pink ribbon, my earrings staring at me Through the glass, with a happy face. Within moments of walking into the room Filled with family and friends Celebrating the birth of another year, I knew there was nowhere to hide from my father’s piercing eyes That penetrated deep below my dress and raped me, all night long.
