40|$|AbstractAn <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> is a graph {{in which}} {{the number of new}} cases of an {{outbreak}} disease is plotted against time. Epidemic curves are ordinarily constructed after the disease outbreak is over. However, a good estimate of the <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> early in an outbreak would be invaluable to health care officials. Currently, techniques for predicting the severity of an outbreak are very limited. As far as predicting the number of future cases, ordinarily epidemiologists simply make an educated guess as to how many people might become affected.

We examined the age-specific <b>epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtyped into seasonal A(H 1 N 1), A(H 3 N 2), and pandemic virus A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09), influenza B and {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV), in subtropical city Hong Kong from 2004 to 2013. We found that different types and subtypes of influenza showed similar two-peak patterns across age groups, with one peak in winter and another in spring/summer.

The effects of vaccine coverage and information distribution on influenza epidemics were evaluated. Materials and MethodsFour indices for epidemics (i. e., onset-peak duration, onset-end duration, ratio of the onset-peak duration to onset-end duration and steepness of epidemic curves) were defined, and the correlations between these indices and anti-flu drug prescription dose, vaccine coverage, the volume of media and search trend on influenza through internet were analyzed. Epidemiological data on seasonal influenza epidemics from 2002 / 2003 to 2013 / 2014 excluding 2009 / 2010 season were collected from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan. ResultsThe onset-peak duration and its ratio to onset-end duration correlated inversely with the volume of anti-flu drug prescription. Onset-peak duration correlated positively with media information volume on influenza. The steepness of the <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve,</b> and anti-flu drug prescription dose inversely correlated with the volume of media information.

40|$|Abstract To better {{describe}} the epidemiology of influenza at local level, {{the time course of}} pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) 2009 {{in the city}} of Hong Kong was reconstructed from notification data after decomposition procedure and time series analysis. GIS (geographic information system) methodology was incorporated for assessing spatial variation. Between May and September 2009, a total of 24415 cases were successfully geocoded, out of 25473 (95. 8 %) reports in the original dataset. The reconstructed <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> was characterized by a small initial peak, a nadir followed by rapid rise to the ultimate plateau. The full course of the epidemic had lasted for about 6 months. Despite the small geographic area of only 1000 Km 2, distinctive spatial variation was observed in the configuration of the curves across 6 geographic regions. With the relatively uniform physical and climatic environment within Hong Kong, the temporo-spatial variability of influenza spread could only be explained by the heterogeneous population structure and mobility patterns.

This study was aimed to investigate {{the impact of the}} pandemic on age-specific <b>epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> of other respiratory viruses. Methods Weekly laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtypes seasonal A(H 1 N 1), A(H 3 N 2), pandemic virus A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza were obtained from 2004 to 2013. Age-specific <b>epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> of viruses other than A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 were compared between the pre-pandemic (May 2004 - April 2009), pandemic (May 2009 - April 2010) and post-pandemic periods (May 2010 - April 2013). Results There were two peaks of A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 in Hong Kong, the first in September 2009 and the second in February 2011. The infection rate was found highest in young children in both waves, but markedly fewer cases in school children were recorded in the second wave than in the first wave. Positive proportions of viruses other than A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 markedly decreased in all age groups during the first pandemic wave. After the first wave of the pandemic, the positive proportion of A(H 3 N 2) increased, but those of B and RSV remained slightly lower than their pre-pandemic proportions. Changes in seasonal pattern and epidemic peak time were also observed, but inconsistent across virus-age groups. Conclusion Our findings provide some evidence that age distribution, seasonal pattern and peak time of other respiratory viruses have changed since the pandemic.

To {{improve the situation}} awareness, the present study aimed to forecast the cholera epidemic, explicitly addressing the reporting delay and ascertainment bias. Methods: Using weekly incidence of suspected cases, updated as a revised <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> every week, the reporting delay was explicitly incorporated into the estimation model. Using the weekly case fatality risk as calculated by the World Health Organization, ascertainment bias was adjusted, enabling us to parameterize the family of logistic curves (i. e., logistic and generalized logistic models) for describing the unbiased incidence in 2017. Results: The cumulative incidence {{at the end of}} the epidemic, was estimated at 790, 778 (95 % CI: 700, 495, 914, 442) cases and 767, 029 (95 % CI: 690, 877, 871, 671) cases, respectively, by using logistic and generalized logistic models. It was also estimated that we have just passed through the epidemic peak by week 26, 2017. From week 27 onwards, the weekly incidence was predicted to decrease.

40|$|Undiagnosed infections {{accounted}} for the hidden proportion of HIV cases that have escaped from public health surveillance. To assess the population risk of HIV transmission, we estimated the undiagnosed interval of each known infection for constructing the HIV incidence curves. We used modified back-calculation methods to estimate the seroconversion year for each diagnosed patient attending {{any one of the}} 3 HIV specialist clinics in Hong Kong. Three approaches were used, depending on the adequacy of CD 4 data: (A) estimating one's pre-treatment CD 4 depletion rate in multilevel model;(B) projecting one's seroconversion year by referencing seroconverters' CD 4 depletion rate; or (C) projecting from the distribution of estimated undiagnosed intervals in (B). Factors associated with long undiagnosed interval (> 2 years) were examined in univariate analyses. <b>Epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> constructed from estimated seroconversion data were evaluated by modes of transmission. Between 1991 and 2010, a total of 3695 adult HIV patients were diagnosed. The undiagnosed intervals were derived from method (A) (28 %), (B) (61 %) and (C) (11 %) respectively. The intervals ranged from 0 to 10 years, and were shortened from 2001. Heterosexual infection, female, Chinese and age > 64 at diagnosis were associated with long undiagnosed interval. Overall, the peaks of the new incidence curves were reached 4 - 6 years ahead of reported diagnoses, while their contours varied by mode of transmission. Characteristically, the epidemic growth of heterosexual male and female declined after 1998 with slight rebound in 2004 - 2006, but that of MSM continued to rise after 1998. By determining the time of seroconversion, HIV <b>epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> could be reconstructed from clinical data to better illustrate the trends of new infections.

40|$|Background: Dengue is {{endemic to}} the rural {{province}} of Kamphaeng Phet, Northern Thailand. A decade of prospective cohort studies has provided important insights into the dengue viruses and their generated disease. However, as elsewhere, spatial dynamics of the pathogen remain poorly understood. In particular, the spatial scale of transmission and the scale of clustering are poorly characterized. This information is critical for effective deployment of spatially targeted interventions and for understanding the mechanisms that drive the dispersal of the virus. Methodology/Principal Findings: We geocoded the home locations of 4, 768 confirmed dengue cases admitted to the main hospital in Kamphaeng Phet province between 1994 and 2008. We used the phi clustering statistic to characterize shortterm spatial dependence between cases. Further, to see if clustering of cases led to similar temporal patterns of disease across villages, we calculated the correlation in the long-term <b>epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> between communities. We found that cases were 2. 9 times (95 % confidence interval 2. 7 – 3. 2) more likely {{to live in the}} same village and be infected within the same month than expected given the underlying spatial and temporal distribution of cases. This fell to 1. 4 times (1. 2 – 1. 7) for individuals living in villages 1 km apart. Significant clustering was observed up to 5 km. We found a steadily decreasing trend in the correlation in <b>epidemics</b> <b>curves</b> by distance: communities separated by up to 5 km had a mean correlation of 0. 28 falling to 0. 16 for communities separated between 20 km and 25 km. A potential explanation for these patterns is a role for human movement in spreading the pathogen between communities. Gravity style models, which attempt to capture population movement, outperformed competing models in describing the observed correlations. Conclusions: There exists significant short-term clustering of cases within individual villages. Effective spatially and temporally targeted interventions deployed within villages may target ongoing transmission and reduce infection risk...|$|R
