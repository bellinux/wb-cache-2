40|$|This study {{presents}} {{methods of}} transit signal priority without transit-only lanes for a transit-based emergency evacuation in a sudden-onset disaster. Arterial priority signal coordination is optimized when a traffic signal control system provides priority signals <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> along an evacuation route. Transit signal priority {{is determined by}} “transit vehicle arrival time estimation,” “queuing vehicle dissipation time estimation,” “traffic signal status estimation,” “transit signal optimization,” and “arterial traffic signal coordination <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> in evacuation route. ” It {{takes advantage of the}} large capacities of <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles,</b> reduces the evacuation time, and evacuates as many evacuees as possible.

40|$|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) {{is defined}} by the Federal Transit Administration as “a rapid mode of {{transportation}} that can provide the quality of rail transit and the flexibility of buses. ” The implementation of BRT can improve the speed, reliability, and identity of transit services, increasing the likelihood of transit system usage. In addition, some applications of BRT can maximize person capacity along corridors that are characterized by limited right-of-way. This paper presents three approaches to using BRT to maximize person capacity. These approaches include: (1) Mixed Traffic- Person capacity has been increased in many communities by implementing BRT in mixed traffic without exclusive lanes. Such an approach typically requires an investment in mainline transit signal priority, queue jumps, and bypass lanes along the corridor. Other BRT elements are also integrated into the system, including rail-like rubber-tired vehicles, level boarding, off-board fare collection, and unique branding. Los Angeles {{is a good example of}} widespread implementation of BRT in mixed traffic. (2) Bus Use of Shoulders- Bus use of shoulders on interstates, arterials, and bridges has been implemented by many communities along selected corridors. Bus use of shoulders typically comes with restrictions and generally allows buses to bypass congestion when travel speeds are less than 35 miles per hour on the through lanes. This approach can essentially result in an additional lane of capacity in both directions. (3) Use of Existing Medians- Divided roadways that have sufficient median space provide opportunities for integrating exclusive lanes within the existing right-of-way. The exclusive lanes may involve two-way traffic <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> flow or a single, reversible lane of traffic <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> flow. These three approaches to using BRT are presented in this paper to emphasize techniques that can be used to maximize person capacity within limited right-of-way...|$|R
40|$|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) uses {{strategies}} such as exclusive bus lanes, off-vehicle fare collection, {{high quality}} vehicles and stations, signal priority, among others. Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is frequently seen as an option to improve performance of public transportation systems at the operational level. TSP is an operational strategy that aims at reducing the delays at intersections <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The goal is to reduce travel times and improve service reliability. The use of transit priority strategies, properly designed for BRT, can complement its other features and potentially contribute to improved performance. However, BRT corridors present a number of challenges and operating characteristics that differ from conventional corridors which are worth considering. This thesis evaluates the potential of incorporating different priority strategies, especially TSP, into BRT operations both in the U. S. and in developing countries. A corridor from Boston, MA and a corridor from Santiago, Chile are analyzed, assessing TSP strategies that consider different conditions such as headway, loads, and traffic demand in a BRT context. Results for both case studies support the belief that TSP can provide travel time reductions <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles,</b> together with reductions in headway variability. However, results proved to be very sensitive to increases in traffic congestion and transit frequency. The research provides insights into the potential of TSP under medium {{and high levels of}} traffic demand, as well as under higher frequencies. Further research is necessary to make the models more robust and test the sensitivity of the parameters of the priority strategies. Evaluation of other priority strategies like the use of full exclusive bus lanes and signal coordination are also included. by Anna C. Matías Alemán. Thesis (S.

40|$|Previous {{experience}} {{has shown that}} real-time, traffic-responsive signal control {{has the ability to}} improve traffic operations in urban areas when compared to traditional fixed-time control. However, most of these experiences have focused primarily on the impact on private automobiles. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a fully distributed, real-time, traffic-responsive model named SPPORT (Signal Priority Procedure for Optimization in Real-Time) that explicitly considers the impacts of <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles.</b> This model is unique in two ways. First, the model explicitly considers the interference caused to the general traffic by <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> stopping in the right of way to board and discharge passengers. Second, when considering priority passage <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the potential effects that such preferential treatment might have on other traffic is explicitly quantified. This paper describes the structure of the model and demonstrates it capabilities on an isolated intersection for a range of traffic demands and with and without <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The rule-based signal optimization procedure provided delay reductions for most of the traffic conditions examined when compared to both fixed-time and traffic actuated control. While the results reported in this paper are limited to an isolated intersection, the model is capable of being applied to a network of signals. Evaluation of its performance on a corridor has been conducted and will appear in the literature in the near future. Dion and Hellinga...|$|R

Shielding needs for both solar particle events (SPEs) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) exposure are discussed <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> and surface habitats. This work was performed under the aegis of two NASA initiatives. The first study was an architecture trade study led by Langley Research Center (LaRC) in which a broad range of vehicle types and mission scenarios were compared. The radiation analysis for this study primarily focused on the additional shielding mass required to protect astronauts from the rare occurrence of a large SPE. The second study, led by Johnson Space Center (JSC), involved the design of lunar habitats. Researchers at LaRC were asked to evaluate the changes to mission architecture that would be needed if the surface stay were lengthened from a shorter mission duration of 30 to 90 days to a longer stay of 500 days. Here, the primary radiation concern was GCR exposure. The methods used for these studies as well as the resulting shielding recommendations are discussed. Recommendations are also made for more detailed analyses to minimize shielding mass, once preliminary vehicle and habitat designs have been completed. Here, methodologies are mapped out and available radiation analysis tools are described. Since, as yet, no dosimetric limits have been adopted for missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO), radiation exposures are compared to LEO limits. Uncertainties associated with the LEO career effective dose limits and the effects of lowering these limits on shielding mass are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Transit signal {{priority}} (TSP) {{is designed}} to reduce delay <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> through signalized intersections. For an existing TSP system, {{it is important to}} assess how timely and effective TSP phases are granted to buses that request priority. It is also necessary to evaluate the time savings and delays for buses and other vehicles as a result of TSP phases. However, {{due to the lack of}} disaggregated and integrated transit, traffic and signal phase data, previous studies have not investigated the TSP performance at the phase level. This study collects and integrates three archived databases: bus automatic vehicle location (AVL) and automatic passenger count (APC) data, intersection signal phase log data, and vehicle count data. Based on the integrated database, this research proposes innovative and useful performance measures to assess the timeliness and effectiveness of TSP phases to buses that request priority. This study also evaluates the time savings and delays to buses and other vehicles on major and minor streets. Results show that TSP performance varies significantly across intersections. On average, most of the TSP phases were granted timely to buses that request priority, but only a few of them were effective. Early green phases are more effective than green extension phases because too many green extension phases were granted late. For each early green phase, the total passenger time savings for buses and other vehicles on major streets is much higher than the delay to vehicles on minor streets. However, for each green extension phase, the total time savings on major streets is almost equal to the total delay on minor streets. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} {{implications of}} transport planning and infrastructure {{have become an}} important consideration across the last decade. Significant research {{has been carried out}} to identify methods to reduce the impact of transportation systems, in particular surface transportation systems, on the environment. Transit signal prioritisation has been widely used throughout mass-transit systems to ensure schedule adherence and reduce delays <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles,</b> primarily buses at a minimised cost to other vehicles on the network. However these systems do not take into consideration the impact on the level of emissions created by the signal prioritisation scenario. The paper demonstrates the emissions impact of a standard Transit Signal Priority (TSP) application simulated using the microsimulation tool, Paramics on the corridor network of El Camino Real, CA. Environmental performance data was collected using the emissions modelling tool "Paramics Monitor" and the results of the simulation indicate that even though emissions levels of busses reduce, the overall level of emissions tend to increase with the implementation of TSP. Accordingly the research study further proposes a methodology for the determination of real time transit signal prioritisation optimisation model with the primary aim to minimise the environmental impact (emissions and fuel consumption). In other words, this will in the future result in the development of an Eco-Transit Signal Prioritisation application. The provision of priority considers a number of parameters including the vehicle's location, speed, vehicle type as well as emissions (such as greenhouse gasses) and fuel consumption. In addition schedule adherence and the number of passengers on board also serve as important factors affecting both the level of emissions as well as delays experienced...|$|R
