5|$|Earl Ball, the Flyers' manager, <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{gathering}} on August 29 and {{was interested}} in participating. The original four representatives then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17. At that meeting, held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay's Hupmobile showroom in Canton, representatives of the Rock Island Independents, the Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Cardinals, and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league. Representatives of the Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in}} the league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Jim Thorpe as president. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, and representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E
25|$|In one {{of several}} of the graces or miracles narrated by Fr. Benito Gómez in Abulug a boy called Benito fell from the roof of the parish house, {{damaging}} the his brain and rendering him insane. When his mother, Doña Paula, <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> she quickly brought her son to the shrine at Piat, where she offered some candles and alms for a Mass to be said for the boy. In no time, her son became healthy again and cured of his madness.|$|E
25|$|The {{new state}} {{constitution}} was revised, and in 1779, Rutledge was elected governor. Rutledge sent troops under General Benjamin Lincoln into Georgia to harass the British. The new British {{commander in the}} south, General Jacques Prevost, responded by marching on Charleston with 2,500 troops. When Rutledge <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> threat, he hurried to Charleston and worked furiously to build up defenses. In spite of Rutledge’s efforts, when General Prevost arrived outside Charleston, the British force had been greatly increased {{by the addition of}} Loyalists, and the Americans were vastly outnumbered.|$|E

25|$|As Dunhuang {{was located}} near foreign lands, many traders often {{travelled}} {{from the west}} to China through the Silk Road to pay tribute or to trade. However, many wealthy locals in Dunhuang objected to trading and had even cheated foreign traders, resulting in much unhappiness among foreigners. When Cang Ci <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> he personally went to reassure the foreign traders and opened up special routes leading to Luoyang exclusively for those traders, while ordering his men to protect and escort the traders as they passed through. The foreigners were very grateful to Cang Ci.|$|E
25|$|Another scandal {{emerged from}} within the unit when a 38-year-old 1st Airborne Brigade paratrooper was arrested in Inzai, Chiba Prefecture for shoplifting. He {{admitted}} to officers {{that he did it}} to demonstrate that he was serious in his effort to avoid deployment to Iraq. When JGSDF officials <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> they told press officials that they require the consent of the troopers and their relatives. Otherwise, they would not be deployed. The Iraq deployment had caused a national debate in Japan, and a new public consensus was necessary for the military to develop a modern role and structure.|$|E
25|$|Oral traditions {{claim that}} anlu was created when, during war, all the males were {{slaughtered}} (in some versions {{this is in}} Bamessi). The story records that the Kom people were a tributary to a chief in Mejang and their tribute was {{to build a house}} in the Mejang city every year. Eventually, the Kom refused and Mejang dispatched an army to put down the rebellion. The Mejang forces decided to attack while the men were hunting and capture all the women. The women <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and so dressed in male clothing and went with crude weapons to meet the Mejang. The men fled from what they thought were the troops of Kom and only one was captured. The women stripped off their clothing to reveal that the Mejang forces had been defeated by women and Mejang became a Kom tributary after that point.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of World War II Royal Air Force pilots were buying Rolex watches to replace their {{inferior}} standard-issue watches. However, when captured and sent to POW camps, their watches were confiscated. When Hans Wilsdorf heard of this, he offered to replace all watches that had been confiscated and not require payment {{until the end of}} the war, if the officers would write to Rolex and explain the circumstances of their loss and where they were being held. Wilsdorf was in personal charge of the scheme. As a result of this, an estimated 3,000 Rolex watches were ordered by British officers in the Oflag (prison camp for officers) VII B POW camp in Bavaria alone. This had the effect of raising the morale among the allied POWs because it indicated that Wilsdorf did not believe that the Axis powers would win the war. American servicemen <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> when stationed in Europe during WWII and this helped open up the American market to Rolex after the war.|$|E
25|$|Sources {{state that}} in 626, {{the crown prince}} Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who {{supported}} Li Jiancheng, set out to ambush the rising Li Shimin. But Li Shimin <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> trap, and organized a counter-coup, walking into the trap with several of his own most trusted and skilled soldiers. When Li Shimin mobilized his personal troops within his mansion, and as he did so, Princess Zhangsun {{was said to have}} personally made an appearance before the troops to encourage them. Her brother Zhangsun Wuji was one of Li Shimin's major strategists in this matter. Li Shimin was able to counter Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate and kill them, and then essentially forced Emperor Gaozu to appoint him crown prince. Princess Zhangsun was accordingly named crown princess. Two months later, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin, who took the throne as Emperor Taizong. Princess Zhangsun, consequently, became empress, and their oldest son, Li Chengqian, became crown prince.|$|E
25|$|Timothy had again {{been elected}} to the {{legislature}} in 1762, but was not reelected the following year due to an election rigged by Elijah Williams. In November 1762, the Susquehanna Company voted {{him to be a}} part of a committee to meet with the Native American chiefs at Albany to discuss the purchase they had made, which was still disputed. This meeting was set for late March, and Elijah and his supporters took advantage of his absence. At this time, the number of English settlers had increased drastically, and some of them were in favor of splitting the town between the English and Native Americans. Williams called for a town meeting while Timothy was in Albany, and while many of the Native American voters were away on their winter syrup harvest. Timothy <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> but was apparently convinced his supporters would reelect him. Williams, however, brought in outsiders to vote for him and used a written ballot, as opposed to the past policy of translating everything into Mahican so that the Mahicans would understand. Even using these extreme tactics, Williams still only won by a three-vote margin. Timothy and his supporters were outraged and demanded an investigation. A petition was sent to Governor Bernard in May with 23 signatures, and Timothy sent another letter in December with 16 signatures. The investigation was delayed until October, and confirmed many of their charges, however the results were allowed to stand.|$|E

50|$|Tomato juice {{was first}} {{served as a}} {{beverage}} in 1917 by Louis Perrin at the French Lick Springs Hotel in southern Indiana, when {{he ran out of}} orange juice and needed a quick substitute. His combination of squeezed tomatoes, sugar and his special sauce became an instant success as Chicago businessmen spread the word about the tomato juice cocktail. When people <b>heard</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> drink the businessmen became more and more famous.|$|R
50|$|The {{musician}} Văn Cao {{appeared at}} the battlefiled right after the battle had ended, therefore he managed to witness the burning and destroyed villages, the corpse of killed Frenchs in the river, and the victorious Vietnamese people who were rebuilding the devastated home after the great victory. After that, when arriving at the Viet Minh head base, Văn Cao met Doãn Tuế, an artillery officer {{who participated in the}} victory on River Lô and <b>heard</b> everything <b>about</b> <b>this</b> battle from Tuế. All of these events became the material for Văn Cao to compose a great epic song <b>about</b> <b>this</b> decisive victory.|$|R
500|$|When {{discussing}} his collaboration with Cyrus, Borgore stated that [...] "you {{have to understand}} that I grew up in Israel, and the whole Hannah Montana thing, I've never seen it.

[...] Her involvement with [...] "Decisions" [...] was originally not publicly acknowledged in an attempt to [...] "make a tune together that we're super happy about and just see people's real opinion about this." [...] However, Cyrus unexpectedly tweeted [...] "Yo check out Decisions me & @borgore new track" [...] in August 2012, which Borgore commented was [...] "super cool [...] she did it the way she did it". He added that he was impressed with her vocal abilities, elaborating that [...] "I thought she was made up more to be a star, but she was pretty phenomenal behind the booth." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mr. Pitiful" [...] was {{recorded}} in December 1964 at the Stax studios. The song was written by both guitarist Steve Cropper and Redding, and was their first collaboration. It was inspired by and written {{as a response to}} a statement made by radio disc jockey Moohah Williams, who had nicknamed Redding [...] "Mr. Pitiful" [...] for sounding pitiful when singing ballads. Cropper <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and, while taking a shower, got the idea it would make a good song. In the car {{on the way to the}} studio, Cropper proposed the idea with a melody already in mind, humming it to Redding. By the time they reached the studio, the song was written and they recorded it in two or three takes. It was released as a single with the B-side [...] "That's How Strong My Love Is". The song became a hit and the album's most successful track, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard R and at number 41 on Billboard Hot 100 chart.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E

They’re a band so many people haven’t <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> but <b>this</b> album is truly a gem. Everyone’s putting technical and jazz elements of things like virtuoso guitarist Allan Holdsworth in there, but these guys were doing it before all of them and Martyr don’t do it for the sake of it, they do it for the sake of new sounding songs. The band incorporate jazz, thrash, death and tech and so much more. They really have their own sound." ...|$|R
500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who {{want to get out of}} prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} the {{question}} of Judge's salaries also arose, and almost caused a constitutional crisis. As Permanent Secretary Schuster was tasked with ensuring that the courts ran correctly, and although the Judges were independent they were paid by the Lord Chancellor's Office. Although a Select Committee in 1878 had recommended that County Court Judges be paid £2,000 a year this increase had still failed to appear due to the economic hardships caused by the First World War. The increase was eventually implemented in 1937, {{but in the meantime}} High Court Judges had also been lobbying for an increase, as their pay had stayed at the same level since 1832. Schuster and Warren Fisher had produced a report recommending a pay increase in 1920, but again the economic hardship prevented their plan from being implemented. The 1931 [...] led to the government passing the National Recovery Act 1931, which reduced the salaries of High Court Judges by 20%. The Judges, who had been expecting a pay raise rather than a pay cut, were shocked, and six High Court Judges threatened to resign, with Henry McCardie accusing Schuster of having his salary almost doubled in the last twelve years. The Prime Minister and Sankey met to write a letter to the Judges demanding that they give in; as soon as Schuster <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> he rushed to Whitehall to [...] "stop the madness". The protests from the Judges increased through 1931 and 1932, with several judges including Albert Clauson and Arthur Luxmoore threatening to sue the government. After negotiations between Schuster and the judges failed {{to bring an end to}} the crisis the section of the act cutting judges' pay was quietly dropped.|$|E

The first that O'Keeffe <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> any of <b>this</b> was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year.

Gestapo agent Robert Jodkum forced prisoner Yvan Dreyfus to approach the supposed network, but Dreyfus simply vanished. A later informer successfully infiltrated the operation, and the Gestapo arrested Fourrier, Pintard, and Nézondet. Under torture, they confessed that [...] "Dr. Eugène" [...] was Marcel Petiot. Nézondet was later released, but three others spent eight months in prison, suspected of helping Jews to escape. Even under torture, they did not identify any other members of the Resistance because they knew of none. The Gestapo released the three men in January 1944.|$|R
