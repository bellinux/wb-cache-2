40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{functions of}} the various elementary phases of the overall extraction and treatment process are identified and the limits and advantages of various possible alternative design solutions are discussed. In this way the conditions for modeling the extraction and treatment process are defined, the following phases being analysed: -characterization of the raw material deposits with respect to mineralization variability, -identification of alternative mining methods with respect to production process flexibility and consequent sequence of the "production units" and their characteristics (<b>deplation</b> project), -choice of prehomogenization and homogenization systems and to reduce variability in characteristics of raw material flows, -influence of variability of raw material characteristics treatment process. The study deals particularly with problems concerning the extraction of the economic mineral...|$|E
40|$|The {{interconnection}} {{between the}} {{environmental issues and}} national security {{is one of the}} pressing matters due to the rapid changes that are taking place in both areas. Resource scarcity and environmental degradation are increasingly understood {{to play an important role}} in generating or exacerbating conflicts. One of the most important causes that contribute to this degradation is related to the mismanagement of water resources. This situation has an important impact on all the activities related to the proper functioning of a community. This research aims taking into account the scarcity of the water resources and degradation of its quality as a challenge on the national security. The <b>deplation</b> and degradation of the water resources are a function of the physical vulnerability of the resource, the size of the resource consuming population and the technologies and practices this population uses in this consumption behavior...|$|E

This interpretation declare that: increasing of minority carrier, np, recombination current Irecom in <b>deplation</b> region when sunlight concentration C increase,s {{due to the}} depletion layer widen because the increasing of drift electric field at the junction boundary correspond to population inversion phenomena which happens at the interfaces between the base region and the depletion region. Experiments was performed with operating solar cells under high injection conditions (sunlight concentration simulator) to get I-V characteristics, then we characterize {{the relation between the}} depletion region width w and Irecom, by suggesting a new model which enable us to optimize a solar sell under sunlight concentration. In consequence we cocnlude that: Irecom is responsible of depleting a significant part of minority carrier, consequently, Irecom causes the solar cell efficiency degradation...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{lands of}} this country are its greatest natural resource. History points out that nations with vast areas of good farm land {{are most likely to}} prosper and survive over long periods of time. Local communities, too, prosper and flourish in proportion to the productiveness of the surrounding land. Schools, social life, and business develop best in areas where the land is productive and properly managed and conserved. Nebraska, in common with other states, has suffered by the depletion of soil fertility. The reduction in acres in legumes and grasses, and the <b>deplation</b> of the organic matter in the surface soils, has likewise had its effect on the run-off of precipitation, soil blowing, and damage from drouth. In order to know what elements of fertility may become deficient and how soil fertility may be restored and maintained, we should understand the composition, character, and management of soils. In the following pages, some fundamentals of soil feritlity are given, followed later by a discussion of practical soil-management practices...|$|E

TARGET OF THIS THESIS IS TO ANALYSE IN DEPTH THE PROBLEM OF THE OZONE LAYER <b>DEPLATION</b> ITSELF AN D THE LEGAL RULES WHICH WERE DEVELOPED FORMING AN INTERNATIONAL REGIME IN ORDER TO CONTROL THAT DEPLETION. THIS REGIME CONSISTS OF A FRAME-CONVETION (VIENNA CONVETION- 1985) AND A PROTOCOL WITH RESTRICTIONS (MONTREAL - 1987) WHICH WAS AMENDED THREE TIMES BY N OW (1990, 1992, 1997). THE THESIS IS DIVIDED IN FOUR CHAPTERS : IN THE FIRST ONE THE PHISIS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE PROBLEM IS ANALYSED, IN THE SECOND ONE THE CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW OF THE REGIME IS PRESENTED, IN THE THIRD THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIROMENTAL LAW ARE ANALYSED AND IN THE FORTH THE LEGAL REGIME IS ANALYSED. THE MAIN CONCLUSION OF MY THESIS IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGIME FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE OZONE LAYER IS THE FIRST "PRODUCT" OF THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIROMENTAL LAW BASED ON THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE AND IS DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM IN A SATISFACTORY WAY. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} bursectomy on the {{development}} of Marek's disease (MD) in chickens was studied histopathologically in two separate experiments in which 2 groups of untreated and bursectomized chickens were used. In experiment I, 16 untreated and 25 bursectomized chickens were examined at 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 weeks old, and in experiment II, 55 chickens, including 28 bursectomized ones, were inoculated with Marek's disease virus (MDV) at 2 weeks old. The neonatal bursectomized chickens in experiment I showed the following morphological and functional changes in comparison with the untreated chickens. 1 Histopathologically, there was a severe <b>deplation</b> of lymphocytes in the bursa-dependent areas and aplasia of the germinal centers in the spleen. 2 There was a lack of antibody synthesis against Salmonella pullorum. 3 There was no reduction of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin reaction. In experiment II, the chickens were examined at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 weeks after inoculation with MDV; the following changes were observed. 1 There were no initial cytolytic lesions in the lymphoid tissues of the bursectomized chickens. 2 Both the bursectomized and the untreated chickens showed a high and almost identical frequency of MD tumor development in various organs and tissues. In the lesions of these findings, we concluded that the function of the bursa of Fabricius is not essential for the tumorigenesis of MD...|$|E
40|$|Rat liver {{tryptophan}} pyrrolase haem is maximally depleted at 30 min after {{administration of}} a 400 mg/kg dose of 2 -allyl- 2 -isopropylacetamide. This depletion lasts for 24 h, {{by which time}} 5 -aminoleevulinate synthase activity becomes maximally enhanced. 2. though the above maximum depletion of pyrrolase haem (at 0. 5 h) is also produced by a 100 mg/kg dose of the porphyrogen, this does not enhance synthase activity at 24 h. It and smaller doses, however, cause a smaller but earlier enhancement of synthase activity (maximum at 2 h) and produce a similarly short-lived <b>deplation</b> of pyrrolase haem. 3. The depletion of pyrrolase haem and the enhancement of synthase activity by the porphyrogen are inhibited by compound SKF 525 -A and phenazine methosulphate, and are potentiated by nicotinamide but not by phenobarbitone. Phenazine methosulphate and nicotinamide also exert opposite effects on hexobarbital sleeping-time. 4. 2 -Allyl- 2 -isopropylacetamde also the depletes pyrrolase haem in vitro. It does so in liver homogenates of control rats in the presence, and in those of phenobarbitone-treated rats {{in the absence of}} added NADPH. 5. A discussion of the present results in relation to previous work with other haemoproteins suggests that, whereas cytochrome P- 450 (haem) is primarily involved in the production of the active (porphyrogenic) metabolite(s) of 2 -allyl- 2 -isopropylacetamide, the haem pool used by tryptophan pyrrolase may {{play an important role in}} the effects of this compound on haem biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEco-innovation is {{developing}} new ideas, promoting new operations, products and processes {{to protect the}} environment, so obtaining environmental sustainability. Eco-innovation supports {{the survival of the}} companies as proposing an acceptable image for these companies to stakeholders. The innovation which decreases the environmental damages and hereby develops the sustainability of the firms, including eco-products, eco-processes and eco-organizational factors is called eco-innovation. Eco-innovation is one of the aims of European Union (EU), and establishes a part of the development and economic policies. Technological progress makes the companies benefit from eco-innovation. Besides the environmental benefits; there are also cost related gains for the companies which apply eco-innovation. Organizations take eco-innovative actions because of the governmental pressures, consumers’ pleasures and the great risk of changing climate in all over the world. Climate change, ozone layer <b>deplation,</b> acidification, eutrophication, decreasing biodiversity and land degradation are some of the environmental threats that face the humanity and also the companies’ survival. Hence multiple stakeholders of the societies expect the companies to be sensitive about eco-innovation to protect the environment in order to save the nature and human lives. Eco-innovation {{is one of the leading}} strategies to promote resource and energy efficiency and create a low a carbon society in EU; because this strategy has other advantages like decreasing the costs of material purchasing. So it leads EU to be more competitive in global world. Eco-innovation is simply contributing to the sustainable company survival by challenging the environmental issues in the eyes of multiple stakeholders in the society. In this study we have comparisons between Turkey and EU in the framework of eco-innovative behaviours of the firms...|$|E
