5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the <b>eugenic</b> ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's <b>Eugenic</b> Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eugenics</b> {{offers two}} approaches: {{positive}} <b>eugenics,</b> and negative <b>eugenics.</b> Positive <b>eugenics</b> aims towards creating better humans by careful mating, based on one's genetic makeup.

25|$|If so, {{then we must}} plan our <b>eugenic</b> policy {{along some}} such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, {{allegedly}} less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest {{the removal of the}} last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our <b>eugenic</b> programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.|$|E
25|$|Galton {{invented the}} term {{eugenics}} in 1883 and set down {{many of his}} observations and conclusions in a book, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development. He believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged by provision of monetary incentives. He pointed {{out some of the}} tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were dysgenic. He advocated encouraging <b>eugenic</b> marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address <b>eugenic</b> issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.|$|E

50|$|Liberal <b>eugenics</b> {{is known}} as new <b>eugenics,</b> {{consumer}} <b>eugenics,</b> reprogenetics, or ″designer progeny″. The connotations of liberal <b>eugenics</b> are negative due {{to the history of}} <b>eugenics</b> being associated with dark historical times. According to the Harvard Law Review, the <b>eugenics</b> of the early 20th century were part of a false scientific justification for racism, class-ism, and colonial subjugation falsely concerned with genetic fitness. The new model of <b>eugenics</b> of the 21st century, called liberal <b>eugenics,</b> allegedly advocates for genetic modification including the screening of genes that cause serious disabilities and engineering children to be born with more desirable physical and mental traits. Liberal <b>eugenics</b> is aimed at improving the genotypes of future generations through screening and genetic modification to eliminate undesirable traits.|$|R
40|$|<b>Eugenics</b> - or 'the {{cultivation}} of a race' - {{is a concept}} dating from {{the latter part of}} the 19 th century. It preceded the new science of genetics by merely 25 years. Negative <b>eugenics</b> stressed especially the exclusion of negative characteristics and was associated with the practice and theory of radical <b>eugenics</b> between the two World Wars. In order to redress 'the decline of the race', reinforcement by positive <b>eugenics</b> was also advocated. After the atrocities committed by the Nazis there was a lull in the practice and discourse of <b>eugenics.</b> More recent technical advances in assisted reproduction techniques and the genome project, however, have revived the <b>eugenics</b> debate. State <b>eugenics</b> and <b>eugenics</b> as an individual choice ought to be distinguished. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} {{eugenics}} {{is the study}} of development and advocacy of ideas related to eugenics around the world. Early <b>eugenic</b> ideas were discussed in Ancient Greece and Rome.

25|$|As {{with all}} medical {{interventions}} associated with human reproduction, PGD raises strong, often conflicting opinions of social acceptability, particularly {{due to its}} <b>eugenic</b> implications.

To justify an aggressive campaign against blacks and immigrants, the <b>eugenics</b> movement used the concept of racial degeneration.|$|R
25|$|The {{effect of}} Buck v. Bell was to legitimize <b>eugenic</b> {{sterilization}} {{laws in the}} United States as a whole. While many states already had sterilization laws on their books, their use was erratic and effects practically non-existent in every state except for California. After Buck v. Bell, dozens of states added new sterilization statutes, or updated their constitutionally non-functional ones already enacted, with statutes which more closely mirrored the Virginia statute upheld by the Court.|$|E
25|$|For Andrew Schapper, Wild Seed is {{an entry}} {{point to the}} “ethics of {{controlled}} evolution” that permeate Butler’s novels, most obviously in the Xenogenesis trilogy. As an early novel on the subject, Wild Seed betrays Butler’s anxiety that <b>eugenic</b> manipulation and selective breeding could lead to an unethical abuse of power and thus she counters it with a “Judeo-Christian ethical approach to the sanctity of human life” represented by the character of Anyanwu.|$|E
25|$|The Governor of Puerto Rico, Menendez Ramos, enacted Law 116, {{which went}} into effect on May 13, 1937. It was a birth control and <b>eugenic</b> {{sterilization}} law that allowed the dissemination of information regarding birth control methods as well as legalized the practice of birth control. The government cited a growing population {{of the poor and}} unemployed as motivators for the law. Abortion remained heavily restricted. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.|$|E

25|$|Sterilization rates under <b>eugenic</b> {{laws in the}} United States {{climbed from}} 1927 until Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942). While Skinner v. Oklahoma did not {{specifically}} overturn Buck v. Bell, it created enough of a legal quandary to discourage many sterilizations. By 1963, sterilization laws were almost wholly out of use, though some remained officially on the books for many years. Language referring to eugenics was removed from Virginia's sterilization law, and the current law, passed in 1988 and amended in 2013, only authorizes the sterilization of incompetent patients if a Virginia court finds with clear and convincing evidence the sterilization procedure is medically necessary for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Gerry Canavan {{argues that}} Wild Seed {{challenges}} conventional fantasies of race by having Doro’s eugenics project supersede that of Europe’s by millennia. In this “alternate history,” “America itself--now {{transformed into a}} blip between the secret history of Doro's experiments and the brutal aftermath of their horrible success--becomes retold here as an African story, in an Africanist recentering of history {{that serves as a}} strongly anti-colonialist provocation, even if the results are mostly anti-utopian.” Still, while Doro’s <b>eugenic</b> project turns out a “superpowered blackness” that negates notions of white supremacy, his exploitation of his people as mere genetic experiments echoes the breeding methods of New World slave owners, thus replicating the actual history of racial slavery practiced by the Western world.|$|E
