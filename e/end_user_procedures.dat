40|$|The {{concept of}} {{metrological}} traceability of measurement results to property values assigned to measurement standards of higher metrological order {{or to the}} International System of Units (SI) through sequential calibrations, using reference materials and reference measurement procedures, {{plays a key role}} in ensuring that <b>end</b> <b>user</b> measurement <b>procedures</b> perform at an acceptable level in the clinical context. The aim is that measurement results produced over time or by different <b>end</b> <b>users</b> or with different <b>end</b> <b>user</b> measurement <b>procedures</b> for the same measurand will be equivalent within their corresponding uncertainties. These goals can only be reached under certain conditions and if requirements laid down in international standards on calibration concepts, reference measurement procedures and reference materials are fulfilled. Calibration hierarchies have to be implemented correctly and parameters contributing to measurement uncertainty and systematic bias need to be controlled and eliminated, respectively, by technically improving methods and reference materials and intermediate calibrators used for effectively achieving equivalence of measurement results and for meeting analytical performance requirements for in vitro diagnostic devices.

40|$|Reliability, {{in terms}} of Grid {{component}} fault tolerance and minimum quality of service, is an important aspect {{that has to be}} addressed to foster Grid technology adoption. Software reliability is critically important in today’s integrated and distributed systems, as is often the weak link in system performance. In general, reliability is difficult to measure, and specially in Grid environments, where evaluation methodologies are novel and controversial matters. This paper describes a straightforward procedure to analyze the reliability of computational grids from the viewpoint of an <b>end</b> <b>user.</b> The <b>procedure</b> is illustrated in the evaluation of a research Grid infrastructure based on Globus basic services and the GridWay meta-scheduler. The GridWay support for fault tolerance is also demonstrated in a production-level environment. Results show that GridWay is a reliable workload management tool for dynamic and faulty Grid environments. Transparently to the <b>end</b> <b>user,</b> GridWay is able to detect and recover from any of the Grid element failure, outage and saturation conditions specified by the reliability analysis procedure.

In Canada, the federal government is committed to providing funding support to its provincial governments for healthcare expenditures as long as the province in question abides by accessibility guarantees as set out in the Canada Health Act, which explicitly prohibits billing <b>end</b> <b>users</b> for <b>procedures</b> that are covered by Medicare. While some label Canada's system as [...] "socialized medicine," [...] but health economists don't use that term. Unlike systems with public delivery, such as the UK, the Canadian system provides public coverage for a combination of public and private delivery. Princeton University health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt says that single-payer systems are not [...] "socialized medicine" [...] but [...] "social insurance" [...] systems, because doctors are in the private sector. [...] Similarly, Canadian hospitals are controlled by private boards and/or regional health authorities, rather than being part of government.|$|R
