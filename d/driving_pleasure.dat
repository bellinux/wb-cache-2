50|$|The Dodge Copperhead was {{unveiled}} at the 1997 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Many reviewers {{were impressed with}} its aerodynamic, yet rugged styling with its Copper Fire Orange color {{and the fact that}} its sale price would be about $30,000 USD ($45,000 less than the Viper). The Copperhead, unlike the Viper, was made more for handling and <b>driving</b> <b>pleasure,</b> while the Viper was made more for raw power. The Copperhead had excellent handling due to its low, wide stance. Dodge engineered the Copperhead to make the driver feel the road and the pavement, and this was done by stretching the wheels {{to the end of the}} frame, adding five inches of ground clearance and a stiff suspension, making this car marketed more towards enthusiasts. The Dodge Copperhead was due to be released in 2000, but was canceled.|$|E

5000|$|The band's {{sound is}} {{a hotbed of}} cool {{southern}} traditions crossed with the psych stylings of the Guess Who and the Hammond hard rock of Deep Purple. Many attractions along the way: the band's cover of [...] "You're No Good" [...] is bruisingly power-chorded almost to Sabbatherian levels (in the mean time kicking Van Halen's dopey take outta bed), or at least hard Fireball-era Purple. Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Raven" [...] gets a damp and creaky House Of The Rising Sun-type treatment, all creeped out toward Steppenwolf and Iron Butterfly with harsh electric guitar soloing. [...] "Old Man River" [...] swings right round the other way, reverential, deep-seated although slightly affected. Originals are just as diverse, pioneering and often heavy. Opener [...] "Down The River Boogie" [...] is a proto-southern rocker built on a gentle riff but a riff nonetheless. [...] "Riverboat" [...] and [...] "Price 20 Cents A Copy" [...] are fast James Brown-type showy tunes buoyed by the band's patented harmonies and raucous arrangements. And wiggin' right out is [...] "Toballby", a committed Deep Purple jam complete with an eclectic Paicey-style drum solo. Bit of a roll call there, but the point is, this thing is sequenced for <b>driving</b> <b>pleasure.</b> Potliquor finding fortune at the crossroads between late 60's hard rock, the newly emerging southern sound combining gospel, boogie and the blues, and {{the last vestiges of}} foggy proggy psyche.|$|E

40|$|I {{expand and}} {{integrate}} {{a theory of}} mobility (Automobility) with one {{of science and technology}} (Actor Network Theory) and one about social acceptance and user adoption (UTAUT). I apply this integrative framework to the diffusion (and non-diffusion) of electric vehicles and the process of electric mobility. I begin by presenting my methods, namely semi-structured qualitative research interviews with social theorists. Then, I present the three theories deemed most relevant by respondents. Automobility holds that, on a cultural or social level, automobiles exist as part of a complex, one that involves hardware and infrastructure—a hybridity between drivers and machines—along with patterns of identity and attitudes about <b>driving</b> <b>pleasure.</b> Actor Network Theory (ANT) involves the concepts of network assemblage, translation, enrollment, and actants and lieutenants. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, or UTAUT, states that on an individual level, the adoption of new technologies will be predicated on interconnected factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and other facilitating conditions. Based largely on the original interview data supplemented with peer-reviewed studies, I propose a conceptual framework of user acceptance consisting of motile pleasure, sociality, sociotechnical commensurability, and habitual momentum. I conclude with implications for research and policy...|$|E
