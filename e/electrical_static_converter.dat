40|$|International audienceIn <b>electrical</b> engineering, <b>static</b> <b>converters</b> {{generate}} harmonics; {{consequently the}} {{losses in the}} conductors increase. To use High-Tc superconductors for current transportation, {{it is important to}} evaluate and to measure their losses. Under the assumption that the superconductor is only exposed to its self-field, Bean's model is used to compute these losses. This work deals with the losses in a cylindrical High-Tc superconductor current-lead. It is made of compacted composite of Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O- 2223, the value of its critical current is about 100 A (measured with I /spl mu/V/cm criteria). Two types of measuring methods are used. The first of them uses a differential amplifier associated with a computer, which calculate the instantaneous power by numerical integration. The second series of experiments, valid only with sinusoidal current, are made using a lock-in amplifier measuring the R. M. S. voltage. The value of transport current is high enough to be compatible with applications. Both methods give nearly the same results for sinusoidal signal. Measurements are made with non-sinusoidal current, to do that the superconductor sample is fed by a dimmer switch. The experiments show that the losses are essentially a function of the maximum value of the current, not of the firing angle. We conclude that the shape of the current is not important compared to its peak value...|$|R

40|$|The Norwegian {{traction}} power {{system is a}} 15 kV single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power system. The {{traction power}} system is mainly supplied by rotary frequency converters that convert three-phase 50 Hz power from the utility grid to single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power. In recent times, <b>static</b> frequency <b>converters</b> (power electronic converters) have also been introduced. Parts of the traction power system are quite weak; consisting of long, radial lines with high impedance. Since the 1990 s, the introduction of advanced rail vehicles has revealed a poorly damped eigenmode around 1. 6 Hz in the rotary converters used to supply power to the system. In weak parts of the traction power system, the advanced rail vehicles can excite this eigenmode with their fast control systems, creating low frequency voltage oscillations in the traction power system. This thesis presents the work in investigating whether the <b>static</b> <b>converters</b> in the traction power system {{could be used to}} dampen low frequency oscillations and stabilise the traction power system. A central part of the work is the developing a model of a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> in the PSCAD/EMTDC software, including a control system. For the purpose of recreating the low frequency oscillation problem, a rotary converter is also modelled, modifying synchronous machine models in the PSCAD model library. The traction power system is synchronised with the 50 Hz utility grid, so a control algorithm governing the frequency and phase angle of the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> is implemented in the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> control system, to allow both the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> and rotary converter model to maintain synchronism and operate in parallel. An existing advanced rail vehicle model developed in [4] and implemented in PSCAD in [8] is also added, forming a small model of a traction power system. The model of a <b>static</b> <b>converter,</b> rotary converter and advanced rail vehicle are combined to form a test-bench to study the how the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> control system can be used to mitigate the low frequency oscillation problem. A Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller is implemented in the <b>static</b> <b>converter's</b> control system and tested. The <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> is found to provide extra stability to the traction power system when interconnected with a rotary converter, compared to situations were only rotary converters are present in the system, or worse, when a rotary converter operates in stand-alone mode. Implementation of a POD controller was also found to be effective in adding additional damping to the low frequency oscillations, but also revealed potential negative interaction issues with advanced rail vehicles. </p...|$|R

The <b>static</b> phase <b>converter</b> is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> will void any warranty.) An oversized <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.|$|R

5000|$|Jericho Park, MD - 20 MW <b>Static</b> <b>Converter.</b> Jericho Park was {{constructed}} {{to replace the}} capacity lost when BG&E declined to renew the Benning rotary converter contract. BG&E proposed a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> to replace Benning and Jericho Park came on service six years later. It consists of two 10 MW cycloconverter modules supplied by GE. Jericho Park was the first solid-state power supply introduced on the Amtrak network. It suffered from some filtering network problems caused by the highly distorted voltage present on the catenary and was ultimately downgraded from its original design capacity of 25 MW to 22 MVA. Amtrak has requested funding to rehabilitate portions of the converter in an ARRA request. During the twelve-month period that ended in August 2009, the Jericho Park converter used about 70 GWh of energy.
