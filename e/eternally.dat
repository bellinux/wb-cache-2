5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{school and}} Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya believed that some souls are <b>eternally</b> doomed and damned.|$|E
5|$|Rothbard {{accepted}} the Labor theory of property, but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing {{that if an}} individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner <b>eternally,</b> and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift.|$|E
5|$|As the Word, Jesus was <b>eternally</b> {{present with}} God, active in all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Montag re-entered the Celebrity Big Brother {{with her}} husband. On day 18 {{the couple were}} <b>eternally</b> {{nominated}} by James Cosmo, which {{they did not have}} a good reaction to. They were saved in an 8-person eviction on day 22 however, they were evicted on day 25 against Kim Woodburn, Jessica Cunningham, Bianca Gascoigne and Jedward. Montag and Pratt were reunited with their rival, Rylan Clark-Neal, on Big Brother's Bit on the Side that night.|$|E
5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} motions of the heavenly bodies, were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres <b>eternally</b> rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.|$|E
5|$|The Agni Purana {{mentions}} only 4 hells. Some texts mention 7 hells: Put ("childless", for the childless), Avichi ("waveless", {{for those}} waiting for reincarnation), Samhata ("abandoned", for evil beings), Tamisra ("darkness", where darkness of hells begin), Rijisha ("expelled", where torments of hell begin), Kudmala ("leprous", the worst hell {{for those who}} are going to be reincarnated) and Kakola ("black poison", the bottomless pit, {{for those who are}} <b>eternally</b> condemned to hell and have no chance of reincarnation).|$|E
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is {{described}} as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay <b>eternally</b> with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on his lap. To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered <b>eternally.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is said to}} have preached Jainism far and wide. At his death, he {{attained}} Nirvana kalyanaka (also called Moksha), {{all four}} of his ghati karma were destroyed, his soul was liberated from the endless cycle of rebirths, to stay <b>eternally</b> at siddhaloka. His death is believed in Jainism to have occurred on Ashtapada (also known as Mount Kailash) on the fourteenth day of Magha Krishna (Hindu Calendar) at the age of 84 lakh purva years, with three years and eight and a half months remaining of the third ara.|$|E
5|$|The Nandi in Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur is seen placed {{off centre}} as a {{testimony}} of Nandanar's devotion and the miracle. A stone {{image of the}} saint is worshipped in the temple. The Dvarapalas (gate-keeper sculptures) are depicted with his heads leaning downwards, {{said to be in}} honour of Nandanar. In 1959, a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple, from where the stone image of Nandanar looks <b>eternally</b> at Shiva. Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined above his head, praying to Shiva. Scenes of Bharati's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to <b>eternally</b> fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover <b>eternally</b> pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|Puritans {{believed}} that God is sovereign {{over all of}} history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of predestination, or choice to save some people, to the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were <b>eternally</b> chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving {{those who had been}} chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.|$|E
5|$|This New Life is endless, {{and even}} after my {{physical}} death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of complete renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those who rely wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely {{for the sake of}} loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual or material reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself <b>eternally,</b> even if there is no one to live it.|$|E

25|$|The Ekavyāvahārika sect {{emphasized}} the transcendence of the Buddha, asserting {{that he was}} <b>eternally</b> enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, {{the words of the}} Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight. According to the Mahīśāsaka sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.|$|E

Furthermore, unlike in Hell, when all his physical wounds healed almost instantly, Tobei's body is mortal on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Other Christians {{understand}} the soul as the life, {{and believe that}} the dead are sleeping (Christian conditionalism).

25|$|Additional {{names of}} Rama include Ramavijaya (Javanese), Phreah Ream (Khmer), Phra Ram (Lao and Thai), Megat Seri Rama (Malay), Raja Bantugan (Maranao), Ramudu (Telugu), Ramar (Tamil).

Goldwyn finally gave Niven a lead part, the title role as the eponymous gentleman safe-cracker in Raffles (1939).|$|E
25|$|Some Christian traditions {{reject the}} {{doctrine}} of the Trinity, and are called nontrinitarian.

Some broad definitions of Protestantism include these groups within Protestantism, but most definitions do not.|$|E
