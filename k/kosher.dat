5|$|<b>Kosher</b> salt, though refined, {{contains}} no iodine {{and has a}} much larger grain size than most refined salts. This can give it different properties when used in cooking, and can be useful for preparing <b>kosher</b> meat. Some <b>kosher</b> salt has been certified to meet <b>kosher</b> requirements by a hechsher, {{but this is not}} true for all products labelled as <b>kosher</b> salt.|$|E
5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making <b>kosher</b> cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to <b>kosher</b> gelatin, an animal product, derived from <b>kosher</b> animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all <b>kosher</b> fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions {{prohibit the}} use of the phrase <b>kosher</b> in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of <b>kosher</b> are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting {{the use of}} the term <b>kosher</b> have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep <b>kosher</b> at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of <b>Kosher</b> consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views <b>kosher</b> certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} century, there have {{developed}} numerous rabbinical organizations that certify products, manufacturers, and restaurants as <b>kosher,</b> usually using a symbol (called a hechsher) {{to indicate their}} support. Currently, about a sixth of American Jews or 0.3% of the American population fully keep <b>kosher,</b> and many more abstain from some non-kosher foods, especially pork.|$|E
5|$|The word <b>kosher</b> is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, <b>kosher</b> salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a <b>kosher</b> dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 {{survey found}} that 22% of American Jews {{surveyed}} claimed to keep <b>kosher</b> in the home.|$|E
5|$|Blood (dam): {{blood of}} <b>kosher</b> mammals and fowl is removed through salting, with special {{procedures}} for the liver, which is very rich in blood.|$|E
5|$|Carrion (nevelah): {{meat from}} a <b>kosher</b> animal {{that has not}} been {{slaughtered}} according to the laws of shechita. This prohibition includes animals that have been slaughtered by non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, for instance, {{the members}} of Congregation B'nai Israel in Memphis, Tennessee advertised for their first rabbi in The Israelite, {{at the same time}} they advertised for a <b>kosher</b> butcher.|$|E
5|$|In {{many cases}} {{constant}} supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were <b>kosher</b> may {{cease to be}} so. For example, a <b>kosher</b> lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become <b>kosher</b> but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the bread <b>kosher</b> (Angel Bakeries carries the hechsher of both the Edah HaChareidis and the Orthodox Union), Angel's son Ovadia, a trained chemist, collaborated with others at the Angel's-owned Adumim Chemicals plant {{to develop a new}} formula for the emulsifiers that bind water and oil in the bread-making process. In those early days, emulsifiers were made with animal-based fats which were not <b>kosher.</b> Ovadia Angel and his team produced emulsifiers from hydrogenated fats, a vegetable-based source, and later sold this new knowledge to other companies.|$|E
5|$|Utensils {{used for}} non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even {{otherwise}} <b>kosher</b> food prepared with them non-kosher. Some such utensils, {{depending on the}} material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing <b>kosher</b> food again by immersion in boiling water or by {{the application of a}} blowtorch. Food prepared in a manner that violates the Shabbat (Sabbath) may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and {{scholars}} in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered <b>kosher</b> or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the AquAdvantage salmon, and while salmon is normally an acceptably <b>kosher</b> food, this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism.|$|E
5|$|Gardein (a {{portmanteau}} {{of garden}} and protein) {{is a product}} line of meat-free foods made by Garden Protein International in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. In November 2014, Pinnacle Foods purchased Gardein for $154 million. Founder Yves Potvin stayed on with the company, and has stated that the buy-out assisted Gardein to access more capital and expand manufacturing facilities to Hagerstown. All Gardein products are vegan, and they are certified by Vegan Action. Most of Gardein's products are certified <b>Kosher</b> pareve by <b>Kosher</b> Check (The Orthodox Rabbinical Council of BC). In 2014, they added gluten-free beefless products to their range {{in response to the}} expanding gluten allergy market.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the {{congregation}} became divided over {{the need for}} the Jewish community to hire a shochet to ritually slaughter animals for <b>kosher</b> meat, and over whether the synagogue should hire a Reform or Conservative rabbi. More traditional members broke away to form the Beth El Congregation, affiliated with Conservative Judaism.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, <b>kosher</b> wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are <b>kosher</b> and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Products labeled kosher-style are non-kosher {{products}} that have characteristics of <b>kosher</b> foods, such as all-beef hot dogs, or are flavored or prepared {{in a manner}} consistent with Ashkenazi practices, like dill pickles. The designation usually refers to delicatessen items.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are used as food; however, all types are edible. The {{powerful}} breast muscles characteristic of the family make excellent meat. Domesticated or hunted pigeons {{have been used as}} the source of food since the times of the Ancient Middle East, Ancient Rome, and Medieval Europe. It is familiar meat within Jewish, Arab, Assamese and French cuisines. According to the Tanakh, doves are <b>kosher,</b> and they are the only birds that may be used for a korban. Other <b>kosher</b> birds may be eaten, but not brought as a korban. It is also known in Asian cuisines, such as Chinese and Indonesian.|$|E
5|$|The menu at the White House Passover Seder {{featured}} traditional American Jewish Passover cuisine such as gefilte fish, charoset, {{chicken soup}} with matzah balls, brisket, potato kugel, and macaroons. Salads and vegetable side dishes completed the menu. Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad-Lubavitch center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, these recipes included matzo ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot soufflé from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly <b>kosher,</b> but <b>kosher</b> style. In 2014, the White House Passover Seder began inviting a guest chef to coordinate the menu with the White House executive chef.|$|E
5|$|Although not all Jews in Israel keep <b>kosher,</b> the {{tradition}} of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes, public institutions and many restaurants, including the separation of milk and meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods, especially pork and shellfish. During Passover, bread and other leavened foods are prohibited to observant Jews and matza and leaven-free foods are substituted.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{numerous}} laws that {{form part of}} kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of certain animals (such as pork, shellfish (both Mollusca and Crustacea)) and most insects, {{with the exception of}} certain species of <b>kosher</b> locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to slaughter mammals and birds according to a process known as shechita. There are also laws regarding agricultural produce that might impact the suitability of food for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Hindu scriptures, {{dated to}} between 5th century and 1st century BC, while {{discussing}} human diet, initially suggest <b>kosher</b> meat may be eaten, evolving {{it with the}} suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.|$|E
5|$|Producers {{of foods}} and food {{additives}} can contact Jewish religious authorities {{to have their}} products certified as kosher: this involves {{a visit to the}} manufacturing facilities by an individual rabbi or a committee from a rabbinic organization, who will inspect the production methods and contents, and if everything is sufficiently <b>kosher</b> a certificate would be issued.|$|E
5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene {{accounts}} for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is <b>kosher.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op and kitchen. In 1995, the <b>Kosher</b> Co-Op moved out of Lathrop and into a newly acquired Jewish house {{across the street from the}} college.|$|E
5|$|Jerome David Salinger {{was born}} in New York City, on New Year's Day, 1919. His father, Sol Salinger, sold <b>kosher</b> cheese, and was from a Jewish family of Lithuanian descent, his father having been the rabbi for the Adath Jeshurun {{congregation}} in Louisville, Kentucky. Salinger's mother, Marie (née Jillich), {{was born in}} Atlantic, Iowa, of Scottish, German, and Irish descent, but changed her name to Miriam and considered herself Jewish after marrying Salinger's father. Salinger did not learn {{that his mother was}} not of Jewish ancestry until just after he celebrated his bar mitzvah. His only sibling was his older sister Doris (1911–2001).|$|E
5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or almond milk (for a <b>kosher</b> version) and cornstarch. It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E
5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being <b>kosher.</b> The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps {{have been taken}} to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael. Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E
5|$|The first KFC in the Middle East {{opened in}} 1973 in Kuwait. Today {{there are over}} 700 outlets, {{certified}} halal, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. KFC Israel existed from 1993 to 2013 and featured <b>kosher</b> restaurants. In 2012 KFC opened in Ramallah in the Palestinian Authority and later expanded to Hebron, Bethlehem, Jenin, and three separate outlets in Ramallah: the Ersal Branch (Bacri), Plaza Mall Branch and Masyoun Branch. In 2013 the New York Times reported that KFC was being smuggled into Gaza through tunnels.|$|E
5|$|B'nai Israel hired Peres in December 1858 as cantor and teacher, in English and German, at {{an annual}} salary of $600 (today $) with {{perquisites}} of $400. By comparison, the <b>kosher</b> butcher's salary was $300, not including what he earned killing poultry. Peres also ran the Hebrew school and the choir, and was in effect the rabbi. Under his leadership, the membership took a serious interest in the plight of Jews around the world. For example, at a congregational meeting in , they gathered money from the members present and B'nai Israel's treasury to assist suffering Moroccan Jews, and created a committee to raise funds throughout Memphis on their behalf. The congregation also moved more towards Orthodoxy, and passed a rule stating that only those members who were Sabbath observant could receive Torah honors on the High Holy Days.|$|E
5|$|B'nai Israel was {{the only}} Jewish {{congregation}} in Memphis, and from {{the time it was}} established members were split between traditionalists and reformers. When remodeling their new building, the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional separate seating for men and women. By 1858, with enough funds to hire a full-time spiritual leader, they consulted Rabbi Isaac Leeser, the leader of America's Orthodox Jewish community, but were also in contact with Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, the leader of America's fledgling Reform movement, who had dedicated B'nai Israel's sanctuary earlier that year. The members had advertised for their first spiritual leader in Wise's newspaper, The Israelite (along with other English-language Jewish newspapers) {{at the same time they}} advertised for a <b>kosher</b> butcher. Leeser recommended Jacob J. Peres, an Orthodox rabbi.|$|E
5|$|Zion Cinema was {{the central}} {{landmark}} of Zion Square from the 1920s until its closure in 1972. Located {{on the south side}} of Zion Square, it was originally a 400-seat silent-movie hut and, after snowfall destroyed the structure, was rebuilt into a 600-seat theatre that staged plays, concerts, lectures, and films. In the 1920s and 1930s the Zion Cinema was the cultural center of Jerusalem. After its closure, the building was demolished and a high-rise containing the Kikar Zion Hotel and a branch of Bank HaPoalim was erected in its place. In 2013 the 117-room hotel was purchased by Orchid Hotel Management Ltd., which is renovating the property for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. The hotel will have 137 rooms and suites, and a <b>kosher</b> rooftop restaurant with a 360-degree panoramic view.|$|E
25|$|On November 19, 2008, Sara Lee Corporation {{announced}} that it would close its <b>kosher</b> hot dog and meat processing facility in Chicago, on or before January 30, 2009. Sara Lee decided to exit the <b>kosher</b> meat business and discontinue processing and distributing products made under all of its <b>kosher</b> meat brands, including: Best's <b>Kosher,</b> Sinai <b>Kosher,</b> Shofar and Wilno.|$|E
25|$|According to Ludwig Horlein of the Hartmannsdorf Brewery in Germany, {{with respect}} to {{ingredients}} {{there is no difference}} between <b>kosher</b> and non-kosher beer. In general, observant Jews will only drink unflavored beers without a <b>kosher</b> certification (compared to flavored beers, which do require a <b>kosher</b> certification). But according to Israeli beer expert Gad Deviri, <b>kosher</b> certification is not a consideration for many observant Jews in Israel. However, while unflavored beers with no additives are acceptable even without <b>Kosher</b> certification, some beers may contain additives that are not <b>kosher.</b> It is also generally accepted that, as a beverage made with grains such as barley, beer is considered chametz and never <b>kosher</b> for Passover.|$|E
25|$|Agriprocessor's {{problems}} led to {{a shortage}} of <b>kosher</b> meat and higher prices nationwide. Empire <b>Kosher,</b> the largest US producer of <b>kosher</b> poultry, doubled its production capacity in response.|$|E
