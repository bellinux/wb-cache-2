40|$|Catalytic {{promiscuity}} {{can facilitate}} evolution of enzyme functions-a multifunctional catalyst may {{act as a}} springboard for efficient functional adaptation. We test the effect of single mutations on multiple activities in two groups of promiscuous AP superfamily members to probe this hypothesis. We quantify the effect of site-saturating mutagenesis of an analogous, nucleophile-flanking residue in two superfamily members: an arylsulfatase (AS) and a phosphonate monoester hydrolase (PMH). Statistical analysis suggests that no one physicochemical characteristic alone explains the mutational effects. Instead, these effects appear {{to be dominated by}} their structural context. Likewise, the effect of changing the catalytic nucleophile itself is not reaction-type-specific. Mapping of "fitness landscapes" of four activities onto the possible variation of a chosen sequence position revealed tremendous potential for respecialization of AP superfamily members through single-point mutations, highlighting catalytic promiscuity as a powerful predictor of adaptive potential.

40|$|Estimating the {{difficulty}} of a decision is a fundamental process to elaborate complex and adaptive behaviour. In this paper, we show that the movement time of behaving monkeys performing a decision-making task is correlated with decision difficulty and that the activity of a population of neurons in ventral Premotor cortex correlates with the movement time. Moreover, we found another population of neurons that encodes the discriminability of the stimulus, thereby supplying another {{source of information about}} {{the difficulty}} of the decision. The activity of neurons encoding the difficulty can be produced by very different computations. Therefore, we show that decision difficulty can be encoded through three different mechanisms: 1. Switch time coding, 2. rate coding and 3. binary coding. This rich representation reflects the basis of different functional aspects of difficulty in the making of a decision and the possible role of difficulty estimation in complex decision scenarios.

The antibiotic pipeline is running dry and infectious disease remains {{a major threat to}} public health. An efficient strategy to stay ahead of rapidly adapting pathogens should include approaches that replace, complement or enhance the effect of both current and novel antimicrobial compounds. In recent years, a number of innovative approaches to manage disease without the aid of traditional antibiotics and without eliminating the pathogens directly have emerged. These include disabling pathogen virulence-factors, increasing host tissue damage control or altering the microbiota to provide colonization resistance, immune resistance or disease tolerance against pathogens. We discuss the therapeutic potential of these approaches and examine their possible consequences for pathogen evolution. To guarantee a longer half-life of these alternatives to directly killing pathogens, and to gain a full understanding of their population-level consequences, we encourage future work to incorporate evolutionary perspectives into the development of these treatments.

40|$|Pseudomonas putida is {{well known}} for its {{metabolic}} capabilities, but recently, it has been shown to exhibit resistance {{to a wide range of}} antibiotics. In P. putida DOT-T 1 E, the TtgABC efflux pump, which has a broad substrate specificity, extrudes antibiotics such as ampicillin, carbenicillin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and chloramphenicol. We have analyzed the expression of the ttgABC efflux pump operon and its regulatory gene, ttgR, in response to several structurally unrelated antibiotics at the transcriptional level and investigated the role of the TtgR protein in this process. ttgABC and ttgR are expressed in vivo at a moderate basal level, which increases in the presence of hydrophobic antibiotics like chloramphenicol and tetracycline. In vitro experiments show that, in the absence of inducers, TtgR binds to a palindromic operator site which overlaps both ttgABC and ttgR promoters and dissociates from it in the presence of chloramphenicol and tetracycline. These results suggest that the TtgR repressor is able to bind to structurally different antibiotics, which allows induction of TtgABC multidrug efflux pump expression in response to these antimicrobial agents. This is the first case in which the expression of a drug transporter of the resistance-nodulation-division family has been shown to be regulated directly by antibiotics.

40|$|Pseudomonas putida DOT-T 1 E, {{known for}} its high {{tolerance}} to solvents, possesses three Resistance– Nodulation–Cell Division-type (RND) efflux pumps, namely TtgABC, TtgDEF and TtgGHI, which {{are involved in the}} active extrusion of solvents. Expression of the ttgABC and ttgGHI operons was previously shown to be regulated by the adjacently encoded repressors, TtgR and TtgV, respectively. Upstream of the third RND operon, ttgDEF, is located a putative regulator gene, ttgT. In this study, TtgT is shown to bind to the promoter region of the ttgDEF operon, and to be released from DNA in the presence of organic solvents. In vitro studies revealed that TtgV and TtgT bind the same operator sites in both the ttgDEF and the ttgGHI promoters. However, the affinity of TtgV for the ttgDEF operator was higher than that of TtgT, which, together {{with the fact that the}} ttgV promoter seems to be almost twice stronger than the ttgT promoter, explains why TtgV takes over in the regulation of the two efflux pump operons. The functional replacement of the cognate, chromosomally encoded TtgT by the plasmid-encoded paralogue TtgV illustrates a new mode of efflux pump regulation of which the physiological relevance is discussed.

After qualifying in medicine from King's College, London, Sir James spent one year studying physiology at Oxford University, and in 1948 went to the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, as a D Phil student {{under the supervision of}} Florey, who was professor of pathology. In the interview Sir James discusses the project set by Florey: to what extent is an inflammatory response necessary for an in vivo cure of infectious disease when antibiotics are given. The interview moves on to completion of D Phil studies after a period of illness, a year spent at the Pasteur Institute, Paris - where he developed an interest in infection and immunity - and his return in 1953 to the Dunn School to begin work on lymphocytes, a project suggested by Florey. Sir James then discusses how this work, which solved the problem of lymphocyte turnover in the blood, led to research studies in immunology, demonstrating the role of small lymphocytes. He acknowledges the support of Peter Medawar, who had worked at the Dunn School and maintained a close association with Florey, and he also speaks of Jean Medawar, who had published a paper on lymphocytes from the department in 1940. Sir James then talks about Florey's successful term as president of the Royal Society, and in the final part of the interview he pays a personal tribute, acknowledging the important part Florey played in the development of his scientific career...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. Published online October 21, 2016. Signalling nanodomains requiring close contact between the plasma membrane and internal compartments, known as 'junctions', are fast communication hubs within excitable cells such as neurones and muscle. Here we have examined two transgenic murine models probing the role of junctophilin- 2, a membrane tethering protein crucial for the formation and molecular organisation of sub-microscopic junctions in ventricular muscle cells of the heart. Quantitative single molecule localisation microscopy showed that junctions in animals producing above-normal levels of junctophilin- 2 were enlarged, allowing the re-organisation of the primary functional protein within it, the ryanodine receptor (RyR). Although this change was associated with much enlarged RyR clusters that due to their size should be more excitable, functionally it caused a mild inhibition in the calcium signalling output of the junctions (calcium sparks). Analysis of the single molecule densities of both RyR and junctophilin- 2 revealed an ∼ 3 -fold increase in the junctophilin- 2 to RyR ratio. This molecular rearrangement is compatible with direct inhibition of RyR opening by junctophilin- 2 to intrinsically stabilise the calcium signalling properties of the junction and thus the contractile function of the cell.

40|$|Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) {{has emerged}} as a new {{regulatory}} molecule in the brain. Recently, some studies have shown a role for this molecule and its LPA 1 receptor in the regulation of plasticity and neurogenesis in the adult brain. However, no systematic studies have been conducted to investigate whether the LPA 1 receptor is involved in behavior. In this study, we studied the phenotype of maLPA 1 -null mice, which bear a targeted deletion at the lpa 1 locus, in a battery of tests examining neurologic performance, habituation in exploratory behavior in response to low and mild anxiety environments and spatial memory. MaLPA 1 -null mutants showed deficits in both olfaction and somesthesis, but not in retinal or auditory functions. Sensorimotor co-ordination was impaired only in the equilibrium and grasping reflexes. The mice also showed impairments in neuromuscular strength and analgesic response. No additional differences were observed {{in the rest of the}} tests used to study sensoriomotor orientation, limb reflexes and co-ordinated limb use. At behavioral level, maLPA 1 -null mice showed an impaired exploration in the open field and increased anxiety-like response when exposed to the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, the mice exhibit impaired spatial memory retention and reduced use of spatial strategies in the Morris water maze. We propose that the LPA 1 receptor may play a major role in both spatial memory and response to anxiety-like conditions. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.

40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential {{channel of}} the ankyrin-binding repeat subfamily, TRPA 1, is a Ca 2 +-permeable non-selective cation channel that depolarizes the plasma membrane and causes Ca 2 + influx. A typical feature of TRPA 1 is its rapid desensitization following activation by agonists such as mustard oil (MO), cinnamaldehyde, {{and a high}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. In whole-cell recordings on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing TRPA 1, desensitization was delayed when phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -biphosphate (PIP 2) was supplemented via the patch pipette, whereas the PIP 2 scavenger neomycin accelerated desensitization. Preincubation with the PI- 4 kinase inhibitor wortmannin reduced both constitutive TRPA 1 channels activity and the response to MO. Run down was also accelerated by high intracellular Mg 2 + concentrations, whereas chelating intracellular Mg 2 + with 10 mM ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (EDTA) increased the basal channel activity. In inside-out patches, we observed a rapid run down of TRPA 1 activity, which could be prevented by application of diC 8 -PIP 2 or 2 mM Mg-ATP but not Na 2 -ATP to the cytosolic side of the excised patches. In isolated trigeminal ganglion neurons, preincubation with wortmannin resulted in inhibition of endogenous TRPA 1 activation by MO. Taken together, our data indicate that PIP 2 modulates TRPA 1, albeit {{to a lesser extent}} than other known PIP 2 -dependent TRP channels, and that tools modifying the plasma membrane PIP 2 content often have direct effects on this channel. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.
