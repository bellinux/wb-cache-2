5|$|The moors {{had been}} used as a source for {{domestic}} fuel, in the form of peat, since at least the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and probably as early as the Roman or pre-Roman periods.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce the {{complexity}} of the mesh mode and accelerate <b>the</b> processing <b>in</b> real-time virtual reality environment, an algorithm is put forward to implementing the triangle splitting based on the feature values of elevation texture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>The</b> triangle mesh model is redefined including vertex, the topological structure and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> texture map information. The algorithm provides a method to subdivide <b>surfaces</b> based on <b>the</b> feature values of elevation texture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> and <b>the</b> binary-tree of triangle. The results show that the data structure of binary-tree is designed for the triangle mesh subdivision, and multi-resolution mesh structure is achieved. Experiments indicate that the algorithm can solve difficult technical problems such as large-scale modeling and real-time drawing of geometric objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> virtual city...|$|R

At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity. A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.|$|E
5|$|The red poppies that McCrae {{referred}} to had {{been associated with}} conflict since the Napoleonic Wars when a writer of that time first noted how the poppies grew over the graves of soldiers.

5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E

5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Further delay meant play {{began after}} the tea break, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} excess moisture, which also caused there to be little bounce <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> With Australia not looking to chase the runs because the time {{available}} was not reasonable, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp, who completed the catch. Johnson fell for six to leave Australia at 10/1.|$|E

The basic idea is to use real-time computer vision techniques to dynamically extract per-pixel depth and reflectance information for <b>the</b> visible <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office including walls, furniture, objects, and people, and then to either project images on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces,</b> render images of <b>the</b> <b>surfaces,</b> or interpret changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first case, one could designate every-day (potentially irregular) real <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office to be used as spatially immersive display surfaces, and then project high-resolution graphics and text onto those <b>surfaces.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second case, one could transmit the dynamic image-based models over a network for display at a remote site.

5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde {{was once}} a planet in the making before being {{involved}} in a collision with another object making it the asteroid that it is today. Speculations do range as {{it may have been}} the solar system's true 9th planet (other than Pluto), previously being an equal rival that of Ceres. This asteroid was visited by the NEARShoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that had gouged out depressions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> It was the first carbonaceous asteroid to be explored and, until 21Lutetia was visited in 2010, was the largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E
