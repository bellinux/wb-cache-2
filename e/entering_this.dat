5|$|The Seneca {{tribe of}} the Iroquois hunted {{in much of}} Pennsylvania and the Quehanna area. The Iroquois and other tribes used the Great Shamokin Path, the major native east–west path {{connecting}} the Susquehanna and Allegheny River basins, which passed south {{of what is now}} the wild area. The native village of Chinklacamoose (or Chingleclamouche) was on this path at the West Branch Susquehanna River, at what is now Clearfield to the southwest of Quehanna. The Sinnemahoning Path along Sinnemahoning Creek ran north of Quehanna; as the path with the gentlest grade, {{it may have been the}} route the first Paleo-Indians took <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> part of Pennsylvania from the west.|$|E
5|$|Mahanoy Creek's {{source is}} in strip mines {{in the eastern}} part of Schuylkill County, near Buck Mountain. It heads west for a short {{distance}} before crossing under Pennsylvania Route 54 and entering Mahanoy City, where it picks up the tributary North Mahanoy Creek. Mahanoy Creek continues westward, heading into Mahanoy Township again, and goes through more strip mines. It begins paralleling Bear Ridge for several miles, passing the communities of St. Nicholas and Boston Run before entering Gilberton. In Gilberton, the creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 924 and goes through by the former Mahanoy Plane. Upon leaving Mahanoy Township, the creek enters Butler Township. Soon after <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> township, the creek passes through Girardville, picking up Shenandoah Creek. It parallels Pennsylvania Route 54 for some distance into Ashland. Upon leaving Ashland, the creek stops paralleling Pennsylvania Route 54 and turns south through a gap in Ashland Mountain, leaving behind the strip mines. At Gordon, it picks up Little Mahanoy Creek and then turns west again, meandering out of Butler Township. The creek then briefly meanders through Barry Township before passing into Eldred Township. It flows on the northern side of a mountain in Weiser State Forest. Upon leaving Eldred Township, the creek enters Northumberland County.|$|E

25|$|East Gopuram is {{the oldest}} of the three gopurams on the modern day structure. As the name implies it opens facing the rising sun across the sea in the East. It rises to the height of 54 feet from the base. This gopuram {{originally}} had the fewest number of sculptures. During the renovation period, a number of new sculptures seem to have been added and painted in brighter colours to match the newly constructed Raja Raja Gopuram. Upon <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> gopuram, one directly faces the Moolamurtis (consecrated deities).|$|E

25|$|Asar Mahal or palace was {{constructed}} in 1646 by the Adil Shahis. It is located {{to the east of}} the citadel. A bridge connects it and it is well preserved. It also known as Dad Mahal since it was initially used as hall of justice. It was later converted as reliquary and has become a highly revered place since it is said to hold two hairs from the beard of Prophet Mohammed. The portico has impressive wooden columns (four numbers of octagonal shape) and is double the normal height and has wooden panelled ceiling. It faces an artificial lake. The walls and ceiling of the hall display landscape paintings. Women are prohibited from <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> Mahal.|$|E
25|$|On <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> {{small and}} unassuming building, the {{unexpected}} {{glory of the}} interior for the visitor is the scissor-truss roof, which {{after more than a}} century retains rare stencil paintings by Powell Bros of Leeds on the chancel beams. Beneath the paint on the plastered north and south walls of the nave are hidden stencil paintings and possibly spirit frescoes by the same artists, revealed in a pre–1914 photograph in the church archives. Although this building is too simple to permit a gallery of columns and bays, Barber has still managed to include a few small columns by recessing the three-light nave windows into the wall, and fitting a single slender supporting column into each recess.|$|E

25|$|An {{external}} {{electromagnetic field}} at a frequency {{associated with a}} transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron's <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of spontaneous emission. A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this {{is the process of}} stimulated emission.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{growing up}} on his family's farm in Pongakawa (near Te Puke), Hulme learned to drive a truck while sitting on his father's lap, and {{by the age of}} six, he was driving solo. He left school and went to work in a garage. He saved up enough money to buy an MG TF, {{promptly}} <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> in hillclimbing events. After that his father brought a MGA for him. After making impressive progress he purchased a F2 Cooper-Climax, subsequently being chosen for the New Zealand Driver to Europe program, along with fellow Kiwi, George Lawton. The pair of young New Zealander began competing in Formula Junior and Formula Two across Europe, in a Cooper-BMC and Cooper–Ford respectively. Hulme won the 1960 Gran Premio di Pescara for Formula Juniors, but the newspapers back in New Zealand made no mention of this, as they wrote only about Bruce McLaren. However, the year, 1960 ended in disaster, when Lawton crashed during a race at Roskilde (Denmark) dying in Hulme's arms.|$|E
25|$|Although for the reactor's backup {{systems were}} available, the power loss proved {{that that was}} not the case for the spent fuel pools. No {{measures}} had been taken to prevent small animals <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> important equipment located at the back of a truck in open air. On 21 March, TEPCO apologized for the delay in reporting the power loss, and for not contacting the media, and promised to improve on this. The NRA decided, that it would speed up the installment of back-up power supply systems, and more durable and reliable systems. A meeting of experts was announced for 29 March 2013 to discuss the TEPCO report on the subject. Serious criticism came from the Japanese government; TEPCO was instructed to install multiple power supplies, and to do more to restore public confidence in the safety of the plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.|$|E

500|$|The Manila Light Rail Transit System {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{expensive}} rapid transit systems in Southeast Asia, costing significantly less to ride than other systems in the region. [...] Fares are distance-based, ranging from 15 to 30 Philippine pesos (₱), or about 29 to 47 U.S. cents (at US$1=₱42 as of September 2011), depending on the number of stations traveled to reach the destination. [...] Unlike other transportation systems, in which transfer to another line occurs within a station's paid area, passengers have to exit and then pay a new fare for the line they are <b>entering.</b> <b>This</b> is also the case on the Yellow Line when changing boarding platforms to catch trains going in the opposite direction.|$|E
500|$|In 1644, just a {{few months}} after the Qing seized the city of Beijing from the peasant rebels who had pushed the last emperor of the Ming dynasty to suicide, the Manchus {{constructed}} a new tangse in the city, modeled on the tangse of the former Qing capital Mukden. This [...] "Manchu shamanist sanctuary," [...] an octagonal building whose shape was specific to the Aisin Gioro clan, was located outside the Imperial City to the southeast, but still within the Inner City occupied by Bannermen, making it convenient for imperial visits. There, the emperor made offerings to Heaven and various other deities, including the horse spirit and the Manchu progenitor.

He questioned whether {{there could be a}} [...] "deficiency disease of the emotional life, comparable to a deficiency of vital nutritional elements within the developing organism".

500|$|After {{her visit}} to the queen, Trimmer was {{inspired}} to write The Œconomy of Charity, which describes how readers, specifically women, can establish Sunday schools in their own communities. However, her book accomplished much more than this. While proponents of Sunday schools such as Raikes and Trimmer claimed that the schools would help control the growing social unrest of the poor, critics claimed that these schools would only encourage the social upheaval {{they were trying to}} quell. The Hon. John Byng, for example, issued the dire warning that [...] "not only would education 'teach them to read seditious pamphlets, books and publications against Christianity'… but it would render them unfit for 'the laborious employment to which their rank in society had destined them'". Trimmer agreed that the poor were [...] "destined" [...] by God to be poor but would argue that her schools reinforced that divine social hierarchy. The Sunday school debate was waged in churches, in Parliament and in print; in publishing The Œconomy of Charity, Trimmer was <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> vigorous debate.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, the song {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. UKMIX described the song as [...] "quite blissful {{with a smooth}} vocal delivery and some pretty nice lyrics," [...] but despite {{not being able to}} fault the song, the reviewer was unsure that the song was the right choice for the Eurovision Song Contest and predicted that Tyler would suffer the same criticism that Engelbert Humperdinck received the previous year. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song two stars out of five, stating that the song is a [...] "polar opposite to the slew of Euro-club bangers <b>entering</b> <b>this</b> year's contest," [...] but applaud Tyler for entering the Eurovision Song Contest with the contrasting song. The Guardian held a poll on their website asking the public if they expected Tyler to be successful at Eurovision. The results were fairly even with 46% predicting that Tyler would win and 54% voting that they didn't expect Tyler to win. Ann Gripper from the Daily Mirror described the song as [...] "heartfelt," [...] and {{went on to say that}} Tyler [...] "can still sing." [...] She criticised the songwriters' choice of [...] "above" [...] and [...] "stuff" [...] as the first rhyming lyrics, but noted the line [...] "you never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain" [...] as an improvement, and an opportunity to [...] "have some fun with the staging on finals night in Malmo." [...] Gripper concluded by saying that it [...] "doesn't get into your head like (2012 Sweden winning song) [...] "Euphoria"," [...] and stated that unless the staging is [...] "spectacular", the song won't be remembered by voting time.|$|E
500|$|At 13:30 on 1 November, Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn, {{respectively}} the Presidential Military Adviser and Army Chief of Staff, led a coup against Diệm, assisted by mutinous ARVN officers. [...] The rebels had carefully devised plans to neutralise loyalist officers {{to prevent them}} from saving Diệm. Unknown to Diệm, General Đính, the supposed loyalist who commanded the ARVN III Corps that surrounded the Saigon area, had allied himself with the plotters of the coup. The second of Diệm's most trusted loyalist generals was Huỳnh Văn Cao, who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta. Diệm and Nhu were aware of the coup plan, and Nhu responded by planning a counter-coup, which he called Operation Bravo. This plan involved Đính and Colonel Tung, the loyalist commander of the Special Forces, staging a phony rebellion before their forces crushed the [...] "uprising" [...] to reaffirm the power of the Ngô family. Unaware that Đính was plotting against him, Nhu allowed Đính to organise troops as he saw fit, and Đính transferred the command of the Seventh Division from Cao's IV Corps to his own III Corps. This allowed Colonel Nguyễn Hữu Có, Đính's deputy, to take command of the 7th Division based at Mỹ Tho. The transfer allowed the rebels to completely encircle the capital and denied Cao the opportunity of storming Saigon and protecting Diệm, as he had done during the previous coup attempt in 1960. Minh and Đôn had invited senior Saigon based officers to a meeting at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base, headquarters of the Joint General Staff (JGS), on the pretext of routine business. Instead, they announced that a coup was underway, with only a few, including Tung, refusing to join. Tung was later forced at gunpoint to order his loyalist Special Forces to surrender. The coup went smoothly as the rebels quickly captured all key installations in Saigon and sealed incoming roads to prevent loyalist forces from <b>entering.</b> <b>This</b> left only the Presidential Guard to defend Gia Long Palace. The rebels attacked government and loyalist army buildings but delayed the attack on the palace, hoping that Diệm would resign and accept the offer of safe passage and exile. Diệm refused, vowing to reassert his control. After sunset, the 7th Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, who later became the nation's president, led an assault on Gia Long Palace and it fell by daybreak.|$|E
