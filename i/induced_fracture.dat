The main goal of hydraulic fracture monitoring is to completely characterize the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> structure, and distribution of conductivity within a formation. Geomechanical analysis, such as understanding a formations material properties, in-situ conditions, and geometries, helps monitoring by providing a better definition of {{the environment in which}} the fracture network propagates. The next task is to know the location of proppant within the fracture and the distribution of fracture conductivity. This can be monitored using multiple types of techniques to finally develop a reservoir model than accurately predicts well performance.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{modeling}} of an induced hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture in a poroelastic medium and study their interaction. A finite element based numerical model is developed for this purpose. The model integrates a wellbore, an induced hydraulic fracture, a natural fracture and a reservoir in a fully coupled manner and simulates {{the interaction between}} induced hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture. A half reservoir model is used {{to take advantage of}} symmetry. In order to have control over the entire grid and element numbering, an innovative mesh generator was developed as part of this study. Fracture propagation is modeled based on KGD fracture mechanics. The numerical studies have shown that a natural fracture has a profound effect on the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> propagation. It has been observed that in most cases the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> crosses the natural fracture at high angles of approach and high differential stress. The width of the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> decreases as it propagates. Once the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> crosses a natural fracture and it propagates further into the formation fracture width increases. At low angles of approach and low differential stress the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> {{is more likely to be}} arrested (at least short time) and/or breaks out from the far end side of the natural fracture. Results also showed that in the case of high angle of approach the hydraulic fracture always crosses the natural fracture and the differential stress has no significant effect on the propagation of hydraulic fracture. It has been also observed that propagation of <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> is stopped by a large (> 10 m) natural fracture at high angle of approach. If the injection rate, however, is increased the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> crosses the large natural fracture at high angle of approach. At low angle of approach the <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> deviates and propagates along natural fracture. Crossing of natural fracture and/or arrest by the natural fracture is controlled by shear strength of the natural fracture, natural fracture orientation and in-situ stress state of the reservoir. From the results of this study it has been found that this model has a potential application in the design and optimization of hydraulic fracture treatments in naturally fractured reservoirs including tight gas reservoirs and enhanced geothermal systems. The model can also be used in the design of hydraulic stimulation of naturally fractured reservoirs based on shear dilation principle...|$|E

Fractured intervals ranged in depth from 45 to 570 m. and logs were made {{both before and}} after the <b>fractures</b> were <b>induced.</b> Unambiguous identification of almost all <b>induced</b> <b>fractures</b> was made on the three types of logs, with depth alignments verified through identification of nearby natural fractures.

All but the two most steeply dipping hydraulic fra. ctures produced small apparent decreases in compressional velocity. Waveforms that propagated across hydraulic fractures at depths greater than 100 m had negligible shear anomalies and tube-wave attenuation. These results indicate that the hydraulic fractures at these depths were slightly open within a few centimeters or less of the borehole wall, and did not produce a measurable increase in permeability.

40|$|Groundwater flow {{resulting}} from a proposed hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operation was numerically modeled using 91 scenarios. Scenarios were chosen to {{be a combination of}} hydrogeological factors that a priori would control the long-term migration of fracking fluids to the shallow subsurface. These factors were <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> extent, cross-basin groundwater flow, deep low hydraulic conductivity strata, deep high hydraulic conductivity strata, fault hydraulic conductivity, and overpressure. The study considered the Bowland Basin, northwest England, with fracking of the Bowland Shale at ∼ 2000 m depth and the shallow aquifer being the Sherwood Sandstone at ∼ 300 - 500 m depth. Of the 91 scenarios, 73 scenarios resulted in tracked particles not reaching the shallow aquifer within 10000 years and 18 resulted in travel times less than 10000 years. Four factors proved to have a statistically significant impact on reducing travel time to the aquifer: increased <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> extent, absence of deep high hydraulic conductivity strata, relatively low fault hydraulic conductivity, and magnitude of overpressure. Modeling suggests that high hydraulic conductivity formations can be more effective barriers to vertical flow than low hydraulic conductivity formations. Furthermore, low hydraulic conductivity faults can result in subsurface pressure compartmentalization, reducing horizontal groundwater flow and encouraging vertical fluid migration. The modeled worst-case scenario, using unlikely geology and <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> lengths, maximum values for strata hydraulic conductivity and with conservative tracer behaviour had a particle travel time of 130 years {{to the base of the}} shallow aquifer.

40|$|Presently, {{more and}} more water {{injection}} wells operate under induced fracturing condition. Induced fractures geometry and their orientation {{with respect to the}} injection well and nearby production wells are crucial factors in determining water injection performance. Designing, conducting and interpreting well tests is a possible way to understand geometry and dynamic behavior of induced fractures. Integrating nearby wells into well testing may give a possibility to characterize <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> geometry and its impact on macroscopic sweep efficiency. In this thesis, one of the objectives is getting knowledge on pressure transient responses of wells connected with fractures with different geometries and orientations using numerical simulations and analytical models. Two scenarios of well tests including single-well tests and interference tests were simulated with two well geometries (vertical and horizontal) and two <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> orientations (parallel and perpendicular to the well). Base cases without fracture were simulated and compared with cases including induced fractures. The numerical simulation included injection periods and shut-in periods with similar durations. Synthetic responses generated by the numerical simulation were compared with well test responses from equivalent analytical models. Comparison between the results of all fracture cases for single-well tests and also interference tests were performed and subsequently used to analyse differences in pressure transient responses. Moreover, a comparison of the results of numerical simulations with analytical models was carried out and confirmed capabilities of analytical models in interpreting pressure responses from many cases with various well and fracture geometries. The analysis of single-well test simulations confirmed that the case with parallel and perpendicular induced fractures intersecting a horizontal well has identical pressure transient responses to the case of <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> intersecting a vertical well for cases with high or infinite conductivity. On the other hand, interpretations of the synthetic pressure response generated by simulations of well interference tests indicated different responses in the case with parallel and perpendicular induced fractures: the pressure response to the active well shut-in (or start of injection) was registered later in the observation well in the case of parallel fracture. Therefore, it was confirmed that interference tests can give more information about fracture orientation than single-well tests. Finally, it was shown the value of interpretations of synthetic pressure transients in understanding <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> geometry and suggesting a well test design for the field application...|$|E

40|$|To safely store {{carbon dioxide}} in {{enhanced}} oil recovery/ CO 2 sequestration projects {{it is important to}} ensure the integrity of the caprock during and after production and injection. A change in fluid pressure and temperature within a porous reservoir will generally induce stress changes within the reservoir and the rocks that surround it. Amongst the potential hazards resulting from these induced stress changes is the reactivation of existing faults or <b>fractures</b> and <b>inducing</b> new <b>fractures,</b> which may breach the hydraulic integrity of the caprock that bounds the reservoir. The theories of inclusions and inhomogeneities have been used in this research to derive semi-analytical and closed-form solutions for induced stress change during pore pressure change within a reservoir and in the surrounding rock, under plane strain and axisymmetric conditions. Methods have been developed to assess fault reactivation and <b>induced</b> <b>fracturing</b> during injection or production within a reservoir. The failure stress change concept for a Coulomb failure criterion has been used to study the likelihood of fault reactivation and <b>induced</b> <b>fracturing</b> within the reservoir. Formulations have been adopted to calculate the critical pressure change for fault reactivation and <b>induced</b> <b>fracturing</b> within the reservoir and in the surrounding rock during injection and production. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the effects of different parameters such as initial in-situ stress, reservoir geometry, reservoir depth, reservoir “tilt” or dip, material property contrast between the reservoir and surrounding rock, fault geometry, fault strength, and intact rock strength. General patterns of induced stress change, in-situ stress evolution, fault reactivation, and <b>induced</b> <b>fracturing</b> have been identified. The developed methodologies have been applied to six different case studies: fault reactivation analysis in the entire field for a synthetic case study; <b>induced</b> <b>fracturing</b> analysis in the entire field in a synthetic case study; fault reactivation and induced stress change analysis within the Ekofisk oil reservoir in North Sea; fault reactivation analysis in the Lacq gas reservoir in France; the Weyburn-Midale EOR/CO 2 Storage project in southeast Saskatchewan; and acid gas injection in Zama oil field, Alberta. The results of these case studies show good consistency with field observation, and physical and numerical models. The generality, simplicity, and straightforwardness of the developed methodologies, along with their flexibility to model different plausible scenarios and their ease of implementation for systematic sensitivity analyses makes them suitable for decision-making and uncertainty management, specifically in early stages of reservoir development or site assessment for geological sequestration of carbon dioxide...|$|R

In the present study, the axial loading test with fully reversed condition was performed to examine the fatigue property of a surface-carburized low alloy gear steel in the long life region. Results show that this steel represents the duplex S-N (stress-number of cycles) characteristics without conventional fatigue limit related to 107 cycles. Fatigue cracks are all originated from the interior inclusions in the matrix region due to the inhabitation effect of carburized layer. The inclusion <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> with fisheye occurs in the short life region below 5 × 105 cycles, whereas the inclusion <b>induced</b> <b>fracture</b> with fine granular area (FGA) and fisheye occurs in the long life region beyond 106 cycles.

30|$|Polymer {{flooding}} is {{a popular}} enhanced oil recovery method because of its impact on improvement of sweep efficiency. Polymers are non-Newtonian fluids with different behavior at different flow rates. At high shear rate, they reveal shear-thinning behavior, which is the apparent viscosity reduction by increasing shear rate. However, higher shear rate let them become dilatant. Consequently, an increase in shear rate contributes to increase in apparent viscosity and thus decreases the well injectivity of polymer. Hydraulic fracturing reduces mechanical shearing {{in the vicinity of}} the wellbore and plays an important role in feasibility of polymer flooding scenarios due to injectivity enhancement and lowering shear rate. A three-dimensional simulator was used to construct a synthetic model of the reservoir with no-flow boundary condition. Results show that <b>induced</b> hydraulic <b>fractures</b> improve recovery factor of homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs due to an increase in injectivity of polymer flooding, although in vertically heterogeneous reservoirs, <b>induced</b> <b>fractures</b> are not very effective.
