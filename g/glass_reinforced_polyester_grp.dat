40|$|The {{flexural}} and compressive {{properties of}} <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polyester</b> (<b>GRP)</b> plates after exposure to fire are investigated. Large plates of the GRP composite {{were exposed to}} a kerosene fuel tray fire for times up to 10 min. The plates suffered thermally induced damage which increased with exposure time and consisted of charring, due to combustion of the polyester matrix, and delamination cracking. The residual flexural and compressive properties were measured at room temperature, and were found to decrease rapidly with increasing exposure time. It is shown that the post-fire structural properties can be approximated by modelling the burnt plate as a bi-layer material using a rule-of-mixtures formulation. It is proposed that the models {{can be used to}} estimate the structural deterioration after a fire of flat single-skin plates used in GRP ship construction. Crown © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{investigation}} of thin-walled stressed-skin sheet pyramids for use as structural elements in lightweight roof systems. Exploratory tests were carried out on commercially produced <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polyester</b> (<b>GRP)</b> hexagonal- base pyramids to determine the behaviour of thin-sheet units under load. The units were found to act mainly in the large deflection and post-buckled ranges. A review of the relevant literature was made, with much of the information originating from the field of aeronautical engineering. The calculation of the critical buckling load of the trapezoidal plates under uniformly distributed load at the apex and base was carried out using the method of collocation. Several effective width formulas developed for simply supported buckled rectangular plates in compression were applied to the results of tests on a full-scale hexagonal-base unit. To these was added a formula for the effective width of a buckled plate, proposed by the author. This formula took into account the geometry of the trapezoidal plate. Ultimate load tests were carried out on four GRP pyramids to determine the accuracy of the effective width formulas when applied to practical structures containing variations in thickness and mechanical, properties. The results of tests on individual pyramids were used to develop a method of analysis for structures composed of many pyramids by assuming that the pyramidal elements were equivalent pin-connected skeleton space frames. The analysis was then carried out by established methods developed for such skeleton structures. The results of this approximate method of analysis applied to the pyramidal structures were compared with the results of tests on two prototype structures, a stressed-skin space grid and a stressed-skin barrel vault. Conclusions were drawn, and suggestions were made for future research into some of the problems encountered...|$|E

The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 10. 1108 / 14714170910931525 Purpose – Offsite {{is one of the main}} innovative techniques employed in the contemporary UK construction sector. Building maintenance accounts for over 5 percent of the UK's gross domestic product of which bathrooms are regarded as a critical area, with potential high risks and defects. However, the importance of its maintenance has been largely underestimated and research into this area appears to be limited. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the maintenance performance of offsite and in situ bathrooms for student accommodation. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines 732 maintenance records over three years of 216 precast concrete modules, 84 <b>Glass</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>Polyester</b> (<b>GRP)</b> modules and 96 traditionally-built in situ bathrooms. Findings – The research found that offsite modules outperformed in situ bathrooms in terms of maintenance. GRP modules created the least maintenance problems, compared to precast modules and in situ bathrooms. The maintenance of in situ bathrooms was more complex than offsite modules, and involved more diverse problematic areas. The main causes of the problems included inappropriate design; poor build workmanship, lack of quality of component materials and improper usage by occupants. This supports a parallel study that found that the costs associated with maintenance were significantly higher for in situ bathrooms than for the equivalent offsite solutions. Research limitations/implications – The paper contributes to understanding the problems of offsite bathroom modules requiring maintenance in comparison with in situ bathrooms and their possible causes. Key aspects of offsite bathrooms including drainage, toilets, vents and sinks should be improved. Quality of component materials used for in situ bathrooms should be ensured. These improvements can only be achieved through better design for maintenance with clients' aspiration embodied. The findings should assist in design decision making of selecting bathrooms for residential buildings. However, a balanced approach, taking into account other factors for such selection, is open for future investigation. Originality/value – The framework of strategies developed should improve the innovative design of bathrooms manufactured offsite and help maintain them for better lifecycle performance...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{important}} issue {{of finding a}} relationship between a macroscopic damage variable {{and the process of}} damage accumulation within a material is addressed in this article. Monotonic and cyclic deformation behavior has been studied in a randomly distributed <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polyester</b> matrix composite. The composite material is called sheet molding compound, abbreviated as SMC, with a short glass fiber weight of 30 %. The damage evolution in this planar isotropic material is studied by continuously monitor-ing axial, lateral, and specimen thickness strain components on the specimen. Based on these measurements, the damage volumetric strain was calculated that increased continu-ously with cycles in load-controlled experiments. However, in the strain-controlled experi-ments, where tensile stresses decayed rapidly with cycles, the corresponding damage volumetric strain reached a saturation level. Microscopic observations revealed that cracks grew along the matrix/fiber interfaces as well as the matrix/filler interfaces. Many of these cracks are normal to the specimen thickness direction. This observation is consistent with the increasing specimen thickness strain measured in the experiments...|$|R
