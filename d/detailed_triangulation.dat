In 1784, a team from General William Roy's Ordnance Survey of Great Britain began the Principal Triangulation of Britain. The first Ramsden {{theodolite}} was built for this survey. The survey was finally completed in 1853. The Great Trigonometric Survey of India began in 1801. The Indian survey had an enormous scientific impact. It was responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly. It named and mapped Mount Everest and the other Himalayan peaks. Surveying became a professional occupation in high demand at the turn of the 19th century with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The profession developed more accurate instruments to aid its work. Industrial infrastructure projects used surveyors to lay out canals, roads and rail.|$|E
50|$|Triangulation {{methods were}} by now well {{established}} for local mapmaking, {{but it was}} only {{towards the end of the}} 18th century that other countries began to establish <b>detailed</b> <b>triangulation</b> network surveys to map whole countries. The Principal Triangulation of Great Britain was begun by the Ordnance Survey in 1783, though not completed until 1853; and the Great Trigonometric Survey of India, which ultimately named and mapped Mount Everest and the other Himalayan peaks, was begun in 1801. For the Napoleonic French state, the French triangulation was extended by Jean Joseph Tranchot into the German Rhineland from 1801, subsequently completed after 1815 by the Prussian general Karl von Müffling. Meanwhile, the famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss was entrusted from 1821 to 1825 with the triangulation of the kingdom of Hanover, for which he developed the method of least squares to find the best fit solution for problems of large systems of simultaneous equations given more real-world measurements than unknowns.|$|E

This became very influential, and the technique spread across Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. The astronomer Tycho Brahe applied the method in Scandinavia, completing a <b>detailed</b> <b>triangulation</b> in 1579 of the island of Hven, where his observatory was based, with reference to key landmarks {{on both sides of}} the Øresund, producing an estate plan of the island in 1584. [...] In England Frisius's method was included in the growing number of books on surveying which appeared from the middle of the century onwards, including William Cuningham's Cosmographical Glasse (1559), Valentine Leigh's Treatise of Measuring All Kinds of Lands (1562), William Bourne's Rules of Navigation (1571), Thomas Digges's Geometrical Practise named Pantometria (1571), and John Norden's Surveyor's Dialogue (1607). It has been suggested that Christopher Saxton may have used rough-and-ready triangulation to place features in his county maps of the 1570s; but others suppose that, having obtained rough bearings to features from key vantage points, he may have estimated the distances to them simply by guesswork.|$|E

The data were analyzed using the qualitative descriptive technique. The data credibility was enhanced by the participation lengthening, interview <b>details,</b> <b>triangulation,</b> and peer checking. The results were as follows. (1) In general, the students consulted with their AAs during the consultation period. (2) On the average, the consultation frequency was once or twice a semester. (3) They consulted with not only their AAs but also other lecturers. (4) They consulted with their AAs when they needed their AAs and the AAs responded to them; they consulted with other lecturers when they found it difficult to see their AAs, they felt scared and hesitant, and the AAs did not respond to them. (5) Most consultation materials were academic in nature. (6) Most AAs gave the students positive responses and only few AAs were not responsive or indifferent. (7) Most of the AAs’ suggestions were positive and only few were useless and irrelevant. (8) The students suggested that AAs should be easy to see, have schedules, and conduct the consultation not in public.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Action Research {{investigation}} was to better understand how post-secondary faculty mentor self-regulatory behaviours in a project-based learning environment (PjBL). The secondary purpose was {{to understand how the}} Action Research process supported faculty in their mentoring. Lastly, understanding learner perceptions of being mentored and how the faculty’s mentoring of specific self-regulatory behaviors would align with the expectations of the video game industry, would provide a cross-section of intrigue into the investigation. The research context was the Master of Digital Media Program in Vancouver, Canada. The MDM Program specializes in providing learners, organized in project teams, the opportunity to work on real-world digital media projects. Three faculty mentors and three student teams participated in this study; each team was tasked with co-constructing video-game prototypes for three game companies over a four-month period. Pre-research interviews with established members of the video game industry in Vancouver were conducted in order to determine what qualities and skills they looked for when hiring new recruits. Data from these interviews revealed characteristics of self-regulation, such as self-motivation, ‘ownership’, the ability for recruits to manage their own learning, and self-reliance as being of primary importance. A pilot study was then undertaken to operationalize self-regulation as reflected in the mentoring practices of one MDM faculty member and assess the effectiveness of the planned data collection procedures. The primary investigation consisted of video recording the mentoring sessions of three faculty and three student teams, a total of 18 students. Video recorded mentoring sessions were observed and discussed by the researcher and each faculty member in a one-on-one interview setting. Final faculty and student interviews were conducted. Data from pre-research interviews, the stimulated recall sessions, and final interviews were analyzed and triangulated. Triangulation of learner interviews revealed that mentors supported self-regulatory behaviors using a variety of strategies, which are described in <b>detail.</b> <b>Triangulation</b> of pre-research interviews revealed that mentors were supporting learners in their development of specific characteristics expected of new recruits transitioning into the video game industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{multilevel}} representation scheme adapted to storage, progressive transmission, and rendering of dense data sampled {{on the surface}} of real objects. Geometry and object attributes, such as color and normal, are encoded in terms of surface particles associated to a hierarchical space partitioning based on an octree. Appropriate ordering of surface particles results in a compact multilevel representation without increasing the size of the uniresolution model corresponding to the highest level of detail. This compact representation can progressively be decoded by the viewer and transformed by a fast direct triangulation technique into a sequence of triangle meshes with increasing levels of detail. The representation requires approximately 5 bits per particle (2. 5 bits per triangle) to encode the basic geometrical structure. The vertex positions can then be refined by means of additional precision bits, resulting in 5 to 9 bits per triangle for representing a 12 -bit quantized geometry. The proposed representation scheme is demonstrated with the surface data of various real objects.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{algorithm}} for dynamic adaptive triangulation of spline surfaces. The algorithm is dynamic because it adjusts {{the level of}} <b>detail</b> of the <b>triangulation</b> at each frame. It is adaptive because it samples each surface patch more densely in regions of high curvature and less densely in regions of low curvature. The two have not been combined before. Our algorithm pre-computes a prioritized list of important samples on the surface. At rendering time, it adds these points in the specified order to the triangulation. Once the pre-computed points are exhausted and even more detail is required on some region of the patch, additional samples, now uniformly spaced, {{are added to the}} triangulation. The algorithm works well in practice and has a low memory footprint...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} this can be {{achieved}} with the help of CDR data already stored for billing purposes, without the need for implementing more <b>detailed</b> hand-over or <b>triangulation</b> data analysis pipelines. The benefit of using billing data is that mobile operators always collect this data in a standardized format; there is even a dedicated software package for analyzing such data ([URL] [30]. However, extracting accurate travel time information from CDRs is not a straightforward task because the location of a user is recorded only when the user initiates a call or sends a text message. Therefore, a single CDR-based mobility trajectory is typically very sparse in time, and cannot directly be used for estimating travel times between locations. However, when multiple mobility trajectories are pooled and analyzed as a whole, it turns out it is possible to produce reliable travel time estimates.|$|R

An analysis {{of the nature of}} problems faced by the museum and recommendations for improving its success are also offered. Face to face interviews guided by interview schedules with semi structured questions were used to collect data.

When such a general-purpose model has to be used in a particular application context, however, a pre-processing is often worth to be considered. In some cases, it is convenient to slightly modify the geometry and/or the connectivity of the mesh, so that further processing can take place more easily. Other applications may require the mesh to have a pre-defined structure, which is often different from the one of the original general-purpose mesh. The central focus of this thesis is the automatic remeshing of highly <b>detailed</b> surface <b>triangulations.</b> Besides a thorough discussion of state-of-the-art applications such as real-time rendering and simulation, new approaches are proposed which use remeshing for topological analysis, flexible mesh generation and 3 D compression.

40|$|Masters in Public Administration - MPAWhilst policy {{formulation}} {{has been}} extensively studied and theorised in the literature, far less {{attention has been paid}} until fairly recently to the issue of policy implementation. For a long time it was more or less assumed that once policy was formulated, implementation was a relatively straightforward administrative matter. In the past twenty or thirty years, however, public administration scholars (such as Pressman and Wildavsky and, in the South African context, Brynard and de Coning) have devoted more attention to unravelling the complexities of policy implementation. The current study intends to apply these more theoretical approaches to an analysis of the implementation of the 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare with particular respect to children in conflict with the law, focusing specifically on the One Stop Child Justice Centre in Mangaung, Bloemfontein. Welfare Service in South Africa before 1994 had a racial bias with services mostly unavailable to the majority of the citizens of the country. The 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare, based on a developmental approach to social welfare, was designed to take the country in a new and inclusive direction. In line with South Africa’s 1996 ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as other international instruments, Section 4 of Chapter 8 of the White Paper focuses on crime prevention through development and restorative justice, and recommends diversion wherever possible in the case of juveniles. With respect to Juvenile justice, this section of the White Paper makes provision for the establishment of One Stop Child Justice Centres, where a variety of services, from Social Development, the Department of Justice, the South African Police Services, Correctional Services, and the NPA, would be available to clients under one roof. All of these role players, it was envisaged, would operate as a multi-disciplinary team to achieve the objectives of the White Paper with respect to developmental and restorative forms of justice. The Centre at Mangaung is one of only a few centres to have been established as yet in South Africa. Although focusing in particular on the implementation of the 1997 White Paper, the study is also informed by other policy and legislative measures with respect to juvenile justice, in particular the Child Justice Bill of 2002 (now the Child Justice Act of 2008) and the Probation Services Amendment Act of 2002. It is generally accepted by the Government and its critics alike that the policy scene in South Africa in the period since 1994 has been characterized by good policies but poor execution. This is, however, a relatively untested hypothesis and needs further investigation. In the light of this, it is anticipated, that the present study will make a contribution to the literature on policy implementation in South Africa, as well as providing useful insights and lessons that can inform general government policy in this regard, and policy with respect to juvenile justice in particular. Within the general context of the 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare and the Department of Social Development’s Integrated Service Delivery Model, and the specific context of the Mangaung One Stop Child Justice Centre, the overall purpose of the study is to scrutinize the apparent discontinuity between policy design {{on the one hand and}} policy implementation on the other. More specifically, though, the objectives of the study are: (i) to examine the content of the 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare in general and more specifically the section on children in conflict with the law, (ii) to provide a historical overview of the delivery of services to youth in conflict with the law prior to the first democratic elections (1994) in South Africa, (iii) to examine what the concept of ‘integrated service delivery’ means to the different role-players at the One Stop Child Justice Centre, (iv) to examine the existing resources (human, financial and other) for successful implementation of the policy,(v) to examine whether there are procedures in place to encourage co-operation among stakeholders at the One Stop Child Justice Centre, (vi) to examine the successes, challenges and opportunities presented by the implementation of this policy at the One Stop Child Justice Centre and, (vii) to identify gaps between policy and implementation and make recommendations towards more successful implementation. Detailed semi-structured interviews were conducted with the Centre Manager and senior representatives of all the services involved (Social Development, the SAPS, Magistrates, the Probation Service, and Prosecutors). The interview questions focus mainly on implementation issues and challenges, but also gather information on the knowledge of the interviewees on the content of the policy. In addition, in order to validate and compare the data collected from these respondents, semi-structured interviews were held with six parents/guardians of children in conflict with the law who had been serviced by the centre. Official documents of the centre, such as annual reports, were also consulted for purposes of <b>triangulation.</b> <b>Detailed</b> transcripts will be made of all the interviews. In analysing the data, use was made in particular of the 5 C Protocol advocated by Brynard and De Coning (2006) in their study of policy implementation in South Africa. The five C’s include the Content of the policy, the Context in which the policy is implemented, Commitment from those implementing the policy, the role of Clients and Coalitions, and the Capacity of those tasked with implementing the policy. In addition other C’s which have an impact on policy implementation (such as communication, co-ordination, and change management) will also be considered. Confidentiality of data gathered and anonymity of respondents were ensured by not requiring any personal details from the survey instruments. The sole purpose of using the data gathered for research was communicated to the respondents on the front page of the survey instruments. The choice of also not answering questions raised was respected...|$|R
