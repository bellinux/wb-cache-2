50|$|Hosting a live {{red carpet}} was exhilarating, but I {{particularly}} enjoyed the social media component of these worldwide premieres. I could interact {{in real time}} with fans watching at home through Twitter, <b>Instagram</b> <b>or</b> <b>Facebook</b> and that's what I love most about hosting. Getting to share in people's opinions and have a conversation about what really excites them.|$|E
5000|$|Internet {{technology}} such as online {{retailers and}} social media platforms {{have given way}} for trends to be identified, marketed and sold immediately. Styles and trends are easily conveyed online to attract the trendsetters. Posts on <b>Instagram</b> <b>or</b> <b>Facebook</b> can easily increase awareness about new trends in fashion which can create high demand for specific items or brands, new [...] "buy now button" [...] technology can link these styles with direct sales.|$|E
50|$|To keep up {{with these}} changes, {{businesses}} who strategise using celebrity branding to advertise their campaigns will of course use the most obvious choice to reach their market. For example, if a brand is wanting to target the elderly {{it would make sense}} to put their celebrity marketing in radio or newspapers - though less used, still utilised by marketers to appeal to the tradition media users; whereas if they were targeting a younger market who are more social media and technology savvy then they would use websites like <b>Instagram</b> <b>or</b> <b>Facebook</b> to appeal to them and communicate their message.|$|E

5000|$|Photo showing {{originated}} as {{an alternative}} to [...] "live" [...] showing. Photo showing originally involved taking photographs of the models and posting them to the show holder, to be judged alongside other entrants; this is now referred to as 'postal showing' and has become less popular with the invention of the internet. The majority of photo showing now takes place online. Photos may be emailed directly to the show holder or upload to various web services, such as YouTube, <b>Instagram</b> <b>or</b> <b>Facebook.</b> Photo shows are typically not registered with a higher body such as NAMHSA, and are run on a more adhoc basis, therefore can only be found through searching social networks.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, Swedish society has gone through a great change. Firstly with the personal computer and then with the internet moving in to everyday life, a new arena for interaction with society evolved. Work, education, doing bank errands and reading or discussing the news, just to name a few, now all take place in the virtual world online. Not to mention social media sites such as twitter, <b>instagram</b> <b>or</b> <b>facebook,</b> the last of which has over half of the Swedish population represented as members.    Companies, corporations, interest groups, political parties and politicians must be aware of the massive impact that a post spread through social media can have.      This thesis will, with the text analyzing tool, argumentation analysis, and on the theoretical platform of political communications theory, analyze three of the most viral Swedish political posts spread over 120 000 times each, {{to see if there are}} any combined qualities that point to the fact that there is a formula for getting a post to become a viral success on social media.      The main result showed that of the three posts analyzed, all were built up around a factual thesis, argued for with foremost example arguments, not only appealing to the logical branch of argumentation but also to the ethical, and that they tended to be of high relevance and sustainability. The conclusion must therefore be that these are all qualities that tend to be of relevance for making a political post on social media into a viral success...|$|E
