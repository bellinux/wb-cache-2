5|$|In 1933, Enrico Fermi {{proposed}} the first {{theory of the}} weak interaction, known as Fermi's interaction. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> beta decay {{could be explained by}} a four-fermion interaction, involving a contact force with no range.|$|E
5|$|Khalid, sensing Heraclius' plan, {{feared that}} the Muslim armies would indeed be {{isolated}} and destroyed. In a council of war <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Abu Ubaidah draw all the Muslim armies to one place so as to fight a decisive battle with the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{ended in}} mid-1944 on {{the orders of}} Major-General Robert Laycock, the chief of Combined Operations Headquarters. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{they were no longer}} as {{effective}} and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, which could be detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E

5|$|When {{interviewed in}} early 2005, the Illinois EPA {{inspector}} {{who discovered the}} secret pipe in 1996 was pessimistic about the chances of rapid remediation of the site. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the clear-up could take twenty years or so.|$|E
5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E

50|$|Finally, Phillips <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> oil {{has been}} the driving force in U.S. foreign policy for nearly thirty years. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. {{military}} {{has been transformed into}} a worldwide oil protection force. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> various military events in the 1980s, as well as the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, were primarily oil driven. Phillips makes a point that with Iraq at war for the past 25 years, and thus Iraqi oil production depressed for that time period, that most of Iraq's oil is still in the ground.|$|R
5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, another rodent {{from the}} same group was described: Noronhomys, a {{recently}} extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H.primigenus should probably be excluded from the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called early because of weather and treating them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where it left off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely until the next day.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} compete at the Winter Olympics, he set up the Ethiopian National Skiing Federation with his three {{brothers}} so that the sport could be recognised in the country. Teklemariam explained in interviews prior to the Games that he hoped his appearance would inspire other Ethiopians living in colder climates to take up sports. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> cross-country skiing could be a sport that Ethiopians could naturally be proficient at, since it was an endurance sport.|$|E

50|$|In {{his second}} reconstruction, Martin de Framond placed more {{weight on the}} will of Garsenda, which could be read as {{implying}} that she left no children. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the nepotes Hugh and Raymond were children of Raymond II, Count of Rouergue, the nephew of Raymond Pons and his heir-male were he to die without sons. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Raymond of Rouergue may have succeeded his uncle as Count of Toulouse, and that the husband of Adelaide was son of this count, a like-named half-brother to Raymond III of Rouergue.|$|R
50|$|R. Scott Clark, {{professor}} of church history and historical theology from Westminster Seminary California, argues that New Calvinists like Driscoll {{should not be}} called Calvinists merely because they believe in the five points of Calvinism, but rather <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> adherence to the Three Forms of Unity and other Reformed confessions of faith is what qualifies one a Calvinist. Specifically, <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> many of the New Calvinists' positions on infant baptism, covenant theology, and continuation of the gifts of the Spirit are {{out of step with}} the Reformed tradition.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bennett {{noted that the}} two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were {{precisely}} separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> they probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of Pteranodon would have been present at any one time, and P. sternbergi (or Geosternbergia) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for crews' wages {{to be stopped}} when a ship was sunk. Famed Labour leader James Larkin {{raised the issue of}} the survivors' treatment in the Dáil Éireann. Citing the crew member who was told by the Labour exchange to 'go and get his record card', which was lost when Irish Oak sank, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the Dáil Éireann ask the German Consul-General to send a submarine to retrieve it.|$|E
5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5000|$|David Grote {{argues that}} it was another name for As You Like It. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> titles for comedies were often generic - several plays could be called [...] "As You Like It" [...] or [...] "All's Well that Ends Well", for example, and that names were not fixed until {{repeated}} publication. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> As You Like It began as a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost, but was later revised when Robert Armin replaced William Kempe as the principal comic actor in Shakespeare's theatre company the Lord Chamberlain's Men.|$|R

5|$|Once war was declared, Voorhis {{supported}} the internment of Japanese-Americans, though <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the evacuations {{be done in}} as voluntary a manner as possible and that officials be appointed to administer their property to avoid forced sales at bargain prices. During the war, Voorhis advocated more efficiently taxing higher incomes and war profits, planning against postwar unemployment, and planning for the nutritional needs of Americans. Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys couesi {{was first}} {{reported}} from Colombia in 1987, when Philip Hershkovitz reported on its occurrence at Montería in Córdoba Department, northwestern Colombia. The Colombian specimen is ochraceous in color throughout {{and according to}} Hershkovitz almost identical to specimens from Guatemala, but distinctive in that the upper lip is white. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> O.couesi may also be discovered in the Pacific lowlands of the Chocó in western Colombia.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
