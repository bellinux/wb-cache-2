Patrick realizes what Robin and this baby truly mean to him and knows that he wants them to be a family <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word, but Robin still has concerns. Although Robin states that Patrick could see his child as much as he wants, she does not believe he is fully {{committed}} or prepared to give up his bachelorhood for a family. He takes her to court and only after his moving testimony does she realize Patrick truly wants this, her and their child, their family. They wait for their baby as a happy, loving committed couple. On August 12, 2008, Patrick and Robin learn their baby is a girl. As Patrick goes into full panicked father mode, Robin tries to calm him down. Later, when Patrick sees Robin with Jason, he expresses his concern that he does not want his child to be around such a dangerous target and Robin agrees.|$|E

Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: [...] "The key word with Mariam {{is that she is}} isolated <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word.

As John Major suggested, this dealt a massive blow to [...] "Puritan morality", and {{it could have been the}} beginning of the long-term relationship between sport and alcohol.

500|$|Conversely, the sequel, Godchild, {{received}} positive reviews. When {{the first}} chapter premiered in Shojo Beat, critics commented on the potiental and art of the series, but found the chapter [...] "listless" [...] and confusing. Reviews of the bound volumes were positive. Writing for The Book Report, Robin Brenner described the mysteries as [...] "unsettling, splatter-filled, and deliciously {{in line with the}} melodramatic, horrific traditions of Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley." [...] Leroy Douresseaux of Coolstreak Cartoons wrote: [...] "By turns bizarre and unsettling, Godchild is actually quite engaging, but can be difficult to follow for those who didn't come in at the beginning". Writing for Sequential Tart, Sheena McNeil described Godchild as [...] "a masterpiece <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word."

[...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E
500|$|In {{its initial}} {{run at the}} Opéra-Comique, Carmen {{provoked}} little public enthusiasm; it shared the theatre for a while with Verdi's much more popular Requiem. Carmen was often performed to half-empty houses, even when the management gave away large numbers of tickets. Early on 3 June, {{the day after the}} opera's 33rd performance, Bizet died suddenly of heart disease, at the age of 36. It was his wedding anniversary. That night's performance was cancelled; the tragic circumstances brought a temporary increase in public interest during the brief period before the season ended. Du Locle brought Carmen back in November 1875, with the original cast, and it ran for a further 12 performances until 15 February 1876 to give a year's total for the original production of 48. Among those who attended one of these later performances was Tchaikovsky, who wrote to his benefactor, Nadezhda von Meck: [...] "Carmen is a masterpiece <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word ... one of those rare creations which expresses the efforts of a whole musical epoch". After the final performance, Carmen was not seen in Paris again until 1883.|$|E

Simon Kuper of the Financial Times criticised both Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo as the [...] "worst" [...] of the Adventures, being [...] "poorly drawn" [...] and [...] "largely plot-free". Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Hergé had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, Hergé cast the Bolsheviks as [...] "absolute evil" [...] but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet [...] "world of misery" [...] and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as [...] "fairly straightforward" [...] and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as [...] "pantomime cut-outs".|$|E

[...] He was the captain of the Flames for four seasons, and his teammates in Dallas praised him as a player who would help guide the younger players as they began their careers. His presence was considered an important factor in New Jersey's 2003 Stanley Cup championship. Devils' general manager Lou Lamoriello praised his impact {{both on and off the}} ice: [...] "Certainly (the tangibles were) the quality player he was even at that time, how good he was defensively as well as always finding a way to get big goals. It was also about how good he was on faceoffs. And the intangibles, which are really more tangible than anything, are what he brought in the locker room from leadership and unselfishness. It was obvious that when he didn't play he was still so active in his support. He's genuine <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word. He was a true team player."

In a 1980 article in The Musical Times, George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach, but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten. Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption, a few perceived Offenbach's unusual quality; in The Times, Francis Hueffer wrote, [...] "none of his numerous Parisian imitators has {{ever been able to}} rival Offenbach at his best." [...] Nevertheless, the paper joined in the general prediction: [...] "It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive." [...] The New York Times shared this view: [...] "That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree is not to be denied, but he wrote currente calamo, and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will, it is to be feared, keep them from reaching even the next generation". After the posthumous production of The Tales of Hoffmann, The Times partially reconsidered its judgment, writing, [...] "Les Contes de Hoffmann [...] confirm the opinion of those who regard him as a great composer <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word".
