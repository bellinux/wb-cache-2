The NAHMS Layers ' 99 Study was designed to provide information about the nation's layer population for education and research purposes. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collaborated with VS to select a statistically-valid sample from 15 states for Layers ' 99. The 15 -state target population accounted for over three-quarters of the table egg layers in the U. S. as of December 1, 1998. The study was limited to companies with 30, 000 or more layer. About two-thirds (68. 1 percent) of farm sites did not allow visitors that did not have a business reason for visiting the operation in the layer houses. The percentage of farm sites that allowed non-business visitors in the layer houses did not differ by size of farm site. However, visitors {{were more likely to be}} required to sign in on farm sites of 100, 000 or more layers than on farm sites with fewer layers. About two-thirds (62. 9 percent) of farm sites that allowed non-business visitors required the visitors, vehicles not to have been on any other poultry farm that day. A total of 22. 9 percent of farm sites did not allow business visitors, such as a salesperson or feed service personnel, in the layer houses. The average usual down time between flocks ranged from 10. 5 days for farm sites in the Central region to 20. 4 days in the Great Lakes region. About one-third (35. 1 percent) of farm sites usually had a down time of 18 days or longer, while 8. 6 percent of farm sites usually had down time of less than 4 days. The median down time was 14 days. Over 98 percent of farm sites emptied feeders and 91. 3 percent emptied feed hoppers between flocks. About 80 percent each flushed water lines and dry cleaned cages, walls, and ceilings, while 71. 8 percent cleaned fans and ventilation systems between each flock.

The 15 -state target population accounted for over three-quarters of the table egg layers in the U. S. as of December 1, 1998. The study was limited to companies with 30, 000 or more layers. While the majority of farm sites were contract farms (61. 0 percent), the majority of birds were located on company owned farms (72. 6 percent), indicating that company owned farms tended to be larger than contract farms. The Central region had the largest percentage (23. 0 percent) of farm sites with 200, 000 or more layers and also the largest percentage (40. 5 percent) of farm sites with fewer than 50, 000 layers. The vast majority of flocks (95. 6 percent) and layers (98. 8 percent) were white egg layers. (The New England states, which have a higher percentage of brown egg layers, were not involved in this study.) Almost two-thirds (61. 8 percent) of farms sites obtained all of their most recently placed pullets from a single pullet raising site, while 13. 6 percent of farm sites assembled their most recently placed flock from four or more different farm sites. The majority of farm sites (71. 3 percent) obtained all their replacement pullets from primarily cage reared facilities, although the majority of the farm sights in the Southeast region obtained pullets from primarily floor reared facilities. Layers on 69. 6 percent of farm sites came from pullet facilities that monitored for Salmonella enteritidis (S. e.) Ten percent of farm sites obtained replacement pullets from facilities that used competitive exclusion product in pullets to reduce S. e. Overall, 89. 0 percent of farm sites obtained pullets that had been vaccinated against fowl pox. On average, 3. 7 pounds of feed were needed to produce one dozen eggs.

Duplicates of the following examinations were performed: Roche index (10 samples/week); total content of proteins, lipids, water and ash (two samples/week); CFU/eggshell as well as presence of Salmonella in the contents using three different selective agar media (8 samples/week). From the total number of 480 samples of each category, results showed the following: for the Roche index, organic eggs were evaluated at 10 - 11, for free-range and aviary ones, values reached 13 and for cage production systems, 8 - 9. The content of proteins (%) was higher for free-range eggs (12. 48). The content in lipids showed high values for cage production eggs (11 %), but with close values for the other categories, reaching the minimum to 10. 7 % in aviary eggs. As for the water content, the highest value was observed for free-range eggs, and for ash the lowest value was observed for cage production eggs, while the highest for organic eggs. Microbiological quality of <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> revealed a significant bacterial load for the eggshell, of up to 5. 06 log CFU/eggshell for free-range eggs, and 5. 04 log CFU/eggshell for organic ones.

Well fed, healthy flocks, housed in adequate quarters should average 50 to 70 percent production during the entire laying season. If this production is not attained with proper management practices, the flock owner should give more careful consideration to the type of stock being purchased. Rigorous culling several times during the season should be practiced to eliminate the poor layers and those that drop out of production early. Information available from Extension Service, Iowa State College, in bulletin form, will serve as a guide to proper culling techniques. The amount of feed consumed by a flock o f laying hens depends largely on the breed, body size and the rate of production. The feed intake of the hen is used (1) to maintain the body and supply body warmth, (2) to increase body weight and (3) to produce eggs. Flocks in heavy production consume much more feed than those producing only a few <b>eggs.</b> <b>Table</b> 2 may be used as a guide to calculate the yearly feed requirement. The proportion of grain, mash and green feed necessary to make up the yearly diet will vary according to the method of feeding and the amount of protein in the mash. It will be noted that the word ration applies to all the feed elements eaten by the flock from any source...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} analyze the eggshell {{characteristics}} from 14 cores production of fertile eggs. They were monitored for three months totaling 478, 680 eggs that arrived at the hatchery, through a classification known as Egg Quality Assessment. The eggs were classified as dirty, face, thin skin and crooked. To grade <b>eggs</b> a <b>table</b> was used with a lamp which allowed {{a better view of}} them. After the classified eggs that had defects were discarded. After the evaluations, we determined that most centers have not reached the ideal indices, established by the company. However, eggs classified in receipt of hatchery clenched a higher percentage compared to dirty, crooked and deformed. ...|$|R

40|$|In broad terms, about {{one-fifth of}} the world is well fed, while about four-fifths (mainly in the tropics and subtropics) is poorly fed (Holmes 1970). Presently the world is losing the race between food supply and popula-tion growth. The race is being lost because the {{developing}} countries, and others as well, are not producing food at anywhere near their potential. For ex-ample, the developing countries have about 60 % of the world's livestock and domestic fowl. Yet, they produce only about 22 % of the world's supply of meat, milk, and <b>eggs.</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). The United States produces about 19 % of estimated that 80 % of the popluation increase will occur in the developing countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. These are areas least able to feed and support a large population growth. The population in Latin America is the fastest growing in the world. Since 1944, food production per person has been decreasing more in this area than any other area of the world. Since 1960, the world increase in food production has been about 1. 8 % year, compared with a population growth of over 2. 0 % yearly. Thus, {{the world as a whole}} is gradually producing less food per per-son. the world as a whole, up to half the population suffered from hunger or malnutrition or both (F AO 1963). About two-thirds of the world's people live in 70 countries with average diets that are nutritionally inadequate in en-ergy, protein, and other nutrients. The diet deficient areas include all of Asi...|$|R

During the decade 1940 - 49, hogs ranked first, dairy products second, cattle and calves third, and poultry products and <b>eggs</b> fourth (<b>table</b> 1). The income from hogs has varied from approximately 20 to 25 per cent of total cash receipts 1 from the sale of products by Minnesota farmers since shortly after World War I. Since the middle 1920 's, livestock and livestock products, including hogs, have accounted for about three-fourths of the total cash receipts. 35 pages.
