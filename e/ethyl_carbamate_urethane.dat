In the lungs, NF-κB, a central effector of inflammatory responses, is frequently activated in non-small-cell lung cancer, but its role in tumor promotion has not been studied. Several lines of evidence indicate that <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> (<b>urethane)</b> -induced lung tumor formation, a prototypical mouse model of multistage lung carcinogenesis, is potentiated by inflammation. We found that mouse strains susceptible to lung tumor formation (FVB, BALB/c) exhibited early NF-κB activation and inflammation in the lungs after urethane treatment. However, a resistant strain (C 57 B 6) failed to activate NF-κB or induce lung inflammation. In FVB mice, we identified urethane-induced NF-κB activation in airway epithelium, as well as type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Using an inducible transgenic mouse model (FVB strain) to express a dominant inhibitor of NF-κB specifically in airway epithelial cells, we found that urethane-induced lung inflammation was blocked and tumor formation was reduced by > 50 %. Selective NF-κB inhibition resulted in increased apoptosis of airway epithelial cells at 2 weeks after urethane treatment in association with a marked reduction of Bcl- 2 expression. These studies indicate that NF-κB signaling in airway epithelium is integral to tumorigenesis in the urethane model and identify the NF-κB pathway as a potential target for chemoprevention of lung cancer...|$|E

These differentially expressed genes include 13 -actin, ubiquitin, a hyperproliferative keratin (K 6), a gene whose product is a member of a fatty acid or lipid-binding protein family, and a gene called transin or stromelysin. The overexpression of the stromelysin gene, which encodes a metalloproteinase that degrades proteins in the basement membrane, is hypothesized to play a functional role in malignant tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We believe that the cloning, identification, and characterization of gene sequences that are differentially expressed during tumor progression could lead to the discovery of gene products that either play functional roles in skin tumor progression or in the maintenance of various progressive tumor phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The ARF tumor {{suppressor}} gene, encoded {{along with}} a second tumor suppressor, p 16 INK 4 a, at the CDKN 2 A locus, is frequently inactivated in human cancers. However, the close proximity of ARF and p 16 INK 4 a lends itself to the concurrent loss of both genes, raising important questions about the specific contribution of ARF to tumor suppression in vivo. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that sustained signaling from oncogenes such as RAS or MYC induces the expression of ARF, which then stabilizes p 53 activity to arrest cell proliferation. To address the role of ARF in RAS-driven cancers, we exposed wild-type and Arf -deficient mice to two separate carcinogens, <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> (<b>urethane)</b> and 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Arf -deficiency facilitated the growth and malignant progression of lung adenocarcinomas after urethane exposure. A subset of lung tumors in Arf -deficient animals presented as poorly differentiated and metastatic, with many characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, a transitional tumor type previously undocumented in mice. Unexpectedly, urethane injection also resulted {{in the development of}} hepatic vascular tumors in Arf -deficient animals. Suppression of hemangioma development by ARF was strongly influenced by mouse genetic strain and was likely p 53 -dependent. Subjection of mice to the DMBA/TPA two-step skin carcinogenesis protocol further revealed that ARF inhibits the metastatic spread of carcinoma cells. The pro-invasion and metastasis phenotype of Arf -deficient carcinomas was apparent at the transcriptional level, and our data provide preliminary evidence of a role for ARF in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition program. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that induction of ARF is an early response in carcinogenesis that mounts an effective barrier against tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. For this reason, ARF status may have important implications for cancer patient prognosis and clinical management...|$|E

40|$|Summary. -A tumour {{initiating}} dose of {{ethyl carbamate}} {{was administered to}} mice by subcutaneous injection together with a dose {{of one of the}} homologous esters or an ethyl N-alkyl derivative. The homologues used were the methyl, n-propyl and n-butyl esters, and the derivatives were the N-methyl, N-ethyl and N-n-propyl ethyl esters. The mice were then given promoting treatment with croton oil for 28 weeks. Neither the homologous esters nor the N-substituted derivatives of ethyl carbamate had any influence on the yield of tumours in the skin, lung, or liver. However, increasing the dose of ethyl carbamate increased the yields of tumours. THE administration of <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> (<b>urethane)</b> to mice by any route leads to the production of tumours in a variety of tissues (Tannenbaum, 1964). Adenomata of the lung (Nettleship et al., 1943; Shimkin, 1955) are very common. Lymphomata with or without leukaemia (Pietra et al., 1961), haemangiomata of the liver (Trainin, 1963), and hepatomata are less commonly found; tumours of lacrimal gland, skin and of other sites are observed infrequently and only after a long latent period. For skin its carcinogenic action is mainly that of an initiator, that is, tumours usually appear only when the skin is subsequently painted repeatedly with a promoting agent such as croton oil (Graffi et al., 1953; Salaman and Roe, 1953; Berenblum and Haran, 1955). The tumour initiating property of carbamates for skin appears to be limited to the ethyl ester and a few of its N-substituted derivatives (Berenblum et al., 1959 b; Pound, 1967, 1969). The tumour producing property for lung also appears to be restricted to ethyl, ethyl N-methyl and N-hydroxy carbamates although propyl carbamate was considered to have a doubtful effect (Larsen, 1947, 1948; Berenblum et al., 1959 b). However, because of the common chemical structure it might be thought that the homologues, or the N-substituted derivatives, of ethyl carbamate might affect or be affected by similar metabolic systems within the cells of animals injected with them. Some related compounds appear to produce similar abnormalities of the chromosomes during mitosis in the cells of animals, some eggs and plant...|$|E

The mechanism of this degradation and its oenological implications were examined in this research. It was found that wine LAB able to degrade arginine do so {{by means of the}} arginine deiminase pathway, demonstrated by measuring the enzyme activitie since l l-free extracts: arginine deiminase, ornithinetrans carbamylase and carbamate kinase. These enzymes we represent in most heterofermentative lactobacilli and leuconostocs, but were absent in homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci. The presence of arginine increased the activities of arginine deiminase pathway enzymes in heterofermenters, but failed to induce these enzymes in homofermenters even under conditions of low glucose concentration (1 g/L). Glucose did not repress arginine utilisatio n but fructose appeared to do so, as fructose and arginine were metabolised sequentially, with arginine being metabolised mainly after utilisation of the fructose. D etailed studies o n Leuconostoc oenos OENO, Lactobacillus b uchneri CUC- 3 and Lactobacillus brevis 250 showed that arginine was converted stoichiometrically to ammonia and ornithine as the major end-products and that arginine catabolism could supply energy (ATP) to support growth. lt was also demonstrated that citrulline was excreted during arginine catabolism by both the lactobacilli and the leuconostoc. Some of the excreted citrulline was reassimilated and catabolised after arginine depletion by the lactobacilli, but not by the leuconostoc. The implication of citrulline excretion for the wine industry was explored by studying the formation of the carcinogen <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> (<b>urethane)</b> in a synthetic wine and a white wine, since citrulline is a known precursor of ethyl carbamate. During growth of Le. oenos OENO and Lb. buchneri CUC- 3 in the synthetic wine and wine, significant amounts of ethyl carbamate were found i n the two wine types upon heat treatment of samples. The formatio n of ethyl carbamate correlated well with arginine degradation and citrulline excretion. Citrulline excretion during arginine degradation is of concern to the winemaker, since the reaction of citrulline and ethanol to form ethyl carbamate has been shown by other workers to occur even at normal wine storage temperatures. Winemakers, therefore, should avoid using argininedegrading LAB starter cultures for inducing malolactic fermentation (MLF). In addition, spontaneous MLF in wine by undefined LAB strains should be discouraged, as this may lead to formation of ethyl carbamate precursors. Ammonia detection with Nessler's reagent provides a simple, rapid test to assess arginine degradation by wine LAB in a complex medium, but is useful only for strains showing strong ammonia formation. The more sensitive enzymatic determination of ammonia is required for strains showing weak ammonia formation...|$|E

The binding of an <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> metabolite to liver DNA was fourteen times greater in males but the level of binding to lung or epidermal DNA showed no sex differences. Partial hepatectomy increased the binding to liver DNA in both sexes but did not alter the amount bound to lung or epidermal DNA. The rate of metabolism of <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> was slower after partial hepatectomy, but this did not create {{a significant increase in the}} effective dose...|$|R
