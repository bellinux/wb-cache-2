40|$|AbstractTo {{increase}} the competition {{of the solar}} energy collection system, {{the size of the}} solar panel module during the manufacturing process is being increased continuously. As the size of the solar panel increases, the size of the robot to <b>handle</b> the <b>panel</b> increased also. The change in scale of the robot inevitably results in the amplification of the adverse effect of the flexure. The main source of the flexure in the large scale solar cell <b>panel</b> <b>handling</b> system is the long and thin fork fingers of the hand and the solar cell panel. In addition, the belt-driven actuator system used by most of the large scale <b>panel</b> <b>handling</b> robot is another significant source of the vibration. In this paper, the flexible multi body dynamic model of a large scale solar cell <b>panel</b> <b>handling</b> robot, which is being designed and constructed with the help of Kyung Hee University, is developed. The belt-driven system in the robot is also modeled as flexible system and included in the robot to represent the actual vibration characteristics of the actuator system...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for formulating stiffness terms and thermal coefficients of stiffened, fiber-reinforced composite panels. The method is robust enough to <b>handle</b> <b>panels</b> with general cross sectional shapes, including {{those which are}} unsymmetric and/or unbalanced. Nonlinear, temperature and load dependent constitutive material data of each laminate are used to 'build-up' the stiffened panel membrane, bending, and membrane-bending coupling stiffness terms and thermal coefficients. New thermal coefficients are introduced to quantify panel response from through-the-thickness temperature gradients. A technique of implementing this capability with a single plane of shell finite elements using the MSC/NASTRAN analysis program (FEA) is revealed that provides accurate solutions of entire airframes or engines with coarsely meshed models. An example of a composite, hat-stiffened panel is included to demonstrate errors that occur when an unsymmetric panel is symmetrically formulated as traditionally done. The erroneous results and the correct ones produced from this method are compared to analysis from discretely meshed three-dimensional FEA...|$|R

40|$|Nonparametric {{efficiency}} {{analysis has}} become a widely applied technique to support industrial benchmarking {{as well as a}} variety of incentive-based regulation policies. In practice such exercises are often plagued by incomplete knowledge about the correct specifications of inputs and outputs. Simar and Wilson (2001) and Schubert and Simar (2011) propose restriction tests to support such specification decisions for cross-section data. However, the typical oligopolized market structure pertinent to regulation contexts often leads to low numbers of cross-section observations, rendering reliable estimation based on these tests practically unfeasible. This small-sample problem could often be avoided with the use of panel data, which would in any case require an extension of the cross-section restriction tests to <b>handle</b> <b>panel</b> data. In this paper we derive these tests. We prove the consistency of the proposed method and apply it to a sample of US natural gas transmission companies in 2003 through 2007. We find that the total quantity of gas delivered and gas delivered in peak periods measure essentially the same output. Therefore only one needs to be included. We also show that the length of mains as a measure of transportation service is non-redundant and therefore must be included...|$|R
40|$|In the {{financial}} field {{much of the}} data available is in panel form. Nevertheless, some researchers convert these data into indices {{in order to facilitate}} its use. Today, because of the availability of software programs, it is easier than in the past to <b>handle</b> <b>panel</b> data in those instances where its use is preferable to the use of indices. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the long run equilibrium relationship between prices and fundamentals while proposing a very simple method of extending time series models to panel data. Although this method has multiple applications, here we are solely concerned with investigating the cointegrating relationship between prices and fundamentals with data expressed in panel form. This method has several characteristics that make it appealing. First, it is simple to implement (efficient). Second, it is general in scope (can be applied to many tests). Third, it takes into account arbitrary correlations (for example, among firms). Fourth, it does not require making unrealistic assumptions (such as the assumption of independence among firms within the same market). Our results are supportive of Han’s (1996) in that we do not find cointegration between fundamentals and prices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} an {{implementation of the}} Communication-Avoiding QR (CAQR) factorization that runs entirely on a single graphics processor (GPU). We show that the reduction in memory traffic provided by CAQR allows us to outperform existing parallel GPU implementations of QR for a large class of tall-skinny matrices. Other GPU implementations of QR <b>handle</b> <b>panel</b> factorizations by either sending the work to a general-purpose processor or using entirely bandwidth-bound operations, incurring data transfer overheads. In contrast, our QR is done entirely on the GPU using compute-bound kernels, meaning performance is good regardless of {{the width of the}} matrix. As a result, we outperform CULA, a parallel linear algebra library for GPUs by up to 17 x for tall-skinny matrices and Intel’s Math Kernel Library (MKL) by up to 12 x. We also discuss stationary video background subtraction as a motivating application. We apply a recent statistical approach, which requires many iterations of computing the singular value decomposition of a tall-skinny matrix. Using CAQR as a first step to getting the singular value decomposition, we are able to get the answer 3 x faster than if we use a traditional bandwidthbound GPU QR factorization tuned specifically for that matrix size, and 30 x faster than if we use Intel’s Math Kernel Library (MKL) singular value decomposition routine on a multicor...|$|R

40|$|A common {{approach}} to the claims reserving problem is based on generalized linear models (GLM). Within this framework, the claims in different origin and development years {{are assumed to be}} independent variables. If this assumption is violated, the classical techniques may provide incorrect predictions of the claims reserves or even misleading estimates of the prediction error. In this article, the application of generalized estimating equations (GEE) for estimation of the claims reserves is shown. Claim triangles are <b>handled</b> as <b>panel</b> data, where claim amounts within the same accident year are dependent. Since the GEE allow to incorporate dependencies, various correlation structures are introduced and some practical recommendations are given.

Moreover, an estimate for the mean square error of prediction for the claims reserves is derived in a nonstandard way and its advantages are discussed. Real data examples are provided as an illustration of the potential benefits of the presented approach. Comment: Submitted on April 9, 201...|$|R

The emphasis is upon minimum assumptions about the nature and determinants of heterogeneity and nonstationarity, as any uncontrolled variations may result in the identification of spurious adaptive behaviour. Moreover, all the models are readily calibrated and tested using widely available computer software. Some assessment is made of the flexibility of the modelling framework with respect to its potential for <b>handling</b> attrition in <b>panel</b> membership, more extensive choice sets, and exogeneous variables. ...|$|R

50|$|Although {{mechanically}} the new TL and KL series {{remained the}} same as the preceding TJ, stylistically, it had been radically facelifted by French designer Olivier Boulay. Gone were the somewhat angular lines featured since the first TE series, which were instead replaced by what Mitsubishi's new global head of design envisioned as the new Mitsubishi corporate face (a style that would eventually be grafted onto other Mitsubishi vehicles, beginning with the Lancer Evolution and Colt/Mirage). The frontal appearance of the TL/KL series had a distinctive grille, which was again divided in the middle like on the TJ series, but this time by an extension of the bumper bar and not the bonnet. Larger chrome Mitsubishi triple diamonds logo adorned the front bumper, whereas the front guards now had a swoopy appearance with triangular headlamp assemblies. On its sides, new design, colour-coded plastic door <b>handles,</b> rocker <b>panels</b> and skirts were introduced. At the rear, a rounded boot lid and bumper bar were fitted to continue the swoopy front theme, but the rear tail lights remained effectively unchanged from those of the TJ series (except for VR-X and Verada Xi AWD which featured darkened lenses).
