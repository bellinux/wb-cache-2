5|$|Castles {{have played}} an {{important}} military, economic and social role in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although {{a small number of}} castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringworks castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone– with characteristic square keeps– that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E
5|$|Radama's {{successor}} Ranavalona <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> a shipwrecked craftsman named Jean Laborde {{to construct}} the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and Manjakamiadana (built 1839–1841), the largest palace at the Rova. Laborde also produced {{a wide range of}} industrial products at factories in the highland village Mantasoa and a foundry in the Antananarivo neighborhood Isoraka. Ranavalona oversaw improvements to the city's infrastructure, including the construction of the city's two largest staircases at Antaninarenina and Ambondrona, which connect la ville moyenne ("the middle town") to the central marketplace at Analakely. In 1867, following a series of fires in the capital, Queen Ranavalona II issued a royal decree that permitted the use of stone and brick construction in buildings other than tombs. LMS missionaries' first brick house was built in 1869; it bore a blend of English, Creole and Malagasy design and served as a model for a new style of house that rapidly spread throughout the capital and across the highlands. Termed the trano gasy ("Malagasy house"), it is typically a two-story, brick building with four columns on the front that support a wooden veranda. In the latter third of the 19th century, these houses quickly replaced most of the traditional wooden houses of the city's aristocratic class. The growing number of Christians in Imerina prompted the construction of stone churches throughout the highlands, as well as four memorial cathedrals on key sites of martyrdom among early Malagasy Christians under the reign of Ranavalona I.|$|E

The following month, King George <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> him to become Prime Minister of Greece, an office he would hold seven times between 1910 and 1933.|$|E

25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>invited</b> Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|Pedro <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> Dona Mariana de Verna Magalhães Coutinho (later Countess of Belmonte in 1844) to {{take the}} {{position}} of aia (supervisor) to his son. Mariana de Verna was a Portuguese widow who was considered a cultured, honorable and kindly woman. Pedro II called her [...] "Dadama" [...] as he did not pronounce the word [...] "dame" [...] correctly as a child. However, he would continue calling her in this way into adulthood, though out of affection and treating her as his surrogate mother. As was the custom of the time, he was not nursed by his mother. Instead, a Swiss immigrant from the Morro do Queimado colony ("Burnt Hill", now Nova Friburgo) {{by the name of}} Marie Catherine Equey was chosen as his wet nurse.|$|E

500|$|By 1808 it {{was still}} {{considered}} unsafe to return to Berlin, and the royal family consequently spent the summer near Königsberg; Louise believed that the hard trials of her children's early lives {{would be good for}} them: [...] "If they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that so it must always be." [...] In the winter of 1808, Tsar Alexander <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> the king and queen to St. Petersburg, where she was treated to sumptuously decorated rooms; [...] "Nothing dazzles me anymore", she exclaimed on her return to Germany. Near the birth of her youngest child Princess Louise in 1809, Louise wrote to her father, [...] "Gladly...the calamities which have befallen us have not forced their way into our wedded and home life, rather have strengthened the same, and made it even more precious to us." [...] Louise was sick for much of that year, but returned with the king to Berlin near the end of it after an absence of three years; the queen arrived in a carriage accompanied by her two daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine and younger son Charles, and was greeted by her father at Charlottenburg Palace– the residence was ransacked however, as Napoleon and his commanders had stripped its rooms of paintings, statues, manuscripts, and antiquities. Returning to a much different Prussia than she left, a preacher observed that [...] "our dear queen is far from joyful, but her seriousness has a quiet serenity... her eyes have lost their former sparkle, and one sees that they have wept much, and still weep".|$|E

Bronstein wrote, in his acclaimed book The Sorcerer's Apprentice (page 102): [...] "Later, when I recognised the logical play of Furman, <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> him to be my assistant during preparation for the match [...] in 1951. Also, I took him abroad as my second to the Interzonal Tournament in Gothenburg in 1955 and the Candidates' Tournament in Amsterdam 1956." ...|$|E

Gwenllian was sent to Sempringham Priory, and her cousin Gwladys ferch Dafydd is known to have been sent to Sixhills, whereas the fate of Gwladys' sisters is not known.|$|E

2500|$|She had {{the rare}} {{opportunity}} to perform with an internationally-known singer during Jessie J's Live in Manila Concert on the 14th of July 2014 at Smart Araneta Coliseum. Morissette was tasked to interview Jessie J for the music channel MYX and during the interview she mentioned that she sang one of her songs when she joined The Voice of the Philippines. Jessie J then requested Amon to sing in front of her, and despite being hesitant, she sang {{a portion of the}} singer's hit song [...] "Who You Are." [...] This impressed Jessie J so much that she immediately decided to invite Amon to join her onstage during her concert later in the evening. The singer even took to Instagram to express her admiration at Morissette's talent, saying [...] "“The moment @itsmorissette sang to me and told me she auditioned for The Voice Philippines and came 2nd... So great! So <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> her out to sing with me. Love when this happens.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1810s Alexander <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> Menelaws to {{redesign}} the Alexander's Park in Tsarskoye Selo, starting {{with an old}} dilapidated menagerie. The new plan proposed by Menelaws created an illusion of a completely novel design, yet carefully preserved {{the structure of a}} regular park shaped in the previous century; according to Lvov, Menelaws [...] "merged the art of Kent and Le Nôtre". Menelaws designed and built 12 structures, including the Egyptian Gates and three park pavilions: the large Arsenal (1819–1834) built on the site of Mon Bijou built by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1750s, the White Tower (1821–1827), a house for the young Grand Dukes and the Chapel (1825–1828), a folly providing living quarter to the palace chaplain. Use of an eclectic, pan-European romanticism was justified {{as a symbol of the}} New Europe shaped at the Congress of Vienna, but was also a sign of Alexander's turn to mysticism. Alexander's Park was occupied by Nicholas I, then heir presumptive, who also leaned to eclecticism and medieval legacy, as would be evidenced later by his reign.|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also. And also I wanted to install lots of human noises, all kind of phonetic rhythms with my mouth; you hear lots of noises in the background which are done with my mouth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
