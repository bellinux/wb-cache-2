5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington {{its status as}} a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out, with the church at the east end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution. By the end of the 16th century <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> under the {{protection}} of John Popham (judge) and his descendants who built a manor house which was destroyed during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Lochlann, {{originally}} Laithlinn or Lothlend, {{the land}} where Amlaíb's father was king, is often identified with Norway, {{but it is not}} universally accepted that it had such a meaning in early times. Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly as late as the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland. Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to mean Norway.|$|E

5|$|On November 12, 2010, {{tourists}} found a jawbone on an Aruban beach {{near the}} Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp. Preliminary examination by a forensic {{expert on the}} island determined that the bone was from a young woman. A part of the bone was sent to The Hague for testing by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the jawbone was not from Holloway, {{and it was not}} possible to determine whether <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> from a man or woman.|$|E
5|$|On January 24, Blandy {{named the}} Bikini Lagoon {{as the site}} for the two 1946 detonations, Able and Baker. The deep {{underwater}} test, Charlie, scheduled for early 1947, would take place in the ocean west of Bikini. Of the possible places given serious consideration, including Ecuador's Galápagos Islands, Bikini offered the most remote location with a large protected anchorage, suitable but not ideal weather, and a small, easily moved population. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> under exclusive United States control on January 15, when Truman declared the United States to be the sole trustee of all the Pacific islands captured from Japan during the war. The Navy had been studying test sites since October 1945 and was ready to announce its choice of Bikini soon after Truman's declaration. On February 6, the survey ship Sumner began blasting channels through the Bikini reef into the lagoon. The local residents were not told why.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} began {{phasing out}} the Mirage in July 1986, and took delivery {{of its first}} Hornet on 29June 1987. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{under the control of}} a newly re-formed No.81 Wing that February. No.77 Squadron's last Mirage departed Williamtown on 27November 1987. Hornet maintenance at Williamtown was the responsibility of No.481 Wing, which had evolved from No.481 Squadron. One of No.77 Squadron's Hornets crashed near Rockhampton, Queensland, on 19May 1992, killing the pilot and his passenger, a defence scientist. In September that year, the squadron undertook a proving exercise over Halifax Bay in Far North Queensland, when four of its Hornets—refuelled in flight on the round trip from Williamtown by a Boeing 707 tanker—became the first jet aircraft in Australia to drop aerial mines. No.481 Wing was reorganised as No.402 Wing in July 1996; the latter transferred its functions to No.81 Wing's flying squadrons in July 1998.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E
5|$|The Congress disbanded in {{the third}} week of December, and the next step would be a {{congress}} at Laibach to discuss intervention with Ferdinand. Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down. As a result, when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich's policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He was relieved when able to create a Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia; however, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{at the expense of the}} Anglo-Austrian entente.|$|E
25|$|Analysis {{indicated}} that the DNA collected {{at the crime scene}} did not match any of the suspects—and that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> from a single, as yet unknown person.

25|$|The Round Table is King Arthur's famed {{table in}} the Arthurian legend, around which he and his Knights congregate. As its name suggests, it has no head, {{implying}} that everyone who sits there has equal status. The table was first described in 1155 by Wace, who relied on previous depictions of Arthur's fabulous retinue. The symbolism of the Round Table developed over time; by {{the close of the}} 12th century <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to represent the chivalric order associated with Arthur's court, the Knights of the Round Table.|$|E

25|$|In Mesopotamian iconography, {{the most}} common symbol of Ishtar is an eight-pointed star, though {{the exact number of}} points {{sometimes}} varies. Six-pointed stars also occur frequently, but their symbolic meaning is unknown. The eight-pointed star was originally associated with Inanna and seems to have originally borne a general association with the heavens, but, by the Old Babylonian Period, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to be specifically associated with the planet Venus, with which Ishtar was identified. Starting during this same period, the star of Ishtar was normally enclosed within a circular disc.|$|E
25|$|As {{both teams}} had {{expressed}} {{that they wanted}} the bikes and that the other's first choice was their back-up - Revolution's was the candle lamps; Instinct's was the comforters - both had to negotiate on the matter during the second day, before eventually settling on the choices they sold in the task. While Emma felt that Arjun's negotiations on this matter had been poor for not including her or Zoe, Nick questioned why Instinct had relinquished the candle lamps, when <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> from a brand name already being sold {{by one of the}} retailers.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the {{location}} of the tomb was lost because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to be buried by stone chips from subsequent tombs, either dumped there or washed there by floods. In the years that followed, some huts for workers were built over the tomb entrance, clearly without anyone's knowing what lay beneath. When {{at the end of the}} 20th Dynasty the Valley of the Kings burial sites were systematically dismantled, Tutankhamun's tomb was overlooked, presumably because knowledge of it had been lost, and his name may have been forgotten.|$|E

The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury would have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptians and Moors of the 12th and 13th centuries {{used the}} Arabic {{word for the}} plant, bamya, {{suggesting}} <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> into Egypt from Arabia, but earlier it was probably taken from Ethiopia to Arabia. The plant may have entered southwest Asia across the Red Sea or the Bab-el-Mandeb straight to the Arabian Peninsula, rather than north across the Sahara, or from India. One of the earliest accounts is by a Spanish Moor who visited Egypt in 1216 and described the plant under cultivation by the locals who ate the tender, young pods with meal.|$|E

This law had been enacted following the Great Depression and the government's fear at that time of the domination <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> under after accepting major amounts of money from the federal government, and the strings that came attached to it.
