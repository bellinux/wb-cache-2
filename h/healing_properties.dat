5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the <b>healing</b> <b>properties</b> of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E

40|$|Received on 10 - 08 - 2010 Accepted on 26 - 08 - 2010 The {{different}} extracts of {{the bark of}} Tecoma stans Linn. (Bignoniaceae) was evaluated for its wound healing potential in {{two different types of}} wound models in albino rats viz., incision and excision. The {{different extracts}} of Tecoma stans are obtained by successive soxhlet extraction with petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol. The methanolic extract showed significant increase in wound contraction and formation of scar in excision wound model. The extract showed significant increase in the breaking strength of resutured incision wound as compared to control group(p< 0. 05). The result of the present study indicate that methanolic extract of Tecoma stans bark has more significant wound <b>healing</b> <b>property</b> than the petroleum ether and chloroform extracts in excision and incision wound model. The presence of phytoconstituents like phytosterols, triterpene, glycosides, phenols, flavonoids, saponins, and tannins either individually or combined together may exhibit the synergistic effect towards healing of wounds. The wound <b>healing</b> <b>property</b> of Tecoma stans has been attributed to its antimicrobial effects.

40|$|Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is {{commonly}} used for skin ulcers in Indian traditional medicine. Areca nut oil is prepared and is applied topically for burn wound healing. However, scientific study has not been conducted so far. Hence, this study was aimed to evaluate burn wound healing activity of Areca catechu. Objective: To evaluate the burn wound <b>healing</b> <b>property</b> of Areca catechu kernel in normal as well as dexamethasone treated rats. Materials and Methods: Ethanolic extract of Areca catechu kernel was prepared and an ointment was made with 2 % of this extract. Burn wound was induced by standard procedure. Rats with burn wound model received either vehicle, standard drug or test drug. Two other groups were injected with dexamethasone to delay the wound healing process. The dexamethasone treated groups received either vehicle or test drug topically. Wound contraction rate and period of epithelialization were measured. The collected data were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The wound contraction rate was significantly increased in Areca catechu treated group in all the days compared to control. Period of epithelialization was faster in the drug treated group than control group. The dexamethasone treated group showed a significant delay in wound healing process when compared to control. Test drug showed a significant reversal in wound contraction rate and epithelialization period in dexamethasone suppressed burn wound healing model. Conclusion: This study has shown the wound <b>healing</b> <b>property</b> of Areca catechu. Further study is required to know the compounds responsible for its wound <b>healing</b> <b>property</b> and to understand the mechanism of action...|$|R

5|$|The main {{factor in}} the {{continued}} decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they {{are believed to have}} <b>healing</b> <b>properties.</b> Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first went into effect in 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all international trade in the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal. Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market have determined that Asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn.|$|E

Results: The animals were divided into four groups of oral test, control and topical test, control with 6 animals in each group. The time taken for 50 % wound contraction and complete eipthelisation by oral Ocimum sanctum, topical Ocimum sanctum was significantly (p< 0. 001) less compared to oral and topical controls. Histopathological studies showed early inflammatory changes, dense collagen and neovascularisation in wounds treated with oral and topical Ocimum sanctum, compared to respective controls. Mean tensile strength of oral and topical Ocimum sanctum treated wound was significantly great (p< 0. 001) compared to controls.

On the 20 day after biopsy, the presence of adhesion strands between the sites of skin incision and testicle was evaluated by palpation. Adhesion strands were found in three testicles (15 %) in G 1 and in two testicles (10 %) in G 2.
