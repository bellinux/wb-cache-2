50|$|A raceway, {{also known}} as a {{flow-through}} system, is an artificial channel used in aquaculture to culture aquatic organisms. Raceway systems are among the earliest methods used for <b>inland</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> A raceway usually consists of rectangular basins or canals constructed of concrete and equipped with an inlet and outlet. A continuous water flow-through is maintained to provide the required level of water quality, which allows animals to be cultured at higher densities within the raceway.|$|E

40|$|No poster available. Modern {{fisheries}} management is strongly based on ecosystem theory.

We argue that aquatic resource management problems cannot be addressed without due consideration of their socio-economic and agro-ecological context. We conclude that conventional ecosystem based management does not sufficiently capture the complex linkages between <b>inland</b> fisheries and <b>aquaculture,</b> and wider services provided by the ecosystems of which they are part. <b>Inland</b> fisheries and <b>aquaculture</b> management instead should be based on agro-ecosystems management concepts in order to better capture their social and economic objectives within the context of overall ecosystem service provision...|$|R

Nevertheless, there is still potential for increased production which can be realized by improving the management of existing stocks, utilizing unexploited stocks and increasing the exploitation of reservoirs.

50|$|In the Breton {{legend of}} the city of Ys, Corentin is the saint who {{observed}} the fall of Ys and warned King Gradlon of the sin committed by his daughter, Dahut (Ahes). The Christianization of the Celts was concurrent with the fall of Rome, and so the mercy of Corentin towards Gradlon symbolized the cultural transition. Prior to Christianity, the Celtic lifestyle was based around estuarine aquaculture dependent upon the pattern of the tides. In lowland environments where flooding is a major hazard, megaliths served as an astronomical calendar to predict the movement of water. Coastal Celts (also called Armoricans) used a system of dikes and locks to provide irrigation on an alternating basis, allowing separate plots of land to switch between producing cereals and shellfish. This social structure became untenable during the 5th century due to the works of Hypatia, which explained the predictive relationship between the phases of the moon and the levels of the tides, thus enabling aquaculture inland. Corentin is a patron saint of seafood and, through him, <b>inland</b> <b>aquaculture</b> demonstrates the sustainability of Celtic Christianity over prior practices.|$|E
