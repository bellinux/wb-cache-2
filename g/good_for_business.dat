25|$|In 1806 he {{negotiated}} the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty with Great Britain. It would have extended the Jay Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794–95 {{because he felt}} it would allow the British to subvert American republicanism. The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed. When Monroe and the British signed the new treaty in December 1806, Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification. Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees {{that would have been}} <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>business,</b> Jefferson was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. The president made no attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812. Monroe was severely pained by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and he fell out with Secretary of State James Madison.|$|E
500|$|A 2003 {{survey by}} Radio Times found that Last of the Summer Wine was the {{programme}} readers most {{wanted to see}} cancelled. With nearly 12,000votes in the survey, the show received one-third of the total vote, and twice as many votes as the runner up in the poll, Heartbeat. Alan J. W. Bell responded that Radio Times has always been anti-Last of the Summer Wine, and Roy Clarke remarked that people who dislike the show [...] "shouldn't switch it on" [...] unless they are [...] "too idle to turn it off". A 2008 survey by County Life magazine, which named the show the worst thing about Yorkshire, was disputed {{by members of the}} Holme Valley Business Association, who said the show was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>business.</b> The BBC wanted to cancel Last of the Summer Wine for years in favour of a new programme aimed at a younger audience, but the show remained too popular for cancellation; even repeats received ratings of as much as five million viewers per episode. The show came 14th in a high-profile 2004 BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom, and was praised for portraying older people in a non-stereotypical, positive, and active manner. It was also praised for its clever and at times philosophical writing, and for being a family-friendly show.|$|E

Shane reminded The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince conceded that it was wrong for him to back Austin, as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him.

The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom after some bickering between Shane and Vince, and proceeded to stare down Shane, then smile cheekily and shake Shane's hand, faking a defection to the Alliance and a heel turn – but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well and give him a People's Elbow, before emphatically asserting, [...] "Finally, the Rock has come back... to the WWF," [...] thus aligning himself with the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E
2500|$|The Indians were {{organized}} into kinship and clan networks, and marrying {{a woman from}} one of these kinship networks would make a fur trader into a member of these networks, thereby ensuring that Indians belonging to whatever clan the trader had married into {{were more likely to}} deal only with him. Furthermore, the fur traders discovered that the Indians were more likely to share food, especially during the hard months of winter, to those fur traders who were regarded as part of their communities. One fur trader who married a 18-year old Ojibwa girl described in his diary his [...] "secret satisfaction at being compelled to marry for my safety". The converse of such marriages was that a fur trader was expected to favor whatever clan/kinship network that he had married into with European goods, and a fur trader who did not would ruin his reputation. For the Ojibwa, like the other Indians, saw all life in this world being based upon reciprocal relationships, with Ojibwa women leaving behind [...] "gifts" [...] of tobacco when harvesting plants to thank nature for providing the plants while when a bear was killed, a ceremony was held to thank the bear for [...] "giving" [...] up its life to them. The Ojibwa believed if the plants and animals were not thanked for [...] "giving" [...] themselves to them, then the plants and animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] the next year, and the same principle applied to their relations with other peoples such as the fur traders. The Ojibwa, like other First Nations, always believed that animals willingly allowed themselves to be killed, and that if a hunter failed to give thanks to the animal world, then the animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] the next time around. As the fur traders were predominately male and heterosexual while there were few white women beyond the frontier, the Indians were well aware of the sexual attraction felt by the fur traders towards their women, who were seen as having a special power over white men. From the Ojibwa viewpoint, if one of their women gave herself to a fur trader, it created the reciprocal obligation for the fur trader to give back. Fur-trading companies encouraged their employees to take Indian wives, not only to built long-term relationships that were <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>business,</b> but also because an employee with a wife would have to buy more supplies from his employer, with the money for the purchases usually subtracted from his wages. White decried the tendency of many historians to see these women as simply [...] "passive" [...] objects that were bartered for by fur traders and Indian tribal elders, writing that these women had [...] "exert influence and be active communicators of information" [...] to effective as the wife of a fur trader, and that many of the women who married fur traders [...] "embraced" [...] these marriages to achieve [...] "useful purposes for themselves and for the communities that they lived in". One study of the Ojibwa women who married French fur traders maintained {{that the majority of the}} brides were [...] "exceptional" [...] women with [...] "unusual ambitions, influenced by dreams and visions-like the women who become hunters, traders, healers and warriors in Ruth Landes's account of Ojibwa women". Out of these relationships emerged the Métis people whose culture was a fusion of French and Indian elements.|$|E
