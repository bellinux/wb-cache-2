In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single <b>personal</b> <b>allowance,</b> marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased.

During the 2011 Budget, the allowance was raised by £630 to £8,105 from April 2012. In 2013, George Osborne revised the plans to increase the <b>Personal</b> <b>Allowance</b> and bring forward to date at which it would reach the £10,000 target.

30|$|Adam and Browne (2013), {{as well as}} OECD (2012), also {{calculate}} the reward to working a full tax year rather than not working at all. An increase in, say, the <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> {{does not affect the}} reward to working an additional week except for the small group of people who are working so little during the year that they have not used up their <b>personal</b> <b>allowance.</b> Or consider a person earning, for the tax year, in the 20 -percent bracket with an income just below the threshold for the 40 -percent bracket. A reduction in that threshold hardly affects the reward to working at all during the tax year but doubles the disincentive from the income tax for working an additional week.|$|R
