5|$|A Tahitian {{traditional}} dance genre {{dating back}} to before the first contact with European explorers is ʻōteʻa, danced by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> accompanied solely by a drum ensemble.

Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to keep moving in order to prevent desertion.

5|$|At Philadelphia Mutual Savings Bank, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> led by Agent Mitchell Loeb {{break in}} {{and use a}} machine that makes it {{possible}} to walk through the bank's wall.

5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992). WWF officials claimed that the injury {{was the result of a}} Jet Ski accident.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> from Hamburg, Germany {{arrived in}} Afghanistan, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin Laden selected these men {{because they were}} educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the West. New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot's license. Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing.|$|E
5|$|John J. Thorpe, vice {{president}} of AASEREA led the renewed unionization effort, and he and a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> traveled to Indianapolis. Drawing support from union employees of the Indianapolis Street Railway Company, Thorpe began a campaign to unionize the employees of the Traction and Terminal Company in August 1913. The 900 non-union employees of the Traction and Terminal Company were generally paid much less and worked longer hours than the union workers of the smaller transportation company, and Thorpe considered them to be a prime target for the union organizing attempt.|$|E

5|$|Many navvies {{had been}} farm labourers from the Yorkshire Dales, North East England and the Fens, or {{had come for}} work from Scotland and Ireland. Drunkenness and {{fighting}} was such that Jos Midgeley, a railway police inspector, was hired for £1.25 per week to keep order. At one time he was attacked by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men,</b> and at Wescoe Hill, two miles away {{on the opposite side}} of the River Wharfe, a riot occurred when the contractors tried to cut off the beer supply to keep the men sober enough to work.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape with a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men.</b> The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E

Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval writer, praised Osbert's knowledge of law, but condemned his acceptance of gifts from plaintiffs and defendants in legal cases. Osbert was one of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> who are considered the first signs of a professional judiciary in England.|$|E

Valero stopped in St. Thomas, where he established contacts with the Puerto Rican independence movement.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{also helped}} with the {{creation}} of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any familial ties to himself. This <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are the first signs of a professional judiciary.|$|E
