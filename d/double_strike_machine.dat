5000|$|Legions {{introduced}} {{three new}} keywords: amplify, provoke, and <b>double</b> <b>strike.</b> A creature with Amplify {{comes into play}} with a +1/+1 counter on it for each creature card that shared a type revealed from its controller's hand. When a creature with provoke attacks, it can untap an opponent's creature and force that creature to block it. <b>Double</b> <b>strike</b> was suggested on Magic's [...] "You Make the Card" [...] website, and allows a creature with it to deal both First Strike and regular combat damage. To compensate {{for the lack of}} instant and sorcery spells in Legions, a number of creatures had triggered abilities when cycled or turned face up after being morphed.|$|R

50|$|Arguably Australia's most {{successful}} Olympic football tournament, the squad coached by Eddie Thomson contained just two overseas based players: KV Mechelen striker Zlatko Arambasic and Club Brugge midfielder Paul Okon, {{as the rest}} of the squad hailed from NSL clubs. The squad saw Mark Bosnich, John Filan, Tony Vidmar and Tony Popovic, and most importantly, Ned Zelic, who had virtually single-handedly gotten the Olyroos to Barcelona with a sensational <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> in the second leg play off against the much admired Dutch team, take part before commencing their successful careers in Europe.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 February 1945, {{bad weather}} over Europe {{prevented}} any USAAF operations, {{and it was}} left to RAF Bomber Command to carry out the first raid. It had been decided that the raid would be a <b>double</b> <b>strike,</b> in which a second wave of bombers would attack three hours after the first, just as the rescue teams were trying to put out the fires. Other raids were carried out that night to confuse German air defences. Three hundred and sixty heavy bombers (Lancasters and Halifaxes) bombed a synthetic oil plant in Böhlen, [...] from Dresden, while de Havilland Mosquito medium bombers attacked Magdeburg, Bonn, Misburg near Hanover and Nuremberg.|$|R
2500|$|Spares {{and strikes}} are also marked uniquely in candlepins. Spares are {{recorded}} {{in a box}} by coloring in the left upper corner of the appropriate left-hand square (using a triangular shape to [...] "fill-in the corner"). If a strike is recorded, opposing corners of the left-hand square are similarly colored in, while leaving sufficient space between the [...] "filled-in" [...] opposing corners, to record the score from the two succeeding balls' [...] "fill" [...] total for the strike. A common (albeit unofficial) practice is to mark a strike on a <b>strike's</b> bonus ball (<b>double</b> <b>strike)</b> by shading in the remaining two corners of the first strike.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of four-ball called desítkový karambol (Czech for 'tenfold carom') is popular in Central Europe, {{especially in the}} Czech Republic. It is played with two white balls, a blue ball, and a red ball which serves as the cue ball for both players. Players score a point by hitting on any other three balls with the cue ball, scoring one point for single or <b>double</b> <b>strikes.</b> A carom off all three object balls in one shot, however, scores 10 points. The score is doubled by hitting a cushion before hitting {{any of the other}} balls for a total of either 2 or 20 points in one shot.|$|R

5000|$|Considered “Canada’s Coin Bible” [...] the Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins {{provides}} {{comprehensive information}} on history, and records all legal tender coinage including current values, and major coin varieties for coins, die varieties {{as well as}} containing all coins {{that have been used}} as circulating tender in Canada from 1858 to present. Over 150 years of Canadian coins are listed, illustrated, and priced depicting standards of grading, along with varieties and illustrations for the avid collector. Interestingly enough, the Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins has never recorded errors (ex. <b>double</b> <b>strikes,</b> die clashes, hanging numbers etc) as compiling information on errors would be a never ending endeavour.|$|R

50|$|Monhegan Island {{has long}} been an {{important}} marine navigation landmark on the coast of Maine. Because it is frequently beset by fog, the United States Lighthouse Board proposed in 1853 the construction of a fog signal for Manana Island. Congress appropriated funds for the station in 1854, and in 1855 a manually sounded bell was installed on Manana Island, about one mile west of Monhegan Island Light. In 1856 an automatic <b>striking</b> <b>machine</b> was installed. After further funding was secured, a steam-powered Daboll trumpet, then an experimental device, was installed in 1870. It was replaced in 1872 by a whistle, and the trumpet was moved to the Portland Head Light.|$|R

Financial {{problems}} plagued the club during the period from 1998–2001, and the club went through hard times although it became the first Azerbaijani team to win away from home in a European competition by defeating the Israeli side Maccabi Haifa 1-2 in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup thanks to a <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> from club legend Mushfig Huseynov.

50|$|He {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his time at Colchester as a defender, usually as a right wing-back. He enjoyed a storming start to the 1995-96 season when he scored Colchester's winner on the opening day against Plymouth Argyle — a 30-yard drive into the roof of the net, followed by two more goals against Hartlepool United in the autumn. In the 1996-97 campaign, he scored four goals, all of those coming away from home, and featuring a <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> at Exeter City. However, given the depth of midfield talent at Layer Road, he found himself {{in and out of the}} starting line up and went on the transfer list at his own request in March.|$|R
40|$|Interventional {{radiology}} {{interacts with}} all medical disciplines and historically {{has not had}} a patient base of its own. The specialty has depended upon referrals for procedures (often complex) and not referrals for the global management of the disease process or patient. Because of this, when referrers develop catheter-based skills, referrals to interventional radiology drop and competition for primary care physician referrals increase; a <b>double</b> <b>strike.</b> To compete, interventional radiology needs to offer clinical services to the primary care physician. One way to compete is by establishing particular disease surveillance programs. Below we discuss in detail the process of establishing surveillance clinics, which one worked for us, and the expected outcomes of these clinics...|$|R

50|$|This {{mission was}} {{enshrined}} in fiction as the 'Hambrucken raid' in Beirne Lay and Sy Bartlett's novel, Twelve O'Clock High. It provides a reasonably accurate {{view of the}} thinking behind the planners' intention and the decisions {{that led to the}} abandonment of the goal of launching a <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> {{in such a way that}} the second strike would meet no aerial opposition; and of the action in the air itself. The Schweinfurt portion of the mission also formed the framework for the novel The War Lover, by John Hersey. In the early 1990s, the raid was depicted for the first time in a video game, as a playable mission in Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe.|$|R
5000|$|Darksteel {{continued}} the Equipment, Affinity, Imprint and Entwine mechanics, and introduced the indestructible and modular keywords. Something that is or has indestructible can't be destroyed by damage or [...] "destroy effects". In Darksteel, indestructible cards (all {{of which were}} artifacts) are made of the titular metal, though other things have been deemed indestructible when it became a common mechanic in later sets (similar to <b>Double</b> <b>Strike,</b> introduced in the Onslaught). Modular was a keyworded ability of artifact creatures, these creatures would come into play with a set number of counters and, upon the destruction of that creature, could transfer them to another artifact creature. Modular {{was part of a}} larger theme of charge counters on artifacts throughout the set.|$|R
