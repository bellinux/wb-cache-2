The station was constructed by the Cheshire Lines Committee and opened on 21 August 1935.

The two original open top buses were now due for retirement and were replaced with two converted Guy Arab vehicles from the 1949 batch. Also the Transport Committee decided that all new buses would be A.E.C. chassis fitted with East Lancashire bodies. In 1966, bigger buses that could provide higher passenger capacities were needed and a prototype entered service in early 1966; this being a 30 feet long double-deck bus. The prototype {{proved to be a}} success and so was followed by a further seven buses and another 20 in 1967. These would be the last rear entrance double deckers to be bought by Southampton. Later in 1967 another prototype was introduced; this being an A.E.C. Swift, which was a high capacity single decker and was trailed on Woolston routes as a replacement to the Standees, which were due for retirement. The chassis were made by A.E.C. and were 36 feet long. It also had a local body, a Pacemaster built by Strachans of Hamble. Five similar buses were delivered in 1968. All of these buses were one-man operation.|$|E

40|$|An entity has {{a foreign}} {{subsidiary}} operating {{in an economy}} that is considered highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the entity's reporting currency has been used as the subsidiary's functional currency in accordance with Statement 52. Except for inflation considerations, the subsidiary's functional currency would have been the local currency. Because of significant declines in the rate of inflation for the local currency in recent years, the foreign economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. The issue is how the entity should account for a change in its subsidiary's functional currency from the reporting currency to the local currency when the economy ceases to be considered highly inflationary. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that paragraph 46 of Statement 52 does not apply to this type of change and that the entity should restate the functional currency accounting bases of nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> as follows: the reporting currency amounts at the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> should be translated into the local currency at current exchange rates and those amounts should become the new functional currency accounting bases for the nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Exhibit 92 - 4 A illustrates the application of this consensus. Copyright © 1992, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution Page 1 The Task Force also noted that the difference between the new functional currency basis and the functional currency tax basis represents a temporary difference under Statement 109 and the Task Force discussed how the related deferred taxes should be recognized. The Task Force was not asked to reach a consensus on this new issue, but requested that a separate Issue Summary be prepared for discussion at a future meeting. [Note: See STATUS section. ...|$|E

40|$|This article investigates {{whether there}} has been a {{structural}} increase in financial market integration in nine European countries and the US in the period 1980 to 2003. We employ a GARCH model with a smoothly time-varying correlation to estimate the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and the speed of the transition between the low and high correlation regimes. Our test produces strong evidence of greater comovement across the board for both stock markets and government bond markets. Dates of change and speeds of adjustment vary widely across country linkages. Stock market integration is a more gradual process than bond market integration. The impact of European monetary union (EMU) is rather limited, as it has mainly affected the timing of bond market correlation gains (but hardly their size) and has had little discernible effect on stock market integration. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study {{estimation}} of the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in persistence, from I(0) to I(1) or vice versa. Contrary to statements in the original papers, our analytical results establish that the ratio-based break point estimators of Kim [Kim, J. Y., 2000. Detection of change in persistence of a linear time series. Journal of Econometrics 95, 97 – 116], Kim et al. [Kim, J. Y., Belaire-Franch, J., Badillo Amador, R., 2002.

Tests of stationarity against a change in persistence. Journal of Econometrics 123, 33 – 66] are inconsistent when a mean (or other deterministic component) is estimated for the process. In such cases, the estimators converge to random variables with upper bound given by the true break date when persistence changes from I(0) to I(1).

30|$|The use of DNA {{sequencing}} has led {{to numerous}} taxonomic changes resulting in {{a large number of}} species names becoming obsolete and being replaced by newly created ones. However, a large majority of CC users, and specifically those outside the field of taxonomy, do not keep up to date with microbial taxonomy. To best serve the needs of such users, databases should allow for searches using the “old”/obsolete species names in addition to the new ones. Although this practice has been implemented in some Information Systems (e.g., CABRI, [URL] and web servers (YeastIP, [URL] it is quite uncommon. In addition, the user community needs integrated tools to allow automatic correction of misspellings in taxonomic names to ensure comprehensive and thorough responses to search queries.

They begin to fill a long-standing and, given the land management aims of planning, rather basic gap in the planning data record and have the potential to change {{the way in which we}} approach land-use studies and policy monitoring.

In the analysis of LUCS data it is essential that an appropriate allowance is made for both the temporal and the spatial incidence of survey lags.

We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications for land-use theory in general. ...|$|E
