500|$|Born Esham Attica Smith on September 20, 1973 in Long Island, New York, Esham grew up {{splitting}} {{time between}} the Seven Mile neighborhood on the East side of Detroit, where {{he lived with his}} mother. He attended Osborn High School, and lived with his grandmother in New York during summers. He studied piano, guitar, and trombone in high school, and listened to artists such as Sugar Hill Gang, Run-DMC, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss. Esham began to write original lyrics, and was encouraged by his older brother, James H. Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, [...] "He felt like I had a dope flow, and he thought I could bring something new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn't really a [...] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating what <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> doing." [...] In the second grade, Esham met Champtown, who was also an aspiring rapper. The two performed together at open mic events Seafood Bay. In one occurrence, Champtown and Esham were forced to rap for a drug dealer at gunpoint.|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{became famous}} for his voice work in the ongoing {{animated}} television series The Simpsons. He joined the show having previously performed only one voice-over—as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox pilot Hollywood Dog, a show he described as [...] "sort of Roger Rabbit-esque, where the dog was animated, but <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> real." [...] The first voice he performed on The Simpsons was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak, replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the character's voice. Having known him from Hollywood Dog, casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria {{and asked him to}} audition for the voice of Moe. At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on actor Al Pacino's performance in the film Dog Day Afternoon. He used the voice in his audition for The Simpsons and, {{at the request of the}} show's executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon, made the voice more [...] "gravelly". Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", dubbing Collins' voice.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

You are not false to me. <b>Everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> false; <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> cruel. Mamma will care for nobody, nobody, nobody, but her own, own, own little man;" [...] and she again kissed {{and pressed the}} baby and cried till the tears ran down over the child's face.|$|R
2500|$|This {{aggressive}} {{decision making}} {{was typical of}} Wilkes' command style. [...] On one hand, he was recognized as [...] "a distinguished explorer, author, and naval officer." [...] On the other, he [...] "had {{a reputation as a}} stubborn, overzealous, impulsive, and sometimes insubordinate officer." [...] Treasury officer George Harrington had warned Seward about Wilkes: [...] "He will give us trouble. He has a superabundance of self-esteem and a deficiency of judgment. When he commanded his great exploring mission he court-martialed nearly all his officers; he alone was right, <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wight played {{basketball}} and American football {{in high school}} at Wyman King Academy in Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina. He was a standout center for the basketball team and a tight end for the football team. He quit football after his freshman year, because of disputes with the coach. He continued to support the team by joining the cheerleading squad as a sophomore, partly from spite. He later called it [...] "the greatest experience of my life... <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> riding a bus with sweaty equipment and I'm in a van with seven cheerleaders who are all learning about life". The van (a Ford Econoline) was driven by [...] "a mom who was deaf in her right ear and chain-smoked".|$|E
2500|$|James H. Smith {{founded the}} label in 1988 with his younger brother, Esham, a rapper. According to Esham, {{by the time}} he had started to rap, Detroit did not have a {{prominent}} hip hop scene. Smith states that [...] "Everybody was just imitating what <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> doing". His older brother, James, encouraged him to seriously pursue a career as a rapper because of the city's limited hip hop scene. At the age of 13, Esham released his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. In 1990, Reel Life Productions reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his heavy metal influences.|$|E

2500|$|Aaahh!!! Real Monsters {{was created}} by Gábor Csupó and Peter Gaffney, and was {{produced}} by Csupó's company Klasky Csupo, which also created the animated shows The Simpsons, [...] Rugrats and Duckman on USA Network. Before the final title was chosen, which took over 5 years, the series had the working titles Monsters and Real Monsters. The show was conceived after Csupó {{and his wife and}} creative partner Arlene Klasky were approached by the network Nickelodeon to create a follow-up series to Rugrats. Csupó was inspired to write a show about monsters because his own young children loved them. He also said he knew Nickelodeon would not want a series about human characters because <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> pitching shows about animals. Csupó drew some sketches of possible monsters {{on a piece of paper}} and successfully pitched the idea to the network: [...] "I wanted them silly and not too skillful– and the idea worked." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Dickinson's return to writing, {{the album was}} also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they [...] "spent more time checking up on each other to see what <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> up to, {{just to make sure}} the story fitted properly and went somewhere." [...] To make sure each song fit with the record's concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states [...] "didn't make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I've done on this album than any I've done before. But the stuff we all started coming up with, once we'd agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged 'concept' album, really startled me. It was so much better than anything we'd done in ages..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Benedict XV was {{a careful}} {{innovator}} by Vatican standards. He {{was known to}} carefully consider all novelties before he ordered their implementation, then insisting on them to the fullest. He rejected clinging to the past for the past's sake with the words [...] "Let us live {{in the present and}} not in history." [...] His relation to secular Italian powers was reserved yet positive, avoiding conflict and tacitly supporting the Royal Family of Italy. Yet, like Pius IX and Leo XIII, he also protested against interventions of State authorities in internal Church affairs. Pope Benedict was not considered a man of letters. He did not publish educational or devotional books. His encyclicals are pragmatic and down-to-earth, intelligent yet at times far-sighted. He remained neutral during the battles of the [...] "Great War," [...] when almost <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> claiming [...] "sides." [...] Like that of Pius XII during World War II, his neutrality was questioned by all sides then and even to this day.|$|E
