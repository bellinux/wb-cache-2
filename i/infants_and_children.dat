There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words.

5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} public health spending <b>and</b> probability of <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> death in India. Methods: We used data from the three rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in India during 1992 - 93, 1998 - 99 and 2005 - 06 to {{investigate the}} association between public health spending <b>and</b> probability of <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> death. We used data from the birth history of three NFHS rounds to create state-year panels of births, <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> deaths, state-level public finance variables, food grain production, household and individual variables for the period 1980 - 2005. Two-stage probit regression model is used to investigate the association. State-level per capita gross fiscal deficit is used as an instrument for estimating two-stage probit model. Findings: Findings suggest association between public health spending <b>and</b> <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> mortality in India. A 10 % increase in per capita public health spending is likely to reduce the probability of <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> deaths by 0 • 005 (95 % CI: 0 • 003, 0 • 007) and 0 • 003 (95 % CI: 0 • 002, 0 • 004) respectively. The second and third lags of public health spending were also statistically significant. Other factors affecting <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> death were sex of the child, birth order, mother’s age at birth of the index <b>child,</b> mother’s schooling <b>and</b> urban-rural residence. Interpretation: Public health spending was associated with probability of <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> death in India.

Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five.

Although the monograph was primarily concerned with the removal of children from their homes it was also used for political purposes to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen.

In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available.

This paper reports on progress in developing a summary measure of <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> feeding practices that addresses the following two challenges: <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> feeding is multidimensional, and appropriate practices vary by age of the child. Much previous {{research in the area}} of <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> feeding has focused on single practices over a narrow age range and so has not addressed the determinants and impact of adequate or optimal <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> feeding. Using data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, an <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> feeding index is constructed, summarizing a range of key practices, including breastfeeding, bottle use, feeding frequency, and diet diversity. Because it provides agespecific scoring and incorporates various practices, the index is a useful analytic tool. The index is associated with an indicator of child growth (height-for-age) in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Examination of individual indicators shows that this association is driven by a strong positive association between one componentdiet diversityand height-for-age. Further work is required to establish the nature of the relationship between <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> feeding indicators, nutrient adequacy, growth, and other outcomes. But because it can be used to illustrate the association between a set of recommended practices and growth, the index may serve as a communication tool with policymakers. iii Simulations show that the index accurately reflects an averaging of changes in individual component practices, and so it may also be of use to program managers who seek a summary measure for assessing p [...] ...|$|R
