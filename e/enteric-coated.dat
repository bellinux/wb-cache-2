25|$|Omeprazole is {{available}} as tablets and capsules (containing omeprazole or omeprazole magnesium) in strengths of 10, 20, 40, {{and in some}} markets 80mg; and as a powder (omeprazole sodium) for intravenous injection. Most oral omeprazole preparations are <b>enteric-coated,</b> due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This is most commonly achieved by formulating <b>enteric-coated</b> granules within capsules, <b>enteric-coated</b> tablets, and the multiple-unit pellet system (MUPS).

25|$|Most oral PPI {{preparations}} are <b>enteric-coated,</b> due to {{the rapid}} degradation of the drugs in the acidic conditions of the stomach. For example omeprazole is unstable in acid with a half-life of 2 min at pH 1–3, but is significantly more stable at pH 7 (half-life ca. 20 h).|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin {{is easily}} inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally {{administered}} formulations are given as either <b>enteric-coated</b> or more-stable salts or esters, such as erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due {{to the high}} concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported {{to the site of}} infection, where, during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of erythromycin are released.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is {{available}} as delayed-release capsules in the United States or as delayed-release tablets in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada (containing esomeprazole magnesium) in strengths of 20 and 40mg, as delayed-release capsules in the United States (containing esomeprazole strontium) in a 49.3mg strength (delivering {{the equivalent of}} 40mg of esomeprazole, and as esomeprazole sodium for intravenous injection/infusion.

50|$|Rabeprazole {{is a novel}} {{benzimidazole}} compound on market, since 1999 in USA.

It is available as <b>enteric-coated</b> tablets.|$|E
50|$|Oral {{absorption}} of didanosine is fairly low (42%) but rapid. Food substantially reduces didanosine bioavailability, {{and the drug}} should be administered on an empty stomach. The half-life in plasma is only 1.5 hours, but in the intracellular environment more than 12 hours. An <b>enteric-coated</b> formulation is now marketed as well. Elimination is predominantly renal; the kidneys actively secrete didanosine, the amount being 20% of the oral dose.|$|E

50|$|Omeprazole was {{the first}} PPI on the market, in 1988. It is a 1:1 {{racemate}} drug with a backbone structure of timoprazole, but substituted with two methoxy and two methyl groups. One of the methoxy group is at position 6 of the bensoimidazole and the other at position 4 of the pyridine and the methyl groups are at position 3 and 5 of the pyridine.Omeprazole is available as <b>enteric-coated</b> tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, powder for oral suspensions and powder for intravenous injection.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the rise}} of {{mechanization}} and mass production, new modes of medication-delivery, among them the tablet (1884), the <b>enteric-coated</b> pill (1884) and the gelatin capsule (first produced {{on a large scale}} in 1875 by Parke, Davis & Company, Detroit) became practicable. By 1900, most pharmacies stocked the shelves, partially or predominantly, with medicines prefabricated en masse by the growing pharmaceutical industry instead of custom-produced by individual pharmacisti, and the traditional role of the scientifically trained pharmacist to produce medicines increasingly eroded. This shift worried many, raising concerns of quality control, professional irrelevance and more. William Procter lamented that, [...] "If the pharmacist becomes a mere dispenser of medicines, 'he relapses into a simple shopkeeper.'” ...|$|E
5000|$|According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), [...] "ibuprofen can {{interfere}} with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin, potentially rendering aspirin less effective when used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention." [...] Allowing sufficient time between doses of ibuprofen and immediate-release (IR) aspirin can avoid this problem. The recommended elapsed time between a dose of ibuprofen and a dose of aspirin depends on which is taken first. It would be 30 minutes or more for ibuprofen taken after IR aspirin, and eight hours or more for ibuprofen taken before IR aspirin. However, this timing cannot be recommended for <b>enteric-coated</b> aspirin. But, if ibuprofen is taken only occasionally without the recommended timing, {{the reduction of the}} cardioprotection and stroke prevention of a daily aspirin regimen is minimal.|$|E
50|$|Each anti-convulsant agent has {{a unique}} side-effect profile. Valproic acid can {{frequently}} cause sedation or gastrointestinal upset, which can be minimized by giving the related drug divalproex, which is available in an <b>enteric-coated</b> tablet. These side effects tend to disappear over time. According to studies conducted in Finland in patients with epilepsy, valproate may increase testosterone levels in teenage girls and produce polycystic ovary syndrome in women who began taking the medication before age 20. Increased testosterone can lead to polycystic ovary syndrome with irregular or absent menses, obesity, and abnormal growth of hair. Therefore, young female patients taking valproate should be monitored carefully by a physician. Excessive levels of valproate can lead to impaired liver function, and liver enzymes and serum valproate level, with a target of 50-125 µg/L, should be monitored periodically.|$|E

50|$|In {{the higher}} doses {{used to treat}} osteoporosis, sodium {{fluoride}} can cause pain in the legs and incomplete stress fractures when the doses are too high; it also irritates the stomach, sometimes so severely as to cause ulcers. Slow-release and <b>enteric-coated</b> versions of sodium fluoride do not have gastric side effects in any significant way, and have milder and less frequent complications in the bones. In the lower doses used for water fluoridation, the only clear adverse effect is dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of children's teeth during tooth development; this is mostly mild and is unlikely to represent any real effect on aesthetic appearance or on public health. Fluoride was known to enhance the measurement of bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, {{but it was not}} effective for vertebral fractures and provoked more non vertebral fractures.|$|E
