Numerous definitions of fiction text, often associated only with method of creating a fiction text, in particular with principles of its form and structure or the language and style, are certainly an evidence of the interest aroused by the nature of fiction text. If we consider a fiction text as a single whole, we can note on the one hand that it is an embodiment of the content expressed by certain (linguistic) signs, i. e. its nature lies in a sign system of coordinates.

40|$|Abstract — Injuries due to falls {{are among}} the leading causes of {{hospitalization}} in elderly persons, often resulting in a rapid decline in functionality and death. Rapid response can improve the patients outcome, but this is often lacking when the injured person lives alone {{and the nature of}} the injury complicates calling for help. This paper presents an alert system for fall detection using common commercially available electronic devices to both detect the fall and alert authorities. We use a common Android-based smart phone with an integrated triaxial accelerometer. Data from the accelerometer is evaluated with several threshold based algorithms and position data to determine a fall. The threshold is adaptive based on user provided parameters such as: height, weight, and level of activity. These variables also adapt to the unique movements that a cellphone experiences as opposed to similar system which require users to mount accelerometers to their chest or trunk. If a fall is suspected a notification is raised requiring the user’s response. If the user does not respond, the system alerts prespecified, social contacts with an <b>informational</b> <b>message</b> via SMS. When a contact responds with an incoming call the system commits an audible notification, automatically answers the call, and enables speakerphone. If a social contact confirms a fall, an appropriate emergency service is alerted. Our system provides a realizable, cost effective solution to fall detection using a simple graphical interface while not overwhelming the user with uncomfortable sensors. I...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, in {{transformation}} {{of the realm of}} political communication, a more important part is given to the so-called «new social media». Previously, political communication was seen as a process of production, dissemination and perception of political information for the purpose of achieving a consent regarding one or another political action. Additionally, communication appeared as a mechanism of one-way information exchange. Under new conditions, political communication becomes a tool of ensuring the process of preparation, making and implementing political decisions. In a modern understanding, an <b>informational</b> <b>message</b> is built by means of specific cooperation between communicants. In this regard, information sources appear as a specific base for state actions. This paper deals with old (traditional) and new social media and lists several characteristics that help distinguish these media. It also shows how authorities and representatives of political opposition can use social media to achieve their political purposes. This article analyses not only benefits but also drawbacks in the application of new information technologies in politics, considering a problem of manipulation as a main disadvantage. It also compares the use of social networks by authorities in Russia and abroad. Because of differences in political culture, social networks are not popular with Russian authorities. However, the number of social networking users among Russian politicians is increasing year by year. Moreover, the most popular network with them is Twitter.

This study aims to test the relative effectiveness of testimonials compared to simple <b>informational</b> health <b>messages</b> presented through different modalities, and to the recipients with different levels of involvement. Results of the three independent experiments demonstrate that testimonials are more persuasive when presented through the audio mode rather than when presented through the written mode. Also, the <b>informational</b> <b>messages</b> are more persuasive when perceived by individuals characterized by high rather than low involvement and high rather than low need-for-cognition. The results are explained in terms of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). The interactive effect of transportation (Green & Brock, 2004) and involvement on persuasion is further examined. The findings help in developing the more effective ways of computer-based health communication. The highest level of efficiency can be achieved if the appropriate media modality and message format are used for recipients with certain initial involvement or need-for-cognition. by Julia Braverman.
