5|$|On 26 April 2013, Mercedes goes to find Jacqui in Alicante {{where the}} two had visited when they were younger. Mercedes finds Jacqui working as a barmaid. At first Jacqui is not happy to see her but the two sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a conversation. Mercedes admits that at first the {{kidnapping}} was a scam {{to get back at}} Paul Browning (Joe Thompson) for supposedly cheating on her and apologizes to Jacqui. At first Jacqui is furious at Mercedes for this and yells at her causing them both to start crying. After insulting Mercedes Jacqui forgives her and tells her that she love her. Jacqui is last seen relaxing by the pool on a sun lounger drinking a cocktail with Mercedes whilst they talk and say their final goodbyes.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham {{turns it off}} to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up the balloon. She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they should all settle <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that the balloon has burst. Graham and Si take the balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E

25|$|This {{campaign}} {{also demonstrated}} that the KMT was determined {{to carry on the}} fight and defeat the Japanese. The British and Americans realised that, as long as the Chinese continued their War of Resistance, the Japanese Army would be basically completely tied <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> almost no power to help fascist Nazi Germany. As a result, Britain and America started loaning large amounts of money to China. This was certainly a great help to the KMT's determination to continue resisting the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads wear <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> to be replaced. And {{before they}} wear out completely, their {{position}} {{may need to}} be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E

500|$|On March 3, 2009, a remix {{version of}} the song, {{entitled}} [...] "Turnin' Me Off", featuring new verses from Hilson and Lil Wayne, and an additional verse by T-Pain, surfaced online. In the remix, Hilson takes jabs at two unnamed female entertainers. Referred to as [...] "the remix heard round the industry", media rumored that Hilson was taking shots at Beyoncé Knowles and Ciara, with lines like [...] "You can dance, she can sing but need to move it to the left", possibly referencing Ciara's acclaimed dancing ability, and Beyoncé's hit [...] "Irreplaceable." [...] The lyrics also point at other possible shots taken toward the artists, such as Hilson stating one needs to [...] "go sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> babies" [...] and points out several songs written for the other. A BET columnist wrote, [...] "critics couldn't fathom the purpose or reasoning behind the malicious gesture", while a writer for BET Sound Off noted that if Hilson or her management intended to engage in this, {{that it would be}} [...] "career suicide." ...|$|E
500|$|Like all penguin species, emperor {{penguins}} have streamlined {{bodies to}} minimize drag while swimming, and wings {{that are more}} like stiff, flat flippers. The tongue is equipped with rear-facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught. Males and females are similar in size and colouration. The adult has deep black dorsal feathers, covering the head, chin, throat, back, dorsal part of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper mandible of the [...] long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be pink, orange or lilac. In juveniles, the auricular patches, chin and throat are white, while its bill is black. Emperor penguin chicks are typically covered with silver-grey <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> black heads and white masks. A chick with all-white plumage was found in 2001, but was {{not considered to be}} an albino as it did not have pink eyes. Chicks weigh around [...] after hatching, and fledge when they reach about 50% of adult weight.|$|E

500|$|Hollows can be [...] {{deep and}} [...] wide, with {{a base of}} woodchips. A chance felling of a {{eucalypt}} {{known to have been}} used as a nesting tree near Scottsdale in northeastern Tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made, yielding a hollow measuring [...] high by [...] wide at the mouth, and at least [...] deep, in a tree which measured [...] in diameter below the hollow. Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding, which involves peeling or scraping off wood shavings from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs. Gum leaves are occasionally added as well. The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule. The first egg averages around 47 or 48mm long and 37mm in diameter (2 × 1.4in). The second egg is around 2mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later. The female incubates the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying. She enters the hollow feet first, and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day. Later both parents help to raise the chicks. The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy. Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking; however, the incubation period in captivity is 28–31days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging. Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching, and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

2500|$|Anna Chlumsky as Amy Brookheimer: the Vice President's Chief of Staff. She credits {{herself as}} the Vice President's [...] "trouble-shooter, problem-solver, issue-mediator, doubt-remover, conscience-examiner, thought-thinker and all-round everything-doer". Amy is {{constantly}} sacrificing her own reputation to save Selina's political credibility. She {{is known to be}} uptight and overly dedicated to her career, unwilling to settle <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> children, much to the dismay of her family. She has romantic history with Dan, and may still have feelings for him. Amy becomes Selina's campaign manager during her presidential run, but resigns {{as a result of the}} brief appointment of an equivocating, yet omnipresent, old friend of Selina's to the campaign team. She rejoins the Meyer team when a tie in the general election leads to a statewide recount in Nevada. Chlumsky previously portrayed a similar character, Liza Weld, in Iannucci's 2009 film, In the Loop. She has received five consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations for her performance.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{short-term}} aging needs of wine {{is a period}} where the wine is considered [...] "sick" [...] due to the trauma and volatility of the bottling experience. During bottling the wine is exposed to some oxygen which causes a domino effect of chemical reactions with various components of the wine. The {{time it takes for}} the wine to settle <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> the oxygen fully dissolve and integrate with the wine is considered its period of [...] "bottle shock". During this time the wine could taste drastically different from how it did prior to bottling or how it will taste after the wine has settled. While many modern bottling lines try to treat the wine as gently as possible and utilize inert gases to minimize the amount of oxygen exposure, all wine goes through some period of bottle shock. The length of this period will vary with each individual wine.|$|E

2500|$|The unruliness of {{the crowd}} was readily {{apparent}} in 1974-75 as Australia beat England at {{home for the first}} time in 16 years they were more excitable than previously. [...] "In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'" [...] and the MCG was compared to the Colosseum or the World Cup. Australian drinking laws allowed alcohol to be sold in the grounds even when it was banned outside and in the heat many spectators became drunk. In the Third Test at Melbourne two supporters climbed the picket fence and reached the wicket before Brooks decided to physically remove one, which damaged the wicket. At Sydney in the Fourth Test Rick McCosker was disturbed by the rumpus from the notorious Sydney Hill, its members pelted Tony Greig with food and cans (some containing urine) and later did the same to the scoreboard. One full can hit Greig on the back, and Brooks had to intervene to calm them <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> the field cleared of rubbish before play could resume.|$|E
2500|$|In a fully upright stance, {{the boxer}} stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a {{half-step}} {{in front of}} the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches {{in front of the}} face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the [...] "textbook" [...] stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.|$|E

Hessian sacks containing asbestos fibre were still present, and the yard was filled with 'a few hundred tonnes' of blue asbestos waste mixed with soil. R.D. Lunt, T's Safety and Environment manager, wrote of the factory basement: [...] "Every nook and cranny has asbestos fibre in it". T contributed £15,000 towards the clean-up of the factory, and claimed they were doing so out of [...] "a moral, not a legal responsibility" [...] to do so. The surrounding houses and buildings {{were not included in}} this operation, and Leeds City Council and T [...] "agreed to keep the whole matter 'low-key' if approached by the media," [...] while a T internal memo stated [...] "The Principal Inspector of Factories and the Assistant Director of Environmental Health are anxious to play this <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> given us considerable support." ...|$|E
