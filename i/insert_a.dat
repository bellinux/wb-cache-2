5|$|Several {{manufacturers}} market prepackaged cricothyrotomy kits, which enable one to {{use either}} a wire-guided percutaneous dilational (Seldinger) technique, or the classic surgical technique to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> polyvinylchloride catheter through the cricothyroid membrane. The kits may be stocked in hospital emergency departments and operating suites, {{as well as}} ambulances and other selected pre-hospital settings.|$|E
5|$|Surgery, when {{considered}} {{necessary for}} {{diseases of the}} heart, can take place via an open operation or via small guidewires inserted via peripheral arteries ("percutaneous coronary intervention"). Percutaneous coronary intervention is usually used {{in the context of}} an acute coronary syndrome, and may be used to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> stent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E

30|$|Inserting new nodes {{occurs in}} three general cases: <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> node before the leftmost node, <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> node after the {{rightmost}} node, and <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> node between any two nodes at any position. We review {{each of these}} cases and explain how the proposed method overcomes such cases.|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{thinking}} that the FBI agent {{is part of a}} government conspiracy, Crump forces Mulder at gunpoint to drive, infuriating him along the way with antisemitic slurs. Eventually, Mulder and Crump make amends and attempt to work out a solution before it is too late. Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> needle into Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure. Unfortunately, when Scully arrives, Crump has already died.|$|E
5|$|June {{was signed}} by the Houston Texans on April 4, 2009 to a one-year {{contract}} worth $1.5million. He was expected to compete with Xavier Adibi and Zac Diles for the weakside linebacker position. However, on August 20, June broke his forearm during morning practice, had surgery to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> plate that afternoon and was expected to miss 68 weeks. June had previously missed some training camp time due to a knee injury. On August 28, June was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to his injured forearm. He was released with an injury settlement on September 3, making him a free agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} {{depends on its}} ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E

30|$|Difficulty <b>inserting</b> <b>an</b> {{intravenous}} catheter because of redundant skin and hypertrichosis on the limbs {{would be a}} common problem in general anesthesia for patients with BSS. In our case, senior anesthesiologists tried to <b>insert</b> <b>an</b> additional {{intravenous catheter}}, but the attempts ended in failure. It seems to be essential that a pediatric anesthetic expert <b>insert</b> <b>an</b> intravenous catheter before the induction of general anesthesia to avoid slow induction in patients with BSS.|$|R
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the early}} part of 2006, Massaro became the victim of a series of attacks from Mickie James. At the Royal Rumble, James {{defeated}} Massaro with then Women's Champion, Trish Stratus, as the special guest referee. Massaro got her revenge one week later by pinning James in the rematch on Raw. During the February 20, 2006 edition of Raw, however, Massaro suffered a fractured left fibula while being eliminated from the Women's Battle Royal, and her feud with James was cut short. She underwent surgery to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> five-inch metal plate and eight screws into her leg. During her recovery, Massaro still occasionally appeared on Raw as part of the Stratus/James feud, albeit in a non-active role. Massaro returned on the March 20, 2006 episode of Raw, being kidnapped by James to lure Stratus in to saving her but James was successful and attacked Stratus.|$|E
5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E

5|$|Although 1 ATF {{was well}} placed {{to deny the}} communists the use of its AO, it was {{increasingly}} obvious {{that there was little}} role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of Viet Cong prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone; two Viet Cong were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of Viet Cong; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and were contacted. Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E
5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of the Titans. The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of the Titans, in which the testers were found to be reluctant to leave the titans behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also a source of inspiration for Crash: Mind over Mutant, having such wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full camera control was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and to avoid having to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature in the finished game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E

5|$|Registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam) shirks his {{responsibilities}} by excessively delegating to Oliver; to his dismay, Connie appoints him as Oliver's mentor. Oliver pushes himself {{too far in}} an attempt to impress Greg, which earns the senior doctor a reprimand for leaving him unsupervised. Oliver tries to earn back Greg's respect, but panics while attempting to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> chest drain, and has to be rescued by ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). He invites her for a drink as thanks, but when Penny discovers that Frieda has romantic feelings for him, Oliver cancels as he does not reciprocate them. Oliver's confidence is further damaged when he mishandles a case, which results in a mother leaving her son to die alone. He moves back to the AAU, where he is shaken by an encounter with the boy's mother, which causes him to panic and embarrass himself in theatre. Penny's career begins to improve, and Oliver resents her when she is given registrar duties for a shift. Having realised that he is close to failing his F2 year, Oliver implicates Penny in a serious surgical error of his own doing, but is caught by registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola).|$|E
5|$|The script of {{the film}} went through several changes during filming. Due to the length {{of the film}}, scenes from a side-story {{involving}} the relationship between the character Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to <b>insert</b> <b>a</b> mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play. Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.|$|E
