5|$|In the 1912 presidential election, Lane {{supported}} Democratic {{candidate and}} New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, though {{he declined to}} make campaign speeches on Wilson's behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner. Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner {{spent much of the}} day with Colonel Edward M. House, the President-elect's advisor, who would {{play a key role in}} selecting Cabinet appointees. The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but he indicated he was happy in his present position. After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked <b>House</b> <b>if</b> he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary. House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere. Colonel House did not immediately recommend Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page.|$|E
5|$|William Edward Forster {{argued that}} a Coercion Act—which would punish those participated in events like those at Lough Mask, and would include the {{suspension}} of Habeas Corpus—should be introduced before any Land Act. Gladstone eventually accepted this argument. When Forster attempted to introduce the Protection of Person and Property Act 1881, Parnell and other Land League MP's attempted to obstruct its passage with tactics such as filibustering. One such filibuster lasted for 41 hours. Eventually, the Speaker of the house intervened, and a measure was introduced whereby the Speaker could control the <b>house</b> <b>if</b> there was a three to one majority in favour of the business being urgent. This {{was the first time}} that a check was placed on a debate in a British parliament. The act was passed on 28 February 1881. There was a negative reaction to the passing of the act in both England and Ireland. In England, the Anti-Coercion Association was established, which was a precursor to the Labour Party.|$|E

25|$|In some versions, if a {{lock down}} occurs, {{the first person}} to call a lock-down gains the other players bones and adds the amount of the pips to his <b>house.</b> <b>If</b> a person who calls rocks after a call of lock-down or domino finds the number of pips a player called is incorrect, those points become his.|$|E

25|$|As an {{additional}} measure, {{and as a}} forerunner to fire insurance, rich merchants would prepay wood retailers for the materials needed for building a <b>house.</b> <b>If</b> their businesses burned down, then after the debris was removed, the prepaid materials could be immediately claimed for reconstruction, so that the business could resume within a short time.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} a sukkah {{under a tree}} is as invalid as a sukkah within a <b>house.</b> <b>If</b> one sukkah is erected above another, the upper one is valid, but the lower is invalid. Rabbi Judah said that {{if there are no}} {{occupants}} in the upper one, then the lower one is valid.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the House of Councilors {{rejected}} the contentious postal privatization bills. Koizumi previously {{made it clear}} that he would dissolve the lower <b>house</b> <b>if</b> the bill failed to pass. The Democratic Party, while expressing support for the privatization, made a tactical vote against the bill. Fifty-one LDP members also either voted against the bills or abstained.|$|E

25|$|It is because, {{a nation}} which shared blood and history is clear, {{and just like}} my body can't be another's, the reason that a certain nation can't become another {{is the same as}} {{brothers}} living in the same <b>house.</b> <b>If</b> two gather and become one, one would be higher and the other lower, so it becomes a basic problem that one orders from above, and the other obeys from below.|$|E
25|$|However, {{he never}} did. Farrakhan and newly elected congressman Charles Rangel, {{who had come}} to the scene, warned them that the crowd outside, already {{throwing}} rocks, assaulting reporters present and attempting to damage police property, was beyond their control. Seedman claimed they offered to have the mosque worshippers show up at the local precinct <b>house</b> <b>if</b> the police left the scene; Rangel has said that he could not make such a promise, and did not.|$|E

25|$|Like many agelenids, barn funnel weavers {{are very}} precise in their movements. Instead of {{following}} a continuous gait pattern, they usually move in short intervals, stopping {{several times before}} deciding where to head next. Males will wander aimlessly around the <b>house</b> <b>if</b> undisturbed, but will soon switch to the running interval if prey or threat are spotted. Their legs are perfectly fit for walking (with tarsi bent outward on the tips) and spiders can run over quite long distances in both situations.|$|E
25|$|Whitwell's aunt Elizabeth, Countess of Portsmouth {{agreed to}} leave him her {{interest}} in Audley End <b>House</b> <b>if</b> he changed his surname to Griffin: he did so in 1749, by Act of Parliament, becoming John Griffin Griffin.

25|$|Muslim jurists have {{debated whether}} and when coerced {{confession}} and coerced witnesses are acceptable. In the Ottoman Criminal Code, the executive officials {{were allowed to}} use torture only if the accused had a bad reputation and there were already indications of his guilt, such as when stolen goods were found in his <b>house,</b> <b>if</b> {{he was accused of}} grievous bodily harm by the victim or if a criminal during investigation mentioned him as an accomplice.
