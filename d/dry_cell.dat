5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7.|$|E

Chlorella protothecoides CS- 41 was chosen from the seven strains for further investigation due to its higher productivities of both biomass and lutein. The maximal biomass concentration and lutein content of C. protothecoides cultivated heterotrophically with 9 g L- 1 glucose in a 3. 7 -L fermentor were respectively 4. 6 g <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> L- 1 and 4. 60 mg lutein g- 1 <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> on Basal medium, and 4. 0 g <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> L- 1 and 4. 36 mg lutein g- 1 <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> on Kuhl medium.

25|$|A common <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> is the zinc–carbon battery, {{sometimes}} called the dry Leclanché cell, with a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts, {{the same as the}} alkaline battery (since both use the same zinc–manganese dioxide combination). A standard <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> comprises a zinc anode, usually {{in the form of a}} cylindrical pot, with a carbon cathode in the form of a central rod. The electrolyte is ammonium chloride in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide, the latter acting as a depolariser. In some designs, the ammonium chloride is replaced by zinc chloride.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} the alteration of cell permeability toward fluoroquinolones in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, {{which is a}} major quinolone-resistance mechanism along with the alteration of DNA gyrase in gram-negative bacteria. The prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant N gonorrhoeae strains is rapidly increasing in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS [...] The uptake and accumulation of norfloxacin by gonococcal cells, including six clinical and five World Health Organization (WHO) reference strains, were measured. Of the six clinical strains, two were highly resistant to norfloxacin (MIC 8. 0 and 4. 0 micrograms/ml), two were moderately resistant (MIC 1. 0 and 0. 5 microgram/ml), and two were sensitive (MIC 0. 063 and 0. 004 microgram/ml). All five WHO reference strains were sensitive to norfloxacin (MIC < or = 0. 001 to 0. 063 microgram/ml). RESULTS [...] Mean initial norfloxacin uptake in the four resistant strains (104 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> was significantly lower than that in the seven sensitive strains (158 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> (p < 0. 05). The mean uptake after 20 minutes was also significantly lower in the four resistant strains (130 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> than in the seven sensitive strains (194 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> (p < 0. 05). However, {{there was no significant}} difference in mean norfloxacin accumulation after 20 minutes between the four resistant strains (26 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> and the seven sensitive strains (36 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells).</b> The accumulation of norfloxacin after 20 minutes was almost zero in two of the four resistant strains, while the remaining two strains accumulated norfloxacin as well as the sensitive strains. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings suggest that alteration of bacterial cell permeability is a quinolone-resistance mechanism in N gonorrhoeae isolated in Japan, and that this bacteria may exhibit other mechanisms such as alteration of DNA gyrase...|$|R

25|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> {{form was}} used to power early telephones—usually from an {{adjacent}} wooden box affixed to the wall—before telephones could draw power from the telephone line itself. The Leclanché cell could not provide a sustained current for very long. In lengthy conversations, the battery would run down, rendering the conversation inaudible. This was because certain chemical reactions in the cell increased the internal resistance and, thus, lowered the voltage. These reactions reversed themselves when the battery was left idle, so it was good only for intermittent use.|$|E
25|$|Rural areas, {{as well as}} the {{smallest}} towns, had manual service and signaling was accomplished with magneto telephones, which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. <b>Dry</b> <b>cell</b> batteries, normally two large N°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter.

The mass resolution obtained by the ION-TOF V instrument is sensitive to height variations, and since the hydrated cells were taller than the <b>dried</b> <b>cells</b> (AFM micrographs, data not shown), the mass resolution in the spectra of the FH cells may have been reduced compared to the flatter, dehydrated cells.|$|R

First published April 7, 2010; doi: 10. 1152 /jn. 01043. 2009. The most favored model of humidity transduction views the cuticular wall of insect hygroreceptive sensilla as a hygromechanical transducer. Hygroscopic swelling or shrinking alters {{the geometry of}} the wall, deforming the dendritic membranes of the moist and <b>dry</b> <b>cells.</b> The small size the sensilla and their position surrounded by elevated structures creates technical difficulties to mechanically stimulate them by direct contact. The present study investigated hygroreceptors on the antennae of the cockroach and the stick insect. Accurately controlled, homogeneous mechanical input was delivered by modulating air pressure. Both the moist and <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> responded not only to changes in air pressure {{but also in the}} opposite direction, as observed during changes in air humidity. The moist cell&# 39;s excitatory response to increasing humidity and increasing air pressure implies that swelling of the hygroscopic cuticle compresses the dendrites, and the dry cell&# 39;s excitatory response to decreasing humidity and decreasing air pressure implies that shrinking of the hygroscopic cuticle expands the dendrites. The moist and <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> of the stick insect are more sensitive to pressure changes than those of the cockroach, but the {{responses to}} air pressure are generally weaker than to humidity. Therefore the hygroreceptive sensilla differ in their physical properties and constitutions. Furthermore, the mechanical parameters associated with homogeneous changes in air pressure on the sensillum surface can only partially account for the responses of the moist and <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> of both species to humidity stimulation...|$|R
