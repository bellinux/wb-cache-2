This mixed-method study investigated variables that influenced rehabilitation outcome of former clients of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) who are deaf. Quantitative data was collected from the Federal Case Services Record (CSR) 911 on 411 former clients who are deaf and whose case files were closed between the years of 1990 and 1995. The quantitative aspect of this design used descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, chi-square test of the independence of categorical variables, and Fisher's exact test to examine and explore variables related to client demographics (i. e., disability, secondary disability, gender, race, marital status, income at referral, age), VR services received (i. e., diagnostic, physical restoration, training, counseling and guidance, job referral, placement, transportation, maintenance, and all other services), and closure information (i. e., status 26 or status 28). Significant associations were found between case <b>file</b> <b>closure</b> status and age, marital status, race, and work status at application. These findings were supported by qualitative data. Qualitative data was collected on 10 of the original 411 former clients who are deaf through personal interviews using the preferred language of the clients. Qualitative data provided information on the perceptions of former clients' who are deaf about the services received through VR, the outcome of the services received, and consequent impact of services on their quality of life. Overarching themes associated with post-secondary education, communication, personal support, job placement, self-determination, and independence were prevalent in the interviews with participants. The findings from quantitative and qualitative data suggest that VR outcome and clients' perceptions of outcome were an accurate measure of employment success or lack of success in the VR system. All participants associated personal success with a positive quality of life. Ability to achieve a positive quality of life, however, differed with the education and functioning level of clients. Clients who had post-secondary education, family support, communication skills, and independent living skills assumed responsibility for their successes or failures, whereas clients without these variables attributed responsibility for success or failure to VR services. Overall, a positive quality of life was easier to achieve for clients who are deaf and educated. Further research is needed to address the vocational and personal needs of clients who are deaf and whose functioning level is negatively influenced by lack of post-secondary education, family support, communication skills, and independent living skills...|$|E

Hier sind letztlich die aus Bewertungsverfahren hervorgegangenen Bestandsübersichten und Findmittel erforderlich, die wie Kompass und Landkarte dem Nutzer Orientierung bieten und daher zu Recht das Bewertungsgeschäft in den Mittelpunkt archivischer Kernaufgaben rücken. Dieser Befund verdeutlicht die These des vorliegenden Beitrags, dass eine grundsätzliche Auseinandersetzung mit dem Themenkreis der Bewertung unumgänglich ist. Als unerlässliche Grundlage hierzu wird eine Bestandsaufnahme zur Praxis der Schriftgutverwaltung und der Bewertung in den nordrheinischen Kommunen angesehen. Mittels Fragebogen beschreiben die rheinischen Kommunalarchivare ihre Situation und liefern zugleich die für eine differenzierte Analyse der Bewertungspraxis in rheinischen Kommunalarchiven notwendigen Daten. Die Daten beziehen sich auf 1662 Sozialhilfeaktenbänden aus dem Zwischenarchiv der Gemeinde Liblar. Das betreffende Schriftgut ist in den Jahren von 1950 bis 1999 entstanden. Als Stichprobenverfahren wurde eine Klumpenstichprobe nach Buchstaben gewählt. Grundsätzlich stehen drei Varianten des Umgangs und der Bewertung mit massenhaft gleichförmigen Einzelfallakten zur Diskussion. Nicht nur Stichprobenziehungen, auch Totalkassation und Vollarchivierung sind reale Handlungsoptionen. Wird jedoch eine tatsächlich repräsentative Aussagemöglichkeit als unerlässlich angesehen, so führt kein Weg an einer Zufallsauswahl nach Zufallszahlen vorbei. Über die Genauigkeit des Stichprobenresultats und damit über den Grad der Repräsentativität entscheidet dann allein die Stichprobengröße. Generell ist festzustellen, dass im Archiv repräsentative Stichprobenziehungen möglich sind. Allerdings ist ihre Durchführung u. U. mit einem höheren Aufwand verbunden, als es beispielsweise ein rein mechanisches Vorgehen nach Klumpen bei entsprechender Ordnungsstruktur erfordern würde. (ICA) 'The Archives Consulting Centre Rhineland {{discussed}} {{the problems of}} the archival assessment of 1. 662 social welfare aid files ('Sozialhilfeakten') of the small town LINDLAR. All files were registered in machine readable form. Furthermore, the letter sampling (to be handled anyway easily due to the filing) was frequently recommended for this tradition type. These two aspects seemed to speak for the use of a cluster sample (in case using the initial letter of the names). It was necessary to inform about the legal bases of the registration perception 'welfare aid'. Contents and form of the welfare aid files were analyzed. Because of the uniform law basis and a standardized administration it was agreed to standardize the formal content of the 1. 662 social welfare aid file volumes agree. The social welfare aid files are relevant, if not the only one more extensive information sources in this field and offer a broad field for women research, gerontology, unemployment research, family sociology or for political and sociological research on the municipal welfare system. To test the different sampling methods, the 1. 662 file volumes were examined for certain features such as sex of the applicant resp. of the head of household, number of the applicants, month and year of birth of the applicant resp. the head of household, year of the application, year of <b>file</b> <b>closure,</b> nationality of the applicant resp. the head of household. These variables were coded and the different samples were analyzed with help of a statistical programme. The selection of the 'true' (i. e. adequate on the research problem) sampling method presupposes an textual decision. Therefore, the aim of the storage should be well-defined. It may be decided in this respect only with a clear archival aim definition about 'right' and 'wrong', or what improve about 'useful' and 'unimportant'. The multi-stage sampling procedure does not relieve the archivist of any decision as regards content, it presupposes such one. The representativeness of a sample depends on the chosen sampling method. A representative result, oriented at the archival reality, is only guaranteed by the random sampling using random numbers taken from a table of random numbers. This random sampling is the prerequisite for a reliable evaluation of the sample. In the case of LINDLAR the decision was in favour of a random sampling (approx. 18 %, completed by a selection of extraordinary cases which consists of several file volumes). Via the actual random sample basic trends and structures can be not only shown in a better way, but their mapping is also representative. The reliable comparability of results based on the representativeness of the survey i. e. the samples as well. Moreover, the qualitative research benefits from the actual random sample, because the samples finally consists of individual cases. The archivist has three possibilities to handle uniform individual case files: full storage, total cassation and sampling. In conjunction with this, the archivist is confronted inevitably with the question of the necessity of representativeness with regard to the documentation profile. If this is looked upon as requirement, a random sample has to be drawn by using random numbers. ' (author's abstract...|$|E

50|$|During the anti-corruption movement, Bedi faced {{controversy}} {{when some}} newspapers questioned discrepancies in her past travel expenses between 2006 and 2011. In 2009, for example, Bedi was invited as {{the keynote speaker}} at a conference arranged by Aviation Industry Employees Guild. She accepted the invitation without a speaking fee, but her NGO was to be reimbursed for travel expenses. Bedi's travel agent Flywell, invoiced her hosts business class fare for air tickets, but arranged Bedi to travel in economy class. Between 2006 and 2011, there were several discrepancies in travel-related expense statements, as well as instances where she travelled {{at no cost to}} her hosts for a cause. In these cases, Bedi stated she did not personally receive or incur the disputed difference, only India Vision Foundation did, an NGO she headed. In November 2011, the Delhi Police, under directions of the additional chief metropolitan magistrate, registered an FIR - police case for cognizable offense - against Bedi for allegedly misappropriating funds through Indian Vision Foundation and other NGOs. The investigation that followed found no evidence of fraud against her or of siphoning of NGO funds for personal use, and subsequently <b>filed</b> <b>closure</b> of the case.|$|R

50|$|Just as Ashwin Kumar {{is about}} to {{conclude}} his investigation, his senior officer retires and a new CDI chief takes over. ACP Vedant, in his greed to get a promotion, starts working against Kumar. This leads to an altercation between the two officers, resulting in Kumar's suspension. On 9 July 2008, CDI hands over the case to a new probe team led by Kumar's former boss Paul (Atul Kumar), who concludes that the parents committed the murders. In the final act, rival camps (of Kumar and Paul), with opposing hypotheses, make their cases before the CDI chief. On 20 February 2011, CDI <b>files</b> a <b>closure</b> report in Ghaziabad court, naming parents as the prime suspects, but states that the evidence is insufficient to initiate prosecution. On 15 March, the Tandons file a protest plea opposing CDI's report. On 25 March, the judge rejects the closure report and makes the parents an accused in the case.

40|$|Judge Winiarski {{was unable}} {{to take part in}} the last stage of the second phase of the Nottebohm case decided by the International Court of Justice in 1956. He was thus {{prevented}} from appending to the judgement his dissenting opinion. He subsequently wrote down a statement of his views, dated 15 th June 1955, and circulated it among the members of the Court and some other jurists. The present contribution briefly presents Judge Winiarski's unpublished views against the background of the Court's judgement. Friedrich Nottebohm was German by birth domiciled in Guatemala. In 1939 he acquired the nationality of Liechtenstein. The Court found that the naturalization conferred on Nottebohm could not be invoked by Liechtenstein against Guatemala, and Liechtenstein was not entitled to exercise its protection in favour of Nottebohm against Guatemala. Consequently, the Court held that the claim submitted by Liechtenstein was inadmissible. Judge Winiarski disagreed. According to him, between 1940 and 1944 the Government of Guatemala regarded Nottebohm as a national of Liechtenstein, and — as a result — an official relationship arose between the two Governments. That relationship concerned the right of diplomatic protection. The naturalization of Nottebohm by Liechtenstein was lawful, while the Hague Court cannot pronounce on the interpretation and application of municipal law when done by the supreme organs of the country. Each country decides on the regularity of the naturalization brought under its laws, and the naturalization of Nottebohm remained within the domestic jurisdiction of Liechtenstein, though Judge Winiarski did not deny that there might be situations where naturalization was governed by treaties or other rules of international law. Nor did Nottebohm solicit the Liechtenstein nationality fraudulently. Having established that the naturalization of Nottebohm was valid in both municipal and international law Judge Winiarski criticized the Court for not admitting that Liechtenstein had the right to exercise its diplomatic protection with regard to Nottebohm. Any non-recognition of nationality and of the resulting right of diplomatic protection could only be based on reasons that follow from international law. The concept of effective nationality and the concept of the real connection with the naturalizing State were of strictly limited relevance in international law. Various factors adduced by the Court in this context were not conclusive in law. In particular, they did not follow from international law and were too subjective to find support in judicial decisions. In Judge Winiarski's opinion the Court's judgement went beyond positive law. Judge Winiarski also criticised the "unexpected formalism" of the Court in considering it unnecessary to have regard to certain new documents <b>filed</b> after the <b>closure</b> of the written proceedings. The Court thus deprived itself of the possibility of verifying some further facts that were alleged. The examination of these facts could have thrown new light on the admissibility of the claim submitted by Liechtenstein. Judge Winiarski thought that the Court should have adjourned the oral proceedings.
