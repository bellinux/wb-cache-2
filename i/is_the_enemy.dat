5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.|$|E

25|$|A player's {{promotion}} zone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> camp, {{consisting of}} the six farthest ranks that comprise the opponent's territory at setup (the original line of the opponent's chariots and beyond). If a piece moves within this promotion zone, including moves into, out of, or wholly within the zone, then that player may promote the piece {{at the end of}} the turn. (The general, sumo wrestler, and elephant do not promote, nor do pieces which have already promoted.) Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves. See the table above for what each piece promotes to. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over, revealing the name of its promoted rank.|$|E

25|$|Somali {{scholars}} have for centuries produced many notable examples of Islamic literature ranging from poetry to Hadith. With {{the adoption of}} the Latin alphabet in 1972 as the nation's standard orthography, numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels, some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim. Of these modern writers, Nuruddin Farah is probably the most celebrated. Books such as From a Crooked Rib and Links are considered important literary achievements, works that have earned Farah, among other accolades, the 1998 Neustadt International Prize for Literature. Faarax M.J. Cawl is another prominent Somali writer who is perhaps best known for his Dervish era novel, Ignorance <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> of love.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether individual snakes are immune {{to their own}} venom {{has not yet been}} definitively settled, though there is a known example of a cobra which self-envenomated, resulting in a large abscess requiring surgical intervention, but showing none of the other effects that would have proven rapidly lethal in prey species or humans. Furthermore, certain harmless species, such as the North American common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula) and the Central and South American mussurana (Clelia spp.), are proof against the venom of the crotalines which frequent the same districts, and which they are able to overpower and feed upon. The chicken snake (Spilotes pullatus) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> of the Fer-de-Lance (Bothrops caribbaeus) in St. Lucia, and it is said that in their encounters, the chicken snake is invariably the victor. Repeated experiments have shown the European grass snake (Natrix natrix) not to be affected by the bite of the European adder (Vipera berus) and the European asp (Vipera aspis), this being due to the presence, in the blood of the harmless snake, of toxic principles secreted by the parotid and labial glands, and analogous to those of the venom of these vipers. Several North American species of rat snakes as well as king snakes have proven to be immune or highly resistant to the venom of rattlesnake species. The king cobra, which does prey on cobras is said to be immune to their venom.|$|E

For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". (During {{the first week of the}} tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.)

[...] The following verse begins with, [...] "And I have no religion", which was included in the lyrics because Bono stated that he believes [...] "religion <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> of God." [...] A review of the album in Melody Maker compared the lyric [...] "Uncertainty can be a guiding light" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song to the line [...] "If you walk away, [...] I will follow" [...] from U2's 1980 single [...] "I Will Follow".

[...] The theme of moral confusion was first used in U2's song [...] "Acrobat" [...] from Achtung Baby. The coda in [...] "Zooropa" [...] features the lyric [...] "dream out loud", which Bono included as a reference to [...] "Acrobat". The phrase [...] "dream out loud" [...] was first used by Bono during the Lovetown Tour in 1989, and has appeared several times in U2's work since then.
