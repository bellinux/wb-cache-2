500|$|In {{his review}} of the seventh season for DVD Talk, Ian Jane wrote that the series [...] "is {{one of those rare}} {{animated}} shows that can be enjoyed equally as much by both adults and children." [...] He described the concept of the show as [...] "utterly ludicrous." [...] He cited the episodes [...] "SpongeBob's Last Stand" [...] and [...] "Tentacle-Vision" [...] as [...] "interesting stand outs," [...] while the episodes [...] "The Inside Job", [...] "Back To The Past", [...] "Gary in Love", and [...] "The Abrasive Side" [...] as [...] "memorable episodes this time around." [...] However, Jane said that the season is not as good as the previous seasons, writing [...] "It's not that this more recent material isn't fun, because it is, but by this point in time storylines are beginning to get a little repetitive and as such, the series doesn't seem quite as fresh and original as it once did." [...] Jane [...] "recommended" [...] the DVD set, writing [...] "This latest collection of episodes is not a high point in the series but it's still decent enough family friendly entertainment, even if <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>get</b> too repetitive for its own good." ...|$|E

You're more confident about what you're doing and having some gravitas, but at the same time, because we're having more and more expectations put on us by everyone, the complexities are increasing. Even Aussie bands that used to take five or six people on the road are now taking 11. That seems to be the magic number, even for a new starting-off band. What they are doing is working to put on the best show they can. Through that the festival needs more production, more riders, more hotel rooms, more everything.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's William Cassidy {{scored the}} Game Boy Advance version 4.5 out of 5, praising the graphics, sound, combat {{system and the}} {{differentiation}} between the controllable characters. His only complaint was that [...] "the amount of sometimes pointless wandering." [...] He called the game [...] "an engaging, action-packed adventure that admirably re-creates the captivating atmosphere of the films. The characters, the locales, and even the music draw you in and create an exciting experience that will have you playing through the entire quest several times." [...] IGN's Craig Harris scored it 8 out of 10, comparing it to Diablo and Gaunlet, and praising the co-op mode. He concluded [...] "even though The Two Towers is far from [...] "boring," [...] <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>get</b> a little repetitive in its hack-and-slash design." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it's mainly a Diablo or Gaunlet clone with story elements from the movie sprinkled throughout. With that in mind, it's surprisingly fun to roam throughout the lands of Middle-earth, slaying orcs and goblins." ...|$|E

These Village-streets are too narrow for new battalions from Browne; [...] "much of the Village should have been burnt beforehand," [...] say cool judges. And now, sure enough, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>get</b> burnt; Lobositz is now all on fire, by Prussian industry.

60|$|For {{this body}} to exist implies the {{existence}} of {{much more than the}} primary and initiating nucleus of engineers and skilled mechanics. If it is an educated class, its existence implies a class of educators, and just as far as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>get</b> educated the schoolmasters will be skilled and educated men. The shabby-genteel middle-class schoolmaster of the England of to-day, in--or a little way out of--orders, with his smattering of Greek, his Latin that leads nowhere, his fatuous mathematics, his gross ignorance of pedagogics, and his incomparable snobbishness, certainly does not represent the schoolmaster of this coming class. Moreover, the new element will necessarily embody its collective, necessarily distinctive, and unprecedented thoughts in a literature of its own, its development means {{the development of a new}} sort of writer and of new elements in the press. And since, if it does emerge, a revolution in the common schools of the community will be a necessary part of the process, then its emergence will involve a revolutionary change in the condition of classes that might otherwise remain as they are now--the older craftsman, for example.|$|E
60|$|The fireboys {{were never}} on hand so {{suddenly}} before; {{for there was}} no distance to go this time, their quarters being in the rear end of the market house, There was an engine company and a hook-and-ladder company. Half of each was composed of rummies {{and the other half}} of anti-rummies, after the moral and political share-and-share-alike fashion of the frontier town of the period. Enough anti-rummies were loafing in quarters to man the engine and the ladders. In two minutes they had their red shirts and helmets on--they never stirred officially in unofficial costume--and as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the long row of windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade, the deliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water, which washed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest. But water was preferable to fire, and still the stampede from the windows continued, and still the pitiless drenching assailed it until the building was empty; then the fireboys mounted to the hall and flooded it with water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was there; for a village fire company does not often get a chance to show off, and so when <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>get</b> a chance, it makes the most of it. Such citizens of that village as were of a thoughtful and judicious temperament did not insure against fire; they insured against the fire company.|$|E
