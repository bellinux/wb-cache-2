50|$|The Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC) is a <b>drilling</b> <b>device</b> {{that uses}} {{vibrations}} {{in order to}} hammer its bit through materials, as opposed to traditional drilling methods. The drill uses a piezoelectric actuator as its source of power, and utilizes a variety of 'horns' to vibrate, or hammer, its bit through the material. A prototype of the drill was first released by NASA in April 2000, which weighed 1.5 lb.

50|$|Rotary {{drilling}} machines use a segmented steel drilling string, typically {{made up of}} 6 m sections of galvanized steel tubing that are threaded together, with a bit or other <b>drilling</b> <b>device</b> at the bottom end. Some rotary {{drilling machines}} are designed to install (by driving or drilling) a steel casing into the well {{in conjunction with the}} drilling of the actual bore hole. Air and/or water is used as a circulation fluid to displace cuttings and cool bits during the drilling. Another form of rotary style drilling, termed mud rotary, makes use of a specially made mud, or drilling fluid, which is constantly being altered during the drill so that it can consistently create enough hydraulic pressure to hold the side walls of the bore hole open, regardless of the presence of a casing in the well. Typically, boreholes drilled into solid rock are not cased until after the drilling process is completed, regardless of the machinery used.|$|E

There were 35 intraosseous insertions, including 24 tibial and 11 humeral insertions. All EZ-IO ™ insertions were achieved within 20 s and were successful at the first attempt except for one. Of the intraosseous insertions, 88. 6 % were reported to be easier than intravenous cannulation. We found flow rates to be significantly faster using a pressure bag.

40|$|Application of {{estimation}} {{and monitoring}} in drilling industry {{has found a}} wide-spread attention among researchers. One of the main areas relates to the efficient supervision and control of drilling operations. For instance, during drilling oil wells, a fluid is pumped into drill string. This fluid is circulated through drill pipe and drill bit to bottom of the well and then is directed to the surface via annulus to transfer cutting material, meanwhile, cooling and lubricating the <b>drilling</b> <b>devices</b> located {{at the bottom of}} well. This causes the pressure between the drilling fluid and formation to be varied, leading to kick phenomenon and ultimately resulting into probable blow out if it is left uncontrolled.

In this paper, we are interested to investigate the feasibility of using adaptive observer technique to realize monitoring of drilling operations in oil wells from the essential and critical operational problem views, being considered in the work.
