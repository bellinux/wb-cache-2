Each major release is named {{in alphabetical order}} after a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few Android versions being called [...] "Cupcake", [...] "Donut", [...] "Eclair", and [...] "Froyo", respectively. During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013, Google explained that [...] "Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert", although a Google spokesperson told CNN {{in an interview that}} [...] "It’s kind of like an internal team thing, and we prefer {{to be a little bit}} — <b>how</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> say — a bit inscrutable in the matter, I’ll say".|$|E
2500|$|According to Girard, the {{substitution}} of an immolated victim for the first, is [...] "the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids". [...] Girard also says {{this is the first}} time that one thing represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one. This substitution is the beginning of representation and language, but also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: [...] "It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, <b>how</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> say, from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Georgescu's {{legacy and}} {{influence}} as an essayist {{and author of}} fiction remained marginal in Romania's post-communist transition, a fact which caused several critics to react negatively. Hostility toward him was reportedly widespread in the literary community {{at the time of}} his death, which, in his 1989 obituary for the author, Nicolae Manolescu equated with ingratitude: [...] "the 'trifles' of daily life [...] have become essential in the biographies of aspiring writers." [...] Manea also wrote: [...] "plenty among Paul's former friends and admirers have enclosed themselves into an opaque conjectural silence, others have rushed in to 'cleanse' themselves of the unseasonable connection." [...] Literary critic Daniel Cristea-Enache defines Georgescu as [...] "a critic and a prose writer who should not be omitted by any serious work of literary history", while his colleague Cernat refers to Georgescu as [...] "unfairly forgotten". Horasangian believes him to have been [...] "completely forgotten", [...] "ignored", and [...] "taken out of the circuit." [...] Cristea-Enache adds that, with time, [...] "our, <b>how</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> put it?, indecent indifference [...] shadowing the name and bibliography of an important writer who is no longer among us". The Georgescu-Simuţ correspondence was published in 2000 as Învăţăturile unui venerabil prozator bucureştean către un tânăr critic din provincie ("The Teachings of a Venerable Prose Writer from Bucharest to a Young Provincial Critic"). In his review of that year, Cristea-Enache called it [...] "one of the most beautiful, most energizing and at the same time most impressive books I have read lately." [...] Dimisianu sees in them proof of [...] "how very human this 'devil' could prove himself to be, how full of warmth, how much troubled by his friend's troubles". Reflecting on Georgescu's fiction, Ioan Holban notes that, during Romania's transitional stage, Ţăndărei came to resemble Huzurei more and more, especially after it became the center of a human trafficking and illegal immigration scandal pitting United Kingdom authorities against members of the local Romani community.|$|E
