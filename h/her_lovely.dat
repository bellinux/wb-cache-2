500|$|None of Art Babbit's lead {{animation}} work on {{the character}} was rotoscoped and the animators were noted to prefer to draw the Queen over Snow White [...] "because she was more real and complex as a woman, more erotic, and driven to desperate acts by her magic mirror." [...] The character, however, [...] {{turned out to be}} especially problematic for the animators, as she had to be [...] "regally beautiful, with confined but graceful movements," [...] and [...] "the experiments on <b>her</b> <b>lovely</b> cruel mouth and eyes alone represent drawings enough to fill a paper house." [...] The sequence of her transformation in particular was the film's toughest to visualise using trick effects, especially since Disney insisted on showing how the Queen felt as she changed.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} criticized {{for the absence of}} story line by critics such as Laura Brooks of 'TeenToday', who [...] {{described}} the video as [...] " [...] to show off <b>her</b> <b>lovely</b> hair and her thighs" [...] that [...] "also features David Guetta who appears to have remembered at several points throughout the video that he's left his iron on dashes off to remedy the situation." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic agreed, calling the clip [...] "dopey ... with guys who forgot to wash the home dye out of their hair" [...] (sic) and the dancing was on-par with sci-fi film The Matrix Reloaded. However she did say that [...] "It's a high-concept understanding of the dance floor, even if it's not my preferred interpretation of that space. If love and shaking it are war, Kelly seems like she'd be a pretty decent person to have boss you around in both." [...] Meanwhile Sound Savvy said [...] "There's some nice moves and Kelly sports some sexy looks for the clip. 'Commander' has received CRAZY airplay and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive for this track. I kinda dig the video, but I would've liked more choreography." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-directed romantic drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani. Penned by Mahesh Bhatt, {{the film}} {{tells the story}} of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day reviewed, [...] "Vidya Balan, a fine actress with {{thousand}} emotions fleeting across <b>her</b> <b>lovely</b> face, has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do". Vidya next took {{on the part of a}} police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was attracted to the idea of playing a [...] "no-nonsense police inspector who commands much respect" [...] and was particularly drawn to her character's [...] "silent aggression". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya [...] "is reliably solid each time she’s on screen, raising her brow, curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi language biopic of the actor-director Bhagwan Dada.|$|E

2500|$|Verdi's {{view of her}} unsuitability for roles like Lady Macbeth {{was similar}} to that {{expressed}} 10 years earlier by Felice Romani who saw her in Bellini's La straniera.

2500|$|Reporting on {{the mating}} {{patterns}} in ancient Greece specifically Sparta, Plutarch writes: [...] "Thus if {{an older man}} with a young wife should take a liking {{to one of the}} well-bred young men and approve of him, he might well introduce him to her so as to fill her with noble sperm and then adopt the child as his own. Conversely a respectable man who admired someone else’s wife noted for <b>her</b> <b>lovely</b> children and her good sense, might gain the husband’s permission to sleep with her thereby planting in fruitful soil, so to speak, and producing fine children who would be linked to fine ancestors by blood and family." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] is Madonna's most poetic ballad. Much in the {{way that}} such hits as [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Into the Groove" [...] act as the {{fuselage}} of '80s pop [...] a lost-love elegy that squares nicely with the burgeoning female singer-songwriter movement of the '90s. Don't mistake its sleepy quality for stuffiness. This song is Madonna at <b>her</b> <b>loveliest.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Margaret Rossiter White, Historical Records Librarian at Loma Linda, writes:"This {{tremendous}} victory {{called for}} an appropriate celebration at Loma Linda. New Year's Day, 1918, was appointed Jubilee Day, and invitations were sent to, all the doctors and their families on the Los Angeles and Loma Linda faculty, members of the Loma Linda church and their families, members of the surrounding churches, including the faculties of the Glendale Sanitarium and Paradise Valley Sanitarium, and everyone else they could think of who had {{a special interest in}} the college. A free dinner was offered for students, nurses, and visiting physicians, and special guests. The church was decorated with plants, ferns, flowers, and holly; the orchestra offered some [...] "good triumphant pieces"; Miss Katherine Hansen sang, in <b>her</b> <b>lovely</b> contralto voice, [...] "God Will Take Care of You" [...] (by special request from Dr. Magan). Dr. Magan was master of ceremonies, and Elder John Burden had been asked to make [...] "the big speech." [...] All in all, it was a great occasion, a combination of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. And not the least thankful among the joyous crowd were the boys who had returned from camp (all but one), to continue their studies in the College of Medical Evangelists.|$|E
