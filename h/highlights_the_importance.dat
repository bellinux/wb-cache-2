5|$|Starting with {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh discusses the uncertainty among the Afghans about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ {{perception that the}} US is funding {{both sides of the}} conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population centers are defended.|$|E
5|$|CARE International proposes several {{strategies}} that might reduce the destructive {{economic impact of}} HIV/AIDS on rural households. They recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV/AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture. Women in patrilineal/patrilocal villages are often unable to support {{themselves and their children}} when their husbands die of HIV/AIDS; therefore, helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels. CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have been devastated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Finally, CARE International <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of increasing access to information about HIV/AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the first}} {{thoughts}} {{that come to}} mind for most machinists regarding threading are of thread cutting processes (such as tapping, single-pointing, or helical milling), Smid points out that, when plastic bottles for food, beverages, personal care products, and other consumer products are considered, it is actually plastic molding that is the principal method (by sheer volume) of thread generation in manufacturing today. Of course, this fact <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the moldmakers getting the mold just right (in preparation for millions of cycles, usually at high speed).|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{fatherhood}} of God does {{appear in the}} Old Testament, but {{is not a major}} theme. While the view of God as the Father is used in the Old Testament, it only became a focus in the New Testament, as Jesus frequently referred to it. This is manifested in the Lord's prayer which combines the earthly needs of daily bread with the reciprocal concept of forgiveness. And Jesus' emphasis on his special relationship with the Father <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the distinct yet unified natures of Jesus and the Father, building to the unity of Father and Son in the Trinity.|$|E

Through MPI, eight {{international}} non-governmental organizations are able to work primarily with middle power governments to encourage and educate the nuclear weapons states to take immediate practical steps that reduce nuclear dangers, and commence negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons. Middle power countries are particularly influential in issues related to arms control, being that they are politically and economically significant, internationally respected countries that have renounced the nuclear arms race, a standing that gives them significant political credibility.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, the European Commission {{presented}} {{a new strategy}} to decrease youth unemployment rate, which is close to 23% across the European Union. The European Qualifications Framework calls for a shift towards learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU. Students are expected to learn skills that they will need when they complete their education. It also calls for lessons to have a stronger link to employment through work-based learning. Work-based learning for students should also lead to recognition of vocational training for these students. The program also sets goals for learning foreign languages, and for teachers continued education. It also <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of using technology, especially the internet, in learning to make it relevant to students.|$|E

Like Asher, Horwitz <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of naturalistic experience in L2, promoting listening and reading practice and stressing involvement in lifelike conversations. She explicitly suggests teaching practices {{based on these}} principles; ‘uch class time should be devoted {{to the development of}} listening and reading abilities’, and ‘eachers should assess student interests and supply appropriate…materials’. The ‘audio-lingual’ teaching practices {{used in the present study}} are based on principles explicated by Asher and Horwitz; listening featured heavily, closely followed by reading and speaking practice. The vocabulary items taught were deemed relevant for all learners, regardless of age, and, according to Pfeffer, they are among the most commonly used nouns in everyday German language.|$|E

Describing the adaptation as [...] "a witty mix of love stories and social conniving, cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry", critics noted that Davies's focus on sex and money and Austen's wry, incisive humour and the [...] "deft" [...] characterisation, prevented the television adaptation from [...] "descending {{into the realm of}} a nicely-costumed, brilliantly-photographed melodrama".|$|E

500|$|Achebe's novels {{approach}} {{a variety of}} themes. In his early writing, a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount. Critic Nahem Yousaf <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of these depictions: [...] "Around the tragic stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu, Achebe sets about textualising Igbo cultural identity". The portrayal of indigenous life {{is not simply a}} matter of literary background, he adds: [...] "Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial reality as an Igbo-centric response to a Eurocentrically constructed imperial 'reality'". Certain elements of Achebe's depiction of Igbo life in Things Fall Apart match those in Olaudah Equiano's autobiographical Narrative. Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: [...] "Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria".|$|E
500|$|Truss <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> that Gibbons {{places on}} {{detachment}} {{as a necessary}} adjunct to effective writing: [...] "Like many a good doctor, {{she seems to have}} considered sympathy a peculiar and [...] redundant emotion, and a terrible waste of time." [...] This matter-of-fact quality in her prose might, according to Gibbons's Guardian obituarist Richard Boston, be a reaction against the turbulent and sometimes violent emotions that she witnessed within her own family who, she said, [...] "were all madly highly-sexed, like the Starkadders". It is, observed Neville, an irony that the overheated [...] melodrama [...] that Gibbons most disliked {{was at the heart of}} her one great [...] success; [...] Gibbons's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as [...] "a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental." [...] While short of sentimentality, Gibbons's writing, in prose or verse, did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as [...] "a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable".|$|E
