5|$|Although {{his work}} took him from Silverton, for the {{remainder}} of his life, Davenport was often melancholy for his native Oregon, and in writing to relatives there, <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> told them not to send him anything that would remind him of Silverton, because he would be plunged into despair.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} in the House and Senate, Dodd built a long record of {{political}} positions on important issues to the nation. He {{was in favor of}} ending the Iraq War and redeploying American from the nation. <b>He</b> <b>repeatedly</b> voted against further funding of the war.|$|E
5|$|Having {{declared}} his {{disdain for the}} 1956 reunification elections, Diệm saw the referendum {{as the first step}} in creating a long-term state to rule over South Vietnam. <b>He</b> <b>repeatedly</b> said that the creation of a legislature and a constitution for his new state would follow the referendum.|$|E

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>repeatedly</b> took credit {{during this}} period for {{operations}} {{in which he had}} no involvement, including the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing, 1985 Bradford City stadium fire, and 1986 assassination of Zafer al-Masri, the mayor of Nablus (killed by the PFLP, according to Seale). He also implied that he had been behind the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster by publishing a congratulatory note in the ANO magazine, writes Seale.|$|E
5|$|Robert Patrick Modell (Robert Wisden) {{walks through}} a supermarket, buying a large {{supply of energy}} drinks. Before he can leave, Modell is {{surrounded}} and arrested by FBI agents led by Frank Burst (Vic Polizos). While being escorted away in a police car, <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> talks about the color cerulean blue. Modell's talking seemingly causes the driver to not see an approaching big rig of that color, causing a collision. Modell escapes after the driver unlocks his handcuffs before dying.|$|E
5|$|The winter had {{political}} ramifications {{and caused}} {{the public to}} lose faith in a Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies. Long-time Labour activist Manny Shinwell {{was in charge of}} the coal supply. <b>He</b> <b>repeatedly</b> denied there were problems. He blamed the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally. The cabinet had to take control away from him and he became the scapegoat.|$|E

5|$|When World War I broke out, the United States {{maintained}} {{a policy of}} isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. <b>He</b> <b>repeatedly</b> warned that the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1861, Lowe {{inflated}} {{a balloon}} in Washington with hopes of providing aerial {{coverage for the}} impending Battle of Bull Run, but a violent storm buffeted the inflated balloon and delayed Lowe until word of the Union defeat reached him on the road. Lowe subsequently {{decided to make a}} detour to Fort Corcoran, reaching it on July 27. Over the next few days, <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> ascended in the balloon in order to make maps of the surrounding area and gather intelligence about Confederate troops advancing on Washington.|$|E
5|$|Jack tells Liz and {{the writers}} of TGS Tracy Jordan that {{he wants them to}} insert General Electric (GE) {{products}} into the show. The writers express their reluctance in doing product placements for GE (even though during the scene the cast talk about how great Snapple's White Green Tea tastes), but Liz agrees on the condition that Jack appears in the sketch. The next day, Liz watches a video containing outtakes from Jack's product placement video, where she discovers that <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> forgot his lines after 142 takes. After realizing that he needs help, Liz encourages Jack to go through with the sketch, which he ultimately is able to shoot.|$|E

5|$|Meg {{catches the}} mumps when the Griffins attend Quahog's annual Star Trek convention, because Peter {{forced her to}} stand next to an irresponsible {{attendee}} with mumps to take a picture, believing him to be in costume as an alien. While recovering in bed, Meg becomes a born-again Christian after watching Kirk Cameron on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs. Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity, but <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, making him a social outcast.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, he {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald, at the Battle of Maserfield; {{from this point}} he {{was probably the most}} powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, laying the foundations for the Mercian supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. <b>He</b> <b>repeatedly</b> defeated the East Angles and drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued to wage war against the Bernicians of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered a crushing defeat by Oswald's successor and brother Oswiu, and was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed {{in the course of a}} final campaign against the Bernicians.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{has become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.|$|E
50|$|Adamo {{has sold}} over 100 {{million copies of}} {{recordings}} worldwide. He has recorded in many languages and, besides France and Belgium, had hits in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Turkey and also in Japan, where <b>he</b> toured <b>repeatedly.</b> <b>He</b> has had hits and toured also in Latin America and throughout the Middle East.|$|R

6000|$|The tall prophet retreated {{before the}} tiny priest {{in an almost}} mad disorder. [...] "What do you mean? How dare you?" [...] <b>he</b> cried <b>repeatedly.</b>|$|R
5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced {{with a lack of}} suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.|$|E
5|$|Storytelling was a {{mainstay}} of the Igbo tradition and {{an integral part of}} the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books– including a prose adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins at}} the National Mall, where Major General Benjamin Bloch (Scott Hylands) gives a speech to a crowd of Vietnam War veterans. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) patrol the crowd, searching for a {{potential}} gunman. However, when the agents see the gunman, <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> disappears and makes their efforts to track him difficult. Mulder finds himself aiming his gun towards the panicked crowd, desperately searching for the gunman, who has disappeared {{right in front of}} him.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} Medals of Honor for the Korean War were awarded for the Battle of Taejon. For his {{actions on the}} front lines, Dean was awarded the first Medal of Honor, {{although}} he remained a prisoner of the North Koreans {{until the end of}} the war (released in September 1953). A second soldier, Sergeant George D. Libby, received the Medal of Honor posthumously, for tending to wounded soldiers during the evacuation: <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> passed over shelled roads to help evacuate them. He was killed while trying to evacuate more soldiers. Additionally, a chaplain, Herman G. Felhoelter, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for an incident later known as the Chaplain-Medic Massacre which took place during the battle near the Kum River.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea of a {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but <b>he</b> <b>repeatedly</b> turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E
