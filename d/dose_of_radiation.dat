5|$|The main {{benefit of}} breast {{brachytherapy}} compared to whole breast irradiation {{is that a}} high <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs. APBI can typically be completed {{over the course of}} a week. The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> {{to be applied}} to a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of hard radiation. He received a lethal <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a criticality accident, following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment.|$|E
5|$|With {{time running}} out, Phlox and T'Pol {{find a way}} to disrupt the virus using deadly levels of radiation. Archer and Phlox, while wearing {{environmental}} suits, escort Tucker and Sato to Sickbay for treatment. Sato soon goes into cardiac-arrest, and Archer removes his gloves and helmet to assist her, but she cannot be resuscitated. They then administer a <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> to Tucker, but that too is ineffective. Phlox then leaves to resume work from the Bridge. Suddenly, Tucker and Sato are reanimated by the aliens, whowhile possessing the crewmenexplain the situation to a surprised Archer, who then makes an impassioned speech on behalf of his crew. The aliens decide to modify their procedures, choosing to resurrect and cure the infected crew members, when they previously would have left them to die. The aliens erase the encounter from the crew's memory. Archer orders a warning beacon to be placed above the planet, and the aliens leave to begin planning first contact with more advanced humans at a later time.|$|E

50|$|In 2011 an {{in vitro}} {{time-lapse}} {{study of the}} cellular response to low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> showed a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low-dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended.|$|R
40|$|Radiation induced {{bystander}} {{effects and}} adaptive responses are two phenomena that modulate cellular responses to low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Bystander effects generally exaggerate the effects <b>of</b> low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> by eliciting detrimental effects in nonirradiated cells, thus making the target for radiation effects {{greater than the}} volume irradiated. Adaptive responses {{on the other hand}} indicate that low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> can reduce damage induced by a second challenging dose. The potential impact of these two low dose effects on the shape <b>of</b> the <b>dose</b> response relationship will be discussed...|$|R

25|$|D. radiodurans was {{discovered}} in 1956 by Arthur W. Anderson at the Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station in Corvallis, Oregon. Experiments were being performed to determine whether canned food could be sterilized using high doses of gamma radiation. A tin of meat was exposed to a <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> that was thought to kill all known forms of life, but the meat subsequently spoiled, and D. radiodurans was isolated.|$|E
25|$|One {{fractionation}} {{schedule that}} is increasingly being used {{and continues to be}} studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2Gy/fraction to 20Gy/fraction. The logic behind hypofractionation is to lessen the possibility of the cancer returning by not giving the cells enough time to reproduce and also to exploit the unique biological radiation sensitivity of some tumors.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in oxygen. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as hypoxia. Oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer, increasing {{the effectiveness of a}} given <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment.|$|E
25|$|Molecular breast imaging is {{a nuclear}} {{medicine}} technique {{that is currently}} under study. It shows promising results for imaging people with dense breast tissue and may have accuracies comparable to MRI. It may be better than mammography in some people with dense breast tissue, detecting {{two to three times}} more cancers in this population. It however carries a greater risk of radiation damage making it inappropriate for general breast cancer screening. It is possible to reduce the <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> used.|$|E
25|$|Experimental and {{epidemiological}} data currently {{do not support}} the proposition that there is a threshold <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> below which there is no increased risk of cancer. However, this is under increasing doubt. It is estimated that the additional radiation will increase a person's cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6–1.8%. The amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of X-ray test and the body part involved. CT and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain X-rays.|$|E

25|$|An {{enhancement}} of virtual simulation is 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), {{in which the}} profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit {{the profile of the}} target from a beam's eye view (BEV) using a multileaf collimator (MLC) and a variable number of beams. When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy can be {{delivered}} by external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy), or by intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT). In the case of external beam radiotherapy, X-rays are delivered from outside the body by a machine called a Linear Accelerator or Linac. In contrast, brachytherapy involves the precise placement of radiation source(s) directly at the treatment site. IORT includes a one-time <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> administered with breast surgery. Radiation therapy {{is important in the}} use of breast-conserving therapy because it reduces the risk of local recurrence.|$|E
25|$|May 1945: Albert Stevens was one {{of several}} {{subjects}} of a human radiation experiment, and was injected with plutonium without his knowledge or informed consent. Although Stevens was the person who received the highest <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> during the plutonium experiments, he was neither the first nor the last subject to be studied. Eighteen people aged 4 to 69 were injected with plutonium. Subjects who were chosen for the experiment had been diagnosed with a terminal disease. They lived from 6 days up to 44 years past the time of their injection. Eight of the 18 died within two years of the injection. All died from their preexisting terminal illness, or cardiac illnesses. None died from the plutonium itself. Patients from Rochester, Chicago, and Oak Ridge were also injected with plutonium in the Manhattan Project human experiments.|$|E

For reasons of secrecy, the official diagnosis was not [...] "radiation sickness" [...] but [...] "astheno-vegetative syndrome", which {{is a kind of}} mental disorder.|$|R
40|$|A single large <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> x-rays {{over the}} abdomen {{will cause a}} {{definite}} injury of the mucosa of the small intestine and {{the severity of the}} clinical intoxication seems to parallel this recognizable epithelial injury. This clinical intoxication lasts 4 to 6 days if the x-ray dose is sublethal. Subsequent <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> given within this period of clinical intoxication give recognizable evidence of summation or a cumulative effect. Small but repeated <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> given within a 5 or 6 day period will cause practically the same cell injury and clinical intoxication as will a single dose representing the sum <b>of</b> the small <b>doses</b> expressed in milliampere minutes. <b>Doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> given at 6 day or longer intervals show no evidence of summation. The reaction of this relatively sensitive intestinal epithelium to radiation may be similar to the reaction of certain deep lying tumor tissues to x-ray therapy and our experiments may give information of value to physicians concerned with x-ray or radium therapy...|$|R
25|$|The {{rationale}} for IORT is {{to deliver a}} high <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.|$|E
25|$|Without the {{protection}} of Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere astronauts are exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation. A year in low Earth orbit results in a <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> 10 times that of the annual dose on earth. High levels of radiation damage lymphocytes, cells heavily involved in maintaining the immune system; this damage contributes to the lowered immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also recently been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Outside {{the protection}} of low Earth orbit, galactic cosmic rays present further challenges to human spaceflight, as the health threat from cosmic rays significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade or more of exposure. A NASA-supported study reported that radiation may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Solar flare events (though rare) can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes. It is thought that protective shielding and protective drugs may ultimately lower the risks to an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy {{eliminates}} the microscopic cancer cells that may remain near {{the area where}} the tumor was surgically removed. The <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> must be strong enough to ensure the elimination of cancer cells. However, radiation affects normal cells and cancer cells alike, causing some damage to the normal tissue around where the tumor was. Healthy tissue can repair itself, while cancer cells do not repair themselves as well as normal cells. For this reason, radiation treatments are given over an extended period, enabling the healthy tissue to heal. Treatments using external beam radiotherapy are typically given over a period of five to seven weeks, performed five days a week. Recent large trials (UK START and Canadian) have confirmed that shorter treatment courses, typically over three to four weeks, result in equivalent cancer control and side effects as the more protracted treatment schedules. Each treatment takes about 15 minutes. A newer approach, called 'accelerated partial breast irradiation' (APBI), uses brachytherapy to deliver the radiation in a much shorter period of time. APBI delivers radiation to only the immediate region surrounding the original tumor and can typically be completed over the course of one week.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tumor {{areas can}} now be very {{precisely}} delimited thanks to technical progress in imaging and ballistics. This has also {{led to the development}} of novel radiotherapy protocols, delivering higher <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> directly to cancer cells. Despite this, radiation toxicity in healthy tissue remains a major issue, particularly with dose-escalation in these new protocols. Acute and late tissue damage following irradiation have both been linked to the endothelium irrigating normal tissues. The molecular mechanisms involved in the endothelial response to high <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> are associated with signaling from the plasma membrane, mainly via the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide pathway. This review describes this signaling pathway and discusses the relevance of targeting endothelial signaling to protect healthy tissues from the deleterious effects <b>of</b> high <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation...</b>|$|R
