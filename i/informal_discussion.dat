5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

The trust was formally launched on 17 November 1990, to a meeting at The Railway Institute in York, followed by further presentations in London and Edinburgh.|$|E

In other words, a focus group is an <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> among a group of selected individuals about a particular topic (Wilkinson 2004).

25|$|The Yearly Kos Presidential Leadership Forum was an <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> {{attended}} by {{seven of the}} eight presidential candidates, with Biden not attending due to votes in Congress.

After the debate, breakout sessions were held where convention goers could question each candidate individually.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{traditional}} Muslim view, the emergence of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) {{goes back to the}} lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In this view, his companions and followers took what he did and approved of as a model (sunnah) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of hadith. These reports led first to <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists Abu Hanifah, Malik ibn Anas, Al-Shafi‘i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who are viewed as the founders of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi, and Hanbali legal schools (madhhabs) of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E
25|$|Markets {{of varying}} types can spontaneously arise {{whenever}} a party has {{interest in a}} good or service that some other party can provide. Hence {{there can be a}} market for cigarettes in correctional facilities, another for chewing gum in a playground, and yet another for contracts for the future delivery of a commodity. There can be black markets, where a good is exchanged illegally, for example markets for goods under a command economy despite pressure to repress them, and virtual markets, such as eBay, in which buyers and sellers do not physically interact during negotiation. A market can be organized as an auction, as a private electronic market, as a commodity wholesale market, as a shopping center, as a complex institution such as a stock market, and as an <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> between two individuals.|$|E

The same questions were repeated {{in the second part}} of the questionnaire in order to track changes in farming practices 10 years after the legalization. Information, missed by the questionnaire was captured through <b>informal</b> interviews and <b>discussions</b> during tea breaks and mealtimes after survey interviews. Topics and questions during <b>informal</b> <b>discussions</b> and interviews included hardships of yak farming, rural out-migration, incomes from yak farming and the Cordyceps business, and migratory and feeding practices for yaks. <b>Informal</b> <b>discussions</b> and interviews lasted from 30  minutes to one hour.|$|R

2500|$|On 26 February 2012 {{a meeting}} with Goshi Hosono, {{minister}} of Environment, and Tatsuo Hirano, minister in charge of reconstruction, and the mayors of eight cities and villages near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was cancelled. Three mayors boycotted the meeting in a protest, because the government had already informed the media about the meeting's agenda prior to informing them. Katsutaka Idogawa, the mayor of Futaba, told a press conference, [...] "I strongly mistrust the government... So I have made a momentous decision not to attend the meeting" [...] The mayors of the towns of Hirono and Namie also refused to go. This meeting was intended to discuss how {{to get rid of}} the radioactive material emitted by the plant and find a place for temporary facilities to store contaminated soil. The meeting was cancelled, instead Hosono and Hirano had an <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> with the five remaining municipal leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Spring 1919, at the Paris Peace Conference, <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> began {{between the}} Zionist Organisation and British representatives. A first draft was {{presented}} on 15 July 1919. After Lord Curzon had replaced Arthur Balfour as Foreign Secretary, the draft was reconsidered. A second draft was presented on 10 June 1920. In the second draft, the paragraph recognising the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine {{was removed from}} the preamble. [...] "self-governing commonwealth" [...] was replaced by [...] "self-governing institutions". Also, [...] "The recognition of the establishment of the Jewish National Home as the guiding principle in the execution of the Mandate" [...] was omitted from the first draft. After strenuous objection to the proposed changes, the statement regarding the historical connections of the Jews with Palestine was re-incorporated into the Mandate in December 1920. The draft was submitted to the League of Nations on 6 December 1920.|$|E

60|$|At the {{commencement}} of the war of 1812, Franklin Pierce was a few months under eight years of age. The old general, his father, sent two of his sons into the army; and as his eldest daughter was soon afterwards married to Major McNeil, there were few families that had so large a personal stake in the war as that of General Benjamin Pierce. He himself, both in his public capacity {{as a member of}} the council, and by his great local influence in his own county, lent a strenuous support to the national administration. It is attributable to his sagacity and energy, that New Hampshire--then under a federal governor--was saved the disgrace of participation in the questionable, if not treasonable, projects of the Hartford Convention. He identified himself with the cause of the country, and was doubtless as thoroughly alive with patriotic zeal, at this eventful period, as in the old days of Bunker Hill, and Saratoga, and Yorktown. The general not only took a prominent part at all public meetings, but was ever ready for the <b>informal</b> <b>discussion</b> of political affairs at all places of casual resort, where--in accordance with the custom of the time and country--the minds of men were made to operate effectually upon each other. Franklin Pierce was a frequent auditor of these controversies. The intentness with which he watched the old general, and listened to his arguments, is still remembered; and, at this day, in his most earnest moods, there are gesticulations and movements that bring up the image of his father to those who recollect the latter on those occasions of the display of homely, native eloquence. No mode of education could be conceived, better adapted to imbue a youth with the principles and sentiment of democratic institutions; it brought him into the most familiar contact with the popular mind, and made his own mind a part of it.|$|E
