5|$|All Jaegers except <b>Gipsy</b> Danger are {{dispatched}} to intervene. Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon, while Leatherback destroys Cherno Alpha and paralyzes Striker Eureka with an EMP blast. Out of options, Pentecost reluctantly allows Mako and Raleigh to pilot <b>Gipsy</b> Danger. <b>Gipsy</b> successfully kills Leatherback and Otachi, while almost destroying Hong Kong in the process. Examining Otachi's body, Newton and Hannibal {{find out that}} it is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal but soon dies from being strangled by its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant’s brain, discovering that The Breach can only open {{in the presence of a}} Kaiju's DNA.|$|E
5|$|Born in Jakarta {{of mixed}} Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became {{interested}} in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later <b>Gipsy),</b> a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia {{and then went back}} to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with <b>Gipsy</b> and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh <b>Gipsy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2020, the Jaeger <b>Gipsy</b> Danger, piloted by {{brothers}} Raleigh and Yancy Beckett, defends Anchorage {{from the}} Kaiju Knifehead. They both engage in combat, with <b>Gipsy</b> gaining {{the upper hand}} and defeating the Kaiju by blasting it with its plasma cannon. Unknown to them, the Kaiju is still alive. Knifehead then reemerges, ambushes them, critically damages <b>Gipsy</b> Danger by severing its left arm and throws Yancy out of the cockpit, killing him. Raleigh manages to pilot <b>Gipsy</b> alone, activating the remaining plasma cannon and finally killing Knifehead. Traumatized by Yancy’s death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program. In 2025, the world governments decide to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers, in favor of building massive coastal walls, but the Kaiju are growing more powerful, their attacks more frequent and Jaegers are being destroyed faster than they are built. The remaining four Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong {{under the command of}} Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying The Breach using a nuclear weapon.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gipsy</b> {{was laid}} down by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, at Govan, Scotland on 4 September 1934, {{launched}} on 7 November 1935 and completed on 22 February 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £250,364. Aside from a brief period assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet after her commissioning, <b>Gipsy</b> spent the pre-war period assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet. She was refitted at Devonport Dockyard between 2 June and 30 July 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the {{opportunity}} to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid of telling his father, who he thought would disapprove of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join <b>Gipsy.</b> After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet <b>Gipsy</b> in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti.|$|E
5|$|Chrisye {{released}} 31 albums {{during his}} lifetime, 1 with Guruh <b>Gipsy,</b> 21 studio albums, and 9 compilation albums.

In a 1992 interview with Kompas, Chrisye said that he fell ill after recording each of his albums, blaming the pressure to promote them.|$|E

5|$|Chrisye {{stopped playing}} {{altogether}} until the Nasutions {{invited him to}} rejoin <b>Gipsy</b> for their new project with Guruh, who offered Chrisye several songs {{in which he would}} be lead singer, with lyrics written especially for him. Overcoming his depression, he joined the group as they practised at Guruh's house in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. The band often rehearsed late into the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese gamelan and was produced collaboratively. Recording took place in mid-1975, with only four songs completed in the first several months. It was released to critical acclaim in 1976, with a production of 5000copies. The success of Guruh <b>Gipsy</b> convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Home Counties Aircraft Services {{were based}} at Penshurst. A de Havilland DH.60 <b>Gipsy</b> Moth was {{exhibited}} at a car showroom in Tunbridge Wells, causing severe traffic congestion {{due to the}} number of people visiting the town to see it. Home Counties Aircraft Service Ltd was registered later that year. By October 1930, Mr Waters, the manager of Home Counties Aircraft Service Ltd had formed the Surrey Aero Club, based at Gatwick Racecourse Aerodrome.|$|E
5|$|In March 1936, for {{his second}} voyage in <b>Gipsy</b> Love, Orsborne {{attempted}} to engage the services of an experienced seaman, Alexander MacLean, to whom he confided that the trip might go further afield—perhaps to Bermuda or South America—but MacLean declined the opportunity. Orsborne offered the mate's berth to Harry Stone, a local seaman who did not possess a mate's ticket but was told by Orsborne that he could use MacLean's number. The other crew members were a Yorkshireman, Hector Harris, and a 17-year-old Scottish cook, Howard Stephens. The formal crew was joined by Orsborne's younger brother James, a grocer, who had no formal status on board and was later classified as a stowaway. <b>Gipsy</b> Love left Grimsby late in March 1936, supposedly to fish in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea, but within hours had returned to port with engine trouble. With {{the consent of the}} owners, Orsborne transferred stores and crew to another Marstrand vessel, the small trawler Girl Pat; James Orsborne again joined them.|$|E

5|$|The Orthodox Metropolitan See of Wallachia was {{recognized}} by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1359. Wallachia issued its own currency under Vladislav I (1364c.1377). The earliest written information about Gypsies in modern Romania, a deed issued by Dan I of Wallachia (c.13831386) refers to Vladislav I's former donation of Gypsies to the Vodiţa monastery.

5|$|The first {{training}} courses at No.3 EFTS were not conducted by RAAF instructors {{under the auspices}} of EATS but by Essendon's civil organisations under government contract. The training aircraft were privately owned deHavilland Tiger Moths and <b>Gipsy</b> Moths. All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by Squadron Leader King. The initial intake of sixteen students arrived on 8January 1940, and received eight weeks of instruction that finished on 4March; {{all but one of the}} trainees had prior flying experience, and the course was accident-free. The next student intake at No.3 EFTS arrived on 5February 1940. The school's inaugural EATS course commenced in May. Overall student numbers at this time were reported as being 48, while staff totalled 50. The second EATS course began in July. By this time, Essendon's civilian presence had effectively been absorbed by the military organisation; privately owned aircraft were taken over by the RAAF, which had also begun employing its own aircraft, the first being a <b>Gipsy</b> Moth that arrived in March. Training accidents were frequent, particularly during landings, but did not result in any fatalities.|$|E

5|$|The {{group was}} renamed <b>Gipsy</b> in 1969, which they {{considered}} more macho and Western-sounding. The {{schedule for the}} band, which had no manager, became increasingly busy, since they had begun giving regular performances at Ismail Marzuki Park.

5|$|While in New York, <b>Gipsy</b> {{performed}} at the Ramayana Restaurant, which was owned by the Indonesian gas company Pertamina. The band, housed in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, performed in New York for almost a year, providing Indonesian-themed music and covering songs by Procol Harum, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis and Blood, Sweat & Tears.

Unlike the 1st DF, the Second was transferred to Force K in Freetown in West Africa, to help search for German commerce raiders. Some ships were later transferred to Bermuda and the West Indies for escort work and patrolling. They returned to the UK in January and spent several months refitting.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} his {{business}} closure, McAloney was forced to seek alternate employment and he consequently enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 1 July 1936. Ranked aircraftman, he completed a fitters course and qualified as an aero fitter and turner before being attached to No.1 Squadron at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, in September. He was employed in a maintenance role within the unit, working on the Jupiter <b>Gipsy</b> and Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines of Bristol Bulldog and Hawker Demon aircraft respectively. During 1937, McAloney completed a part-time air gunner course. His first child, a son named William, was born later that year.|$|E
