40|$|The {{purpose of}} writing my bachelor's work - The {{significance}} of The Early Interňvention {{for a family}} of a child with visual impairment - is to make the readers acquainted with the problems of this service. The <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention</b> is a set of services and programmes offered to children, endangered in their social, biological and psychical development, to children with disability and their families. The aim of it is to prevent disabilities, to mitigate their effects and help the family, the child and the society to achieve social integration. Out from the spectrum of The <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention</b> branches I chose the one oriented at families of children with visual impairment. In consequence, beside the theory of The <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention,</b> I also address the types of visual impairments {{and the development of a}} child with visual impairment. The <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention</b> is a complex approach, oriented at the whole family, i. e. including the parents, since their ability to manage the situation is crucial for the child. That's why a portion of my work pays attention to them. At the end I am giving a comparison of two families, one of which partici- pated in the programme of The <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention,</b> the other one not. The two dialogs indiňcate the importance and value of The <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention.</b> <b>Powered</b> by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

In this article we look at the powers attributed to the ECB, from a legal perspective, in order to evaluate the SSM in the broader European architecture of banking supervision. We focus on three issues: the coexistence of more authorities with the same functions on a different perimeter of intermediaries in Europe, due to the UK decision to remain outside the SSM; the creation of a supervisory authority with weak regulatory powers (since these remain in the hands of European institutions and national legislators); and ambiguity over the competence to carry out <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>powers.</b> These issues should be addressed to increase the effectiveness of supervision. To this end, first we need an “umbrella authority” to coordinate supervision among all European countries (those that do and do not adhere to the SSM); this role could be played by the EBA.

30|$|In {{order to}} put this {{principle}} of a family-centered approach in practice, a legislative effort {{was made in the}} US: the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). The IFSP ‘theoretically (a) shows that <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> is concerned with the whole family and (b) results from a family-centered process of identifying child and family strengths and needs and deciding on intervention priorities’ (McWilliam et al., 1998, p. 69). Thus, the completion of IFSP requirements provides a foundation for family-centered <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> services to children and families within the unit of family. This definition of family-centered <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> includes an enforcement of parent participation in all aspects of <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> practices grounded in the law (Wehman and Gilkerson, 1999). More explicitly, ‘parents’ active participation in the IFSP process [became] a goal of family-centered approaches’ (Minke and Scott, 1995, p. 344), and in effect, the completion of the IFSP requirements denotes that the family actively participated in the process of <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> service planning and delivery. Legitimately, therefore, family-centered <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> has also been accomplished via the family’s active participation in the IFSP procedure and requirements.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} {{economic}} impacts of <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> in England on outcomes and costs {{for people with}} first-episode psychosis. Methods: Three decision analytical models were constructed to compare treatment by <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> for first-episode psychosis with standard care in relation to employment, education, homicide and suicide. Data on effectiveness and costs were taken from previous studies and expert opinion. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of assumptions. Results: Our models indicate that <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> demonstrates savings of £ 2087 per person over 3 years from improved employment and education outcomes. In addition, the annual costs over 10 years related to homicide after <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> were £ 80 lower than for standard care.
