5000|$|The cornamuse is {{a double}} reed {{instrument}} dating from the Renaissance period. It {{is similar to the}} crumhorn in having a windcap over the reed and cylindrical bore. In Syntagma musicum II (1619), Michael Praetorius writes: [...] "Die CornaMuse sind gleich aus/und nicht mit doppelten/sondern mit einer einfachen Röhre/gleich den Bassanelli" [...] (The cornamuse are similar to/and do not have a double, but rather a single tube (bore)/like the bassanelli.)

The fiber optic probe consists of a collimated optical fiber recessed into a <b>double</b> <b>bore</b> ceramic tube fitted with a stainless steel light-limiting window. The optical fiber probe is {{used to measure the}} emission intensity of excited neutral xenon for a small volume of plasma, at various radial and axial locations. The single Langmuir probes, are used to generate current-voltage characteristics at a total of 140 spatial locations inside the discharge chamber. Assuming a maxwellian distribution for the electron population, the Langmuir probe traces provide spatially resolved measurements of plasma potential, electron temperature, and plasma density. Data reduction for the NSTAR TH 8 and TH 15 throttle points indicates an electron temperature range of 1 to 7. 9 eV and an electron density range of 4 e 10 to le 13 cm(sup - 3), throughout the discharge chamber, consistent with the results in the literature. Plasma potential estimates, computed from the first derivative of the probe characteristic, indicate potential from 0. 5 V to 11 V above the discharge voltage along the thruster centerline. These values are believed to be excessively high due to the sampling of the primary electron population along the thruster centerline. Relative neutral density profiles are also obtained with a fiber optic probe sampling photon flux from the 823. 1 nm excited to ground state transition. Plasma parameter measurements and neutral density profiles will be presented as a function of probe location and engine discharge conditions. A discussion of the measured electron energy distribution function will also be presented, with regards to variation from pure maxwellian. It has been found that there is a distinct primary population found along the thruster centerline, which causes estimates of electron temperature, electron density, and plasma potential, to err on the high side, due this energetic population. Computation of the energy distribution fimction of the plasma clearly indicates the presence of primaries, whose presence become less obvious with radial distance from the main discharge plume...|$|R

40|$|Zygomorphic flowers, with {{bilateral}} (dorsoventral) symmetry, {{are considered}} to have evolved several times independently in flowering plants. In Antirrhinum majus, floral dorsoventral symmetry depends on the activity of two TCP-box genes, CYCLOIDEA (CYC) and DICHOTOMA (DICH). To examine whether the same molecular mechanism of floral asymmetry operates in the distantly related Rosid clade of eudicots, in which asymmetric flowers {{are thought to have}} evolved independently, we investigated the function of a CYC homologue LjCYC 2 in a papilionoid legume, Lotus japonicus.

40|$|On the 19 th of February 2010, the Ministry of Transport and Communication {{presented}} the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{with the task}} of assessing different aspects of the future of high-speed rail in Norway. The report, the Norwegian High-Speed Rail Assessment (NHSRA), consist three separate evaluations where the climate assessment by Bergsdal et al. (2012), motivated this thesis. Results from the report identify the railway infrastructure as the dominant emission source for the corridor, with the length of tunnels representing the determining factor. Simultaneously, an ongoing debate is comparing the safety and performance of track and tunnel technologies traditionally used in Norway to that of foreign tunnelling technology such as the drill and blast method which apply a full cast (European method), and a <b>double</b> shielded tunnel <b>boring</b> machine (TBM). The newest development in track technology is the slab track, which is now evaluated for tunnels and bridges in Norway (Jernbaneverket 2011). This thesis contributes to the ongoing debate concerning the construction of infrastructure for high-speed rail in Norway, by emphasizing the environmental impact of several relevant technologies and geological conditions. The assessment includes an evaluation of the impact of different tunnelling and track technologies, calculated for operation speeds of both 250 km/h and 330 km/h. Further, the environmental impact of different levels of support work and grout is assessed. In addition, this thesis includes a sensitivity analysis of the impact of service life for railway components. The assessment is calculated for two functional units: one meter tunnel and tunnel track, and for the case corridor, the potential high-speed rail corridor between Oslo-Stavanger, estimated for 250 km/h obtained from the NHSRA by Bergsdal et al. (2012). Our results from this assessment account for the use of cement, steel and copper as the environmentally most important materials. Among the railway components, the tunnel lining and grout constitute the highest emission level of the case corridor. The different technical alternatives are compared against the technologies traditionally applied in Norway, and an average level of support work, which represents the baseline results of this thesis. Our results indicate that the double shielded tunnel-boring machine is the technology that contributes to the highest increase of emission level compared to baseline. Further, the variables that hold the greatest potential of reducing total emission level is the installation of slab track in tunnels and bridges, and level of grout in the tunnel construction. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} written in {{cooperation}} with the Robbins Company to: - Document the effect of using large diameter cutters (19 ”) compared to smaller diameters (17 ”) - Document the effect of using 20 ” cutter rings on 19 ” cutters - Evaluate Robbins estimation methods to the NTNU-method and the recorded data. The report starts with a short introduction to cutter wear and the factors influencing on it. Before presenting acalculation of the effects the difference cutter diameters theoretical will have on advance rate and cutter life. The calculations suggest an advance rate of a 10 meter diameter TBM with 17 ” cutters being 77. 3 % of the rate of aTBM with 19 ” cutters. The 20 ” cutters will have an advance rate of 91. 3 % of the 19 ” cutter machine. The cutter lifein hours is calculated to be 13 % lower for a machine with 17 ” cutters than a machine with 19 ”. The effect of using 20 ” cutter rings is calculated to extend the cutter life in hours with 16 %. The field work on the thesis is done on two 10 m diameter <b>double</b> shield TBMs <b>boring</b> in India, the AMR 1 projectand the Veligonda Project. Both machines are utilizing 19 ” with 20 ” cutter rings. The geological conditions arevarying for both projects. The field testing and the lab testing is done according to the NTNU model and includes net penetration tests andchip analysis. The processing and calculations are done according to the NTNU-model. The AMR 1 project has had an average penetration rate of 1. 62 m/h and a cutter life of 1. 25 h/c, or 2. 02 m/h. TheVeligonda project has an average penetration rate slightly higher 1. 90 m/h. The cutter life has been significantly higher with 12. 75 h/c in the first period at the project. On the second period it was a change in the geology and thecutter life was reduced to 1. 90 h/c. The utilization rates for the projects have been generally low with an averagemachine utilization of around 30 %. When comparing the results to comparable projects it gives the following indications: - The advance rate is significantly improved when using large cutter diameters. - The 20 ” cutter rings have a beneficial effect on weekly advance rates in hard and abrasive rock. - The 20 ” cutter rings gives a slight economic saving in hard and abrasive rock compared to 19 ” cutter rings. The estimation of the AMR project from NTNU and Robbins has some major differences. This has been looked at indetail and it gives an indication of a systematically overestimation in advance rate and cutter life for the Robbinsestimates. This leads to an underestimation of the cutter costs of the AMR 1 project. The biggest differences in theestimates are at the AMR 2 where the boring still has not started.  </p...|$|R
