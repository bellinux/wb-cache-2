5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing. The exhaust {{problem was}} never adequately resolved, and continued to beat down onto the air-smoothed casing when the engine was on the move, obscuring the driver's vision <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each train {{runs with}} a three-person crew: two {{operators}} control the train <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> {{at the front}} end of the train and handle related operations, while a third crew member is the Customer Service Ambassador. Stationed in a designated car in the middle of each train, the Customer Service Ambassador operates the doors and wheelchair ramp, makes station stop announcements, and is dedicated to assisting customers on board. Bombardier Transportation is responsible for providing train operations, taking over from CN crews in 2007 and CP crews in 2015. GO trains achieve on-time performance of approximately 95%, and a refund will be provided if a train is more than 15 minutes late, with some conditions.|$|E
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driverâ€™s forward vision <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E

25|$|The {{financing}} for the employee group's planned purchase fell through, and as Continental was preparing a public announcement, Feldman {{committed suicide in}} his Los Angeles office. TIA received approval for its purchase <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAB,</b> and President Ronald Reagan did not block the deal. The legal battles between the two companies ended in November, with Lorenzo and two associates elected {{to the board of}} directors of Continental.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{lineside signals}} {{operated}} by a signaller would control train movements, ETCS will signal trains via a computer without lineside apparatus. In effect, the train creates its own 'buffer zone' through a digital signal transmitted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> An onboard computer on the train will inform {{the driver of the}} 'allowable speed and movement of the train.' TMS allows delays to be minimised through a computer running algorithms and deciding how best to return traffic patterns to normal.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{traction}} {{was introduced}} in 1905 with electric multiple units operating between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the railway purchased electric locomotives, exchanged for steam locomotives at Harrow from 1908. In 1910, a seventeen-minute silent film recording was made showing large portions of the journey from Baker Street to Aylesbury and Uxbridge, seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> of a train. The film survives and is publicly available.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{passenger}} <b>cabs</b> are mechanically separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lift mechanism, {{thus allowing}} the elevator shafts {{to be used}} continuously while passengers board and embark <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabs,</b> as well as move through show scenes on various floors. <b>The</b> passenger <b>cabs,</b> which are automated guided vehicles or AGVs, move into the vertical motion shaft and lock themselves in before the elevator starts moving vertically. Multiple elevator shafts are used to further improve passenger throughput. The doorways of the top few [...] "floors" [...] of the attraction {{are open to the}} outdoor environment, thus allowing passengers to look out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of the structure.|$|R
25|$|The Budd Rail Diesel Car, RDC or Buddliner is a {{self-propelled}} diesel {{multiple unit}} (DMU) railcar. Between 1949 and 1962, 398 RDCs were built by the Budd Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The cars were primarily adopted for passenger service in rural areas with low traffic density or in short-haul commuter service, and were less expensive to operate in this context than a traditional diesel locomotive-drawn train with coaches. The cars could be used singly or several could be coupled together in train sets and controlled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> of the front unit. The RDC {{was one of the}} few DMU trains to achieve commercial success in North America. RDC trains were an early example of self-contained {{diesel multiple unit}} trains, an arrangement now in common use by railways all over the world.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-size}} replica {{steam locomotive}} GWR 3031 Class named The Queen was built at Steamtown, Carnforth, {{and this was}} combined with an ex-South Eastern and Chatham Railway tender and fittings from a GWR tender. The locomotive's bogie and rear wheels are also from another GWR tender, but the large driving wheels are only half complete (the lower half) {{and they do not}} sit directly on the rails. This allowed the locomotive to be rolled into position when the exhibition was built. The replica was completed in December 1982 and delivered by road in January 1983. Two mobile cranes hoisted it onto the viaduct, then it was rolled into position on temporary track. Tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators so that steam was emitted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> whistles and safety valves, and smoke from the chimney. A sound unit was also fitted.|$|E
500|$|The heating of the {{passenger}} cab is by a conventional [...] "wet" [...] automotive system. Heat {{is derived from the}} traction battery via a resistance element. Use of the heater significantly reduces range. The traction motor cooling system runs at much lower temperatures than in a conventional car and is therefore separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> heating system. While the car is charging, the interior can be preheated to alleviate the range reduction problem.|$|E

50|$|Works on {{the station}} were ended in 1906 before the lift shafts were dug and before any work on a surface {{building}} was done. Services began on the CCE&HR on 22 June 1907, running through the abandoned station. The uncompleted platforms and lower passageways remain, bricked off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tracks.

500|$|The {{locomotive}} {{also carried}} a similar [...] "air-smoothed" [...] casing to the Merchant Navy class. This was not regarded as streamlining by Bulleid, a fact {{demonstrated by the}} flat front end. Authorities differ as {{to the purpose of}} the casing. According to Creer it was intended to be an aid in cleaning the locomotive with carriage washers to reduce labour requirements during the post-war period, whereas Bradley asserts that the intention was to lift the steam and exhaust gases away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> As with the Merchant Navies, the class soon gained the nickname [...] "Spam Cans", due to the resemblance to the distinctive tin cans in which [...] "SPAM" [...] was sold.|$|E
500|$|On 16 June 2011, a {{fire started}} in the snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station on the Bergen Line. As the station is unmanned, there was no prior warning of the fire until the driver saw it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> just as the train entered the tunnel. More or less simultaneously, the train reached {{the point of the}} line were the fire had damaged the {{overhead}} supply. The driver immediately applied the emergency brake, which caused the train to stop [...] from the fire. Because the train had no power, {{it was not possible to}} reverse out. The 257 passengers were then immediately evacuated. All personnel acted according to regulations and no-one was injured in the accident. According to the driver, had he not lost the power, he would have continued through the tunnel, as the fire was just at the beginning stage. The train, which consisted of two Class 73 units, no. 10 and 13, eventually caught fire and was damaged beyond repair. Class 73 trains are to be taken out of service on the Bergen Line from the fall of 2012.|$|E
500|$|McVeigh {{then added}} a dual-fuse {{ignition}} system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled twoholes {{in the cab}} of the truck under the seat, while twoholes were also drilled {{in the body of}} the truck. Onegreen cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around [...] of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the [...] of Tovex Blastrite Gel [...] "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about [...] of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the twomen separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.|$|E

500|$|... 4859 {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 1982, while still in Strasburg. The deed to 4859 was {{transferred}} from Redevelopment Authority to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission on November13, 1986. Two days later, the engine was moved into the Transportation Center and rededicated. The Pennsylvania General Assembly designated 4859 the official state electric locomotive on December18, 1987, while also designating two K4s locomotives as the state steam locomotives in the same bill. 4859 was listed on National Register of Historic Places {{for a second time}} on May5, 2004. [...] "Soft" [...] materials, like insulation, were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> in 2005 on orders from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to remove residual contamination from the PCBs. [...] In 2010, 4859 received some cosmetic restoration of its truck assemblies which were re-painted black to eliminate a noticeable coating of rust. [...] On April 5, 2014, the locomotive and its caboose were temporarily moved west of the Transportation Center, approximately , to a siding, and covered with tarpaulins to allow Amtrak to perform renovation work on the station's catenary, signals, switches and tracks. [...] By October 17, 2015, the renovations were complete enough to allow 4859 to return to the station, though the project overall remains in progress.|$|E
500|$|A {{fire started}} in the snow tunnel at Hallingskeid on 16 June 2011. It was caused by sparks from welding, which had been {{completed}} at 07:45. A freight train passed through the station at 09:16 and the welders left the station at 09:30. The passenger trains which caught on fire, pass through the station at 10:06. As the station is unmanned, there was no prior warning of the fire until the driver saw it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> just as the train entered the tunnel. At nearly the same instance, he reached {{the point of the}} line where the fire had caused the power to cut. He immediately applied the emergency brake, which allowed the train to stop [...] from the fire. Because the train had no power, {{it was not possible to}} reverse out. The 257 passengers were then immediately evacuated, which took 15 to 20 minutes, and included two people in a wheelchair. Passengers were told to not bring any possessions with them, and many passengers lost valuables, such as laptop computers. All personnel acted according to regulations and no-one was injured in the accident. According to the motorman, had he not lost the power, he would have continued through the tunnel, as the fire was just beginning.|$|E
