The products include cloud amount, phase, optical depth, temperature, height and pressure, thickness, effective particle size, and ice or liquid water path, shortwave albedo, and outgoing longwave radiation for each imager pixel. Because aircraft icing depends on cloud temperature, droplet size, and liquid water content as well as aircraft variables, it is possible to estimate the potential icing conditions from the cloud phase, temperature, effective droplet size, and liquid water path.

40|$|Guided {{waves are}} an {{efficient}} non-destructive tool in inspection and fault detection of elongated structures. Due {{to the special}} characteristics of composite materials, study of guided wave propagation in them has been an interest. In the current work, application of guided waves is investigated in ice detection on composite materials which is a well-known problem in wind turbine industry. The possibility of detecting a layer of ice on a composite plate is first investigated by a 2 D isotropic-anisotropic multilayer model. The wave equation is solved and dispersion curves are obtained. Results show that adding a second isotropic layer {{on top of an}} anisotropic material causes reduction in phase and group velocity of the first symmetric mode. Effects of low temperature on the received signal is investigated using an experimental test setup. Measurements show that lowering the temperature causes drop in amplitude and temporal phase shift in the received signal. These effects were handled by a modification of the Baseline Signal Stretch method. The modification is based on decomposing the signal into symmetric and asymmetric modes and applying two different stretch factors on each of them. Computational modelling of the problem is performed by first developing a 2 D model which shows that accretion of ice causes reduction in phase and group velocities of the incident wave and creates reflections. The model is developed further to a 3 D shell model, in which ice is placed on the plate by changing the properties of specific elements in the icing region. The Baseline Signal Stretch with the mode decomposition method is applied to the model for temperature variations. Effects of ice accretion on a composite plate is studied in time, frequency and wavenumber domains. In each case post-processing approaches are introduced for this specific application. Moreover, <b>icing</b> <b>index</b> is introduced which is sensitive to accumulated ice on the plate. The experimental study is performed in a cold climate lab in three different steps. The first part to get general understanding about the effects of ice accretion on waves propagating in a composite plate. Next, to understand the effects of temperature on the received signal and calibrate the temperature model and finally a more accurate study by installing 24 accelerometers and manufacturing a layer of ice on the plate to validate the results obtained by the computational model. Using the model and introduced criteria both thickness and location of ice on the plate are identified. All the results show that application of guided waves is a promising and accurate tool in ice detection on composite plates...|$|E

The clouds formed {{in a cold}} air outbreak over the open Greenland Sea. Beside the predominant mixed-phase clouds pure liquid water and ice clouds were observed. Utilizing measurements of solar radiation reflected by the clouds three methods to retrieve the thermodynamic phase of the cloud are introduced and compared. Two <b>ice</b> <b>indices</b> IS and IP were obtained by analyzing the spectral pattern of the cloud top reflectance in the near infrared (1500 – 1800 nm wavelength) spectral range which is characterized by ice and water absorption. While IS analyzes the spectral slope of the reflectance in this wavelength range, IS utilizes a principle component analysis (PCA) of the spectral reflectance. A third <b>ice</b> <b>index</b> IA {{is based on the}} different side scattering of spherical liquid water particles and nonspherical ice crystals which was recorded in simultaneous measurements of spectral cloud albedo and reflectance. Radiative transfer simulations show that IS, IP and IA range between 5 to 80, 0 to 8 and 1 to 1. 25 respectively with lowest values indicating pure liquid water clouds and highest values pure ice clouds. The spectral slope <b>ice</b> <b>index</b> IS and the PCA <b>ice</b> <b>index</b> IP are found to be strongly sensitive to the effective diameter of the ice crystals present in the cloud.

A large proportion of undergraduate students intending to pursue MSTE majors switch to other majors after taking introductory courses in math, biology, physics and other courses that constitute a requirement for science and engineering degrees (Astin, 1993). This investigation utilized quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the academic performance of students at a large public research university. In the quantitative phase, two efficiency indices were computed for eleven course sequences for MSTE majors using student cohorts from 1993 - 1999. The <b>ICE</b> <b>index</b> is the average number of attempts it takes a cohort of students to pass a introductory (gateway) course. An index closer to 1 indicates an efficient course, since an index of 1 means that all students passed the course in the first attempt. The <b>ICE</b> 2 <b>index</b> measures the rate of success of students taking the second course in a gateway sequence. The <b>ICE</b> 2 <b>index</b> ranges from 0 to 1.

We have also updated the <b>ice</b> refractive <b>index</b> used in the model and accounted for the dependence of the radiative heating and collisional cooling terms on particle tempe;ature. Finally, a radiation model {{has been used to}} calculate the solar, terrestrial and atmospheric radiative inputs including the effects of multiple scattering and atmospheric absorption. As with the previous models, the particle temperature is calculated under steady-state conditions, assuming the background gas temperature remains constant and the aerosol does not change size, state or altitude. Under these conditions, the largest differences from previous models occur {{as a result of the}} updated <b>ice</b> <b>index</b> of refraction, particularly in the visible, which produces significantly less aerosol heating. These temperatures are combined with the observed properties of mesospheric aerosols to place limits on the water vapour mixing ratio, vertical-wind speeds, and maximum particle sizes.

On the basis of September SICs for each time-period, an index was constructed which was used to identify anomalous high/low SIC years for both the original, {{as well as for}} the linearly detrended sea <b>ice</b> <b>index.</b> Identified years were then used to derive composites for the following winter's monthly atmospheric variables. Mid-troposphere geopotential height composites for winter months are in general reminiscent of the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern with high latitude maximum shifted towards the Barents Sea. Also, lower troposphere temperatures indicate the presence of cooler conditions over the continents during low SIC years. However, differences in the composite patterns are significant only for areas with limited spatial extent.

Methodology - In the developed economies only specific products, processes and functions that outperform emerging economies in Global Value Chains are able {{to profit from the}} larger share of value added. Large portion of "green economy" is knowledge intensive, and if knowledge based economy (KBC) plays a significant role in determining the domestic value added created by exports, economies with a larger stock of KBC should have a larger difference in VAX between knowledge-intensive industries and less knowledge-intensive industries. Domestic value added embodied in exports can be proxied by attracted FDI. Findings - The results seem to show some support to the hypothesis. In Croatia it has already been shown that sectors of economy with larger stock of intellectual capital measured by Intellectual Capital Efficiency (<b>ICE)</b> <b>index</b> attracted more FDI, which can also serve as a predictor for larger value added in exports due to higher productivity.

The objective {{of this study is}} to provide a map of icing events over 32. years (1979 to 2010) that describes the severity of winter icing. This information will prove useful to prevent damages and economical losses due to icing events by documenting the risk factor. To validate the icing climatology method, two case studies involving two topographically contrasting sites were selected: a simple terrain site which is the airport of Bagotville, near Saguenay (Canada) and a complex terrain site located in Mt Bélair, near Quebec City (Canada). Ice accumulation calculated by the use of reanalysis data was quantified using ice accretion on a cylinder model. Comparison between measurement and the model over Bagotville revealed insignificant differences in ice accumulation less than 0. 3. mm, and in duration of icing events less than 0. 2. day. On the other hand, during winter months, the calculation that showed a maximum of 60. mm in January 1999 over Mt Bélair site also had an underestimation of ice accumulation that varies from 5. mm to 16. mm. The horizontal resolution of NARR imposes a challenge on the calculation of icing events over complex terrains, especially during the months of November and March when air temperature is near freezing point. Taking into account the liquid water content, the duration of icing events and the classes of icing events as weighting factors, the <b>icing</b> severity <b>index</b> based on reanalysis data was introduced to assess the severity level of icing events, covering the north-east of Quebec including Quebec City, Sept-Iles, the east of Saguenay, the lower St Lawrence River and the Gaspe region. Consequently, an <b>icing</b> severity <b>index</b> mapping that represents the climatology of in-cloud atmospheric icing was produced...|$|R

The study area is within 73 degrees- 103 degreesE and 25 degrees- 40 degreesN (a total land area of 4. 7 million km(2)), and includes the highest alpine region in the world (e. g. Himalaya Mountains, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Pamirs Plateau, Karakoram Range). In the VGT-based mapping approach, the Normalized Difference Snow/ <b>Ice</b> <b>Index</b> (NDSII) is calculated as NDSII=(B 2 -MIR) /(B 2 + MIR), where the ground reflectance values of the red band (VGT band B 2) and the mid-infrared band (VGT band MIR) are used. When NDSII and the reflectance value of the near-infrared band (VGT band B 3) in a pixel (1 km x 1 km) meet the thresholds of NDSII {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 40 and band B 3 > 0. 11, the pixel is assigned to be snow/ice cover. Total areas of snow/ice cover in the alpine region had large seasonal variations, ranging from 0. 46 million km(2) in 11 - 20 March 1999 to 0. 05 million km(2) in 1 - 10 August 1999 to 0. 60 million km(2) in 11 - 20 November 1999. Spatial distributions of snow/ice cover also varied substantially across the alpine region. There were large areas of snow/ice cover in the north-western part of the alpine region in March and April, but large areas of snow/ice cover in the eastern part of the alpine region in October and November. Qualitatively, spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of snow/ice cover in the alpine region are closely correlated to the plateau monsoon climate and its precipitation patterns...|$|R
30|$|The Bayesian {{multi-level}} {{spatial analysis}} found for EDS >  12 the density, the Maly Index and Factor 2 improved the model {{but were not}} significant. Low % no support, low % poor schooling and Factor 6 improved the model and were significant. Factor 6 significantly improved the Bayesian multi-level model reducing the DIC from 5215 to 5209 (Eastwood 2011, p. 289). In the stratified multilevel analysis measures of social capital did not improve the model for mothers born in Australia but for those mothers not born in Australia <b>ICE,</b> Maly <b>Index,</b> % no support and % poor schooling improved the model for EDS >  9 and EDS >  12 (Eastwood et al. 2013 c). These findings are paradoxical and suggesting that low group level social capital may be protective when controlling for individual level measures of support.|$|R
