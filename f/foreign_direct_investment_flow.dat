This paper attempts to show that dynamic intra-regional FDI (<b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> <b>investment)</b> <b>flow</b> driven by market forces from late 1980 s already began to act as an important catalyst to foster increased intra-regional {{economic integration}}. Factor exchanges accelerated commodity exchanges due mostly to intra-regional economic dynamism since the breakdown of the Cold-War, forced industrial restructuring caused by shaping new intra-regional division of labor, and market preemption effort seeking market potential in China. This, in turn, might result in what is referred to as “natural interdependence” in the intra-regional countries. This market-driven natural interdependence has stronger probability of evolving into an institutional economic integration if the market opening and crossing FDI proceeds further. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{volatility}} of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows, particularly those into ASEAN countries is well known. Still researchers {{will continue to}} use regression approaches to analyze this volatility. This paper is an exploratory approach to analyzing the behavior of FDI with no attempt to design a complete regression model. Our approach is probabilistic in that we treat the FDI flows from home or source country to various members of ASEAN as random independent events over the time period 1999 - 2003 and over ISIC manufacturing sectors. We then show how closely the random plots of FDI fit two common cumulative distribution functions (CDF), the Gumbel and the Weibull and whether the plots are from multi-regimes or not. A brief econometric analysis shows FDI volatility within the ISIC industrial sectors. The essential thesis (or hypothesis) is that if capital markets are in a general equilibrium across hosts, home, industrial sectors, and time, then the return on capital (the marginal efficiency of capital) is equalized everywhere, and a home investor’s dollar will be randomly allocated across hosts, industrial sectors, and time. <b>Foreign</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment,</b> <b>Flow</b> Volatility...|$|E

Cointegration among the variables was established using auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) models {{in the presence of}} a mix of I (0) and I (1) variables. The control variables, inflation and trade openness were statistically significant in the short run. Whilst inflation exerted a negative effect on FDI inflow; trade openness positively induced FDI inflow. GDP per capita and exchange rate did not statistically significantly influence FDI inflow in the short run. In respect of the key variable GIPC, in the short run, there was a positive but statistically insignificant effect on FDI inflow. The estimated long-run ARDL model showed that macroeconomic variables such as inflation, GDP and trade openness determined FDI inflow into Ghana. Notwithstanding the positive relationship between establishment of IP agency (GIPC) and FDI inflow, this relationship was statistically insignificant. Greater efforts at macroeconomic management specifically, promotion of external trade, increasing GDP and reducing inflation holds more promise to attracting FDI into Ghana. GIPC should be maintained to provide a supportive role when the foreign investors arrive in Ghana. </p...|$|E

From the year of 2003 when the “statistical bulletin of Chinese foreign direct” was first published to the year of 2014, Chinese <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>flow</b> grew from $ 28.5 billion to $ 1231.2 billion and the accumulated stock grew from $ 299 billion to $ 8826.4 billion, with the average annual growth rate being 40.8 and 36.0  %, respectively. In 2014, Chinese foreign direct investment accounted for 9.1 and 3.4  % of global flow and stock, respectively, ranks the third and eighth in the world; 18.5 thousand Chinese investors have set up 29.7 thousand enterprises that distribute in 186 foreign countries (territories), which indicates that China has gradually developed from a capital attraction country to an investment country. At the same time, China has long become a major exporting economy since the 1990 s. China’s total exports in 2014 amounted to $ 2.34 trillion, ranking first in the world. In the new background that China actively promotes the “One Belt and One Road” strategy in neighboring countries, it is a greater development opportunity for Chinese foreign direct investment, which makes the effect of foreign direct investment on export trade an important issue. Different conclusions indicate different policy implications: if the OFDI of China had a promoting effect on exports, it would be necessary to take potential trade frictions and dispute risks into consideration and to properly manage the expanding trade surplus and exchange pressures on RMB. If the OFDI of China had a substitution effect on export, it would be necessary to assess the negative effect of capital export and shrinking export on domestic economic growth and employment {{in order to avoid the}} repeating mistake of industrial hollowing-out caused by OFDI as some developed countries have experienced in history (Liu and Nie 2014).|$|E

The comparison of regional processes, institutional systems, experience and the originating potential future scenarios of transition economies are interesting but yet under-examined fields of study. Is there a specific way (trajectory) of regionalization in transition economies, or practices vary from country to country? Do EU level policy changes affect national and sub-national level institutions and processes and if yes, for what extent?
