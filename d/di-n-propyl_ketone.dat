40|$|Photochemical {{sources of}} peroxycarboxylic nitric {{anhydrides}} (PANs) are utilized in many atmospheric measurement techniques for calibration or to deliver an internal standard. Conventionally, such sources rely on phosphor-coated low-pressure mercury (Hg) lamps {{to generate the}} UV light necessary to photo-dissociate a dialkyl ketone (usually acetone) {{in the presence of}} a calibrated amount of nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O 2). In this manuscript, a photochemical PAN source in which the Hg lamp has been replaced by arrays of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) is described. The output of the UV-LED source was analyzed by gas chromatography (PAN-GC) and thermal dissociation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-CRDS). Using acetone, diethyl ketone (DIEK), diisopropyl ketone (DIPK), or <b>di-n-propyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (DNPK), respectively, the source produces peroxyacetic (PAN), peroxypropionic (PPN), peroxyisobutanoic (PiBN), or peroxy-n-butanoic nitric anhydride (PnBN) from NO in high yield (> 90 %). Box model simulations with a subset of the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) were carried out to rationalize product yields and to identify side products. The present work demonstrates that UV-LED arrays are a viable alternative to current Hg lamp setups...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe methyl cation and CF(3) (+) attack saturated, acyclic ketones to make vibrationally excited adduct ions. Despite {{their high}} {{internal}} energies and short lifetimes, these adducts undergo deep-seated rearrangements that parallel slower processes in solution. Observed pathways include alkene and alkane expulsions, {{in addition to}} (in the case of CF(3) (+)) the precedented loss of CF(2) O + HF. For {{the vast majority of}} ketones, the principal charged products are the CF(3) (+) adducts of lighter carbonyl compounds, ions that are not easily prepared by other avenues. Evidence for ion structures comes from collisionally activated unimolecular decomposition and bimolecular ion-molecule reactions. Typical examples are <b>di-n-propyl</b> and diisopropyl <b>ketones</b> (both of which produce CH(3) CH=OCF(3) (+) as the principal ion-molecule reaction product) and pentamethylacetone (which produces (CH(3)) (2) C=OCF(3) (+) as virtually the sole ion-molecule reaction product). Isotopic labeling experiments account for mechanisms, and DFT calculations provide a qualitative explanation for the relative abundances of products from unimolecular decompositions of the chemically activated CF(3) (+) adduct ions that are initially formed...|$|R
