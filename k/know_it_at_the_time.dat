500|$|Though {{her crew}} did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> West Honaker had been {{selected}} {{to be one of}} the blockships for the Allied invasion of France, then in the planning stages. Blockships dispatched from Boston, like West Honaker, were loaded with [...] "tons of sand and cement" [...] before their final U.S. departures. West Honaker sailed from Boston on 25 March 1944 as a part of Convoy BX-101 to Halifax and, from there, Convoy SC-156 to Cardiff. In his book Beyond the Palisades, Cesar Poropat, West Honakers chief engineer, reports that after the ship's cargo was discharged, the ship was suddenly boarded by shipyard workers who cut holes in [...] "strategic places" [...] and positioned [...] "mysterious packs" [...] around the hull. The crew suspected, correctly, that these packs were explosives and that the ship was being prepared for sinking. Though there is no specific mention of this occurring on West Honaker, other blockships selected for the Normandy beachhead had their existing antiaircraft weapons moved higher on the ship and supplemented by additional guns.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, Arsenal {{made the}} bold but {{ultimately}} unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager, despite {{his lack of}} managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club. Like his two immediate predecessors, Wright was not very successful, although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition, in the 1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 1962–63. In his final season, Arsenal finished 14th, their lowest position in 36 years, and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury — 4,554 in a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966. [...] The only Arsenal player to figure in England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning squad was George Eastham, who did not play at all during the tournament. Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board {{in the summer of}} 1966, and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee. Though the club's directors did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years.|$|E

500|$|In September, {{the album}} entered Billboards album charts; the highest {{position}} Freewheelin reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one {{million copies in}} the US. Dylan himself came to acknowledge Freewheelin as the album that marked {{the start of his}} success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: [...] "Although I didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." [...] Besides [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" [...] and [...] "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" [...] have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of global success. John Lennon recalled: [...] "In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all. Paul got the record (The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan) from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan." ...|$|E

60|$|The meal being {{finished}} which I {{thought it}} was well to shorten lest he should eat too much who was so weak, again he lifted up his eyes as though in gratitude, and {{as a sign of}} thankfulness, or so I suppose, knelt before me, took my hand, and pressed it against his forehead, thereby, although I did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> vowing himself to my service. Then seeing how weary he was I conducted him back to the chamber and pointed out the bed to him, shutting my eyes to show that he should sleep there.

60|$|It was {{the very}} middle of the summer before Peter Rabbit again saw Dandy the Waxwing. Quite by chance he {{discovered}} Dandy sitting on the tiptop of an evergreen tree, as if on guard. He was on guard, for in that tree was his nest, though Peter didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> In fact, it was so late in the summer that most of Peter's friends were through nesting and he had quite lost interest in nests. Presently Dandy flew down to a lower branch {{and there he was}} joined by Mrs. Waxwing. Then Peter was treated to one of the prettiest sights he ever had seen. They rubbed their bills together as if kissing. They smoothed each other's feathers and altogether were a perfect picture of two little lovebirds. Peter couldn't think of another couple who appeared quite so gentle and loving.|$|E
6000|$|No {{matter how}} baroque any church was, it could express {{something}} of this sincerity, {{and in their}} way the worshippers seemed always simply at home in it. In San Lorenzo in Lucina, where I {{went to see the}} truly sublime [...] "Crucifixion" [...] by Guido (there is also a bar of St. Lawrence's gridiron to be seen, but I did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time)</b> I liked the unconsciousness of the girl kneeling before the high altar and provisionally gossiping with the young sacristan before she began her devotions. She gave her mind to them when he asked me if I wished to see the Guido, for I could see her lips moving while she shared my veneration of that most affecting masterpiece; the more genuinely affecting because it expresses the rapture and not the anguish of the Passion. I have no doubt she was grateful when the sacristan proposed my having the electric light turned on it, and when, though that I knew it would cost me something more, I assented.|$|E
60|$|In his cruel {{disappointment}} and fully aroused indignation, he at once {{began to suspect}} a connection of circumstances which at any other moment he would have thought purely accidental, or perhaps not have considered at all. The cavity in the tree had evidently {{been used as a}} secret receptacle for letters before; did Mamie <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and how did she know it? The apparent age of the letter made it preposterous to suppose that it pointed to any secret correspondence of hers with young Mr. Slinn; and the address was not in her handwriting. Was there any secret previous intimacy between the families? There was but one way in which he could connect this letter with Mamie's faithlessness. It was an infamous, a grotesquely horrible idea, a thought which sprang as much from his inexperience of the world and his habitual suspiciousness of all humor as anything else! It was that the letter was a brutal joke of Slinn's--a joke perhaps concocted by Mamie and himself--a parting insult that should at the last moment proclaim their treachery and his own credulity. Doubtless it contained a declaration of their shame, and the reason why she had fled from him without a word of explanation. And the enclosure, of course, was some significant and degrading illustration. Those Americans are full of those low conceits; it was their national vulgarity.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{about the}} season {{came in the}} second week, when the Steelers {{suffered}} a rare shutout loss to the Los Angeles Rams 27-0 {{in one of the}} team's last visit to the Los Angeles area in the foreseeable future.

Though no one <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>it</b> would foreshadow what was to come with Bettis' career—as a member of the Steelers, who would acquire Bettis in a draft day trade with the Rams three years later.|$|R
