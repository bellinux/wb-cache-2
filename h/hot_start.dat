5|$|After the <b>hot</b> <b>start,</b> a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February occurred {{during which the}} Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over the coaching duties himself. After the coaching switch, team performance improved but did not match {{the performance of the}} beginning of the season. A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were swept in a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the buy-out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents.|$|E
5|$|The Jets {{opened their}} season against the Houston Texans. Ryan began his head {{coaching}} career with a 24–7 {{victory over the}} Texans in which the Jets' defense shut out their opponents' offense. Houston's lone score came on a fumble return for a touchdown. The following week, the defense did not allow a touchdown against the New England Patriots in a 16–9 victory at home, marking the Jets' first home victory over New England since 2000. Ryan and the Jets went on to defeat the Tennessee Titans in Week 3, marking {{the first time the}} Jets opened the season at 3–0 since 2004. The victory also allowed Ryan to become the Jets' first rookie head coach to win his first three games since Al Groh did so in 2000. Despite their <b>hot</b> <b>start,</b> New York went on to lose six of their next seven games save for a shutout victory over the Oakland Raiders, 38–0.|$|E

25|$|On {{opening day}} at the Rogers Centre, the Jays, led by Roy Halladay, beat the Detroit Tigers 12–5. On June 9, with the 20th pick in the MLB draft, the Jays {{selected}} RHP Chad Jenkins, a power pitcher that has drawn comparisons to David Wells and Gustavo Chacín (passing over Mike Trout who was picked 25th by the Angels). Aaron Hill and Roy Halladay both had excellent years and represented the Blue Jays at the 2009 All-Star Game in St. Louis. In mid-August, J. P. Ricciardi allowed the Chicago White Sox to claim Alex Ríos off waivers. Despite a <b>hot</b> <b>start,</b> the Jays quickly fell, including a 9-game losing streak, after starting with a 27–14 record. With two games remaining in what was a disappointing season, Ricciardi was fired on October 3. He was replaced by assistant general manager Alex Anthopoulos.|$|E

25|$|During the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, {{in which}} the team hosted, the Wild held the 10th overall pick, which was used to select Jonas Brodin. The club also created a stir when they traded star defenseman Brent Burns and a 2012 second round pick to the San Jose Sharks in {{exchange}} for Devin Setoguchi, Charlie Coyle, and the 28th overall pick in the 2011 draft which they used to select Zack Phillips. Later in the offseason, the Wild traded Martin Havlat for Dany Heatley in another blockbuster trade with the Sharks. In the month of November, the team set a franchise record for most wins in one month with 11. Despite a <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> to the season, which saw them sitting atop the league standings in early December, multiple injuries to key players for extended periods essentially knocked the team out of playoff contention for the fourth consecutive year.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> to the season, the Stars {{dominated}} {{the first half}} of the season, staying on the Pacific Division lead and staying in the top three spots of the conference. It seemed like the old Stars were back, as through {{the first half of}} the season, they went 30–15–6. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline, the Stars traded James Neal and Matt Niskanen to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Alex Goligoski. After an awful second half, the Stars still had a chance to make the playoffs by winning all their games in April. They won all of them except for last, as they lost to the Minnesota Wild 5–3, costing them a playoff spot.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} {{fourth in}} 1985, the Astros fired general manager Al Rosen and manager Bob Lillis. The former was supplanted by Dick Wagner, {{the man whose}} Reds defeated the Astros to win the 1979 NL West title. The latter was replaced by Hal Lanier who, like his manager mentor in St. Louis, Whitey Herzog, had a hard-nosed approach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching, defense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball, known as Whiteyball, took advantage of stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, {{both of which were}} characteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by storm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional slow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a <b>hot</b> <b>start,</b> winning 13 of their first 19 contests.|$|E

25|$|After getting only 2 {{points on}} draws {{in the first}} two games of the four-game homestand, United was desperate for a win when Portland Timbers came to town. The start of the game was delayed an hour because of record-setting heat that {{exceeded}} 100 degrees (on the Fahrenheit scale), but United got off to a <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> themselves. An early corner was headed on by Boswell to Birnbaum, who took his chance on a sharp volley to give D.C. an early lead. The team doubled that lead in the 29th minute, just before a scheduled heat break, when Acosta finished a chance in front of goal, set up by a nifty chipped pass from Mullins. Thanks to the usual heroics by Hamid, the team held on for a 2-0 shutout win that lifted United ahead of New England and at least temporarily holding the sixth and final postseason spot in the East.|$|E

Shelvin Mack kept Butler going as Butler would have a 20-18 lead at the under-8 TV Timeout. Then, Jon Scheyer would score four points in the next three minutes leading Duke to a 8-0 run giving them a 26-20 lead and Butler would call a 30-second timeout. During the next 70 seconds, Avery Jukes would score five points leading Butler to a 7-0 run which would result in a 27-26 Butler lead. While Jukes scored five points in the final two and a half minutes of the 1st half, Jon Scheyer scored four in that same time frame and Duke would lead 33-32 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|During the 2000–01 season, the 76ers {{got off to}} a <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> {{by winning}} their first ten games and were never seriously {{challenged}} in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41–14 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings {{at the time of the}} February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kukoč, and Pepe Sánchez to Atlanta (Sánchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56–26, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989–90 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "hot hatch" [...] version, the GT Turbo, was {{introduced}} in 1985.

25|$|For {{their home}} opener, the Dodgers beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 2–1. Ethier celebrated his 30th {{birthday}} by hitting an eighth-inning home {{run for the}} deciding run. Kershaw recovered from the flu by allowing only one earned run in seven innings of work, while striking out seven. The Dodgers improved to 5–1 on the season by beating the Pirates 4-1 the next day behind another strong start by Billingsley. The Dodgers beat the Pirates again the next night, 3–2, to complete the sweep of the series. The Dodgers 6-1 record to start the season was their best start since 1981. On April 13, Aaron Harang struck out 9 consecutive batters after giving up a single to set the all time Dodgers record against the Padres. The record was previously held by Johnny Podres with 8 in 1962. The streak was stopped by Will Venable when he hit an opposite field home run. Harang finished one strikeout short of tying Tom Seaver's Major League record of 10 in a row set in 1970 and tied his career high with 13 total strikeouts in the game. The Dodgers won the game 9–8 after the bullpen allowed the Padres to tie the score. The Dodgers continued their <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> by beating the Padres 6–1 behind two home runs by Kemp and one by Ethier. Ted Lilly made his first {{start of the season}} and pitched seven dominant innings for the win. The Dodgers swept the Padres with a wild 5-4 win on April 15. After taking a 4–1 lead, partially thanks to Matt Kemp's league leading 6th home run, the Dodgers allowed the Padres to tie the game at 4 heading to the ninth. With two on and no outs {{in the top of the}} ninth, Javy Guerra threw the ball inside on Jesús Guzmán, somehow the ball hit his bat and dribbled into fair Territory where A.J. Ellis threw it to third for the start of a triple play, the Dodgers first since 1998. The Padres protested that umpire Dale Scott had signaled that the ball was dead originally before changing his call. In the bottom of the inning, the Dodgers won the game on a walk-off single by Dee Gordon.|$|E
500|$|After the season, the Rockies {{declined}} to offer Hammonds salary arbitration, {{making him a}} free agent. Due to concerns about Hammonds' injury history, including 40 games missed due to injury in the 2000 season, the Rockies chose not to meet Hammonds' financial demands. Before the 2001 season, the Milwaukee Brewers signed Hammonds to a three-year, $21.75 million contract, the largest contract the organization had approved to that date. However, injuries prevented Hammonds from approaching the All-Star form he had shown with the Rockies. He suffered a shoulder injury in 2001 which required surgery and this limited him to 49 games played for the season. He returned with a <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> in the 2002 season, batting [...]324 as of June 5, {{but he had a}} recurrence of the shoulder injury later in the season that returned him to the disabled list yet again. Hammonds then began the 2003 season on the disabled list, this time with a high ankle sprain.|$|E
500|$|By {{virtue of}} his <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> with the Rangers, and his {{considerable}} power as a batter, Davis was dubbed [...] "Crush Davis" [...] by local media and fans (a play on [...] "Crash Davis" [...] from the movie Bull Durham). From July 22 through July 26, he had four straight multi-hit games. Davis played well enough that, upon Hank Blalock's return from the disabled list (DL) on August 22, he was moved to third base so he could remain in the lineup. He had four hits on September 26 in a 121 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In 80 games (295 at bats), Davis batted [...]285 with 84 hits, 23 doubles, 17 home runs, and 55 RBI. He struck out 88 times, which was 30% of his at bats. Defensively, he was much better at first base than third, with a [...]997 fielding percentage at first {{as opposed to a}} [...]962 percentage at third and a higher range factor as well.|$|E

50|$|The R-Series {{was mainly}} a stop gap, {{and had a}} very short {{production}} run that lasted barely two years. BL {{had been working on}} a more substantially revised version of the E-Series, but this was not ready for production in time for the Maestro's already badly delayed launch. The company was instead forced into launching the Maestro with the half-developed power unit which cost the company dearly - R-Series equipped Maestros soon gained a reputation for <b>hot</b> <b>starting</b> problems, cylinder head gasket failures (endemic to the E-Series also), and premature crankshaft failure. Because the E-Series was turned through 180 degrees in order to accommodate an end-on transmission, the R-Series was fitted to the Maestro with the carburettor facing the front of the car, which also led to a reputation for carburettor icing in cold weather.|$|R
5000|$|The {{car was a}} {{reasonable}} success, {{but not as much}} as beleaguered BL had hoped. It was Britain sixth best selling car in 1983 and 1984, with more than 80,000 sales in its second year. After the [...] "boom" [...] years of 1986 and 1987, Maestro sales went into terminal decline. An early reputation for poor build quality and unreliability did not help. The biggest problems centred around the 1.6-litre R-Series engine, which was a hurriedly modified BMC E-Series engine from the Austin Maxi because the under-developed S-Series unit was not yet ready for production. R-Series units suffered from <b>hot</b> <b>starting</b> problems and premature crankshaft failure. This was particularly evident in the MG Maestro 1600, which was included in the original 1983 model range but discontinued the following year.|$|R
