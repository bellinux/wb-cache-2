5|$|Chris Gragg {{was born}} on June 30, 1990, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Kelvin and Tenita Gragg, both of whom worked as educators. Kelvin coached the Warren High School {{football}} team, and Chris served as the team's water boy until he was in junior high school. For the Warren squad, Gragg played football as a wide receiver alongside future NFL players Jarius Wright and Greg Childs. During his senior year, Gragg accumulated 420 receiving yards and caught 8 touchdowns. Recruiting website Rivals.com evaluated him as a 2-star prospect on a 1–5 star scale and ranked Gragg as the 15th best player in Arkansas at his position, while Scout.com ranked him as the 148th best receiver in the nation. In July 2007, Gragg committed to the University of Arkansas, as <b>did</b> <b>three</b> other players from Warren.|$|E
5|$|Of the 118 Category 4 hurricanes {{that have}} {{formed in the}} eastern and central Pacific basins, 25 have made {{landfall}}. Of them, four made landfall at Category 4 intensity, three at Category 3, eleven at Categories 2 and 1, six as tropical storms, and five as tropical depressions. Several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining Category 4 status as they approached land; this is usually a result of dry air, shallower water due to shelving, cooler waters, or interaction with land. Only in five years – 1976, 1983, 1992, 1997, and 2014 – more than one Category 4 hurricane made landfall, and only during one year – 1992 – <b>did</b> <b>three</b> Category 4 hurricanes made landfall.|$|E
5|$|The 1907 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was at one}} point the only Atlantic {{hurricane season}} that did not feature a hurricane. With only five tropical storms having formed, it was a relatively inactive season; of those that <b>did,</b> <b>three</b> made landfall, of which all occurred on the shoreline of the Gulf Coast of the United States. The first storm of the season formed on June24, while the final dissipated on November12. Damage from the storms were minimal, and no deaths were reported. Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and four additional systems could have formed during the season. A documentation for four possible storms during the season exists, although it has not been proven that these systems were fully tropical.|$|E

25|$|In , ABC {{returned}} to baseball broadcasting {{with a series}} of late-afternoon Saturday games. Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. ABC typically <b>did</b> <b>three</b> games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants or Los Angeles Dodgers' home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game.|$|E

25|$|Ryan then {{entered the}} Vincentians, taking {{the oath of}} {{obedience}} to the Congregation. He <b>did</b> <b>three</b> more years of study at the College, {{in the course of}} which, on June 19, 1857, he received minor orders. During this time, the poetry he wrote to entertain his schoolmates impressed them, especially one who recorded the texts in a personal journal. In 1858, shortly {{after the death of his}} father, Ryan was sent to the Seminary of Our Lady of the Angels near Niagara Falls, New York. He was sent there both to pursue his study of theology and to serve as the prefect of discipline for the boys enrolled at the preparatory school attached to the seminary.|$|E
25|$|Another {{thematic}} source {{may have}} been William Baldwin's The Mirror for Magistrates (1559; 2nd edition, 1578), a well-known series of poems spoken by controversial historical figures who speak {{of their lives and}} deaths, and to warn contemporary society not to make the same mistakes they <b>did.</b> <b>Three</b> such figures are Margaret of Anjou, King Edward IV and Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. York's final scene, and his last speech in particular (1.4.111–171), are often identified as being the 'type' of scene suitable to a traditional tragic hero who has been defeated by his own ambition, and this is very much how York presents himself in Mirror, a tragic hero whose dynastic ambitions caused him to reach too far and led to his ruin.|$|E

Two states in the Northeast (Vermont and New York) had ratios higher than the national ratio. There were no states in the Midwest that had ratios higher than the national ratio. As a result, women's {{earnings were}} closer to men's in more states in the South and the West than in the Northeast and the Midwest.|$|E

During their visit to the US, the group met with influential radio programmers, TV networks, and magazines. In addition, Virgin persuaded fifty radio stations to playlist the song before it was released, while the music video was placed into heavy rotation by MTV.|$|E
