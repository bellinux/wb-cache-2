5|$|In {{the area}} around Green Lake there are forests of pecan, black willow, cedar, American elm, <b>hackberry</b> and green ash. To the south, the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife Management Area serves as a wetland habitat for {{thousands}} of permanent egrets, and other birds, including the brown pelican, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, wood stork, bald eagle, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, and the whooping crane. American alligators reside in the area as well.|$|E
5|$|In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds {{mainly on}} {{invertebrates}} collected from pasture, such as beetles (Selatosomus aeneus and Otiorhynchus morio {{have been recorded}} from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European <b>Hackberry</b> (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, perhaps {{as a source of}} carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
25|$|Larvae {{are known}} to feed on some species of alder, ash, birch, blueberry, chestnut, elm, grape, <b>hackberry,</b> hazel, oak, walnut, willow, and many others (Wagner, 2005). No serious injury to trees has been {{reported}} for this late-season feeder (Rose and Lindquist, 1982).|$|E

25|$|The cowpea, incense tree, <b>hackberry,</b> yams, and sorghum, {{are also}} {{known to have}} been grown. Grasses were most likely not {{harvested}} as often, as the climate makes it difficult for grasses to grow. Kintampo people also kept livestock; goats, sheep, and cattle remains have been found. Other wild animals such as monitor lizards, snails, guineafowl, vervet monkey, baboon, turtles and tortoises royal and duiker antelopes, giant pouched and cane rats were hunted as game.|$|E
25|$|Indiana bats {{were found}} {{in a variety of}} plant {{associations}} in a southern Iowa study. Riparian areas were dominated by eastern cottonwood, <b>hackberry</b> (Celtis occidentalis), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). In the forested floodplains, the dominant plants included black walnut (Juglans nigra), silver maple, American elm (Ulmus americana), and eastern cottonwood. In undisturbed upland forest, the most common plants were black oak (Quercus velutina), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). Black walnut, American basswood, American elm, and bur oak dominated other upland Indiana bat sites.|$|E
25|$|The term {{heartwood}} derives {{solely from}} its position {{and not from}} any vital importance to the tree. This {{is evidenced by the}} fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, <b>hackberry,</b> beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.|$|E
50|$|White-ankled Mice {{have been}} known to feed on a variety of seeds, {{including}} <b>hackberries,</b> acorns, juniper berries, and cactus fruit (Davis 1966 and Alvarex 1963).|$|R

Aquatic plants like cattail (Typha angustifolia), giant helleborine (Epipactis gigantea) and maidenhair fern (Adiantum capillus-veneris) are sustained by the stream that flows through the canyon. A botanical resource list is provided by the park staff.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{topographical}} settings, {{the environment}} of the Lake George site was extremely favorable for occupation. In prehistoric times the rich soils and the varying ecologies supported a vast array of plant and animal species. The natural levees created by deposits from the Mississippi were made of rich sandy and silty loams which allowed the common Southeastern deciduous hardwoods, such as hickory, elm, ash, cottonwood, maple, pecan, <b>hackberry,</b> honey locust, sycamore, and even gums and oaks to flourish. The swamps surrounding the site supported an entirely different ecosystem including alligators, small reptiles and aquatic plants. The streams and rivers also provided fish, shellfish, and other aquatic fauna, which can be seen from excavations of shell middens and deposits of the site. These waterways also provided a major form of communication. This abundant region was obviously utilized by many different peoples over the course of prehistory as the Holly Bluff Site shows.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans {{is located}} {{near to the}} Gulf of Mexico and its many oil rigs. Louisiana ranks fifth among states in oil {{production}} and eighth in reserves. It has {{two of the four}} Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage facilities: West <b>Hackberry</b> in Cameron Parish and Bayou Choctaw in Iberville Parish. The area hosts 17 petroleum refineries, with a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly , the second highest after Texas. Louisiana's numerous ports include the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), which is capable of receiving the largest oil tankers. Given the quantity of oil imports, Louisiana is home to many major pipelines: Crude Oil (Exxon, Chevron, BP, Texaco, Shell, Scurloch-Permian, Mid-Valley, Calumet, Conoco, Koch Industries, Unocal, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Locap); Product (TEPPCO Partners, Colonial, Plantation, Explorer, Texaco, Collins); and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Dixie, TEPPCO, Black Lake, Koch, Chevron, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, Dow Chemical Company, Bridgeline, FMP, Tejas, Texaco, UTP). Several energy companies have regional headquarters in the area, including Royal Dutch Shell, Eni and Chevron.

500|$|Construction in San Antonio {{also began}} in the 1960s and was {{completed}} in 1972. The first sections were completed in 1967 to include the portion just south of I-410 at the US 181 interchange. The section from Steves Avenue north to Florida Street to include the I-10 interchange was also complete in 1967. [...] In 1968, the section south of I-410 was extended south to Loop 1604. [...] In 1969, the two sections were connected with the completion of overpasses at Goliad Road, Pecan Valley Drive, Fair Avenue and <b>Hackberry</b> Street {{as well as the}} completion of the interchanges at I-410 and Loop 13. The last sections left were {{on the east side of}} downtown. The downtown overpasses at Durango Boulevard, Commerce Street and the overpass stretching from Houston Street to Jones Avenue were all completed in 1972. The last portion completed in San Antonio was the stack interchange at I-35 (also known as the San Antonio [...] "Downtown Mixer"), near the Pearl Brewery. With the completion of the interchange in 1972, the city had a complete freeway loop in conjunction with I-10 and I-35 around the central business district of the city. At the time construction began in July 1969, the I-35 interchange was the largest highway construction project in state history at $11 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of the [...] route of I-40 across Arizona took nearly 25 years to complete with the last segment being completed in 1984, much longer than the ambitious goal of finishing by 1972. [...] By the end of 1960, [...] had been completed with an additional [...] being worked on. [...] In 1964, construction was still on schedule with [...] complete and an additional [...] under construction.

[...] By 1967, Arizona had completed almost half of the highway with [...] complete and another [...] under construction. [...] In 1968, the bypass around Flagstaff was complete with three interchanges, two at each end of where US 66 split off from I-40 to enter the city and one at the I-17 interchange. [...] An additional interchange at Butler Avenue was completed a year later. [...] One of the big improvements of I-40 over US 66 was the {{construction of}} the segment between Kingman and Ash Fork. [...] The [...] section is a more direct route between the two cities and travels as far as [...] south of the US 66 alignment, bypassing <b>Hackberry</b> and Peach Springs and creating ghost towns. [...] Construction of the $69.1 million segment was also to be a much safer route as the US 66 alignment had one of the highest fatality rates of any section of highway in Arizona. [...] This section of the Interstate was complete in 1975. [...] Construction of the $7.7 million bypass around Winslow began in 1977.
