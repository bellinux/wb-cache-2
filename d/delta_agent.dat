40|$|To {{investigate}} the epidemiology of infection with delta (<b>delta)</b> <b>agent</b> in a Swedish city, 181 chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 599 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B were analyzed for delta antigen and antibody to delta antigen (anti-delta). The study covered {{the period from}} 1970 to 1981. The <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> {{was found to have}} been introduced to this population in 1973. Markers of infection with <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> were almost exclusively found in intravenous drug addicts and their close contacts. The proportion of drug addicts who were chronic HBsAg carriers with anti-delta increased with time and reached 72 % in 1979 - 1981. An episode of acute hepatitis was frequently seen in connection with seroconversion to anti-delta. Among the domestic cases of acute, self-limited hepatitis, no simultaneous infections with hepatitis B virus and <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> were found before 1975. From 1975 to 1980, between 18 % and 44 % of the drug addicts with acute hepatitis B were also infected with <b>delta</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|E

40|$|A direct, {{ribonuclease}} T 1 protection assay {{was employed}} to study the binding of a <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> genomic RNA transcript containing the conserved domain to the double-stranded RNA- (dsRNA-) dependent protein kinase of mammalian cells, PKR (also known as DAI, p 1 -elF 2, or p 68 kinase). In a control reaction, this assay identified {{a major portion of}} the same PKR binding site in VA RNA as deduced previously using a footprinting technique (Clarke PA, Mathews MB, 1995, RNA 1 : 1 - 20). Although <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> RNA contains extensive secondary structure throughout the conserved region, we found a remarkable specificity in its PKR binding. The same region was protected by intact PKR and by a 184 -amino acid fragment thereof containing the two RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) but lacking kinase activity. Two specific opposed, continuous segments of <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> RNA (extending about 65 - 70 bases) were obtained reproducibly. Each is more than twice as long as those protected in VA RNA (about 25 bases), suggesting the involvement of PKR dimers in delta RNA binding. The PKR-protected region of <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> RNA also contains a characteristic tertiary structural element that may be involved in binding specificity...|$|E
40|$|To seek {{patterns}} of nucleotide usage {{in the three}} types of circular subviral RNA pathogens, trimer frequencies and nearest-neighbor biases were studied in 12 plant viroid sequences; five sequences of circular plant viral satellite RNAs; and the sequence of RNA from the human hepatitis <b>delta</b> <b>agent.</b> The viroids and RNA of the <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> contain tracts of polypurines and polypyrimidines which make up substantial portions of their genomes. Such tracts are not common in the virusoids or in the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus. Viroids, the delta hepatitis agent, and the circular satellite RNAs of certain plant viruses have several features in common: all have circular genomic RNA and replicate through an RNA to RNA rolling circle replication cycle. However, virusoids and related satellite RNAs are directly or indirectly dependent on their helper viruses for replication, while the <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> and viroids are not. The difference in the pattern of nucleotide usage between the plant viral satellite RNAs on the one hand, and viroids and delta RNA on the other, may relate to this difference in replication strategy...|$|E
40|$|The genome of {{the human}} delta {{hepatitis}} agent is a circular, highly structured single-stranded RNA lacking regular runs of RNA-RNA duplex longer than 15 bp. We have tested the ability of <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> RNA to participate in reactions with a protein containing a motif which confers the ability to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Surprisingly, highly purified <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> RNA preparations from which all traces of contaminating dsRNA have been removed activate PKR, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase activity of mammalian cells (also known as DAI, P 1 -eIF- 2, and p 68 kinase). This behavior is {{in marked contrast to}} the interaction of PKR with a number of other highly structured viral single-stranded RNAs, which inhibit, rather than stimulate, activation of this kinase. PKR activation leads to inhibition of protein synthesis in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Paradoxically, delta RNA failed to elicit the expected PKR-mediated inhibition of cell-free translation. Instead, delta RNA interfered with PKR activation and the translational block induced by dsRNA. We conclude that the interaction of PKR and <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> RNA may represent a new category of protein-RNA interactions involving the dsRNA binding motif...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a {{major cause}} of chronic liver disease in {{southern}} Italy. In the same area superinfection with the <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> is endemic. To assess the prevalence of delta infection in a large population of patients with acute and chronic HBV related liver disease and to look for differential features among delta infected and uninfected subjects sera from 592 consecutive HBsAg positive patients were tested for the delta/anti-delta system by RIA. In no case was delta Ag found in serum. The prevalence of anti-delta was low in acute hepatitis (6. 6 %) and in asymptomatic carriers (6. 4 %) but raised in chronic active hepatitis with or without cirrhosis (52. 3 %). A decrease in frequency of anti-delta was seen in inactive cirrhosis (38. 8 %) and in hepatocellular carcinoma (11. 9 %). A younger mean age of delta-infected subjects was observed in each type of chronic liver disease. Our data confirm that <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> superinfection is definitely associated with severe chronic active liver disease.

40|$|The {{clinical}} features of delta infection were analysed retrospectively in 191 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers and 592 cases of acute hepatitis B seen over 11 {{years in the}} Swedish town of Malmö (population 250 000). With a few exceptions delta infections occurred exclusively in drug addicts. In the chronic HBsAg-carriers the most common clinical manifestation was an episode of acute hepatitis, which in some individuals became severe with a pronounced rise in serum alanine aminotransferase activity for many months. During the period of delta infection the HBsAg titre was lowered and in three out of 26 cases the patient lost HBsAg altogether and developed hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs). In one patient the acute hepatitis due to delta infection was fulminant and fatal. In patients with acute hepatitis B the clinical picture did not distinguish between those with and without simultaneous delta infection.

40|$|SUMMARY Infection {{with the}} <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> can only {{occur in the}} context of coexistent {{hepatitis}} B virus infection. We describe a patient in whom the clinical features of acute delta hepatitis developed when seroconversion from hepatitis B surface antigen to antibody had already occurred and diagnosis of recent acute hepatitis B was based on high titre IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. We discuss the significance of such a serological profile, not previously described. Rizzetto and colleagues ' first recognised the existence of the <b>delta</b> <b>agent</b> in 1977 while staining liver tissue by immunofluorescence for hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). An early observation was that delta antigen was only present in the livers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Infectivity studies in chimpanzees showed that delta infection could occur with both acute and chronic hepatitis B (HBV) virus infection. 2 In contrast, delta hepatitis could not be induced in HBsAg negative animals with circulating antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Seroepidemiological investiga-tions confirmed that the delta antigen-antibody system was only detectable in HBsAg carriers, except in rare individuals recently recovered from acute HBV and delta infection. 3 We describe a patient with acute delta hepatitis who at presentation had serological evidence of recent HBV infection but was HBsAg negative. The implications of such a serological profile, not previously described, are discussed.
