40|$|A {{specially}} designed accelerator facility for tumour irradiation {{located at the}} Heidelberg University Hospital was built up, the commissioning is still ongoing. Technically the Heidelberg Ion Therapy Centre (HIT) fully relies on the three dimensional intensity-controlled raster scan technique developed at GSI. This method demands for smoothly extracted ion beams (from protons to oxygen) from the HIT synchrotron. For this purpose a RF knock-out system is routinely used. To characterize the extracted beams ionization chambers are installed in the high energy transport lines and {{directly in front of}} the patient. Full spills are recorded with a resolution up to 100 ȝs. Typical raw data are shown as well as derived statistics like Fourier spectra and maximum-to-average ratios, which give good information about the quality of the beam and its applicability for the scanning dose delivery method. In addition, the performance of the flexible spill <b>interrupt</b> <b>procedure</b> will be demonstrated with measured data. HIT ACCELERATOR FACILITY The Heidelberg Ion Therapy Centre (HIT) is a dedica-ted hadron accelerator facility for radio-therapeutical treatment of tumour patients [1]. The advantage of using hadron beams in cancer therapy is their characteristic energy loss profile in irradiated materials. When applied to tumor tissue this leads to a DNA destructive maximum at the Bragg peak immediately before the particles come to rest, while the beam loses very little energy in the entrance channel. To reach penetration depths of 20 - 300 mm in water, charged particles like protons or carbon ions with energies in the range from 48 up to 430 MeV/u are required; see the following table with the implemente...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Professionals {{working in}} the {{operating}} room (OR) are subject to various distractions that can be detrimental to their task performance and the quality of their work. This study aimed to quantify the frequency, nature, and effect on performance of (potentially) distracting events occurring during endourological procedures and additionally explored urologists' and residents' perspectives on experienced ill effects due to distracting factors. METHODS: First, observational data were collected prospectively during endourological procedures in one OR of a teaching hospital. A seven-point ordinal scale was used to measure the level of observed interference with the main task of the surgical team. Second, semistructured interviews were conducted with eight urologists and seven urology residents in two hospitals to obtain their perspectives on the impact of distracting factors. RESULTS: Seventy-eight procedures were observed. A median of 20 distracting events occurred per procedure, which corresponds to an overall rate of one distracting event every 1. 8 min. Equipment problems and procedure-related and medically irrelevant communication were the most frequently observed causes of interruptions and identified as the most distracting factors in the interviews. Occurrence of distracting factors in difficult situations requiring high levels of concentration was perceived by all interviewees as disturbing and negatively impacting performance. The majority of interviewees (13 / 15) thought distracting factors impacted more strongly on residents' compared to urologists' performance due to their different levels of experience. CONCLUSION: Distracting events occur frequently in the OR. Equipment problems and communication, the latter both procedure-related and medically irrelevant, have the largest impact on the sterile team and regularly <b>interrupt</b> <b>procedures.</b> Distracting stimuli can influence performance negatively and should therefore be minimized.

We hypothesized that a single administration of Bretschneider histidine–tryptophan–keto-glutarate (HTK) crystalloid solution (Custodiol) offers myocardial protection comparable with repeated tepid blood cardioplegia. METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively compiled single-centre database containing all adult cardiac procedures performed from January 2005 to January 2011. Preoperative demographic and investigative data, operative variables and postoperative (30 -day) mortality and morbidity were compared between the Custodiol and blood cardioplegia groups. The study primary endpoints were 30 -day mortality, return to the operating theatre, myocardial infarction, stroke, postoperative requirement for an intra-aortic balloon pump, new renal failure, prolonged ventilation and re-admission to hospital within 30 days.

40|$|Abstract Background Management of {{patients}} with co-existent coronary and carotid disease is a controversial and challenging issue. The risk for stroke after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis is up to 30 %. In these patients a common practice is to proceed first with the restoration of cerebral perfusion and then perform the coronary revascularization. The rationale is that this strategy will reduce perioperative neurological morbidity and mortality. However, {{what happens when the}} carotid procedure is acutely complicated by cardiac instability which necessitates the interruption of the carotid procedure? Case report We describe a case of a patient with unstable angina and high grade asymptomatic bilateral carotid stenosis who underwent emergency combined CABG and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Due to hemodynamic instability, ST-T changes, hypotension and bradycardia, upon completion of endarterectomy we placed a carotid shunt and the patient was put on cardiopulmonary bypass through median sternotomy. After triple CABG (duration of 90 minutes) we concluded the <b>interrupted</b> CEA <b>procedure</b> with primary closure of the carotid arteriotomy with the shunt in place. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after a week. In extreme cases with bilateral severe carotid stenosis and coronary artery disease where the carotid <b>procedure</b> should be <b>interrupted,</b> we suggest the use of carotid shunt which can provide adequate cerebral perfusion giving time to cardiac surgeon to perform the life saving cardiac procedure first. </p...|$|R

However, if a patient does not receive sufficient local anaesthesia, continuous severe cough and physical movement may <b>interrupt</b> the <b>procedure</b> and reduce its safety. We therefore examined whether codeine phosphate is a useful premedication for bronchoscopy. The study design was a randomized comparison between codeine phosphate and a placebo in patients undergoing light local anaesthesia and midazolam sedation. We used low dose local anaesthesia (5 ml of nebulized 2 % xylocaine) on the assumption of insufficient local anaesthesia. Patients were allocated to receive codeine phosphate 0 · 4 mgkg− 1 or a saline placebo 60 min before they were sedated with i. v. midazolam. If the patients exhibited severe cough during bronchoscopy, intrabronchial supplemental local anaesthesia (2 % xylocaine solution in 1 ml increments) was instilled via a bronchoscope to the trachea and segmental bronchi to suppress the cough. The dose of supplemental xylocaine was assessed and the requirements were significantly lower in the codeine group compared to the placebo group: 36 · 4 ± 10 · 2 mg vs. 95 · 1 ± 24 · 6 mg, respectively. After bronchoscopy, patients were interviewed by a doctor to assess their willingness to undergo a repeat procedure if one was clinically indicated, but no significant difference was observed between the two groups.

40|$|Background. The {{importance}} {{of parental involvement}} during invasive procedures (IP) in Pediatric Emergency Departments (PED) has been documented. Objective. 1) To determine the frequency of parental presence during different IP in Spanish PED; 2) To assess the reasons for restricting their presence; and 3) To evaluate the agreement among healthcare professionals. Method. Descriptive multicenter study based on questionnaires distributed among the chiefs of 32 Spanish PED. Results. Family presence is allowed during some IP, including wound suture (23 / 32), lumbar puncture (17 / 32), or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (3 / 32), with no significant differences among hospitals. The main reasons for restricting parental presence are the perception of parents not being prepared to witness the procedure (17 / 31), the concern that their presence would adversely affect the performance by the healthcare provider (12 / 31), or parental anxiety (11 / 31). Occasionally, problems derived from the parental presence have been reported, such as dizziness (20 / 32) or the need to <b>interrupt</b> the <b>procedure</b> (13 / 32).

Using coloured pictures to name, we replicated the finding that when the picture's name is phonologically related to the name of its colour, the colour-naming task is facilitated compared with when {{the name of the}} picture is unrelated. We also show that this effect is stronger when naming the picture has been practiced. By contrast, the colour's name has no effect on naming the picture, not even when colour naming is practiced. We conclude that strong versions of both the full-cascading view and the limited-cascading view cannot account for the complete set of data...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the utility of a multiple system intervention to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) in our intensive care unit (ICU). A prospective cohort study was undertaken in the medical and surgical ICU at a university hospital. We applied five measures: educational sessions about inserting and maintaining central venous catheters, skin cleaning with chlorhexidine, a checklist during catheter insertion, subclavian vein insertion and avoiding femoral insertion whenever possible, and removing unnecessary catheters. We determined the rate of CR-BSI per 1, 000 catheter-days during the intervention (March to December 2007) and compared it with the rate {{during the same period}} in 2006 in which we applied only conventional preventive measures. CR-BSI was defined as the recovery of the same organism (same species, same antibiotic susceptibility profile) from catheter tip and blood cultures. We registered 4, 289 patient-days and 3, 572 catheter-days in the control period and 4, 174 patient-days and 3, 296 catheter-days in the intervention period. No significant differences in the number of patients with central venous catheters during the two periods were observed: catheters were used in 81. 5 % of patients during the control period and in 80. 6 % of patients during the intervention period. During the control period, 24 CR-BSI were diagnosed (6. 7 / 1, 000 catheter-days); during the intervention period, 8 CR-BSI were diagnosed (2. 4 / 1, 000 catheter-days) (relative risk 0. 36; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 16 to 0. 80; [*]=[*] 0. 015). Nurses <b>interrupted</b> the <b>procedure</b> to correct at least one aspect when completing the checklist in 17. 7 % of insertions. In conclusion, a multiple system intervention applying evidence-based measures reduced the incidence of CR-BSI in our ICU...|$|R
30|$|During the {{interviews}} with project leaders, their project’s progress was discussed by identifying critical incidents as milestones: ‘Through {{the use of}} the critical incident technique one may collect specific and significant behavioral facts, providing (…) a sound basis for making inferences as to requirements for measures of typical performance (criteria), measures of proficiency (standard samples), training, selection and classification, job design and purification, operating procedures, equipment design, motivation and leadership (attitudes), and counseling and psychotherapy’ (Flanagan 1954). Critical incidents are events or conditions that <b>interrupt</b> the normal <b>procedure</b> of a project; such incidents can lead to significant deviations from the original plan and result in setbacks, delays or even termination of a project. Critical recovery takes place when the project gets back on track towards the intended or adjusted goal, which can be achieved by ‘speeding up’ activity, applying a solution, making a decision, or serendipity. Together with the project team leaders, critical incidents that had caused delay and critical recoveries towards speeding-up situations and getting back on track were assessed. By focussing on the critical incident method, we ensured that in the case studies, the problem-solving behaviour of the project leader formed the unit of study.|$|R
40|$|International audienceConsidering {{the zero}} ’t Hooft {{coupling}} limit of N= 4 super-Yang-Mills theory, the exact spectrum of all single-trace operators {{can be accessed}} {{in terms of the}} underlying so(2, 4) character. This makes it possible in turn to compute the one-loop free energy of the tensionless type IIB string theory in AdS_ 5 ×S^ 5 background, with help of the recently developed method of character integral representation of zeta function (CIRZ). We calcu-late first the one-loop free energy of the string states in the (p − 1) -th Regge trajectory and find the result to be p times the free energy of a single N= 4 Maxwell multiplet. The full one-loop free energy is hence proportional to the divergent series ∑_p= 2 ^∞p. The divergence arises as a result of <b>interrupting</b> the regularization <b>procedure</b> in an intermediate stage. With a reorganization of states, we extract the finite part of free energy after summing over the Regge trajectories. This way gives us a finite result which is minus of the free energy of the N= 4 multiplet. Hence, this bulk one-loop result matches the − 1 term in the N^ 2 − 1 factor of the boundary result...|$|R
