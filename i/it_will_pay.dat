25|$|The Barton School House, {{built in}} 1877, {{is the oldest}} {{building}} in Redlands. The historic elementary school closed down in the 1960s and has since deteriorated on Nevada Street. In early 2008, construction had become huge in the area surrounding it and in late 2008, the land the property sat on was purchased for construction. Instead of destroying the building, the company paid to move it to Orange Avenue at The Grove School's farm campus. The building has been moved {{but it is in}} three pieces and will be renovated and remodeled over the next three years. It will become the school's lunch area as well as theater. It is now owned and operated by The Grove School, but the company that moved <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> to reattach the pieces, with The Grove School planning to pay for the remodeling.|$|E

[...] On March 27, the Redmond City Council voted 5-1 and overturned the Appeal Hearing Examiner's ruling and reinstated the temporary land use permit.
