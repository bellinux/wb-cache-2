60|$|Side by {{side with}} these {{advances}} arose in another, which also has a close parallel {{in the history of}} biological science. If the unit of a compound is made up by the aggregation of elementary units, the notion that these must have some sort of definite arrangement inevitably suggests itself; and such phenomena as <b>double</b> <b>decomposition</b> pointed, not only to the existence of a molecular architecture, but to the possibility of modifying a molecular fabric without destroying it, by taking out some of the component units and replacing them by others. The class of neutral salts, for example, includes a great number of bodies in many ways similar, in which the basic molecules, or the acid molecules, may be replaced by other basic and other acid molecules without altering the neutrality of the salt; just as a cube of bricks remains a cube, so long as any brick that is taken out is replaced by another of the same shape and dimensions, whatever its weight or other properties may be. Facts of this kind gave rise to the conception of 'types' of molecular structure, just as the recognition of the unity in diversity {{of the structure of the}} species of plants and animals gave rise to the notion of biological 'types.' The notation of chemistry enabled these ideas to be represented with precision; and they acquired an immense importance, when the improvement of methods of analysis, which took place about the beginning of our period, enabled the composition of the so-called 'organic' bodies to be determined with, rapidity and precision.[G] A large proportion of these compounds contain not more than three or four elements, of which carbon is the chief; but their number is very great, and the diversity of their physical and chemical properties is astonishing. The ascertainment of the proportion of each element in these compounds affords little or no help towards accounting for their diversities; widely different bodies being often very similar, or even identical, in that respect. And, in the last case, that of isomeric compounds, the appeal to diversity of arrangement of the identical component units was the only obvious way out of the difficulty. Here, again, hypothesis proved to be of great value; not only was the search for evidence of diversity of molecular structure successful, but the study of the process of taking to pieces led to the discovery of the way to put together; and vast numbers of compounds, some of them previously known only as products of the living economy, have thus been artificially constructed. Chemical work, at the present day, is, to a large extent, synthetic or creative--that is to say, the chemist determines, theoretically, that certain non-existent compounds ought to be producible, and he proceeds to produce them.|$|E
60|$|On {{the island}} of San Lorenzo there are very {{satisfactory}} proofs of elevation within the recent period; this of course is not opposed to the belief of a small sinking of the ground having subsequently taken place. The side of this island fronting the Bay of Callao is worn into three obscure terraces, the lower {{one of which is}} covered by a bed a mile in length, almost wholly composed of shells of eighteen species, now living in the adjoining sea. The height of this bed is eighty-five feet. Many of the shells are deeply corroded, and have a much older and more decayed appearance than those at the height of 500 or 600 feet on the coast of Chile. These shells are associated with much common salt, a little sulphate of lime (both probably left by the evaporation of the spray, as the land slowly rose), together with sulphate of soda and muriate of lime. They rest on fragments of the underlying sandstone, and are covered by a few inches thick of detritus. The shells higher up on this terrace could be traced scaling off in flakes, and falling into an impalpable powder; and on an upper terrace, at the height of 170 feet, and likewise at some considerably higher points, I found a layer of saline powder of exactly similar appearance, and lying in the same relative position. I have no doubt that this upper layer originally existed as a bed of shells, like that on the eighty-five-feet ledge; but it does not now contain even a trace of organic structure. The powder has been analysed for me by Mr. T. Reeks; it consists of sulphates and muriates both of lime and soda, with very little carbonate of lime. It is known that common salt and carbonate of lime left in a mass for some time together partly decompose each other; though this does not happen with small quantities in solution. As the half-decomposed shells in the lower parts are associated with much common salt, together with some of the saline substances composing the upper saline layer, and as these shells are corroded and decayed in a remarkable manner, I strongly suspect that this <b>double</b> <b>decomposition</b> has here taken place. The resultant salts, however, ought to be carbonate of soda and muriate of lime, the latter is present, but not the carbonate of soda. Hence I am led to imagine that by some unexplained means the carbonate of soda becomes changed into the sulphate. It is obvious that the saline layer could not have been preserved in any country in which abundant rain occasionally fell: on the other hand this very circumstance, which at first sight appears so highly favourable to the long preservation of exposed shells, has probably been the indirect means, through the common salt not having been washed away, of their decomposition and early decay.|$|E

40|$|Logarithmic {{signatures}} (LS) are {{a kind of}} factorizations of nite {{groups which}} are used as a main component of cryptographic keys for secret key cryptosystems such as PGM and public key cryptosystems like MST 1. As such, logarithmic signa-tures of short length are of special interest. In the present paper we deal with the fundamental question of the existence of logarithmic signatures of shortest length, called minimal logarithmic signatures (MLS), for nite groups. First studies of the problem can be found in [7], [3] and specially in [4], where Gonzalez Vasco, Rotteler and Steinwandt show that minimal logarithmic signatures exist for all groups of order < 175; 560 by direct computation using the method of factoriza-tion of a group into " subgroups. We introduce new approaches to deal with the question. The rst method uses the <b>double</b> coset <b>decomposition</b> to con-struct minimal logarithmic signatures. This method allows to prove for instance that if gcd(n; q 1) 2 f 1; 4; p j p primeg, then the projective special linear groups Ln(q) have an MLS. Another main goal is to construct MLS for all nite groups of order 1010. Surprisingly, the method of <b>double</b> coset <b>decomposition</b> turns out to be very eective, as we can construct MLS for all groups in the range except a small number of 8 groups. We are also able to prove that if an MLS for any these 8 groups exists, then it cannot be constructed by the method of <b>double</b> coset <b>decomposition.</b> We further discuss a method of construction of MLS for groups of the form G = A:B with subgroups A, B and A B 6 = 1, by building suitable MLS for A and B and " them together.
