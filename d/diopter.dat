5|$|Hunter's {{direction}} in some scenes {{was inspired by}} Otto Preminger's work on the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel. That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger's techniques {{to make the most}} out of several of the episode's smaller sets such as the RR Diner. Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split <b>diopter</b> lens, allowing for a greater depth of field. For example, a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at either side of a room; the split <b>diopter</b> lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus. The episode ends with a shot featuring a Dutch angle; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot, which was otherwise forbidden.|$|E
25|$|Using A-constants is {{practical}} when {{a decision}} on the implant power {{has to be made}} during surgery because the power of the lens varies in a 1:1 relationship with the A-constants: if A decreases by 1 <b>diopter,</b> IOL power decreases by 1 <b>diopter</b> also. This straight relationship adds to the simplicity and popularity of the A-constant. Other constants used in modern IOL formulas include the ACD value in Binkhorst and Hoffer-Q formulas, the a0, a1, and a2 constants of the Haigis formula, and the Surgeon factor (SF) in Holladay formulas. True anterior chamber depth (ACD) is measured between the posterior corneal surface and the anterior lens surface. This measure is {{not to be confused with}} the anterior chamber constant (ACD constant) used in IOL power calculation formulas.|$|E

2500|$|The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, {{semi-automatic}} shotgun {{that resembles}} the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement {{of some of}} the controls. It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. [...] The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5-round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and [...] function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located {{on the left side of}} the receiver above the pistol grip. Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in <b>diopter</b> sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.|$|E
2500|$|The SG 550 series rifles have a [...] {{long sight}} radius and are {{equipped}} with iron sights adjustable for both windage and elevation. The sights {{are similar to those}} on some Heckler & Koch weapons, such as the HK G3 or HK MP5. The sights consist of a rear, rotating <b>diopter</b> drum soldered to the receiver and a hooded front post installed in the gas block. The rear sight has an open notch setting marked [...] "1" [...] designed for immediate firing up to 100 m but also contains apertures with settings [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] and [...] "4" [...] corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 m firing ranges. The 400 m setting has a removable iris for sportive shooting. The sights are adjustable via micrometer screws with windage and elevation increments of 1.5 mrad or [...] at 300 m. For night use, the dedicated [...] "1" [...] notch setting in the rear sight drum is provided with two self-luminous tritium-powered inserts fitted laterally {{on each side of the}} notch and additionally in a flip-up post attached to the foresight. When firing rifle grenades the front sight hood is aligned with the uppermost edge of the grenade's warhead, this provides an estimated point of impact up to 75 m. The rifle grenades intended for this purpose were FN/Luchaire Type 58-N bullet-though anti-tank grenades.|$|E

50|$|The {{sighting}} arrangement on the Walther LGR {{takes advantage}} of the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles (circles all having a common centre).As rear sighting system a universal Walther <b>diopter</b> was used. This high end target aperture sight offering windage and elevation correction in 0.2 mm (≈ 0.069 MOA) increments at 10 m came with a rubber eye shield. This <b>diopter</b> was used by Walther for their complete match rifle product range and Steyr Mannlicher for their 300 metre full bore rifles. Like any high end <b>diopter</b> this Walther <b>diopter</b> accepts adjustable <b>diopter</b> aperture and optical filter systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters.The complementing globe front sight is mounted on dove tails on top of the barrel and has the possibility to easily insert various notch elements. Besides metal notch elements, plastic clear or semi transparent front sight elements of various diameters can also be mounted and quickly be exchanged.For shooters with suboptimal vision the optical foresight aid eagle-eye can be installed to aid their aiming.For raising the sightline of the <b>diopter</b> and foresight by 9.5 mm dovetail blocks that fit the integral 11 mm dovetail rail on top of the receiver were available.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Post {{operative}} {{adjustment of}} a single continuous suture is {{an effective means of}} reducing post keratoplasty astigmatism. This study evaluates post keratoplasty keratometry following suture adjustment with an adjusted suture in place and after the suture is removed. METHODS: Average keratometric astigmatism was measured over 24 months time in 26 patients with an adjusted continuous suture and 24 patients with a continuous suture that was not adjusted. Average keratometry in 43 patients with an adjusted continuous suture was compared with 37 patients with combined continuous and interrupted sutures. Finally, suture out astigmatism in 19 adjusted patients was compared to six patients with no adjustment. RESULTS: There was an increase in average corneal astigmatism over two years of 2. 2 <b>diopters</b> in the adjusted group and 1. 7 <b>diopters</b> in the non-adjusted group with sutures in place. One year following surgery, average keratometry flattened from 47. 5 to 42. 9 <b>diopters</b> in the adjusted continuous group and from 47. 0 to 46. 0 <b>diopters</b> in the group with combined continuous and interrupted sutures. Following suture removal, average astigmatism in patients who had suture adjustment was 4. 4 <b>diopters</b> +/- 2. 5 <b>diopters</b> (range 1 - 10 <b>diopters),</b> and 6. 01 <b>diopters</b> (range 4 - 7) in the non-adjusted group. CONCLUSIONS: Average post keratoplasty astigmatism increases after a continuous suture is adjusted but the increase is comparable to patients with acceptable astigmatism who do not require adjustment. More progressive corneal flattening over 12 months time is seen with a continuous suture than which combined sutures. Average suture out astigmatism was 4. 0 <b>diopters</b> following suture adjustment, compared to an average of 8. 4 <b>diopters</b> prior to adjustment...|$|R

Group 1 included the right eyes of the 14 patients who underwent hyperopic LASIK using a 6. 5 mm optical zone diameter. Group 2 comprised the left eyes of the same patients with the only difference being that the optical zone diameter was 6. 0 mm. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 36. 42 &plusmn; 5. 10 years. Group 1 eyes had a median (range) preoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 0. 79 (0. 52) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0. 15 (0. 08). Group 2 had a median preoperative UCVA of 0. 79 (0. 60) and BCVA of 0. 15 (0. 08). The median postoperative UCVA in Group 1 was 0. 17 (0. 21) and BCVA was 0. 15 (0. 13). In Group 2, the median postoperative UCVA was 0. 30 (0. 32) and BCVA was 0. 15 (0. 26). Group 1 had a median preoperative refraction of + 5. 37 (1. 75) <b>diopters</b> and the median postoperative refraction at one week was &minus; 0. 23 (1. 25) <b>diopters,</b> at three months was + 0. 75 (0. 75) <b>diopters,</b> and at six months was + 0. 75 (1. 00) <b>diopters.</b> Group 2 had a median preoperative refraction of + 5. 00 (1. 75) <b>diopters,</b> and the median postoperative refraction at one week was + 0. 13 (1. 5) <b>diopters,</b> at three months was + 1. 00 (0. 75) <b>diopters</b> and at six months + 1. 25 (1. 25) <b>diopters.</b> The difference was statistically significant between groups 1 and 2.

40|$|PURPOSE: Two {{selective}} interrupted suture removal {{techniques were}} compared to determine which technique resulted in earliest, best visual acuity and least postoperative astigmatism. METHODS: Sixty-five consecutive optical penetrating keratoplasties were performed using 12 interrupted 10 - 0 nylon sutures and a 12 -bite continuous 10 - 0 nylon suture, and were alternately assigned to 1 of 2 selective suture removal groups. All patients had refraction, keratometry, and videokeratoscopy postoperatively, starting at 6 weeks. Six weeks postoperatively, Group I underwent simultaneous removal of six alternate sutures, with {{the first of the}} 6 sutures removed at the steepest meridian, while Group II had selective sutures removed only at the steepest meridian, if associated with greater than 2 <b>diopters</b> of astigmatism in that meridian. Subsequently, interrupted sutures were then selectively removed until the resultant astigmatism approached 3. 0 <b>diopters</b> or less. Measurements of resultant astigmatism are reported prior to selective suture removal, following selective suture removal, at 6 months postoperatively, at the completion of all selective suture removal, and at the final visit. RESULTS: At 6 months, residual astigmatism after the 2 techniques of selective suture removal, as measured by refraction, keratometry, and computer-assisted videokeratoscopy, was 2. 8, 3. 0 and 3. 4 <b>diopters</b> for Group I, and 2. 2, 2. 6 and 3. 7 <b>diopters</b> for Group II. At 1 year, the average final visit, astigmatism was 2. 5, 2. 4 and 2. 7 <b>diopters</b> for Group I, and 2. 1, 2. 0 and 2. 3 <b>diopters</b> for Group II. By the final visit, a best corrected vision of 20 / 50 or better was achieved in 86 % of eyes in Group I and in 65 % of eyes in Group II, and {{there was a significant difference}} in average keratometry of 47. 4 <b>diopters</b> in Group I compared to 46. 0 <b>diopters</b> in Group II and, as measured by videokeratoscopy, 47. 9 <b>diopters</b> in Group I compared to 45. 8 <b>diopters</b> in Group II. CONCLUSIONS: Selective suture removal by either technique reduces keratoplasty astigmatism with residual interrupted and continuous sutures in place. The combined use of refraction, keratometry, and videokeratoscopy probably provides more reliable and reproducible quantitative measurements of astigmatism. Minimizing astigmatism by selective suture removal is a major factor in the attempt to achieve excellent and visual function in the majority of patients who have undergone penetrating keratoplasty...|$|R
