5|$|MD 410 {{follows the}} {{northern}} edge of the town of Chevy Chase and crosses Coquellin Run, then follows the southern edge of Columbia Country Club to its intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue). The highway leaves the town of Chevy Chase and passes through an unincorporated area of Chevy Chase, within which the highway meets the northern end of MD 186 (Brookville Road) and descends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of Rock Creek. At the bottom of the hill, MD 410 intersects Jones Mill Road and Beach Drive, the main road through Rock Creek Park. The state highway crosses Rock Creek, passes to the north of Meadowbrook Park and leaves the valley as a four-lane road with narrow median and flanking service roads. MD 410 reaches {{the top of the hill}} at Grubb Road and descends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of a branch of Rock Creek. The highway becomes undivided at Sundale Drive and crosses the stream just west of the northern corner of the District of Columbia and its attendant boundary marker, then leaves the stream valley and ascends to an intersection with MD 390 (16th Street) at the western edge of downtown Silver Spring.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the county line, NY173 initially turns slightly eastward {{to follow a}} less pronounced northeasterly alignment. However, as the route approaches the Chittenango Creek valley, it gradually turns northward. At Brinkerhoff Hill, NY173 enters the Chittenango village limits and descends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> where it ends at an intersection with NY5 in the village center {{at the base of}} the valley.|$|E
5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> and open manufacturing operations.|$|E

5|$|By July 27 all the Mun'gyong divide was in North Korean {{possession}} and their units were moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> {{of the upper}} Naktong {{in the vicinity of}} Hamch'ang. Prisoners taken at the time and others captured later said that the NK 1st Division suffered 5,000 casualties in the struggle for control of the divide, including the division commander who was wounded and replaced. The NK 13th Division, following the 1st, suffered about 500 casualties below Mun'gyong, but otherwise it was not engaged during this period. The NK 15th Division, one of North Korea's weaker divisions which consisted mostly of inexperienced youth, moved on Sangju. It was part of a concentrated attack by North Korean troops aiming to push the UN forces south before they had time to organize an effective defensive line.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks {{the lake to}} the east. The route {{gradually}} descends back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming. Once in Fleming, NY38 runs along the lakeshore and serves {{a long line of}} lakeside homes as it passes by a series of fields to the west. The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle {{expanded}} westwards, and {{the ditch}} {{was extended to}} enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. A shaft dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On {{the south of the}} fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.|$|E

5|$|Nausicaä and Asbel {{return to}} Pejite but find it ravaged by insects. A band of {{survivors}} reveal that they lured the creatures {{to eradicate the}} Tolmekians, and {{are doing the same}} to the Valley. They capture Nausicaä to prevent her from warning the Valley, but with the help of Asbel and his mother, Nausicaä escapes on a glider. Flying home, she finds two Pejite soldiers baiting thousands of Ohm <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> using a wounded baby Ohm. The Tolmekians deploy tanks and the Giant Warrior against them, but their tanks cannot stop Ohm, and the Giant Warrior, hatched prematurely, disintegrates.|$|E
5|$|State Route 149 {{begins at}} Wicks Corner as a divided highway, at an {{interchange}} with SR 70 several {{miles north of}} Oroville. This is {{the north end of}} the State Route 70 freeway, which passes through a gap between the Campbell Hills and South Table Mountain on its way from Oroville. SR 149 heads northwest across gently rolling terrain before descending <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of the Dry Creek. As it begins to climb out of the valley, SR 149 ends at an interchange with SR 99. The latter highway continues the corridor northwest to Chico, quickly dropping back into the Butte Creek valley. The route is a divided highway with four lanes.|$|E
5|$|The Don River valley, formed {{during the}} last ice age, has played an {{important}} role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the Town of York. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795 and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828. Railways were introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> after 1850 with the building of tracks into Toronto. By 1900, the Don River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.|$|E

5|$|The Don Valley Parkway {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with the Gardiner Expressway {{near the mouth}} of the Don River in downtown Toronto. From there, it runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the expressway continues northwards through the parklands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> again and goes through the park lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at Highway401.|$|E
5|$|The path of SR 190 {{east of the}} Panamint Range in Death Valley National Park was {{followed}} in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah {{to look for a}} shortcut to Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route of present SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley, which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178. After ore was discovered in Death Valley, the route became a primitive road, though most travel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> such as the twenty-mule team borax route, was from the south.|$|E
5|$|This final Confederate assault {{through the}} Wheatfield {{continued}} past Houck's Ridge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat {{in the summer}} heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed to the left along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove the exhausted Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield.|$|E

5|$|Arab sources {{indicate}} that at about his time, the Sogdian princes called upon the Western Turks or the Turgesh for help against the Arabs, although the chronology and veracity of these accounts {{is open to}} question. At any rate, {{over the next two}} years Qutayba engaged in an effort to push the Caliphate's borders further and gain control of the Jaxartes valley. A large force, supported by some 20,000 Transoxianian levies, marched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> in early 713. The native levies were dispatched against Shash, which was reportedly taken, while Qutayba with the Arabs marched in the direction of Khujand and Ferghana. Little is known of these expeditions, although successful battles are recorded before Khujand and at Minak in Ushrusana, and the dispatch of an Arab embassy to the Chinese court is verified by Chinese sources. Al-Tabari reports that Qutayba marched into Chinese-held territory up to Kashgar, but this claim is dismissed by modern scholars. In 714, Qutayba renewed his expeditions along the Jaxartes, probably with Shash as his base, but his campaign was cut short upon receiving the news of the death of al-Hajjaj. Unsure of his position now that his patron was gone, he disbanded the army and returned to Merv.|$|E
5|$|Employing {{elements}} of the 84th and 106th Line, the French wing commander ordered the troops not to press home their assault, but to retreat every time they came against strong resistance. Each attack was pushed farther up the ridge before receding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> When the fifth assault in regimental strength gave way, the defenders finally reacted, sweeping down the slope {{to cut off the}} French. Saint-Cyr now sprung his trap. Lecourbe led the massed grenadier companies to attack one Austrian flank, other reserves bored in on the other flank and the center counterattacked. The French troops that struck the Austrian right were hidden in the nearby town of Herrenalb. As the Austrians gave way, the French followed them up the ridge right into their positions. Nevertheless, Kaim's men laid down such a heavy fire that Lecourbe's grenadiers were thrown into disorder and their leader nearly captured. At length, Saint-Cyr's troops emerged triumphant, inflicting 1,000 casualties on their opponents and capturing two cannons. Kaim was compelled to withdraw east across the hills to Neuenbürg. From there, Kaim and Lindt's soldiers fell back toward Pforzheim.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E

5|$|In Alder, MT 287 {{leaves the}} valley of the Ruby River and heads east through Alder Gulch, a narrow valley along which the highway ascends the more {{moderate}} mountains between the Tobacco Root Mountains to the north and the Gravelly Range to the south. The length of the valley is filled with tailings, or small hills of mining waste left behind by gold dredge placer mining over decades of mining. The highway passes through the village of Nevada City, the site of the Finney House and the Dr. Don L. Byam House. MT 287 follows the Alder Gulch Short Line Railroad, an isolated narrow-gauge railway, until the route reaches Virginia City. The highway enters the town on Nevada Street but mainly follows Wallace Street through the Virginia City Historic District, a National Historic Landmark preserving buildings of Montana's second territorial capital. MT 287 leaves Virginia City and ascends to its highest point along Daylight Creek. The highway descends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of the Madison River along Eightmile Creek. MT 287 meets the northern end of S-249 (Varney Road) where the highway curves north on arriving at the Madison River. The highway enters the town of Ennis along Bauer Lane and curves east onto West Main Street before reaching its eastern terminus at US 287, which heads north and east along Main Street.|$|E
5|$|The Moldavians {{made the}} first move by sending musicians {{to the middle of}} the valley. The sound of drums and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there. Instead, the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian {{professional}} army, which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy. Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and, when they made enough progress, the Moldavian artillery started to fire, followed by archers and handgunners firing from three different directions. The archers could not see the enemy for the fog, and, instead, had to follow the noise of their footsteps. The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> by making hit-and-run attacks. Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge, causing it to collapse. Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers, and who did not get caught in the marshes, had to confront the Moldavian army, together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley. The 5,000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7,000 Ottoman infantrymen. Thereafter, they made a slow retreat, as instructed by Stephen, but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi, while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks.|$|E
5|$|The highway heads southeast, partly {{along the}} latter creek, past Keddie to Quincy in the American Valley. It leaves the valley via Greenhorn Creek, passing the Feather River Route's Williams Loop and then {{following}} the small Estray Creek to Lee Summit, which the rail line passes under in the Spring Garden Tunnel. This brings SR 70 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of the Middle Fork Feather River, which takes it southeast to Blairsden, where the State Scenic Highway ends and State Route 89 splits to the south, and then east, through the Plumas National Forest, to Portola and Beckwourth. The large Sierra Valley {{begins at the}} latter community, and SR 70 heads almost directly across, passing {{the north end of}} SR 49 at Vinton and the south end of SR 284 at Chilcoot before crossing Beckwourth Pass, which the railroad takes the Chilcoot Tunnel under, and descending slightly to end at U.S. 395 at Hallelujah Junction.|$|E
