The text begins with a reflection on the term “device” from philosophical interpretations from Michel Foucault to Jean-Louis Déotte, to Gilles Deleuze and Giorgio Agamben. The questions are approached through contemporary examples of current symbolic practices, in which we include both artistic and media tactics procedures. We distinguish five issues: The vital process documentation (<b>documentation</b> <b>devices),</b> the expressive possibilities of the media devices (intonation devices), the means of conveyance network (distribution devices), transformations around the idea of creativity in mass production (resistance devices) and active modes of diversion that seem to invite the rapid exchange of signs that occurs (diversion devices) ...|$|E

The main discourse for this study is the usage of Blues as literary media for some Afro-American writers. And this study exclusively analyzed poetic blues from Langston Hughes.

This has raised issues {{about the pain}} scales contribution to the identifying and understanding of pain. The aim of this thesis was to describe the clinical utility of patients’ self-rated postoperative pain after major surgery from a healthcare professional perspective. The aim of study I and II was to describe healthcare professionals’ perceptions {{of the use of}} pain scales, and to through considering critical incidents describe care experiences and actions taken by healthcare professionals’ when assessing pain. Participants in study I (N= 25) and II (N= 24) were enrolled- registered nurses and physicians with clinical experiences of pain scales. The aims of study III and IV were to determine the clinical applicability of NRS mode- and maximum- measures, and the NRS mode- and median measures at rest and during activity based on patients self-rated pain. The aim in study IV was additionally to determine the number of NRS ratings needed for the calculation of these measures. The number of surgical and orthopedic patients who completed study III were: n= 157 and study IV: n= 479. Study I and II confirmed earlier findings of patients’ self-reported pain scores as a facilitator in the understanding of their postoperative pain. Organizational routines, <b>documentation</b> <b>devices,</b> clinical competence, continuity in care, collaborative actions, time, and individual routines were healthcare related factors affecting the use of pain scales (I, II). Patient-related facilitating factors were patients’ ability and willingness to communicate pain, while disability and unwillingness to communicate or inconsistency in verbal communication with observed behaviors were barriers (II). Time and multidimensional communication approaches could bridge these barriers (I, II). Study III and IV showed acceptable reliability for the mode, median and maximum measures. Rank correlations for individual median scores, based on four ratings, versus patients’ retrospective self-rated average pain, were moderate and strengthened with increased numbers of ratings. The Svensson method showed an individual variation within the expected outcome and a significant systematic group change towards a higher level of reported retrospective pain. The calculated pain measures, particularly concerning pain at rest, generally were lower than patients’ recall of pain. The findings described beneficial effects of patient self-reported pain, however present healthcare did not fully support the utilization of pain scales. Because of the simple measurement characteristics, the use of daily NRS average pain measures, patients’ pain can be followed until resolved. The measures could additionally become important patient reported outcome measures and thus constitute new motivators to increase the utilization of pain scales...|$|E

40|$|Although {{peripheral}} devices {{come out}} at a frantic pace and require fast releases of drivers, little {{progress has been made}} to improve the development of drivers.

40|$|The {{notion of}} place embodies a complex {{intersection}} of architecture, occupancy, and identity. Tied to geographic and historical conditions, built environments existing {{between two worlds}} or within contested territories reveal the underlying political and social forces that have shaped them. Assuming an analogous relationship between consumption and architecture as interconnected systems, this dissertation examines American suburbia in the early twenty-first century to assess convergent flows related to consumption. It engages with {{the changing nature of}} retail form, function, and obsolescence to illustrate transnational and technological influences impacting suburban commercial architecture. More specifically, it analyzes occupancies, appropriations, and informal adaptations of retail environments in two distinct regional contexts in North America?the USA-Mexico Borderlands of Texas and the USA-Canada Borderlands of the Eastern Great Lakes region. This research charts the rise, fall, and transformation of the American shopping mall assessed via post-structuralist theories. Proposing that the obsolete mid-twentieth century shopping mall is a metaphor for the multicultural American city, this study employs dialectical?or comparative? practices to examine conditions which forecast increasing diversity in metropolitan futures. To establish a conceptual framework, two primary theoretical precedents were hybridized in this dissertation?the archival analysis of Walter Benjamin?s seminal The Arcades Project (1927 - 1940) and the theoretical lens of otherness? or heterotopias?proposed by Michel Foucault in Of Other Places: Utopias and Heterotopias (1984). Furthermore, the terrain vague territorial critique proposed by Ignasi Sol?-Morales and the d?rives of Guy Debord?s Situationist International influenced similar documentation techniques for suburban shopping malls characterized by marginal?or borderland?national, metropolitan, and social-economic conditions. Unlike most of the existing literature surrounding so-called dead malls, this research does not lament the demise of suburban drosscape or junkspace, but celebrates its incremental translation into an organic, nuanced, and temporal placeholder for actual urbanism. By means of case studies, this dissertation serves as a <b>documentation</b> <b>device</b> that identifies, theorizes, and archives largely ignored everyday suburban structures?transitional spaces of otherness serving the needs of immigrants and historically disadvantaged communities that are routinely demolished due to contemporary market pressures, planning initiatives, and real estate practices. In short, it draws awareness to informal actions that have transformed mid-century American shopping malls into liminal places threatened by gentrification and permanent erasure...|$|R
