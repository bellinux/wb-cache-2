25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} think that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News, who did {{not like}} [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] proved the series could be funny. He {{specifically}} complimented the episode's commentary on American consumerism. Simon wrote, [...] "It's all very bitter social satire, and if it weren't on Comedy Central, believe me, no one in networkland would think it ready for prime time. And you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else?</b> It's funny." [...] Likewise, The Washington Post critic Tom Shales strongly criticized [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", but said the second episode was funny and included [...] "cleverly intertwined" [...] plot-lines. Shales said, [...] " [...] suggests the show may be an attempt at satire and not just poopy humor ... Yes, it's still sick and still twisted, but somehow this episode at least appears to have some comic ingenuity behind it, whereas the first was just a smutfest." [...] In 2006, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was identified by Winnipeg Free Press {{as one of the}} ten most memorable South Park episodes, and ranked twelfth in a list of the top 25 greatest Cartman moments, as determined by voters on the Comedy Central website. The Daily Record in Scotland listed the episode's ending, and the [...] "Beefcake!" [...] line, as one of the six most memorable moments in the series.|$|E
500|$|Although Canning {{wrote that}} [...] "the writers did {{a fine job}} of {{incorporating}} the tenure, Will's terrible Spanish and the songs into the storylines", Will's lack of Spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers. Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch said this did not [...] "seem to gel with the passionate Will Schuester I remember from season 1", and Slezak expressed surprise that [...] "he hadn't even mastered the basics of the language!", as did Chaney. Slezak also said Will, as evidenced by his [...] "La Cucaracha" [...] rendition for his class, was [...] "suddenly dumb as the cardboard box that Finn winningly turned into a robot head", and Chaney commented, [...] "Mr. Schuester always seemed a bit more sensitive than this." [...] VanDerWerff wrote of [...] "the weird, dark despair {{at the heart of}} Will's plight: He's a high school Spanish teacher, and he mostly is that because he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> to do." [...] He added, [...] "I think this was probably the best episode for the character since early season one." [...] Canning stated that [...] "the tension between Will and Emma was a welcome change", and Votta commented on the episode's less dramatic ending with Will's apology and [...] "celebrating Emma's new-found tenure with a dinner" [...] with the conclusion, [...] "sometimes you don't need a big bang to get oomph out of an episode". Chaney, however, was puzzled as to why Emma was given teaching tenure [...] "when she's been working at McKinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self-made pamphlets".|$|E
500|$|Collins {{decided to}} record {{it in the}} late 1960s amid an {{atmosphere}} of counterculture introspection; {{she was part of}} an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to [...] "pull her through" [...] to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been [...] "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. [...] Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E

She described the band as a work of passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that she wanted to have a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature.
