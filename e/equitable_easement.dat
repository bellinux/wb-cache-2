50|$|The {{benefit of}} an <b>equitable</b> <b>easement</b> passes with the {{transfer}} of the dominant tenement. Whether section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925 can operate to turn an <b>equitable</b> <b>easement</b> into a legal easement upon conveyance of the dominant tenement is unclear. On the one hand, it would seem odd that a mere licence could become a legal easement through the section, when the much closer <b>equitable</b> <b>easement</b> could not; on the other hand, construing the section in this way is unnecessary {{from the perspective of the}} purchaser, since a right enforceable in equity will be almost as useful as one enforceable at common law.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>equitable</b> <b>easement</b> {{when the}} servient {{tenement}} is unregistered is enforceable against a {{purchaser for value}} only when properly registered {{under the terms of}} the Land Charges Act 1972. Equitable easements arising by virtue of a contract to grant an easement are registerable as either estate contracts or equitable easements. Where the servient tenement is registered, the registration of an <b>equitable</b> <b>easement</b> at the Land Registry can take place through mere notice or caution and will then bind purchasers. Alternatively, it will still bind purchasers if it constitutes an [...] "overriding interest". As confirmed in the case of Thatcher v Douglas, section 70(1)(c) of the Land Registration Act and rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925 will operate to ensure that almost all equitable easements constitute overriding interests.|$|E
50|$|Where land is registered, as is now common, {{there are}} further {{circumstances}} where an <b>equitable</b> <b>easement</b> will arise. Where both the dominant and servient tenements are registered, easements must be registered against both titles {{under the terms}} of the Land Registration Act 1925. Failure to do so will render them easements in equity only, although they will still bind purchasers under rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925. Where the servient land is unregistered, it is likely that the easement will not have to be registered against the dominant title, even if that is itself registered land. This has been disputed, however, and is significant because if legal would bind successors after first registration whereas an <b>equitable</b> <b>easement</b> would require registration as a land charge. Rule 250(1) allows for easements to arise in equity through prescription where the title is registered, but a right arising through prescription would be created as a legal easement and there seems to be no part of this process where the owner of the dominant tenement has a right in equity only.|$|E
50|$|A fourth category, <b>equitable</b> <b>easements</b> arising {{by virtue}} of {{proprietary}} estoppel, is contested. Cases such as ER Ives Investments Ltd v High and Crabb v Arun District Council have been offered in support of their existence; however, some commentators prefer to analyse these cases as giving rise to a right distinct from an easement or a legal easement respectively. This makes an important difference {{when it comes to}} binding third-party purchasers.|$|R
5000|$|The other {{important}} kinds of charge {{that had to}} be registered are restrictive covenants and <b>equitable</b> <b>easements,</b> a right from the Family Law Act 1996 Part IV, and an [...] "estate contract" [...] (i.e. either a future right to buy a property, or an option to buy). Without registration, those charges would be void, but once registered those charges would bind everyone. The registration would go against the name of the title holder, although this was sometimes prone to being confusing if people occasionally used different names (e.g. Francis or Frank). If an official search of the register did not reveal any titles, then the purchaser would gain good legal rights.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Equitable</b> <b>easements</b> {{have the}} same basic {{requirements}} as easements at law concerning their subject matter. Easements are recognised as arising in equity {{in at least three}} circumstances. The first is where section 1(2)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, requiring an easement to be [...] "absolute in possession or a term of years absolute", renders an easement incapable of existing as an interest at law. This includes easements for periods of uncertain duration, such as those ending when a particular event happens (the passing of planning permission over one of the tenements, for example). More controversially this category also includes easements for life, similarly incapable of existing at law. Although the topic has not arisen in the courts since at least 1925, it is difficult to show that as easement for life accommodated the dominant tenement, since it is inherently personal in nature. Rights purporting to be easements for life would, if they were rejected as easements, be licences instead and take effect through contract. The second category involves those cases where an specifically enforceable contract to create an easement has taken effect but the easement has not been granted. Here, the regular principles of equity will operate to bring about an easement, since [...] "equity regards as done those things which ought to be done". The third category is where the grantor holds only an equitable interest himself. The most common occasion where this will happen is where an easement is created by operation of a testamentary disposition. Where there is a will, legal title vests in the executors of the estate until transferred to the deceased's personal representatives, but any devised interests operate at equity from the time of disposition.|$|R
40|$|The case of Flynn v. New York 2 ̆ 6 c Railway Co., {{decided by}} the Court of Appeals of New York in April last, {{involves}} the right of an owner of land to which is appurtenant a so-called <b>equitable</b> <b>easement,</b> arising under a covenant restricting the use of other land, to compensation upon the taking of the servient land for a public use inconsistent with the restriction. A tract of land was laid out in accordance with a plan, and all, lots therein were sold and conveyed by deeds containing covenants, inter alia, that, 2 ̆ 2 No building or structure for any business purpose whatsoever shall be erected on said premises. 2 ̆ 2 The appellant railway company purchased thirty-eight of these lots from the grantees of the original owner, subject to the restrictions, and built its railway across them, partly on an embankment and partly in a cut. Respondents owned lots in this tract, some adjacent to appellant 2 ̆ 7 s lots, some {{across the street from}} them. The maintenance and operation of the railway rendered respondents 2 ̆ 7 property less valuable than it would be if the appellant 2 ̆ 7 s property were used exclusively for residence purposes. The respondents sued to enjoin the construction and operation of the railway across appellant 2 ̆ 7 s lots. The judgment appealed from restrains the maintenance of appellant 2 ̆ 7 s structures (the railway was completed and in operation before the trial), and the operation of the road, unless appellant pays respondents the certain sums which are assessed as damages, measured by the depreciation in value which their lands sustain, not only by reason of the existence of the appellant 2 ̆ 7 s structures but also by reason of the use to which they are put. (As to the assessment of compensation in the injunction suit, see LEWIS, EMINENT DOMAIN (3 d. Ed.) § 892). This judgment is affirmed by a unanimous court. POUND, J., delivering the opinion,-says, 2 ̆ 2 These restrictive covenants create a property right and make direct and compensational the damages which otherwise would be consequential and non-compensational: No matter how unpleasant a neighbor the railroad may prove, if it takes no property by physical appropriation it is not chargeable with damages for impaired values due only to proximity. But something in the nature of an easement of privacy over another 2 ̆ 7 s land may be acquired by covenant in order that one may live apart from the disagreeable sights and sounds of business, if one desires, and if that right has a value and the railroad subtracts a portion thereof by building on the restricted land, it is difficult to conceive why compensation should not follow. 2 ̆...|$|E
50|$|The {{covenant}} may {{be shown}} in the deed and should be disclosed to prospective purchasers; {{it may also be}} recorded, {{or in the case of}} Commonwealth countries shown in Torrens title. Real covenants and <b>easements</b> or <b>equitable</b> servitudes are similar and in 1986, a symposium discussed whether the law of <b>easements,</b> <b>equitable</b> servitudes, and real covenants should be unified. As time passes and the original promisee of the covenant is no longer involved in the land, enforcement may become lax.|$|R
5000|$|On top {{of these}} basic rules, the Land Charges Act 1972, {{following}} its 1925 predecessor, required that {{some kinds of}} charges had to be entered on another special register of charges for unregistered land. According to section 2, a puisne mortgage (a second or third mortgage created after a property is already mortgaged) had to be registered before it would be binding, {{even though it had}} previously counted as a legal property right. The other important kinds of charge that had to be registered are restrictive covenants and <b>equitable</b> <b>easements,</b> a right from the Family Law Act 1996 Part IV, and an [...] "estate contract" [...] (i.e. either a future right to buy a property, or an option to buy). Without registration, those charges would be void, but once registered those charges would bind everyone. The registration would go against the name of the title holder, although this was sometimes prone to confusing if people occasionally used different names (e.g. Francis or Frank). If an official search of the register did not reveal any titles, then the purchaser would gain good legal rights. One glaring injustice, however, was that the House of Lords held the registration rules to be strict. In Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Green, Walter Green gave his son, Geoffrey an option to buy the property, but did not register it. Then Walter changed his mind, and knowing that Geoffrey had not registered this estate contract, he transferred the property to his wife, Evelyne, for £500 to defeat the agreement. Although the purchaser had actual notice of Geoffrey's equitable interest, it did not matter because it was not registered. In another example, it was held in Lloyds Bank v Carrick that a person in actual occupation of a home, who had an unregistered right to buy the home, could not claim an over-riding interest (as would have been possible in registered land) because the only source of the interest was the estate contract, and without registration this was void. The anomalies of the system were always acknowledged, and so it was simply hoped that unregistered land would dwindle away. The solution, perhaps simpler, of passing legislation requiring everything was compulsorily registered was not yet taken.|$|R
