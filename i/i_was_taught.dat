The harmonic draft of the Willow score, and most particularly its spiritual side, came from such a cycle, from such mythology and music history that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught,</b> and that I myself convey with my own emotions and compositions." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson had {{publicly}} {{stated that}} he was proud to be black. He also {{wrote a letter to}} photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: [...] "Maybe I look at the world through rose colored glasses but I love people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> that and will always believe it. I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color." ...|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

500|$|The Way I See It was {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> {{to make sure it was}} polish, polish, polish, and to make sure everything fits right, the bass hits and things are clean for the big pop vocal." ...|$|E

At that time Baba Hari Dass was already an accomplished yoga teacher and had a large following. On his guru's (Neem Karoli Baba) recommendation, Ram Dass received teachings of Ashtanga Yoga: [...] "Baba Hari Dass was my teacher. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> by this man with a chalkboard in the most terse way possible".|$|E

2500|$|Like {{all but two}} of his twenty one Groton classmates, Roosevelt went to Harvard College {{in nearby}} Cambridge, Massachusetts. Roosevelt was again an average student academically, and he later declared, [...] "I took {{economics}} courses in college for four years, and everything <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> was wrong." [...] He {{was a member of the}} Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and the Fly Club. Roosevelt was undistinguished as a student or athlete, but he became editor-in-chief of The Harvard Crimson daily newspaper, a position that required great ambition, energy, and the ability to manage others.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condition}} {{of education in}} Nesna at the beginning o the 19th century was described as [...] "lamentable". The education Augustinussen himself had received had mainly been from home and through the priest who lent him books. When he was asked in parliament where he studied, he answered: [...] "Actually I ought {{to tell you that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> at home next to the stove by my mother". It was the curate who was responsible for teaching, and Nesna had been saddled with several awful curates. The curate Müller, in 1811, had to resign his post [...] "due to adultery", and his successor Peter Eggen, who was curate during Augustinussen's childhood and early years, had little more success. He was a cobbler without any pedagogical qualifications and liked to drink and [...] "chase women". Jenssen writes that [...] "he had nothing to teach + {{for the simple reason that}} he knew nothing". The pastor at the time Christian Qvale testified that [...] "He combined lewdness with the greatest incompetence" [...], whilst the later priest Dometius wrote of Eggen that «Han cultivated both Bacchus and Venus and was a general annoyance".|$|E
2500|$|Born in Cluj (Kolozsvár), Lívia Rusz {{was from}} a Hungarian-Romanian family. She {{grew up in a}} mixed environment, among local Hungarians and Romanians, and, {{according}} to her own recollection: [...] "My road was opened by a school with exceptional spirituality, where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> to respect and maintain traditions, to treasure the eternal cultural values, to preserve and take care of our identity so as not to offend the others". Her father, Liviu, was a Romanian Railways employee, amateur artist and calligrapher, who had undergone formal training with painter Sándor Szopos. Rusz was herself avid to train in visual art, copying his paintings, learning how to use watercolors, and entering a class run by Szopos. After graduating from primary school, Rusz continued her education at a high school in her native city, where her talents brought her to the attention of painter and academic Zoltán Kovács. On Kovács' personal recommendation, she applied for the Cluj Art Institute upon passing her baccalaureate examination, and completed her training in 1955. She declared herself [...] "lucky" [...] to have been taught by Kovács, [...] "an artist with virtues recognized even by those who undermined him". As a result of this training and influence, she came to define herself as a [...] "conservative", who did not [...] "renew [...] whenever the fashion changes." [...] Rusz was Assistant at the Institute for the following three years, losing her post to an administrative restructuring.|$|E
