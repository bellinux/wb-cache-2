The proposed adaptation law allows adjusting the control gain by {{taking into account}} the effects of bounded uncertainties and perturbations with unknown bounds. The main advantage of the proposed adaptive sliding mode control algorithm is in adjusting the control gain without its overestimation {{in the presence of the}} bounded perturbations with the unknown bounds.

Firstly, adaptive sliding mode controller that retains the system's robustness {{in the presence of}} the bounded uncertainties/perturbations with unknown bounds is proposed. Due to the on-line adaptation, the proposed approach allows reducing control chattering. Secondly, a high order sliding mode control strategy that features a priory knowledge of the convergence time is presented.

In order to increase energy efficiency, the control of <b>electropneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> requires the energy balance in terms of air flow delivered by the power modulators to be optimized during tasks such as trajectory tracking. This paper tries to tackle two essential difficulties when dealing with pneumatic actuation.

The goal is to obtain a robust sliding mode adaptive gain control law with respect to uncertainties and perturbations without the knowledge of uncertainties/perturbations bound (only the boundness feature is known). The proposed approaches consist in having a dynamical adaptive control gain that establishes a sliding mode in finite time [...] Gain dynamics ensures also that there is no over-estimation of the gain with respect to the real a priori unknown value of uncertainties.

The fuzzy controller expresses in natural language the human expertise on the control of this non-linear system {{by means of a}} set of linguistic expressions. Few investigations have been addressed to the control of such system and the existing one offers a theoretical description of the functioning of its different subsystems.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} the optimal reference tracking control of an <b>electropneumatic</b> clutch <b>actuator.</b> To control both supply to and exhaust from the clutch actuator chamber, {{one pair of}} on/off valves is used. The on/off valves are controlled by pulse-width modulation. The fast dynamics of the clutch actuator {{and the presence of}} both state and input constraints makes it appropriate to design an explicit Model Predictive Controller (MPC), where the only computation performed on-line would be a piecewise linear function evaluation. A multi-parametric Nonlinear Programming approach is applied to design the explicit MPC. In order to reduce the computational burden, the design of the explicit controller is based on a simplified 3 -rd order model of the clutch actuator. The controller performance is verified by simulating with the full 5 -th order model of the actuator dynamics. Also, the closed-loop response is compared to that of an explicit MPC controller without pulse-width modulation, where the valves are directly commanded fully open or fully closed. P I...|$|R
40|$|This thesis treats {{position}} control of an <b>electropneumatic</b> clutch <b>actuator</b> operated by simple on/off solenoid valves. This clutch actuator {{is intended for}} automatic manual transmission systems or clutch-by-wire systems in heavy duty trucks. Pressurized air is already present {{as a part of}} the brake system in such vehicles, and pneumatics is therefore the natural choice for actuating the manual transmission in these clutch actuator systems. Production cost is a crucial factor in all parts of the automobile industry. For the clutch actuator system this influence the choice of number of sensors present in the production system, limiting it to only a position sensor. It also lead to that a set of on/off solenoid valve is chosen for actuation over more commonly used proportional valves, even though it complicates the control task. Production quality sensors are considered in this thesis, and these are sensors which are more influenced by noise than sensors found in test rigs made for research and development. Motor vibration and possible other mechanical influence also have to be taken into consideration when testing in a full-scale truck as done in this thesis. Motivated by the choice of on/off solenoid valves as the control valves in the clutch actuator system, switched control design is considered. Switched controllers exploit the on/off solenoid valves discrete behavior, switching the valves between fully open and fully closed in a manner such that desired supply or exhaust of air from the actuator chamber is obtained, ensuring the demanded piston position. Based on this line of action, two switched controllers are developed along with a dual-mode switched controller utilizing the best features of the individual controllers. Stability analysis based on standard Lyapunov theory are provided, and the performance of the controllers are tested in a full-scale test truck at Kongsberg Automotive ASA. Both theoretical and practical performance analyses confirm that switch controllers are well suited for actuator piston {{position control}} of the clutch actuator system. Full-state feedback availability is assumed in the design of the switched controllers. Adaptive nonlinear observers are derived to provide estimates of unmeasured states and parameters for the clutch actuator system. These adaptive observers are deterministic with linear output-injection, and have adaptation laws for estimation of clutch load characteristics and friction. A full-order adaptive observer, including filtering of position for suppression of noise, shows best performance. The adaptation of unknown parameters accounts for wear of the clutch and variations in temperature, ensuring a robust design of the clutch actuator model and improving state estimates. Theoretical analyses of convergence are derived under persistence of excitation condition, and performance of the adaptive observers are validated by experimental data. The switched controller and the adaptive nonlinear are combined into an observerbased switched controller. Simulation of this is provided, comparing the results with actual truck measurements. These analysis indicate that the pressure sensor can be exchanged with an adaptive nonlinear observer without significant loss of performance for nonlinear state feedback based control designs for the system.

The problem of increasing the speed and accuracy of uncertain spool-valve actuators is studied. The robust regional stabilising control technique is applied to compensate for the large variations in the uncertainties of the electro-pneumatic actuator. The problem of the robust stability of the <b>electropneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> is proved to always be solvable, via an independent of the actuator's uncertainies static state feedback law depending only upon the stability margin.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose help for {{choosing}} a control strategy to certain specifications. The system under study is an <b>electropneumatic</b> <b>actuator.</b> Different kinds of linear and nonlinear control laws have been developed and experimental results have been analyzed and compared in accordance with appropriate benchmarking. Moreover some new trends are presented.

However the complexity of the electropneumatic systems and the important range of control laws are a real industrial problem where the target is to choose the best strategy for a given application. Nowadays the control procedure is included in sizing. It is important to know which kind of control law wil [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation of a jet pipe <b>electropneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> designed for use in the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand (UMDH). A survey of dextrous hand systems and their related technologies is also provided. As {{part of an effort to}} characterize the UMDH system as a whole, a nonlinear mathematical model of the actuator is given including detailed representation of the jet pipe element, orifice areas and fluid dynamics. Model parameters are identified and the model formulation is validated through experimentation and simulation. The performance of the actuator under closed-loop control is examined. Experimental results show that feedforward control is useful in eliminating any steady-state offset and that a stable bandwidth of 80 Hz is achievable using a simple proportional feedback controller. A linearized model of the actuator is presented and compared with the nonlinear model. Results show that linearized model adequately describes the actuator dynamics at the specified operating point. The agreement between simulations and experimental data indicates that the mathematical models presented are potentially valuable tools, whether to aid in the analysis and design of actuation systems, or for use in model-based control...|$|E
40|$|In control theory, sliding mode control, or SMC, is a {{nonlinear}} {{control method}} that alters {{the dynamics of}} a nonlinear system by application of a discontinuous control signal that forces the system to "slide" along a crosssection of the system's normal behavior. This book describes recent advances in the theory, properties, methods and applications of SMC. The book is organised into four parts. The first part {{is devoted to the}} design of higher-order sliding-mode controllers, with specific designs presented in the context of disturbance rejection by means of observation and identification. The second part offers a set of tools for establishing different dynamic properties of systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. Time discretization is addressed in the third part. First-order sliding modes are discretized using an implicit scheme - higher-order slidingmode differentiators, typically used in output-feedback schemes, are discretized {{in such a way that}} the optimal accuracy of their continuous-time counterparts is restored. The last part is dedicated to applications. In the context of energy conversion, sliding-mode control is applied to variable-speed wind turbines, fuel cell coupled to a power converter, rugged DC series motors and rectifiers with unity power factor, and <b>electropneumatic</b> <b>actuator.</b> Finally, an event-triggered sliding-mode scheme is proposed for networked control systems subject to packet loss, jitter and delayed transmissions.
