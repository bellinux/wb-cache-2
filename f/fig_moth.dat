50|$|Other {{common names}} - {{particularly}} in the nonbiological literature - are dried currant moth and <b>fig</b> <b>moth,</b> which invite confusion with the close relatives C. figulilella (raisin moth) and C. calidella (dried fruit moth). C. cautella has achieved an essentially cosmopolitan distribution due to inadvertent transport with its larval food; it has, for example, been transported across Polynesia with copra shipments.|$|E

40|$|Black cutworm moths {{arrive in}} Iowa with spring storms each year. These moths lay eggs in {{fields and the}} {{emerging}} black cutworm larvae cut seedling corn. The sporadic nature of this pest makes scouting essential to determine if management is needed. To make scouting easier, the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program at Iowa State University relies on a network of farmers, agronomists, and Extension staff to place and monitor traps for the adult <b>moths</b> (<b>Fig.</b> 1). The IPM Program uses this moth capture data and temperature data to estimate when farmers {{are most likely to}} see larvae in their fields...|$|R
40|$|China, {{near the}} {{frontier}} of Myanmar. It is surrounded by low mountains covered with evergreen forests and shrubs (Fig. 1). As a tradition, the natives often cut and burn the forests for agriculture, resulting in increasing loss of forest habitat (<b>Fig.</b> 2). The <b>moth</b> fauna of this place is quite diverse, but as {{in other areas of}} the world, the biodiversity is decreasing due to more frequent human activities. Twenty years ago, a female larentiine moth with unusual wing shape and pattern was caught at Heinitang for the first time. Although several expeditions have been carried out at Heinitang and adjacent areas in the past ten years, no new material has been found. With increasing destruction of habitat, the possibility of finding new material of this moth is diminishing, and the purpose of this paper is to describe this extremely rare new species and bring attention to its plight. This new species has some features in common with the genus Heterophleps Herrich-Schäffer, 1854, but also has some atypical features. Therefore, it may belong to Heterophleps or a new genus closely related to Heterophleps, but it is clear that a single female is not enough to clarify the systematic position of the new species.

40|$|Diversification {{of insect}} herbivores is often {{associated}} with coevolution between plant toxins and insect countermeasures, resulting in a specificity that restricts host plant shifts. Gall inducers, however, bypass plant toxins and the factors influencing host plant associations in these specialized herbivores remain unclear. We reconstructed the evolution of host plant associations in Western Palaearctic oak gallwasps (Cynipidae: Cynipini), a species-rich lineage of specialist herbivores on oak (Quercus). (1) Bayesian analyses of sequence data for three genes revealed extreme host plant conservatism, with inferred shifts between major oak lineages (sections Cerris and Quercus) closely matching the minimum required to explain observed diversity. It thus appears that the coevolutionary demands of gall induction constrain host plant shifts, both in cases of mutualism (e. g., <b>fig</b> wasps, yucca <b>moths)</b> and parasitism (oak gallwasps). (2) Shifts between oak sections occurred independently in sexual and asexual generations of the gallwasp lifecycle, implying that these can evolve independently. (3) Western Palaearctic gallwasps associated with sections Cerris and Quercus diverged at least 20 million years ago (mya), prior to the arrival of oaks in the Western Palaearctic from Asia 5 - 7 mya. This implies an Asian origin for Western Palaearctic gallwasps, with independent westwards range expansion by multiple lineages...|$|R
40|$|The {{light brown}} apple moth (LBAM) {{is a member}} of the Tortricidae, a large family of moths (Lepidoptera) that {{includes}} many pest species. In North America there are approximately 1200 species of tortricids, which are often referred to as “leafrollers” because the larvae of some species feed inside a rolled leaf. Most tortricid moths are small and brown with a wingspan of approximately 10 - 30 mm. Although wing pattern can be used to identify some tortricids, the forewings of LBAM are extremely variable and wing pattern should not be used for identification. This aid is designed to assist in the screening and identification of LBAM adults collected from sticky traps in the United States. It covers basic sorting of traps, first and second level screening, and identification based on morphological characters. Due to the extreme variability of LBAM adults, prior knowledge of dissection techniques and Lepidopteran morphology may be necessary to identify suspect LBAM specimens. Figure 1 : Outline of a light brown apple moth in resting position. Sorting Traps should be initially sorted based on the presence of moths of the appropriate size, color, and shape. Traps that contain moths meeting all of the following requirements should be moved to level 1 screening: 1) moths are approximately 7 - 12 mm long (forewing length) (Fig. 2 & 3) 2) moths caught in sticky traps have yellowish-brown to dark brown appearance (<b>Fig.</b> 2) 3) <b>moths</b> caught in sticky traps will generally have standard appearance similar to the outline shown in Fig. ...|$|R
40|$|The greater peachtree borer (Order Lepidoptera, Family Sesiidae) is {{native to}} North America where wild {{cherries}} and plums are its native hosts. It is a sporadic pest in Utah stone fruit orchards, but if left unmanaged it can be severe enough to cause tree loss. The adults are clearwing <b>moths</b> (<b>Fig.</b> 1). The larvae are pinkish-white caterpillars that bore into the trunks where they feed just under the bark in the cambial tissue (Fig. 2). There is one generation per year, but some larvae may require 2 years to complete development (Fig. 3). Extensive larval feeding can girdle and kill trees. The larvae primarily attack tree trunks just at or below the soil line (Fig. 4), but may enter trunks up to 12 inches above the ground. Other tree problems that are confused with peachtree borer injury include winter freeze and mechanical injury, and infection by canker-causing fungi such as Cytospora. All of these problems can cause copious sap or gum to exude from holes or cracks in the bark. Key symptoms of peachtree borer infestation are the presence of sawdust and frass mixed with the gummy exudate near {{the base of the}} trunk (Fig. 5). Prevention is the most effective approach to management. Pheromone-based mating disruption and trunk sprays with synthetic insecticides are the primary management tactics. Adult peachtree borers become active in mid to late June in northern Utah (Fig. 3) and trunks should be protected from tunneling larvae beginning the first week of July (3 - 4 weeks earlier in southern Utah) through late August to early September...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case {{report of a}} 5 -year-old boy with presumed {{anaphylaxis}} to the caterpillar, Lophocampa maculata, manifesting as the acute development of diffuse urticaria and progressive dyspnea. This reaction required prompt treatment with antihistamines and a bronchodilator. Allergen scratch testing with a homogenized caterpillar extract suggests that immunoglobulin E–mediated type I hypersensitivity as the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for the boy’s anaphylaxis. This case report represents the first documented occurrence of an anaphylactic reaction to Lophocampa maculata and adds to the rare incidence of documented hypersensitivity to the order Lepidoptera. (Allergy Rhinol 5 :e 113 –e 115, 2014; doi: 10. 2500 /ar. 2014. 5. 0086) Caterpillars are primarily known to cause dermati-tis and urticaria in humans, with cases of sys-temic reactions rarely reported. 1 – 5 Topical reactions are mediated via direct contact with caterpillar setae or airborne spread of mirror spines, which are shed by the caterpillar. 6, 7 Thaumotopoein, a protein located in cat-erpillar setae, may also mediate these responses by activating mast cell degranulation. 7 Sensitization with prior exposure to caterpillar setae is the greatest risk factor for manifesting urticarial or contact dermatitis from caterpillars. 1 Existing literature on caterpillar der-matitis, urticaria, and anaphylaxis is based primarily on the caterpillar/moth genus Thaumetopoea. This ge-nus is common to Mediterranean Europe and Af-rica. 1, 2, 5 Adverse reactions to caterpillar species within the same order, Lepidoptera, is also documented in North America. However, these documented reactions are primarily limited to locally induced dermatologic responses. 3, 8 – 10 To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} re-ported case of anaphylaxis to a new family and species of Lepidoptera caterpillars, Lophocampa maculata, the spotted tussock <b>moth</b> (<b>Fig.</b> 1) ...|$|R
