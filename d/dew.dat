5|$|<b>Dew</b> {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called <b>dew.</b> The <b>dew</b> point is a saturation point. When the <b>dew</b> point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates <b>dew</b> but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The <b>dew</b> point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the <b>dew</b> point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the <b>dew</b> point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant <b>dew</b> point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the <b>dew</b> point determines the specific humidity of the air. The <b>dew</b> point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
5|$|An air well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a <b>dew</b> pond. A <b>dew</b> pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock. The name <b>dew</b> pond (sometimes cloud pond or mist pond) derives from the widely held belief that the pond was filled by moisture from the air. In fact, <b>dew</b> ponds are primarily filled by rainwater.|$|E

5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel <b>Dew</b> of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy clerk. <b>Dew</b> apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk. Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, {{it is likely that}} Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as <b>Dew,</b> to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how <b>dew</b> condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, <b>dew</b> condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with <b>dew</b> and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

50|$|Maria Oakey <b>Dewing</b> (October 27, 1845 - December 13, 1927) was an American painter {{known for}} her {{depiction}} of flowers.

She also made figure drawings and was {{a founding member of}} the Art Students League of New York. <b>Dewing</b> won bronze medals for two of her works at world expositions.

2500|$|Also {{mirroring}} Ormuzd's act of creation, i.e., {{the realization}} of the Amesha Spentas by his [...] "thought", is Ahriman's creation of the <b>dews</b> through his [...] "demonic essence." [...] Other texts describe this event as being to Ahriman's detriment for his act of [...] "creation" [...] is actually an act of destruction. Ahriman is the very epitome (and hypostasis) of destruction, and hence he did not [...] "create" [...] the demons, he realized them through destruction, and they then became that destruction. The consequence is that, as Ahriman and the <b>dews</b> can only destruct, they will ultimately destroy themselves (Denkard 3). As the medieval texts also do for Ahriman, they question whether the <b>dews</b> exist at all. Since [...] "existence" [...] is the domain of Ormuzd, and Ahriman and his <b>dews</b> are anti-existence, it followed that Ahriman and his <b>dews</b> could not possibly exist. One interpretation of the Denkard proposes that the <b>dews</b> were perceived to be non-existent physically (that is, they were considered non-ontological) but present psychologically.

5|$|All air well designs {{incorporate}} a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that <b>dew</b> forms. <b>Dew</b> {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E
5|$|To left {{of center}} in the station model, the {{temperature}} and <b>dew</b> point are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees Fahrenheit. Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal <b>dew</b> point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can help determine location of weather fronts.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Wilmer <b>Dewing</b> (May 4, 1851 [...] - [...] November 5, 1938) was an American painter {{working at}} the turn of the 20th century.

The Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian Institution has a collection of his works. He was the husband of fellow artist Maria Oakey <b>Dewing.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Dewing</b> created {{embroidered}} applique {{pieces that}} were like tapestries {{in the early}} 1880s.

5|$|A {{moderate}} {{risk for}} severe weather was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center two days prior to the event. The storm then moved across {{the most of the}} Midwest on October 18, where a moderate risk was in effect also for two days for most of Illinois, Indiana and parts of Kentucky, although the moderate risk was revised further to the south and east to include western Ohio, western Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and a larger portion of Kentucky while Michigan and Wisconsin were no longer under a moderate risk. A slight risk of severe weather was forecast for a large area from beyond the Canada–US border to the Florida Panhandle and Mobile Bay. <b>Dew</b> points above 70°F (21°C) were reported well into the Ohio Valley, and <b>dew</b> points above 60°F (16°C) were reported as far north as northern Ontario.|$|E

J. <b>Dew</b> also broke a wheel, but continued the race in W. H. Warren's car; both being entered by J. W. H. <b>Dew.</b> A fourth driver, {{in one of the}} White steam cars, succumbed to the same problem, while A. J. Hancock crashed his Vauxhall into a tree, also breaking a wheel.

25|$|<b>Dews</b> play {{a crucial}} role in the cosmogonic drama of the Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian view of {{creation}} completed in the 12th century. In this text, the evil spirit Ahriman (the middle Persian equivalent of Avestan Angra Mainyu) creates his hordes of <b>dews</b> to counter the creation of Ormuzd (Avestan Ahura Mazda). This notion is already alluded to in the Vendidad (see Younger Avestan texts above), but only properly developed in the Bundahishn. In particular, Ahriman is seen to create six <b>dews</b> that in Zoroastrian tradition are the antitheses of the Amahraspands (Avestan Amesha Spentas).|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} strong low {{pressure}} systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached the low 80s°F (27°C) with <b>dew</b> points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C).
