50|$|In the 1920s, more cameras {{such as the}} Newman-Sinclair, Eyemo, and De Vry were {{beginning}} to be created with hand-held ergonomics in mind. The Bolex camera was introduced using half-width 16 mm film stock. These smaller cameras satisfied the demand from both the growing newsreel and <b>documentary</b> <b>fields,</b> {{as well as the}} emerging amateur market. They were specifically designed to hold shorter lengths of film - usually 100 to 200 ft—and were driven by hand-wound mainspring clockworks which could last continuously through most or even all of a film roll on one winding. These cameras saw limited use in professional filmmaking. Further examples of limited hand-held work in the late 1920s include J.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes that}} California {{contemporary}} photographer Catherine Opie 2 ̆ 7 s Being and Having series (1991) and her Portrait series (1993 - 1996) parody the constraining binary gender discourse and stereotypes that emanate from it. In her art Opie uses familiar codes and identity discourses associated with traditional portrait photography and typological photographs {{to promote a}} postmodern and fluid model of gender identity. Her manipulation of photographic technique and subject matter validates cultural stereotypes of gender {{at the same time}} that it destabilizes them. Opie also simultaneously highlights fallacies such as the presumed objectivity and evidential force that is associated with the discourse of portrait photography as a <b>documentary</b> <b>field.</b> By presenting her portraits of lesbians to broad-based audiences in such a blatant and stylized manner, Opie comments on the limitations of society 2 ̆ 7 s continued reliance on gender non-nativity and physiognomic modes of identifying communities...|$|E

In particular, we focused our attention on one of the access points to pastoral resources of the upper Aveto valley connected to transhumance systems involving mainly sheep until the end of 19 th century. This study was carried out in the perspective of the identification of different agri-silvo-pastoral practices concerning the common-land use system since the 16 th century. In this particular case, the comparison of different sources allowed the reconstruction of the relationship between settlement development, environmental resources management systems and the abandonment of these practices...|$|E
