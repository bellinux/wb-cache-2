25|$|The general {{positioning}} {{of the field and}} the blocking of the batsmen's known strokes was admirable, and his placing was responsible for at least three of the catches made. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> the knack of keeping his men equable and happy. If there were just a little more punch or bite in his make-up one could regard Yardley as a thoroughly satisfactory England captain of the near future.|$|E
25|$|Superficially, {{the ceiling}} is a Humanist construction. The figures are of superhuman {{dimension}} and, {{in the case}} of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.|$|E

2500|$|The 12th annual festival {{began with}} a special Wanda Jackson pre-festival benefit show held at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa on July 7, 2009. In an e-mail {{interview}} before the show Jackson said, [...] "There is no other artist who has influenced the music world any more than Woody Guthrie. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> my respect and admiration for his contributions.” Openers for the show were Nancy Apple and Ronny Elliott.|$|E
2500|$|Aboriginal woman Karina Lester and Chief Executive Craig Wilkins of the Conservation Council of South Australia raised {{concerns}} that the submission process was unnecessarily complicated as written submissions were required to be signed by a Justice of the Peace. Lester and Wilkins argued {{that this would be}} particularly difficult for members of regional and remote communities. Lester also pointed out that the language of the Commission's presentations and issues papers made them difficult for aboriginal people to comprehend. Lester drew attention to her father, Yami Lester, who lost his sight after exposure to radioactive fallout from British nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and 1960s. She told the ABC: [...] "My father (lives) 27 kilometres west form Marla Bore, (he) doesn't drive, wouldn't have a JP on hand, and would probably need to travel down to Coober Pedy... but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> a story to tell and certainly would love to have input into the Royal Commission."The Royal Commission responded by agreeing to accept oral submissions in addition to formal written submissions.|$|E

50|$|In 800, Charlemagne {{enlarged}} the hostel at the Muristan in Jerusalem {{and added}} a library to it. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not been personally in Jerusalem.|$|R
60|$|It suited Wade, then, to step forward; {{and if he}} {{expected}} surprise and pleasure to break across the sheriff's stern face <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not reckoned in vain.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. I {{had never}} heard of him as a boxer. Still, he seems very anxious to go down, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> one {{remarkable}} testimonial, and as there's no one else--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gee, but I {{certainly}} {{am sorry}} for him!" [...] whispered Andy to his twin. [...] "He isn't a fellow that I would cotton to, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> got {{himself into a}} pickle." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it might}} be just coming out, and what a shame to move! A skin that would bring five dollars was surely worth waiting {{for a little while}} longer, and he might never have such another chance. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> never had such a one before.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had,</b> for, as <b>he</b> spoke, Rose {{pulled down}} the {{mistletoe}} and threw it into the fire, while the boys jeered at the crestfallen Prince, and exalted quick-witted Rose to the skies.|$|R
50|$|The exact date of Paris's {{birth is}} uncertain, as is its location: some sources list him as born in Cambridge, others as born in Edinburgh, {{a city with}} which <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> some links.|$|R

6000|$|... "Lady Catherine de Bourgh," [...] she replied, [...] "has very lately {{given him}} a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first {{introduced}} to her notice, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not known her long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> {{had a close}} call. We {{must get}} him ashore and work over {{him as soon as}} possible. You light the way; I think I can carry him alone." ...|$|E
60|$|But His Eminence was clever {{enough to}} know exactly how far he might dare venture. For the moment <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> said enough. The Duke seemed partly dazed and had {{altogether}} forgotten his presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true. But as Ulf's friend {{declares}} that <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not gone {{out that way}} during the evenings {{that he had been}} keeping watch, it is likely that it was their first meeting." ...|$|R
50|$|Roth {{has been}} {{credited}} with the measures taken to restore {{public confidence in the}} Swiss banking system and blamed for destroying the Swiss franc.

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> {{not much}} respect for it. He {{seems to go}} out of his way almost to openly insult it. He calls half-past two thirty-eight o'clock, and in twenty minutes from then he says it is one! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They do {{say about}} the country," [...] whispered Mrs. Townsend, [...] "that he refuses to be the heir at all. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not had any cards printed with the title on them--I know that as a fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and Oswald {{were away}} {{together}} {{when she told}} me that she had made up her mind. Oswald has hardly spoken to her since you have been in the house. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not spoken to her about you since you came to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor youth! we were mistaken {{in those}} facts, and of course, all is forgiven and {{forgotten}} now; but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> a tremendous temper. I shall {{never forget that}} exhibition. Perhaps poor Amabel is saved much unhappiness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I confess I don't {{understand}} it. He {{had all the}} air of it. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not {{the air of a}} man who {{was going}} to rush off and give you the last proof of his confidence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although Parker could {{scarcely}} write a simple descriptive sentence {{to save his}} life, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> a huge grasp of the imagery and poetics of the English language. This is part of one sequence quoted by his son: ...|$|R

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Ron Wynn awarded the album 4½ stars stating [...] "Leroy Jenkins, free jazz's {{greatest}} violinist, has always worked best in intimate situations with equally talented partners. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> the optimum conditions on this duet date".|$|R
5|$|Of Thomas Quiney's fate {{the records}} show little. It is speculated {{that he may}} have died in 1662 or 1663 when the parish burial records are incomplete. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> a nephew in London, who by this time held the lease to The Cage.|$|R
60|$|Caroline {{still looked}} him {{full in the}} face. He was sitting, but she had not sat down. She was {{standing}} before him, faultless in demeanour, in posture, and in dress. If it had been his aim to confound her, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> so far missed his object.|$|R
