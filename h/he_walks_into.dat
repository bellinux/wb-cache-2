5|$|A {{town meeting}} is held to discuss Mr. Burns' actions. Mr. Burns arrives, {{armed with a}} gun after his {{encounter}} with Homer. Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is heard. He stumbles out into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, just about anyone {{could have been the}} shooter.|$|E
5|$|After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is {{restored}} to freedom {{and returned to}} his family, leaving behind the other slaves. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Solomon never met again.|$|E

He {{has started a}} job, working with children, and gives Tom £40 because Tom has [...] "done so much" [...] for Migg. Migg wants {{to take over the}} tenancy on the flat until Tom's benefits come in. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> the bathroom to get into the bath as Gerri walks in and comforts Tom, who asks her not to leave. Gerri tells Tom that he has invented Migg to cope with what has been happening. She says Tom is depressed and has had a nervous breakdown. The pair head into the bathroom, but there is no Migg. Gerri tells Tom to [...] "get this Migg out of [...] head once and for all". She leaves, and Migg emerges from a hiding place; he asks if everything is alright.|$|E

2500|$|George Lucas was set {{to provide}} Abrams with advice as a {{creative}} consultant; however, Lucas had no involvement with the film, with his representative stating Lucas [...] "ideally would love not to see any footage until <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> the theater next December.

Production began in April 2014; it was released on December 18, 2015. In the US, the film is rated PG-13 [...] "for sci-fi action violence", the second Star Wars film to receive that rating after [...] (the five other films received a PG rating).|$|E
2500|$|The film {{ends with}} an {{epilogue}} depicting Rama's last journey, the Mahaprasthana, as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> the river with {{fire in his}} hand and becomes one with Sita, the all-pervading nature. When asked whether Rama was really committing suicide, Aravindan replied, [...] "Yes... in all probability. That is what I think. However, his death in Sarayu river is not like any other kind of death. It was a Mahaprasthanam – an event of supreme self-sacrifice and purification, leaving everything behind. Everyone dear to him had gone. He had parted from Lakshmana. He was troubled by many guilt feelings – the murder of Shambuka, the unfairness meted out to Sita... Towards the end of the film, this mood prevails – Rama walks into the Sarayu river with the sacrificial fire, bearing everything, including his loneliness, calling out for Sita ... and disappears into the depths of the waters, carrying the sacrificial fire with him into the river is not in Ramayana – it is an interpretation. Somehow the part I liked most in the film is this end." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the scene}} in which Lee was accidentally shot, Lee's {{character}} walks into his apartment and discovers his fiancée being beaten and raped by thugs. Actor Michael Massee's character fires a [...]44 Magnum revolver at Lee as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> the room. A previous scene using the same gun had called for inert dummy cartridges fitted with bullets (but no powder or primer) to be loaded in the revolver for a close-up scene; for film scenes that utilize a revolver (where the bullets are visible from the front) and do not require the gun to actually be fired, dummy cartridges provide the realistic appearance of actual rounds. Instead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film's prop crew created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge then reinserting the bullets. However, they unknowingly or unintentionally left the live primer {{in place at the}} rear of the cartridge. At some point during filming, the revolver was apparently discharged with one of these improperly-deactivated cartridges in the chamber, setting off the primer with enough force to drive the bullet partway into the barrel, where it became stuck (a condition known as a squib load). The prop crew either failed to notice this or failed to recognize the significance of this issue.|$|E

Pleasure-seekers from every nation in the world are here, sharpers of both sexes, wearers of the stars and cordons of every court in Europe; Russian princesses, Spanish grandees, Belgian, French, and English nobles, every degree of Briton, from the ambassador, who has his conge, to the London apprentice who has come out for his fortnight's lark.
