5000|$|Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin's tenure on Rocky Top {{is off to}} {{a smooth}} start. Jonathan Crompton threw five {{touchdown}} passes Saturday, leading the Volunteers to a 63-7 rout of Football Bowl Subdivision newcomers Western Kentucky and their largest margin of victory in nine years. [...] "This is the way that we expect to play," [...] Kiffin said. [...] "We have high expectations here. I just talked to them about understanding that was one game and it's over. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to play better next week." [...] In its first two drives, Tennessee looked as if it hadn't learned much under Kiffin, the youngest active coach in the division. Crompton threw a pass over the middle that was easily tipped by Thomas Majors and intercepted by Jamal Forrest, and Montario Hardesty fumbled after a hard hit. The Vols settled down after the first quarter, and Hardesty carried for 18 and 22 yards to help set up a 2-yard touchdown run by freshman Bryce Brown early in the second quarter. Bobby Rainey fumbled on the Hilltoppers' next play, and LaMarcus Thompson recovered for Tennessee. Crompton connected with Luke Stocker on his first of two TD catches to make it 14-0 only 7 seconds later.|$|E

In the episode, Rob lures Dawn out into the country so that May can handcuff her to the bed {{in order to give}} Dawn a home Caesarian. This {{screening}} prompted over 200 complaints to the BBC. Laing commented: [...] "I was shocked when I read the script and my girlfriend Ali has been a bit disturbed by what I've been up to. She's enjoyed it but she's been a bit horrified at the same time! I didn't have any idea how bonkers it was going to get. ... Rob and May were going through real problems with IVF then made some bad choices which got them spiralling into this very dark place. It's good drama and a difficult thing to pull off when it's going out at 8pm. Although we received a lot of complaints last week nobody was trying to offend people." [...] Dawn falls in love with Rob, and he uses this to get a child for May and himself. Laing admitted it was an [...] "intense" [...] period, and commented: [...] "As an actor, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to get your head around it. I never thought about Rob as a villain, he's just someone who makes bad choices and digs holes he can't get out of. The very last turn, when it got so extreme, I put it down to him falling out of love with Dawn and his wife having this spell on him. ... He justifies it to himself by thinking Dawn wants to give the baby up anyway {{and she was going to}} take money for it. I think deep down he has a conscience and there is probably a part of him which is horrified but there's no going back." ...|$|E

By the time I {{get the kids}} dressed, fed, and off to school, fight the traffic into town, and {{scramble}} for a parking spot, I feel like I’ve already put in a day’s work. And then the whirlwind begins.

But this means rushing home with a full briefcase and working after dinner until 11 : 00 or so, and then a few hours ’ sleep, and another round begins. If I could just cut back to a three-day week, I’d have time to do more with the PTA, I could join that book club, I could read the newspaper in the morning, and I could be more present with the family. We can live with the reduced income. How much more sane life would be if I just cut back. ”—A harried lawyer Workplace flexibility is a major concern in business today. As companies are scram-bling to recruit and retain professional em-ployees and managers with critical skills, us-ing expensive search firms, paying large signing bonuses, and offering bounties to employees whose referrals result in new hires, significant resources are being put into creating attractive employee rewards. The one thing that is becoming clear is that money alone is not enough. Increasingly, with the high incidence of two-career house-holds, and the concomitant need to juggle work, home, community, and other life roles, time is a major currency. For example, one recent online survey conducted by Career-Path. com found that 40 % of responding workers plan to change jobs in the next year, and that they will be looking for “workplaces that allow them to tailor their hours to sui...|$|E
