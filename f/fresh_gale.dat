60|$|They were {{steaming}} {{then with}} a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> on the quarter and all their canvas set, to help the engines. But by itself the sail power {{was not enough to}} keep way on her. When the propeller went the ship broached-to at once, and the masts got whipped overboard.|$|E
60|$|Loud {{and clear}} were both the signals, but {{four and a}} half miles of {{distance}} and a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> neutralised their influence. The look-out on the pier did not observe them. In less than five minutes the gun and rocket were fired again. Still no answering signal came from Ramsgate.|$|E

50|$|Dawison was {{considered}} in Germany an actor {{of a new}} type; a leading critic wrote that he and Marie Seebach swept like <b>fresh</b> <b>gales</b> over dusty tradition, and brushing aside the monotony of declamation gave to their roles more character and vivacity than had hitherto been known on the German stage. His chief parts were Mephistopheles, Franz Moor, Mark Antony, Hamlet, Charles V, Richard III and King Lear.|$|R
6000|$|They christened the bay [...] "The Parting of Friends," [...] and the Golden Hind {{was driven}} down again into 55 degrees south latitude. <b>Fresh</b> <b>gales</b> fell upon them and, {{as has been}} said, it was not till October the 28th, after fifty-two days of almost unexampled bad weather, that the sky cleared, {{and they were able}} to renew their journey. They searched the islands in all {{directions}} for their missing friends, and in remembrance of them the admiral gave them the name of the Elizabethedes.|$|R
60|$|Loud {{and clear}} were both our signals, but {{four and a}} half miles of {{distance}} and a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> neutralised their influence on that dark and dismal night. The lookout did not see them. In a few minutes the gun and rocket were fired again. Still no answering signal came from Ramsgate.|$|E
60|$|The rate {{at which}} the little craft was flying before a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale,</b> in {{perfectly}} smooth water, soon put our sealers in a better condition to form closer estimates of their chances. The look-outs aloft, one of whom was Hazard, the first officer, sent down on deck constant reports of what they could see.|$|E

At 4 p.m., wind south-west, <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> and heavy rain. A large fleet {{anchored}} in the Downs. A schooner was seen to anchor in a bad place about this time. At 7, wind still increasing. The watch observed several vessels part from their 7 anchors and proceed to Margate Roads. At 7:30 the wind flew into the nor'-nor'-west, and blew a hurricane." ...|$|E
60|$|We were {{so short}} of men {{that every one}} on board had to bear a hand--only the captain lying on a {{mattress}} in the stern and giving his orders; for, though greatly recovered, {{he was still in}} want of quiet. We laid her head for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds and a couple of <b>fresh</b> <b>gales,</b> we were all worn out before we reached it.|$|R
50|$|As an {{outlying}} {{island in}} the small archipelago of islands in the Ammassalik region, Kulusuk Island is the most exposed to the persistent northeasterly winds from the Greenland Sea. Although the average winter temperatures are {{higher than in the}} more northerly settlements on the west coast of Greenland−often in single digits below zero−the ferocity of winds brings the effective temperatures down by more than an order of magnitude. During a quarter or more January days the island experiences wind speeds between 8 and 10 on the Beaufort scale, qualifying as <b>fresh</b> <b>gales,</b> strong gales, or storms.|$|R
6000|$|... 5. All thy strange, passionate, sudden rushings forward after Jesus Christ, coming sinners {{know what}} I mean, {{they also are}} thy helps from God. Perhaps thou feelest at some times more than at others, strong stirrings up of heart to fly to Jesus Christ; now thou hast at this time a sweet and stiff gale of the Spirit of God, filling thy sails with the <b>fresh</b> <b>gales</b> of his good Spirit; and thou ridest at those times as upon {{the wings of the}} wind, being carried out beyond thyself, beyond the most of thy prayers, and also above all thy fear and temptations.|$|R
60|$|We stayed {{three days}} {{longer than we}} appointed, and hearing nothing amiss from them, we were {{satisfied}} that all was right with them; so we put to sea, standing off to the west, till {{we were out of}} sight of the shore, and then we stood away due south, with a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> at north-west-by-west, and fair weather, though the wind chopped about soon after, and we had calms and hot weather that did us no good, but made our men sick and lazy.|$|E
60|$|Steering {{due south}} from hence in quest of the mainland, {{we went on}} eleven days more, and saw nothing significant, and, upon a fair observation, I found {{we were in the}} {{latitude}} of 47° 8' south; then I altered my course a little to the eastward, finding no land, and the weather very cold, and going on with a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> at south-south-west for four days, we made land again; but it was now to the east-north-east, so that we were gotten, as we may say, beyond it.|$|E
6000|$|... 14, 314--*fire-flags*. The {{notion of}} the [...] "fire-flags" [...] "hurried about" [...] was {{probably}} suggested to Coleridge by {{the description of the}} Northern Lights (aurora borealis) in Hearne's [...] "Journey ... to the Northern Ocean," [...] a book printed in 1795 and known to both Wordsworth and Coleridge before 1798. Hearne says: [...] "I can positively affirm that in still nights I have frequently heard them make a rustling and crackling noise, like the waving of a large flag in a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> of wind." [...] See also Wordsworth's [...] "Complaint of a Forsaken Indian Woman" [...] (Cooper).|$|E
6000|$|Poor Sunny {{was at her}} wits' {{end with}} all these troubles; {{but she would not}} wake her mother, and tried to manage her unruly {{brothers}} alone. West helped her, for while Sunny shone, and shone so sweetly that Rain had to stop crying, West tugged at the weather-cocks till she made East give way, and let her blow for a while. He was out of breath and had to yield; so the [...] "bad spell of weather" [...] was over, and the poor, half-drowned people could get dry and fish their furniture out of the flood, and moor their floating houses at last. Sunny kept on smiling till she dried up the ground. West sent <b>fresh</b> <b>gales</b> to help her, and by March things looked much better.|$|R
25|$|The term Chinook wind is {{also used}} in British Columbia, and is the {{original}} usage, being rooted in the lore of coastal tribes and brought to Alberta by the fur-traders. Such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest. The winds are {{also known as the}} pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii. The air associated with a west coast Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, <b>fresh</b> <b>gales</b> are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon (most of the region’s stormy winds come when a fast ‘westerly’ jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash).|$|R
40|$|The actjve {{development}} of this disturbance occurred in the south-central, or middle, Gulf of Mexico, and its increase in intensity was phenomenally rapid.

J. C. Donnel, lat. 27 O, long. 93 O (about 190 miles southeast of Gslveston), reported a barometer of 28. 88 inches, wind southwest, <b>fresh</b> <b>gales</b> and heavy, confused seas.

60|$|But {{as soon as}} it grew dusk in the evening, I {{changed my}} course, and steered {{directly}} south and by east, bending my course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabout, for we saw no people.|$|E
60|$|We sailed {{again the}} six-and-twentieth day after we came in, having a fair wind at north and north-north-west, and a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> which held us five days without intermission; in which time, running away south and south-south-east, {{we reached the}} former {{latitude}}, where we had been, and meeting with nothing remarkable, we steered a little farther to the eastward; but keeping a southerly course still, till we came into the latitude of 41°, and then going due east, with the wind at north and by west, we reckoned our meridian distance from the Ladrones, to be 50° 30'.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in the}} {{latitude}} of 27 degrees 5 minutes N. and the 19th day of March 1684--5, when we espied a sail, our course S.E. and by S. We soon perceived {{it was a large}} vessel, and that she bore up to us; but could not at first {{know what to make of}} her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-topmast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she fires a gun as a signal of distress. The weather was pretty good, wind at N.N.W. a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale,</b> and we soon came to speak with her.|$|E

60|$|A {{wonderful}} event to-day! For five minutes, at noon, the sun {{was actually}} visible. But such a sun!--a pale and cold and sickly orb that at meridian was only 90 degrees 18 minutes above the horizon. And within the hour we were taking in sail and lying down to the snow-gusts of a <b>fresh</b> south-west <b>gale.</b>|$|R
6000|$|So the {{two young}} people resolved, not without a {{consciousness}} that what was to them a <b>fresh</b> and inspiring <b>gale,</b> to the elder generation was [...] "winds have rent thy sheltering bowers." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{morning the}} wind was at east, blowing a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale,</b> the weather being hazy, with a {{considerable}} breach of sea setting in upon the rock. The morning bell was therefore rung, in some doubt as to the practicability of making a landing. After allowing the rock to get fully up, or to be sufficiently left by the tide, that the boats might have some shelter from {{the range of the}} sea, they proceeded at 8 a.m., and upon the whole made a pretty good landing; and after two hours and three-quarters’ work returned to the ship in safety.|$|E
60|$|About {{four o'clock}} in the evening, being then within a league of the island, I found {{the point of the}} rocks which occasioned this disaster, {{stretching}} out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting off the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north, and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was due west, but almost full north. However, having a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale,</b> I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west: and, in about an hour, came within about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.|$|E
60|$|But {{as soon as}} it grew dusk in the evening, I {{changed my}} course, and steered {{directly}} south and by east, bending my course a little towards the east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day, at three o’clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.|$|E

"Look ye here," [...] said Jack Molloy, rising {{when their}} [...] "feed" [...] was about concluded, [...] "I've {{no doubt they}} won't object to your taking a squint at the readin'-room, though they won't let you use it." [...] Following his companion, Miles passed by a glass double door into an {{enormous}} well-lighted, warm room, seventy feet long, and of proportionate width and height, in which a goodly number of men of the sea were busy as bees--some of them reading books or turning over illustrated papers and magazines, others smoking their pipes, and enjoying themselves in rocking-chairs {{in front of the}} glowing fire, chatting, laughing, and yarning as free-and-easily as if in their native fo'c's'ls, while a few were examining the pictures on the walls, or the large models of ships which stood at one side of the room. At the upper end a full-sized billiard-table afforded amusement to several players, and profound interest to a number of spectators, who passed their comments on the play with that off-hand freedom which seems to be a product of <b>fresh</b> <b>gales</b> and salt-water. A door standing partly open at the upper end of this apartment revealed a large hall, from which issued faintly the sound of soft music.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like enough," [...] {{the sailor}} replied; [...] "a gale {{like this is}} like to blow itself out in twenty-four hours. It has been the worst I ever saw.

60|$|While Clay traced her {{movements}} {{as far as}} they could be learned, the Cetacea was slowly working north. She met with light, baffling winds, and calms, and then was driven into a lonely inlet by a <b>fresh</b> <b>gale.</b> Here she was detained for some time, and adverse winds still dogged her course when she put to sea again, though they were no longer gentle, but brought with them a piercing rawness from the Polar ice. Her crew grew anxious and moody as they stubbornly thrashed her to windward under shortened sail, for every day at sea increased the strain on their finances and the open-water season was short.|$|E
6000|$|She did not speak, but {{offered him}} her {{hand with a}} look which said much.

As she took her seat, he folded his plaid about her so tenderly that {{it felt like a}} friendly arm shielding her from the <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> that blew up from the sea. It was an unusual attention on his part, and coming just then it affected her so curiously that, when he lounged down beside her, she felt a strong desire to lay her head on his shoulder and sob out,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The same {{evening we}} stood away full south, {{to see if}} we could find out the {{continuance}} of the former land; but as we found no land, so a great sea coming from the south we concluded we should find no land that way. And, varying our course easterly, we ran with a fair <b>fresh</b> <b>gale</b> at north-west and by west, for seven days more; in all which time, we saw nothing but the open sea every way; and making an observation found we had passed the southern tropic; and that we were in the latitude of 26° 13', after which we continued our course still southerly for several days more, until we found, by another observation, that we were in 32° 20'.|$|E
60|$|After lying {{several weeks}} at Almeria, the ship {{got under way}} for England again. We had <b>fresh</b> {{westerly}} <b>gales,</b> and beat to and fro, between Europe and Africa, for some time, when we got a Levanter that shoved us out into the Atlantic at a furious rate. In the Straits we passed a squadron of Portuguese frigates, that was cruising against the Algerines. It was the practice of these ships to lie at the Rock until it blew strong enough from the eastward to carry vessels through the Gut, when they weighed and kept in the offing until the wind shifted. This was blockading the Atlantic against their enemies, and the Mediterranean against their own ships.|$|R
50|$|On 5 December 1875 the {{lifeboat}} Herbert Ingram (first) {{had to be}} pulled two miles along the beach to rescue the Colchester barge Star which had been on passage from Hull to Poole when it was driven aground at Winthorne Gap in a <b>fresh</b> easterly <b>gale.</b> At 6 am in the morning {{the lifeboat}} was launched through heavy breaking surf into a headwind and took twenty minutes to reach the casualty. Two crew men were immediately taken off the stricken vessel, but the master fell into the water between the two boats. Samual Moody and George Chesnutt, at great risk to themselves immediately went into the water with a line and held on to the master whilst the lifeboat was rowed to shore. For their bravery in this rescue both Moody and Chesnutt were awarded RNLI silver medals.|$|R
60|$|Agatha said nothing, but a faint {{tinge of}} color crept into her cheeks, and Mrs. Hastings {{was glad to}} see it, for she had noticed that the girl was looking pale and haggard. The strain of the last few months that she had spent in England was {{beginning}} to tell on her. She had borne it courageously, but a reaction had set in, and the trip had been fatiguing. The Scarrowmania had plunged along, bows under, against <b>fresh</b> northwesterly <b>gales</b> most of the way across the Atlantic, and there is very little comfort on board a small, deeply-loaded steamer when she rolls her rails in, and lurches with thudding screw swung clear over big, steep-sided combers. Moreover, Agatha had scarcely slept during the few days and nights that she had spent in the train. It takes time to become accustomed to the atmosphere of a heated sleeper, and since she had landed she had been in a state of not unnatural nervous tension.|$|R
