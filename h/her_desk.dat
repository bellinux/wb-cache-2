Novak) that she's ready {{to be set up}} with one of his friends from business school, which visibly pains Jim.|$|E
5|$|Kyoto held {{a year-long}} celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of Genji in 2008, with poetry competitions, {{visits to the}} Tale of Genji Museum in Uji and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size {{rendition}} of Murasaki at <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> was displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layered Heian court JÅ«nihitoe and ankle-length hair wigs. The author and her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and The Tale of Genji. A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.|$|E
5|$|Pile and her co-writers {{initially}} used {{battery packs}} to represent characters, moving them around on <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> to develop scenarios for the show. The {{decision to make}} the characters doctors came later. Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.|$|E

Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly. The scene ends with his employees in shock.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{became a}} popular subject of {{paintings}} and illustrations highlighting {{her as a}} virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> in Ishimyama Temple, staring at the moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century. The Tale of Genji became a favorite subject of Japanese ukiyo-e artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, {{by the middle of}} the Edo period the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.|$|E
5|$|Springfield Elementary School teacher Mrs. Edna Krabappel feels {{increasingly}} isolated and, {{looking for}} a companion, places a personal ad in the newspaper. A yo-yo craze sweeps through the school after a group of four demonstrate {{the potential of the}} toys. Bart breaks the class fish tank with his yo-yo, and is given one month of detention by Edna. While snooping in <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> to take back his yo-yo, he discovers her personal ad, and decides to get revenge on her pulling a prank and responding by mail.

5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E

5|$|As the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E

They accordingly went into her apartments, opened all <b>her</b> <b>desks,</b> trunks, and cabinets, seized her papers, and took them to London. Mary sat down in the scene of desolation and disorder which they left, and wept bitterly.|$|R

Tammi returns to Surekill {{early the next morning}} and rushes in to get the deposit book showing she has taken from the Surekill account out of <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> but is caught by Dwight and Randall. Dwight is interrupted by the FBI, who have a search warrant. Doggett opens the box Tammi was trying to dispose of, which contains nothing, much to her surprise.

25|$|Gorbanevskaya {{was arrested}} on 24 December 1969, while {{compiling}} issue 11.

25|$|In February 2008, during Sebelius's {{second term}} in office, {{there was a}} report in the Wichita Eagle that the State of Kansas was {{suspending}} tax refunds and that, {{because of a lack of}} tax revenue, may not have been able to meet payroll for state employees. Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not agree with her certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget rescission bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered to <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b> The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she line-item vetoed several cuts she felt were too large. The rescission bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E
60|$|She {{took him}} over to <b>her</b> husband's <b>desk,</b> opened such of the drawers as were not locked, and searched amongst their {{contents}} ruthlessly.
