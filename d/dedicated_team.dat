5|$|In {{the early}} days, team {{management}} was undertaken by a club committee. When payment of players was legalised in 1885, Alfred Jones began {{to act as}} club secretary on a voluntary basis. Small Heath's election to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League in 1892 prompted {{the board of directors}} to appoint him as the club's first paid official, responsible as secretary-manager for matters on the field in addition to his administrative duties. In his first season the club won the inaugural Second Division championship, and gained promotion to the First Division {{for the first time the}} following year via the Test Match system. Jones's 16-year tenure saw three promotions and three relegations, after the last of which in 1908 he resigned. Successor Alex Watson's two seasons in charge ended with the club having to apply for re-election to the league and with responsibility for team affairs passing to former player Bob McRoberts, who became the club's first <b>dedicated</b> <b>team</b> manager.|$|E

25|$|On 23 September 2006, 55 022 (D9000) Royal Scots Grey {{returned}} to the main line after a lengthy and extensive restoration at Barrow Hill, carried out {{on behalf of the}} owners by the DPS. It successfully hauled the SRPS 'Moray Mint' railtour from Edinburgh to Inverness, via Perth on the outward trip and back via Aberdeen. On its second working two weeks later, severe damage occurred to the number 2 end engine. The engine suffered from a leg out of bed, a term which means the engine con-rod breaks out of the engine crankcase. This left Royal Scots Grey still able to operate but on one engine only. By January 2007, the faulty power unit was removed from 55 022, put into storage and replaced by an ex-marine Napier Deltic engine modified for rail use; work was completed by Royal Scots Greys <b>dedicated</b> <b>team</b> in August 2007. After extensive testing at the East Lancs Railway the locomotive hauled its first tour since the previous engine malfunction on RTC's 'Autumn Highlander' with 50 049 and 40 145 in October 2007. 55 022 successfully hauled a number of charter tour services during 2008 but the replacement marine-sourced engine gave rise for concern following the discovery of oil in the coolant {{and at the end of}} August the locomotive was removed from future large railtour duties. The locomotive continued working mainline duty by visiting other preserved railway and moving other non-mainline registered locomotives.|$|E
500|$|Captain America: Civil War was {{the first}} film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in {{partnership}} with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having [...] "incredible scale to it" [...] and referred to by the directors as the [...] "splash panel", were shot with the cameras. Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close {{it was to the}} start of shooting as well as the idea being [...] "such a large-scale undertaking", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own <b>dedicated</b> <b>team</b> operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Aleax 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, [...] "maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to take it all in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conceptual}} Persona 3 {{was submitted}} to Atlus in 2003 by Katsura Hashino, {{who had worked}} as a designer for multiple Megami Tensei titles and had been the director for Nocturne. Gaining Atlus' approval of the concept, development started in the same year, after the completion of Nocturne and the [...] duology. Persona 3 was part of Atlus' push to expand their player base in the West. Ideas were being passed around about Persona 4, but the title did not begin official development until after the release of Persona 3. Preparations for Persona 5s development began in 2010. The team decided to shift towards more challenging story themes, saying that the shift would be more drastic than that experienced with Persona 3. Persona 4 Arena and its sequel were the first non-RPG collaborative project in the series: its success inspired the creation of both Persona Q and Dancing All Night. Beginning with Persona 3, a <b>dedicated</b> <b>team</b> originally referred to as [...] "2nd Creative Production Department" [...] has handled development for the series. The team was later dubbed [...] "P-Studio". Aside from Atlus, other developers have helped develop entries in the Persona series. During the pre-production stage of Persona 4 Arena, Hashino approached Arc System Works after being impressed by their work on the BlazBlue series. For Dancing All Night, development was initially handled by Dingo, who were well known for the [...] series. Citing quality concerns, Atlus took over development.|$|E

At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a <b>dedicated</b> <b>team</b> of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

The development of the perfume took three years to complete and Shakira compared the process to composing a song, opining that [...] "It's similar to the process you go through when writing a melody: certain chord combinations inspire different feelings in the listener. I wanted to find a way of expressing the feeling of pure happiness through the medium of fragrance". José Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, commented that Shakira was completely involved {{in the process of developing}} the fragrance and was [...] "extremely hands-on".
