In 24 sites where drilling was inapplicable due to high topography and steep slopes along the mountain side, oriented block samples were collected. Six to ten 2.5 -cm cylindrical specimens of each sample were alternating-field (AF) demagnetized in 12 steps to 90 mT using a Molspin AF demagnetizer (ASC Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

40|$|In this master thesis, {{the focus}} has been on a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V {{specimen}} produced by Norsk Titanium s patented wire-fed plasma deposition technique, under conditions promoting the break up of the traditional large columnar β-grains formed during solidification. Both the final microstructure and strain response have been studied using several different experimental techniques, such as heat tinting, light microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD combined with In-Situ tensile experiments. The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V specimen studied in this thesis consisted of several deposited layers, and each individual layer contained several small prior β-grains formed during solidification. This resulted in a microstructure with a large area covered with prior β-grain boundaries, which at room temperature was covered with grain boundary α. α-colonies was frequently observed growing from the grain boundary α, resulting in a microstructure more dominated by α-colony morphology compared to the traditional reported microstructure. The small prior β-grains found in this material did not seem to affect the thickness of the final α-plates at room temperature. However, the size of the prior β-grains was frequently observed to affect the final microstructural morphology found in the grain. Several In-Situ tensile tests were performed on specimens having either the deposition <b>direction</b> (<b>Sample</b> X) or build direction parallel (Sample Z) with the tensile direction. The observed deformation was located along the boundaries of the prior β-grains in all specimens. Inhomogeneous deformation of the samples with the build direction parallel with the tensile direction was observed after the deformed samples had been heat tinted, revealing the macro deformation. Due to the unique solidification morphology in each deposited layer, each layer was observed to deform independently during straining in the specimens from Sample Z. The observed deformation mechanism consisted of slip in both the Prismatic and Basal slip system. The orientation of the crystal structure of a α-colony has proven to be very influential on the deformation and the hard/soft -grain combination was frequently observed where most of the deformation took place...|$|E

The {{rationale}} {{for this research}} is the speed-up of radiative heat transfer computation with the Finite Element Method, widely used in mechanical engineering especially for space structure design but not yet often for thermal analysis of these structures.

The numbers of seeds deposited, seedlings emerged, and individuals recruited of A. squarrosum around adult shrubs were sampled along four transects aligned to the four main wind directions at 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. 5 and 6 m from the shrub base on both windward and leeward sides of each transect. Spatial pattern of seed deposition was strongly altered by the presence of shrubs, but effects varied with wind <b>direction,</b> <b>sampling</b> position and distance from shrubs. Significantly more seeds tended to deposit on the leeward than on the windward sides in all four transects, with the exception of transects along the least prevailing wind direction.

In general, the shrub’s influence was within a 2 m radius from the shrub, despite some differences among transects. Although seed bank density had no direct effect on A. squarrosum recruitment patterns, it contributed to the observed variation in recruitment indirectly through density-dependent emergence of seedlings.
