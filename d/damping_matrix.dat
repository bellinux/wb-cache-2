40|$|International audienceIn many {{mechanical}} engineering applications, {{the interactions of}} a structure through its boundary is modelled by a dynamic boundary stiffness matrix. Nevertheless, {{it is well known}} that the solution of such computational model is very sensitive to the modelling uncertainties on the dynamic boundary stiffness matrix. In a recent work, the "hidden state variables method" is used to identify mass, stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> associated with a given deterministic dynamic boundary stiffness matrix which can be constructed by using experimental measurements. Such an identification allows the construction of the probabilistic model of a random boundary stiffness matrix by substituting those identified mass, stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> by random matrices. Nevertheless, the numerical cost of the "hidden state variables method" increases drastically with the dimension (number of degrees of freedom) of the interface. We then propose an enhanced approach which consists in a truncated spectral representation of the displacements on the boundary and with a partition of the frequency band of analysis. A collection of mass, stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> is then identified for each sub-frequency band of analysis. A probabilis-tic model is constructed in substituting each of those matrices by random matrices. A numerical application is proposed...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} is developed that simplifies calculation of the dynamic characteristics of a self-acting, gas-lubricated slider bearing system. This technique avoids a lengthy simultaneous solution of the equations of motion of the slider and the time-dependent Reynolds' equation, while providing additional design information that is otherwise unobtainable. The equilibrium pressure distribution in the gas film is obtained using the BunovGalerkin formulation of the finite element method. By considering small perturbations of the slider bearing system about equilibrium, two coupled, second-order partial differential equations are derived, which define the in-phase and out-of-phase perturbation pressures in the gas film. These perturbation pressures are integrated to obtain the frequency dependent, non-symmetrical stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> for the slider bearing. Using the stiffness and damping properties of the gas bearing and slider support, the equations of motion for the entire slider bearing system are derived. The frequency dependence of the stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> renders the eigenvalue problem nonlinear, and the eigensolutions are obtained iteratively using Brent's method. Because of the non-symmetrical stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices,</b> a similarity transformation based {{on the left and}} right modal matrices is used to decouple the equations of motion. This decoupling is approximate because of the frequency dependence of the stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices,</b> but the resulting damped natural frequencies are shown to be in excellent agreement with published experimental data. Fractions of critical damping obtained for several slider geometries also successfully predict observed instabilities. The mode shapes of slider oscillation, unobtainable with other methods, permit calculation of the center of rotation for the coupled, pitch-heave modes; this information can be used to determine the optimum location for the magnetic transducer. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the response to disk surface displacement, and for the response to a random force applied to the slider body. These forced-response solutions are useful in identifying the critical parameters of slider design. ...|$|R
40|$|A common {{approximation}} in {{the analysis}} of non-classically damped systems is to ignore the off-diagonal elements of the modal <b>damping</b> <b>matrix.</b> This procedure is termed the decoupling approximation. It is generally believed that errors due to the decoupling approximation should be negligible if the modal <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> is diagonally dominant. In addition, the errors are expected to decrease as the modal <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> becomes more diagonally dominant. It is shown numerically in this paper that, over a finite range, errors due to the decoupling approximation can increase monotonically at any specified rate while the modal <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> becomes more diagonally dominant with its off-diagonal elements decreasing continuously in magnitude. An explanation for these unexpected drifts of decoupling errors is provided with the use of complex coupling coefficients. Small off-diagonal elements in the modal <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> are not sufficient to ensure small errors due to the decoupling approximation. Any error-criterion based solely upon the diagonal dominance of the modal <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> would not be accurate. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} easy-to-implement {{algorithm}} {{to identify a}} generalised proportional viscous <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> is developed in this work. The chief advantage of the pro-posed technique is that only a single drive-point frequency response function (FRF) measurement is needed.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we are {{interested}} in the specificities of uncertainty modeling for linearly viscoelastic 3 D dynamical structures described in the frequency domain using the nonparametric probabilistic approach of uncertainties, consisting in replacing the matrices of the mean reduced-order model by random matrices. In the context of linear viscoelasticity, the causality of the system implies a relationship induced by theHilbert transform between its frequency-dependent stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> (also known as the Kramers-Kronig, or K-K, relations). The frequency-dependent random stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> cannot be modeled as independent random matrices without violating the causality. Consequently, the stochastic model of these frequency-dependent random matrices must verify the K-K relations, yielding astatistical dependence between the stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>matrices</b> [1]. The influence of this statistical dependence will be shown in the numerical studies presented. After summarizing the theoretical construction of the stochastic model and a presentation of computationalissues, in particular concerning the computation of the Hilbert transform, we will show results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for a simple composite structures in the frequency domain. This structure, designed as a study case, is composed of a three-layers plate with two viscoelastic layers and a central purely elastic layer. We will also give insight on the behavior of the constructed stochastic model subjected to several levels of uncertainty. References [1] C. Soize, I. E.

40|$|Abstract: This note {{deals with}} three aspects of nonproportional damping in linear damped {{vibrating}} systems {{in which the}} stiffness and damping matrices are not restricted to being symmetric and positive definite. First, we give results on approximating a general <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> by one that commutes with the stiffness matrix when the stiffness matrix is a general diagonalizable matrix, and the damping and stiffness matrices do not commute. The criterion we use for carrying out this approximation is closeness in Euclidean norm between the actual <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> and its approximant. When the eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix are all distinct, the best approximant provides justification for the usual practice in structural analysis of disregarding the off-diagonal terms in the transformed <b>damping</b> <b>matrix.</b> However, when the eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix are not distinct, the best approximant to a general <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> {{turns out to be}} related to a block diagonal matrix, and the aforementioned approximation cannot be justified {{on the basis of the}} criterion used here. In this case, even when the damping and stiffness matrices commute, decoupling of the modes is not guaranteed. We show that for general matrices, even for symmetric ones, the response of the approximate system and the actual system can be widely different, in fact qualitatively so. Examples illustrating our results are provided. Second, we present some results related to the difficulty in handling general, nonproportionally damped systems, in which the <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> may be indefinite, by considering a simple example of a two degrees-of-freedom system. Last, we use this example to point out the nonintuitive response behavior of general nonproportionally damped systems when the <b>damping</b> <b>matrix</b> is indefinite. Our results point to the need for great caution in approximating nonproportionally damped systems by damping matrices that commute with the stiffness matrix, especially when considering general damping matrices. Such approximations could lead to qualitatively differing responses between the actual system and its proportionally damped approximation...|$|E
