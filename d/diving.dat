5|$|Recreational <b>diving</b> (sometimes called sport <b>diving</b> or subaquatics) is {{a popular}} leisure activity. Technical <b>diving</b> {{is a form of}} {{recreational}} <b>diving</b> under especially challenging conditions. Professional <b>diving</b> (commercial <b>diving,</b> <b>diving</b> for research purposes, or for financial gain) involve working underwater. Public safety <b>diving</b> is the underwater work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and underwater search and recovery dive teams. Military <b>diving</b> includes combat <b>diving,</b> clearance <b>diving</b> and ships husbandry.|$|E
5|$|A <b>diving</b> {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or <b>diving</b> tank is a {{gas cylinder}} used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied <b>diving</b> or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied <b>diving</b> or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a <b>diving</b> regulator or the breathing loop of a <b>diving</b> rebreather.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration <b>diving</b> {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave <b>diving,</b> wreck <b>diving,</b> ice <b>diving</b> and <b>diving</b> inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of <b>diving</b> under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

5|$|Deep sea <b>diving</b> is {{underwater}} <b>diving,</b> {{usually with}} surface supplied equipment, and often {{refers to the}} use of standard <b>diving</b> dress with the traditional copper helmet. Hard hat <b>diving</b> is any form of <b>diving</b> with a helmet, including the standard copper helmet, and other forms of free-flow and lightweight demand helmets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diving</b> may be {{performed}} for various reasons, {{both personal and}} professional. Recreational <b>diving</b> is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as cave <b>diving,</b> wreck <b>diving,</b> ice <b>diving</b> and deep <b>diving.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Diving</b> {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} <b>diving,</b> the prevention of <b>diving</b> disorders, treatment of <b>diving</b> accident injuries and <b>diving</b> fitness. The field includes {{the effect on the}} human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In <b>diving</b> accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. <b>Diving</b> medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of <b>diving</b> disorders are important parts of diver education.|$|E

5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} <b>diving,</b> the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba <b>diving</b> or surface-supplied <b>diving,</b> and the saturation <b>diving</b> technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric <b>diving</b> suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|The Naval School, <b>Diving</b> and Salvage was re-established at the Washington Navy Yard in 1927, and the Navy Experimental <b>Diving</b> Unit (NEDU) {{was moved}} to the same venue. In the {{following}} years, the Experimental <b>Diving</b> Unit developed the US Navy Air Decompression Tables, which became the accepted world standard for <b>diving</b> with compressed air.|$|E
50|$|Final: 26 August — Each diver {{performed}} a front <b>dive,</b> a back <b>dive,</b> a reverse <b>dive,</b> an inward <b>dive</b> and a twisting <b>dive.</b> There were no limitations in difficulty degree.

30|$|Plastics {{were the}} most {{abundant}} marine litter type, exceeding 50  % in both surveys. Metals were the second most abundant marine litter type, of significant occurrence. Glass/Ceramics and Miscellaneous only had a small share in the total marine litter collection. Among plastics, bottles (<b>Dive</b> 1 : 8.3  %, <b>Dive</b> 2 : 15  %), sheets (<b>Dive</b> 1 : 25  %, <b>Dive</b> 2 : 25  %), bags (<b>Dive</b> 1 : 8.3  %), entangled longlines (<b>Dive</b> 1 : 8.3  %, <b>Dive</b> 2 : 5  %), synthetic rope (<b>Dive</b> 2 : 5  %), fishing nets (<b>Dive</b> 2 : 5  %) had the highest contribution. Among metals, beverage cans (<b>Dive</b> 1 : 41.7  %, <b>Dive</b> 2 : 15  %) and fisheries related items (<b>Dive</b> 2 : 5  %) were predominant.|$|R

5|$|The colours {{permitted}} for <b>diving</b> cylinders {{vary considerably}} by region, {{and to some}} extent by the gas mixture contained. In {{some parts of the world}} there is no legislation controlling the colour of <b>diving</b> cylinders. In other regions the colour of cylinders used for commercial <b>diving,</b> or for all underwater <b>diving</b> may be specified by national standards.|$|E
5|$|The major <b>diving</b> {{accident}} and fatality research {{studies that have}} been conducted globally including work by the Divers Alert Network, the <b>Diving</b> Incident Monitoring Study, and Project Stickybeak have each identified cases where the mortality was associated with the <b>diving</b> cylinder.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} modes of <b>diving</b> {{based on the}} <b>diving</b> {{equipment}} used.|$|E
50|$|Semi-final: 24 August — Each diver {{performed}} a front <b>dive,</b> a back <b>dive,</b> a reverse <b>dive,</b> an inward <b>dive</b> and a twisting <b>dive.</b> The overall difficulty degree {{was limited to}} 9.5. The 12 divers with the highest combined score from the semi-final and preliminary <b>dives</b> advanced to the final.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dive</b> 62 (eighth in the Nekton series) {{was another}} Apra Harbor <b>dive.</b> The next <b>dive</b> (sixth in the series, <b>dive</b> 63 for Piccard) was another {{checkout}} <b>dive</b> December 18, west of Guam. It reached 5,700 feet.|$|R
50|$|Preliminary round: 23 August — Each diver {{performed}} a front <b>dive,</b> a back <b>dive,</b> a reverse <b>dive,</b> an inward <b>dive,</b> a twisting <b>dive</b> and a sixth free-choice <b>dive</b> {{from one of}} these groups. There were no limitations in degree of difficulty. The 18 divers with the highest total score advanced to the semi-final.|$|R
5|$|Trapezes {{are often}} used with <b>diving</b> shots. When <b>diving</b> in tidal waters {{at the end of}} slack water, the trapeze may be {{released}} from the <b>diving</b> shot to drift in the current as the divers make their decompression stops.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational <b>diving</b> and technical <b>diving</b> to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position.|$|E
5|$|Commercial <b>diving</b> {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational <b>diving,</b> but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial <b>diving</b> operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial <b>diving</b> operation, and this is also the case for offshore <b>diving</b> operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E

5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where <b>diving</b> takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where <b>diving</b> risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression <b>diving,</b> and particularly when <b>diving</b> under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E
