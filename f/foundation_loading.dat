The {{aim of the research}} is to investigate and segregate the three settlement stages of a raft and an isolated foundation, supported by soft clay improved by granular columns. For convenience, the programme of work is divided into two parts, in which : Part 1 examines the long term settlement performance of a smooth, rigid raft underlain by soft clay without granular columns, and with granular columns, under single and multiple configurations, at an area replacement ratio, As of 15 %; and Part 2 examines the long term settlement performance of an isolated footing underlain by soft clay without granular column and with a single granular column at an As of 33 %. The results obtained from Part 1 (raft <b>foundation</b> <b>loading)</b> of the experimental investigations challenge the effectiveness of granular columns to control foundation settlement over a prolonged period, when installed in soft clay under a range of loadings. The tests were carried out in instrumented, one dimensional testing chambers on samples (254 mm ɸ, 100 mm high) of kaolin and sleech. The results obtained from Part 2 (isolated <b>foundation</b> <b>loading)</b> of the experimental investigations suggest that granular columns are a viable option in reducing settlements (initial, consolidation and creep) in weak deposit under low bearing pressures, at which the soil is overconsolidated, and not particularly effective under moderate to high bearing pressures, at which the soil is normally consolidated.

Due to the complex nature of sloped soil structures that are subjected to <b>foundation</b> <b>loading,</b> past numerical models have been based on simplified assumptions that propose to produce conservative results for bearing capacity. This project illustrates the use of explicit finite different software (FLAC) to numerically model and analyse the behaviours of slopes under <b>foundation</b> <b>loading</b> at an advanced level. The purpose of this research is to produce a qualitative set of results for the shallow rigid foundation resting near a slope and use them to validate the previous simplified numerical models of the foundation problem. The advanced FLAC models used to obtain results within this study have been validated against a number of available solutions.

30|$|This paper {{discussed}} the liquefaction-induced {{damage to buildings}} {{that occurred during the}} Meinong earthquake. From site investigations, we determined that the formations of the liquefied sites always exhibit a very soft clay layer below the saturated sandy soils. The <b>foundation</b> <b>load</b> is mainly supported by the sandy soils and a preshear (deviatoric) stress existing in the foundation soil of the footing before earthquake. The soil is easier to reach the failure state due to the additional shear force and the generation of the excess pore water pressure triggered by the earthquake excitation and cause large settlement and deformation. During the shaking of the earthquake, the excess pore water pressure is generated and decreased the strength of the saturated sandy soils. When the softened sandy soils beneath the spread foundation cannot bear the deviatoric stress induced by the loading of the surface building as well as the additional shear force due to the seismic <b>loading,</b> the <b>foundation</b> bearing layer will be squeezed out laterally and upward. Then, the <b>foundation</b> <b>load</b> is transferred to the soft clay beneath the saturated sandy soils, which induces more settlement of the building. Note that if the weight of the surface building is uneven like the case shown in Fig.  4, the differential settlement can be observed in case of the foundation bearing layer being liquefied during earthquakes.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{principal}} stress rotations are important features of granular materials. Experimental data obtained in directional shear cell experiments for dense sand are re-analyzed and re-evaluated {{in terms of}} distortional (shear+deviatoric responses) and volumetric behaviors. Principal stress rotations in loading cause greater initial contraction but greater dilation in further shear deformation. In particular, principal stress rotations in unloading cause relatively greater contraction. The mechanisms {{of principal}} stress rotation effects on sand behavior are illustrated and interpreted. Rotations of principal stresses can mobilize more sand particles in various orientations facilitating particle rearrangement. Therefore, principal stress rotations cause greater contraction if sand tends to contract under shear but greater dilation if sand tends to dilate under shear. Loading and unloading with significant principal stress rotations are common stress states for underground soils during non-proportional <b>foundation</b> <b>loading,</b> excavation, and tunneling.

Shells foundations, by virtue of its form will necessarily be more economical. This research is primarily focused on the behavior of three different shapes of foundation viz; pyramidal shell foundation, hyperbolic paraboloid shell foundation and square flat foundation under axial loading with different founding levels. Three different height/ thickness ratio of flat and shell foundation made out of different materials (namely Plaster of Paris and polyester resin) were studied. All foundations were subjected to loading test in a soil box as purposefully designed and fabricated special for this research to model testing conditions. The test observation of foundation model was measured using dial gauges to observe the stress characteristic deformation. Experimental results from direct shear test, particle size distribution, specific gravity and compression test were analyzed to characterize the material tested (sand and sponge). Results from <b>foundation</b> <b>loading</b> tests presented in graphical form show that that foundation shape, shell aspect ratio and embedment depth significantly affected the result of load carrying capacity.

40|$|Foundations are {{ubiquitous}} to geotechnical engineering. Most shallow foundations {{are built}} in unsaturated soils {{above the ground}} water table. Methods for evaluating the bearing capacity and settlement of foundations in unsaturated soils are not yet well established. Methods developed for foundations in saturated/dry soils are not directly applicable. This study addresses this problem. It presents an effective stress based finite element formulation {{that can be used}} to predict the bearing capacity and consolidation settlement of unsaturated soil shallow foundations. For the first time the influences of hydraulic hysteresis, the location of the hydraulic state on the soil-water characteristic curve and three different drainage conditions are considered when modelling bearing capacity. The three drainage conditions are a constant suction condition, a constant moisture content condition and a constant contribution of suction to the effective stress and strength condition (also referred to as a constant χs condition). The elastic-perfectly plastic Mohr-Coulomb model is used to simulate the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soil. The effects of the location of the hydraulic state on the soil-water characteristic curve and the degree of saturation are considered when determining the rate and magnitude of consolidation settlement. The study also includes a program of experiments including plate load tests (PLTs) on saturated and unsaturated soil samples, along with cone penetration tests (CPTs) in the samples. Good agreement is obtained between computed and measured bearing capacities. It is shown by the numerical results and the experimental data that suction and hydraulic hysteresis directly impact the bearing capacity of unsaturated soil foundations. It is also shown that the constant χs condition provides a good approximation to the other two drainage conditions and may be assumed to simplify calculation of bearing capacity. When <b>foundation</b> <b>loading</b> occurs quickly, meaning a constant moisture content condition prevails, a constant χs condition can be assumed without loss of significant accuracy. The χs magnitude can be taken as being equal to the initial in-situ value for this silty sand. Further numerical analyses are performed to study the settlement of unsaturated soil foundations by simulating the consolidation of unsaturated soils. It is found that hydraulic hysteresis and degree of saturation have major influences on the consolidation of unsaturated soils. The results indicate that in engineering practice most settlement of a footing on soil with a low degree of saturation takes place during a short time. Long term settlement is insignificant and can be ignored under certain conditions...|$|E

In particular, an attempt has been made to determine the proportion of the total load supported by the piles, using simple calculation techniques. The ability to predict accurately this share out of <b>foundation</b> <b>loading</b> between piles and raft could have a marked influence in saving costs in foundation design. An attempt has also been made to predict foundation settlement with a piled raft foundation, taking into account the non-linear soil strata and heave effects from the removal of the considerable depth of overburden, in the basements. Comprehensive site investigations were carried out; initially for Blocks B. and C, and later for Block D. The results from these site investigations were used for the initial design of the piled foundations, but were found to give very conservative results. Four test piles were constructed and tested to verify the initial pile design for Blocks B and C, The test piles were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges in an attempt to determine the distribution of load down the pile shafts and on the pile bases. The results from these test piles showed that much higher stresses could be applied to the ground than had been indicated in the soil investigation report. Three further test piles were tested for Block D and gave similar results to the test piles for Blocks B and C. The various considerations affecting the choice of foundation design are discussed and the validity of the initial assumptions are compared with the actual performance of the foundations as derived from the results recorded by the instrumentation of the foundations. In order to monitor the dispersion of loading through the foundation system, vibrating wire strain gauges were built into the working piles and vibrating wire soil cells were installed under the rafts and at the bottom of piles. The test piles were also instrumented to record the distribution of shear forces on the shaft and the end bearing forces.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{physical}} model tests were conducted with foundations placed on both unreinforced and reinforced sloped fills of different angles and subjected to repeated loading of different amplitudes and frequencies. Both small- and large-scale experiments were carried out under plane-strain conditions with a strip footing placed at a constant setback distance from the slope crest. Model sloped fills consisted of moist sand (at approximately the same moisture content) compacted in layers to a consistent density. Short vertical bars at different spacings, and horizontally placed geogrid and geocell were used as reinforcement. The influence of each test variable, such as soil-reinforcement, slope angle, repeated loading amplitude and frequency, on the behaviour characteristics e. g., foundation deformation and soil stress below it, was studied. Numerical simulations of foundations on sloped fills under both monotonic and repeated loading were conducted. Also, a low-cost, repeated-load model testing facility, which incurred almost no operational or maintenance costs, was designed and manufactured. The experimental study showed that a foundation on a sloped fill, subjected to deviatoric loading amplitude 2 / 3 rd of its static load, remained stable {{as long as the}} maximum total loading remained below 50 % of its ultimate bearing capacity. Under a particular repeated loading conditions, the permanent deformations of such a foundation (in both the vertical and slope directions) were found to increase exponentially with increases in the slope angle. On the other hand, for a particular slope angle, the permanent deformations increased with increases in both the amplitude and frequency values of the repeated loading. A similar variation was observed for both the resilient and total deformations as the loading amplitude and frequency changes. The use of different reinforcing elements within the sloped fill not only increased the slope stability but also improved the deformation behaviour of a foundation placed on top of it. Based on experimental results, an empirical equation was developed to predict the vertical permanent deformations of a foundation on a sloped fill for a range of slope angle, repeated loading amplitude and frequency, as the number of loading cycles increased. In a particular repeated-load testing, as the loading cycles progressed, the residual soil stresses at any depth below the foundation increased whereas the resilient soil stresses remained constant. The rate at which the residual soil stress increased depend on both soil depth and loading amplitude, i. e., soil close to foundation and subjected to higher repeated loading amplitude exhibited higher increment rate. Monotonic-load testing subsequent to repeated-load testing showed that both the stiffness and bearing capacity of a foundation increased significantly due to repeated load application. The monotonic load-displacement plots inferred that those foundations subjected to higher repeated loading amplitudes (within the shakedown limit load) exhibited stiffer responses in both the vertical and slope directions. On the other hand, the stiffness of a foundation which experienced higher-frequency repeated loading was found to be less compared with that under low-frequency repeated loading. Also, the soil stress corresponding to a particular monotonic <b>foundation</b> <b>loading</b> intensity at a particular depth was found to be greater for those foundations which experienced higher deviatoric loading amplitudes during previous repeated-load testing...|$|E
