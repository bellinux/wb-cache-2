On 21 June, {{in an interview with}} Der Spiegel, Heynckes said, [...] "After everything that's happened over the past two years, I'm ready for some peace and quiet. After this string of successes, I could transfer to just about any club in Europe. I {{have a problem with the}} finality of saying 'never'.

2500|$|In May 2004, Barenboim {{was awarded}} the Wolf Prize at a {{ceremony}} at the Israeli Knesset. Education Minister Livnat held up the nomination until Barenboim apologized for his performance of Wagner in Israel. Barenboim called Livnat's demand [...] "politically motivated", adding [...] "I don't see what I need to apologize about. If I ever hurt a person privately or in public, I am sorry, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of hurting people...", which {{was good enough for}} Livnat. The ceremony was boycotted by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin, {{also a member of the}} Likud party. In his acceptance speech, Barenboim expressed his opinion on the political situation, referring to the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948: ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 19, 1960, Charles [...] "Charlie" [...] O. Finley (1918-1996), {{purchased}} a controlling {{interest in the}} team from Johnson's estate after losing out to Johnson six years earlier in Philadelphia. He bought out the minority owners a year later. Finley promised the fans a new day. In a highly publicized move, he {{purchased a}} bus, pointed it {{in the direction of}} New York, and burned it to symbolize the end of the [...] "special relationship" [...] with the Yankees. He called another press conference to burn the existing lease at Municipal Stadium which included the despised [...] "escape clause." [...] He spent over $400,000 of his own money in stadium improvements (though in 1962 the city reimbursed $300,000 of this). He introduced new uniforms which had [...] "Kansas City" [...] on the road uniforms {{for the first time ever}} and an interlocking [...] "KC" [...] on the cap. This was the first time the franchise had acknowledged its home city on its uniforms. He announced, [...] "My intentions are to keep the A's permanently in Kansas City and build a winning ball club. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of ever moving the franchise." [...] The fans, in turn, regarded Finley as the savior of Major League Baseball in Kansas City.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{met with}} Victor Huguet (7 August), a French liaison officer summoned to London at Kitchener’s request, {{and sent him}} back to France to obtain more {{information}} from Joffre, having told him of British plans to start movement of troops on 9 August. Kitchener, angry that Wilson had acted without consulting him, summoned him to his office for a rebuke. Wilson was angry that Kitchener was confusing the mobilisation plans by deploying troops from Aldershot to Grimsby in case of German invasion, and recorded in his diary that [...] "I answered back as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of being bullied by him especially when he talks such nonsense … {{the man is a}} fool … He is a d---- fool". On Huguet's return (12 August) he met with French, Murray and Wilson. They agreed to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, but Kitchener, in a three-hour meeting which was, according to Wilson, [...] "memorable in showing K’s colossal ignorance and conceit", tried to insist on a deployment to Amiens where the BEF would be in less danger of being overrun by the Germans coming north of the Meuse. Wilson wrote not just of the difficulties and delays which Kitchener was making but also of “the cowardice of it”, but {{there is little doubt that}} Kitchener was correct. The clash of personalities between Wilson and Kitchener worsened relations between Kitchener and Sir John French, who often took Wilson's advice.|$|E
2500|$|Romney has not {{put forward}} a clear {{statement}} {{as to whether he}} supports and would have signed, or would have opposed, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require that employers prove that differences in pay are based on qualifications, not gender, and extends the statute of limitations for filing claims of wage discrimination. The legislation was opposed by all but two Republicans in the House of Representatives and five in the Senate; {{and it was the first}} piece of legislation signed into law by President Obama. Asked in an [...] April 2012 interview if he would have signed the bill had it come before him as president, Romney said, [...] "It’s certainly a piece of legislation <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of changing. I wasn’t there three years ago.... I’m not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and — and have no intention of changing that law, don’t think there’s a reason to.” After the topic of equal pay for women was touched on during the second presidential campaign debate between Romney and Obama in October 2012, a top Romney campaign advisor told reporters that Romney was opposed to the passage of the bill at the time but had no plan to repeal it. The following day, the campaign adviser retracted his statement, saying that he was wrong when he said that Romney had been opposed to the act.|$|E
