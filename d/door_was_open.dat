As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Johnson-Clarendon treaty, {{presented}} to Congress by President Ulysses S. Grant, was overwhelmingly {{defeated by the}} Senate and the claims remained unresolved.

In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the Alabama Claims under Prime Minister William Gladstone. Fish, who was determined to improve relations with Britain, along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open</b> for renewed negotiations with Britain.|$|E

25|$|The band were contractually {{obliged to}} record a final album for the Chrysalis label, and with Carthy and Kirkpatrick not wanting to rejoin the re-formed band, the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open</b> for Knight and Johnson to return in 1980. The album Sails of Silver saw the band moving away from {{traditional}} material to a greater focus on self-penned songs, many with historical or pseudo-folk themes. Sails was not a commercial success, in part because Chrysalis chose not to promote the album aggressively, but also because many fans felt uncomfortable with the band's new direction in its choice of material. The failure of the album left Hart unhappy enough {{that he decided to}} leave the band and give up commercial music entirely, in favour of a reclusive life overseas.|$|E
25|$|In August 1982, Atlanta {{police officer}} Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle {{into the brush}} along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping {{on the couch in}} the living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them down the hall to Hardwick’s room.

[...] County officials sympathized with You, supposedly leaving his cell door unlocked at night and encouraging him to escape. [...] You eventually did escape, early in the morning of January 14: one news report claimed the improvised lock to his cell door had been picked {{with the aid of a}} confederate. [...] You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. [...] On January 15 he was sighted by two men; the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of $200 for You's capture. On January 17 You was finally apprehended by a three-man posse. [...] You offered no resistance, and when asked how he escaped, said only that the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open</b> and he walked out.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the second}} season, {{there was a}} change to the main cast. Gates McFadden, who portrayed Dr. Beverly Crusher, was fired from the show and {{replaced}} with Diana Muldaur, who played a new character called Dr. Katherine Pulaski. Rick Berman later said that [...] "There were those who believed {{at the end of}} the first season that they didn't like the way her character was developing, vis-a-vis Gates' performance, and managed to convince Mr. Roddenberry of that". He said that he did not agree with the decision. Roddenberry decided to write Crusher out rather than killing the character to allow for McFadden's return in the future. Keith DeCandido later suggested that it was Maurice Hurley who wanted McFadden out of the show, and after he left {{at the end of the}} season, the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open</b> for her to return. Pulaski was intended to be reminiscent of Dr. Leonard McCoy from The Original Series. Muldaur had appeared twice in The Original Series, first as Dr. Anne Mulhull in [...] "Return to Tomorrow" [...] and later as Dr. Miranda Jones in [...] "Is There in Truth No Beauty?". She had also appeared in a Roddenberry-led pilot, Planet Earth.|$|E

2500|$|In Montfort's view {{it takes}} effort to {{progress}} along {{the scale of}} achieving closer union with God through consecration to Mary and that different individuals reach different levels along this scale, depending on their efforts and purity of intentions. But he {{did not hesitate to}} point out that the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open</b> for everyone to achieve high levels of spiritual progress through Marian consecration. Montfort's classification of the multiple levels of spiritual progress is similar to the [...] "spiritual dwelling places" [...] described by Saint Teresa of Avila in the Interior Castle.

2500|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} the DMC-12 is its gull-wing doors. The common problem of {{supporting}} the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and a hydraulic pump in the Bricklin SV-1, although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DMC-12 features heavy doors supported by cryogenically preset torsion bars and gas-charged struts. These torsion bars were developed by Grumman Aerospace (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, PA) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors. A popular misconception of the DMC-12's gull-wing doors is that they require far more side clearance to open relative to ordinary side-hinge doors, such as when parked in a parking lot. In fact, the opposite is true: the DMC-12 requires far less clearance than side-hinge doors, and this can be physically demonstrated. This misconception of side clearance may stem from a misunderstood location of the hinge point of the doors by persons unfamiliar with DMC-12s. These doors, when opening, only require [...] clearance outside {{the line of the}} car, making opening and closing the doors in crowded spaces relatively easy. Much like the doors fitted to the Lamborghini Countach, the DMC-12 doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels. Additionally, the doors featured red and amber [...] "safety" [...] lights around the perimeter. These lights illuminated when the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open</b> and could be seen from the front, rear or side of the vehicle at night or low light situations.|$|E
2500|$|On December 13, about 30 {{soldiers}} {{came to a}} Chinese {{house at}} #5 Hsing Lu Koo in the southeastern part of Nanking, and demanded entrance. The <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>open</b> by the landlord, a Mohammedan named Ha. They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs. Ha, who knelt before them after Ha's death, begging them not to kill anyone else. Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged {{out from under a}} table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1 year old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia's parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2–3 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7–8, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively. The older was bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword.|$|E
