25|$|This swine {{production}} and pollution that accompanies factory hogging {{is concentrated in}} the parts of North Carolina that have the highest disease rates, the least access to medical care, and the greatest need for positive education and economic development. Since hog production has become consolidated in the coastal region of N.C., the high water tables and low-lying flood plains have increased the risk and impact of hog farm pollution. A swine CAFO {{is made up of}} three parts: the hog house, the “lagoon,” and the “spray field.” Waste <b>disposal</b> <b>techniques</b> used by small-scale traditional hog farms, like using waste as fertilizer for commercially viable crops, were adopted and expanded for use by CAFOs. Lagoons are supposed to be protected with an impermeable liner, but some do not work properly. This can cause environmental damage, as seen in 1995 when a lagoon burst in North Carolina. This lagoon released 25 million gallons of noxious sludge into North Carolina’s New River and killed approximately eight to ten million fish.|$|E

50|$|Burial is the {{placement}} of waste in man-made or natural excavations, such as pits or landfills. Burial {{is the most common}} onshore <b>disposal</b> <b>technique</b> used for disposing of drilling wastes (mud and cuttings). Generally, the solids are buried in the same pit (the reserve pit) used for collection and temporary storage of the waste mud and cuttings after the liquid is allowed to evaporate. Pit burial is a low-cost, low-tech method that does not require wastes to be transported away from the well site, and, therefore, is very attractive to many operators.|$|R

This paper treated the explosive wastewater of TNT by using a self-made discontinuity reactor, Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO) system. The experimental results show that SCWO is a high-efficiency, clean treatment and <b>disposal</b> <b>technique</b> for TNT explosive wastewater. Temperature and reaction time serve as the main influence factors in removing COD of wastewater, with which add, the COD removal rate obviously increases.

30|$|Biodegradable waste {{refers to}} the amount of organic matter in waste. Biodegradable waste is {{commonly}} found in municipal solid waste (MSW) where the organic matter in waste ranges from 75 to 85 % in urban MSWs of India. The varying content of organic matter in waste depends on the economic condition of the country from where it is generated (Bandara et al. 2007). Recent decades had seen rapid increase in human population, accelerating economy and urbanization, which have led to an exponential increase in waste generation every year (Gouveia and Prado 2009). According to Gupta and Arora (2016), {{it has been estimated that}} urban India generates approximately 1, 88, 500 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day (68.8 million tonnes per year). The most common and cheap waste <b>disposal</b> <b>technique</b> involves dumping of waste in a specified disposal yard. This results in the pollution of soil by toxic chemicals present in waste, leading to emergence of diseases in plants, human beings and cattle (Forastiere et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Geothermal {{reservoirs}} {{and groundwater}} resources in layered porous media in large sedimentary basins have enormous exploitation potential {{because of their}} extensive distribution, great quantity, and feasible temperatures and drilling depths. The discharge of geothermal wastewater (i. e. tail-water) on the surface is a serious environmental issue because of its high salinity content, so the Bureau of Geology Exploration and Mineral Resources Exploitation in Shandong Province, China called {{for the study of}} the <b>disposal</b> <b>technique</b> of the geothermal tail-water. The disposal test process is as follows: take the waste of geothermal water to make physics-chemistry preparative disposal; filtration with manganese-sand set and/or double-medium equipment; filtration with ion exchange resins; nanofiltration membrane separation; and reverse osmosis separation. After separation, the cheap, clean water can be used as a material for chemical plants. However, in the case of deeply embedded geothermal groundwater resources, connate water(buried water), or bad recharge conditions, must be dried up for a long time exploitation, causing ground depression. Therefore, it is concluded that systems utilizing reinjection, i. e. closed-circuit cycle mode injection, in sandstone reservoirs are ideal for the realization of sustainable exploitation of the geothermal groundwater resources with favorable environmental conditions on the surface...|$|R
40|$|To {{decrease}} {{the potential for}} fine coal waste slurry impoundment failures, the Bureau of Mines investigated a new <b>disposal</b> <b>technique.</b> The fine coal waste slurry is rapidly thickened (i. e., dewatered) and deposited on a slightly sloping surface. To accomplish rapid dewatering, a chemical flocculation system using polymers was developed to treat the fine coal waste slurry stream.

During the last 5 days of the field test, slurry flowing at rates from 498 to 675 gal/min with a specific gravity range of 1. 15 to 1. 33 was successfully treated and dewatered. During this period, untreated slurry had an average moisture content of 227. 4 pct (30. 7 wt pct solids). The effectiveness of the dewatering system was determined by monitoring the moisture content of the deposited waste with respect to time.

This contribution provides a systematic theoretical kinetic study of the initial interplay of hematite nanopatiicles with chlorine-bearing compounds (namely as hydrogen chloride, chloroethene, 1 - chloro- 1 -propene, chloroethane, 2 -chloropropane, chlorobenzene and 2 -chlorophenol) that are released from the degradation of PVC. A detailed kinetic analysis points out that, subsequent addition of HCl to Fe(Cl) -O(H) structures leads to convert Fe 20 3 into oxychlorines and iron chlorides. Then, elimination of HzO molecule proceeds via an intramolecular hydrogen transfer. The analyses of the transition structures indicate that, there are two possible pathways to operate in the reaction of chlorinated alkanes and alkenes with a-Fe 20 3 clusters, i. e., direct elimination and dissociative addition.

The influence of sludge application on dry matter accumulation of Brassica napus was described with logistic functions. Both types of sludge improved dry matter accumulation significantly. Sludge coagulation with Fe did not affect plant growth in both soils, but in the acid soil its application enhanced the accumulation of Zn, Cd, Mn and Ni in plants. On the opposite, in the neutral soil this effect was not observed with the exception of Cd, which was higher in plants treated with Fe coagulated sludge on the 20 - 30 days of growth; this difference disappeared thereafter.
