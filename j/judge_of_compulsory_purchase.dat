40|$|The paper {{discusses}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> as {{an administrative}} procedure. In many countries {{the procedure is}} handled in courts {{and it is very}} complicated and time consuming. The present system in Finland based on legislation from 1977 is an administrative procedure lead by cadastral surveyors. There are already a lot of experiences in Finland, so we are able to present the system and analyse its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, there are similar types of procedures for almost the same purposes, which make the analysis even broader. The main objective of the paper is to examine the possibility to make the procedure <b>of</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> more efficient. It is based on studies done in the Institute of Real Estate Studies and the Institute of Law, Department of Surveying at the Helsinki University of Technology during the past few years. It is hoped that the paper may contribute to the development <b>of</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> procedures in the future also in other countries...|$|R

After 1990 the newly elected democratic governments changed the constitutions to permit and protect private ownership <b>of</b> land. However, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> is essential in a market economy to deal with certain aspects of market failure.

40|$|The guiding {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> interests in land in England and Wales {{is that of}} fairness, best stated {{in the words of}} Lord Justice Scott in Horn v Sunderland Corporation when he said that the owner has “the right to be put, so far as money can do it, in the same position as if his land had not been taken from him”. In many instances, land acquired by compulsion subsequently becomes surplus to the requirements of the acquiring authority. This may be because the intended development scheme was scrapped, or substantially modified, or that after the passage of time the use of the land for which the purchase took place is no longer required. More controversially it may be that for ‘operational reasons’ the acquiring authority knowingly purchased more land than was required for the scheme. Under these circumstances, the Crichel Down Rules (‘the Rules’) require government departments and other statutory bodies to offer back to the former owners or their successors, any land previously so acquired by, or under the threat <b>of,</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase...</b>|$|R

50|$|Although land may be {{acquired}} by consent, and conduct which raises another party's reasonable expectations, these private methods of acquiring land are often insufficient for adequate public regulation. Building national infrastructure, such as railways, housing, and sewerage, {{as well as}} democratically determined planning rules, either by national or local government, typically requires <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase,</b> because private owners might not give up land required for public works except at an extortionate price. Historically, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> were carried out under the Inclosure Acts and their predecessors, where enclosure was frequently a method of expropriating people from common land {{for the benefit of}} barons and landlords. In the industrial revolution, most railways were built by private companies procuring <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> rights from private Acts of Parliament, though by the late 19th century, powers <b>of</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> slowly became more transparent and used for general social welfare, as with the Public Health Act 1875, or the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> legislation was significantly extended during World War One for military use, and after the war for housing, as certain principles became standardised.|$|R

40|$|Policy {{instruments}} are {{the building blocks}} of land use policies. Instrumentation of policies relates to values. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> is a direct government instrument that may be an effective way to implement policies of biodiversity conservation and the allocation of land for recreational use. It is, however, in many contexts, politically controversial. The Netherlands' Government has endorsed policies that involve <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> in up to 10 % of land purchases. This paper reviews if this 10 %-ceiling can structure relationships between landowners and government agencies {{in such a way that}} it relieves constraints imposed by land availability for biodiversity conservation and the provision of recreational areas. The analysis consists of (1) the background of this 10 %-ceiling, (2) the actual procedures <b>of</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase,</b> by analysis <b>of</b> Royal Decrees, (3) the actual <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases,</b> and (4) the indirect instrumental effects of the use of this instrument. The paper concludes that the 10 %-ceiling does not lift the constraints of land availability, but does influence the relationship between stakeholders, the implementation of biodiversity objectives, and land policy strategies. Nevertheless, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> may provide possibilities to acquire land necessary for a consolidated natural area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

In doing so, we show how a fictionalised mantra of "necessity" combines neoliberal growth logics with their obscene underside-a stigmatisation logic that demonises poor urban neighbourhoods. CPOs can be used progressively, for example to abrogate the power of slum landlords for social democratic ends, yet with the increasing urbanisation of capital they more often target marginalised neighbourhoods in the pursuit of land and property valorisation. The growing use of CPOs as an exceptional measure in urbanisation, we argue, requires urgent attention in urban political struggles and policy practice...|$|R
