The welfare ranking of <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> depends on the way the government uses the budgetary surplus. It is shown that <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> can also be used to stabilize the public pay-as-you-go pension system. Given an external financial shock that hits the pension system re-adjusting the system with <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> is welfare superior to reforms of the pension system itself. Finally, it can be shown that the effect on fertility remains when introducing altruism in the model while the effects on welfare and budget depend more strongly on the model parameterization...|$|R
40|$|Objective: In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the context of}} the social structure of a population. Methods: We use an agent-based model to analyse the impact of policies on individual fertility decisions and on fertility at the aggregate level. The crucial features of our model are the interactions between <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> and social structure, the agents' heterogeneity, and the structure and influence of the social network. This modelling framework allows us to disentangle the direct effect (the alleviation of resource constraints) from the indirect effect (the diffusion of fertility intentions via social ties) of <b>family</b> <b>policies.</b> Results: Our results indicate that <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> have a positive and significant impact on fertility. In addition, the specific characteristics of the social network and social effects do not only relate to fertility, but also influence the effectiveness of <b>family</b> <b>policies.</b> Conclusions: <b>Family</b> <b>policies</b> can only be successful if they are designed to take into account the characteristics of the society in which they are implemented. ...|$|R

25|$|As prime minister, David Cameron {{wanted to}} put <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> {{at the heart of}} the Conservative Party {{claiming}} British politics in the past had got it wrong. He stated families should be the most important thing in the country's life, believing social responsibility and a strong family was key to an individuals success, and by extent becoming less reliant on the state. Both Cameron and Theresa May have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by mother and father as they choose. Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, and fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, worth £2,500 a year per child. Tax schemes to support families, freezing fuel duty, cutting income tax. David Cameron in a speech mentioned businesses will have to help cut the costs imposed on society and families through the decisions businesses make, by becoming more socially responsible which would in turn reduce the need for state control to solve the problem.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{effectivity}} of <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> in the context of different assumptions regarding the social structure of a society. We use an agent based simulation model to analyse the impact of <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> on individual fertility decisions and on cohort fertility, intended fertility, and the fertility gap on the aggregate level. The crucial features of our simulation model are the agents' heterogeneity with respect to age, income, parity, and intended fertility, the social network and social influence. Our results indicate that both fixed and income dependent child supports have a positive and significant impact on fertility. However, several network and social influence parameters have the ability not only to influence fertility itself but also the effectivity of <b>family</b> <b>policies.</b> Therefore, policymakers aiming to transfer a certain policy mix that has proved successful from one country to another one ignoring differences in the social structure may fail. <b>Family</b> <b>policies</b> can only be successful if they explicitly take into account the characteristics of the society they are assigned for. <b>Family</b> <b>policies,</b> low fertility, social influence, social networks, social structure. ...|$|R

25|$|Since the 1950s medical care, {{public hygiene}} and {{sanitation}} improved considerably, and epidemics were controlled. Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The population growth rate surged as {{the mortality rate}} dropped more rapidly than the birth rate. China's massive population {{has always been a}} major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major birth control program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958–60 was partially responsible for a huge famine that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second population control drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of contraceptives. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second family planning program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the one child per <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%. China's population growth rate is now among the lowest for a developing country, although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China {{is now one of the}} most rapidly ageing countries in the world.|$|E

As regards methods we argue that the policy effects can only be assessed properly if we study the impact of policies on individual behavior, event-history models applied to individual-level data being the state-of-theart of such an approach.
