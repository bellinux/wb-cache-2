40|$|By {{introducing}} an imperfectly competitive banking sector into {{a standard}} two-country, two-good RBC model with complete asset markets, we study the international transmission of aggregate TFP shocks {{in an environment}} with noncompetitive financial intermediation. In this model, price-cost margins in a <b>global</b> <b>loan</b> market are endogenous and countercyclical. As a result, a positive TFP shock in one country spills over to another through {{a reduction in the}} global cost of both credit and externally financed investment. The quantitative analysis shows that countercyclical margins on loans {{play a key role in}} bringing the predictions of the theory closer to the observed cross-country cyclical co-movements of consumption, employment, investment and output. Recessions are deeper when the cost of credit rises during these economic downturns. Thus, a financial accelerator arises in our framework, unveiling the increased importance of stabilization policies in economies where margins in credit markets are countercyclical.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether unobservable {{differences in}} firm volatility {{are responsible for}} the <b>global</b> <b>loan</b> pricing puzzle, which is the observation that corporate loan interest rates appear to be lower in Europe than in the United States. We analyze whether equity volatility, an error prone measure of firm volatility, can explain this difference in loan spreads. We show that using equity volatility in OLS regressions will result in biased and inconsistent estimates of the difference in U. S. and European loan spreads. We use instrumental variable methods to identify consistent estimates and find no difference in U. S. and European loan spreads. (JEL G 10, G 20, G 30) A large body of literature analyzes the determinants of syndicated loan pricing. However, recent research by Carey and Nini (2007) suggests that there are still important gaps in economists ’ understanding of this market. They provide evidence that corporate loan interest rate spreads in the European syndicated loan market are 30 basis points lower than in the United States market and that U. S. borrowers rarely borrow in the apparently lower cost European loan market. This is puzzling because Becker and Ivashina (2011) show that th...|$|E

40|$|Amidst {{the global}} {{financial}} uncertainties since 2007, the East and Southeast Asian economies continued to attract a significant bulk of the <b>global</b> banks’ <b>loans</b> to emerging markets, albeit at a decelerating rate. The alleged advantages of these lending are wellknown. Yet the recent interruption to this spectacular rise in international bank lending during the 2007 / 2008 global financial crisis serves as a stark reminder that international bank lending can rapidly transmit adverse shocks from developed markets to emerging markets. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify key features and characteristics of foreign banks’ activities in East and Southeast Asian economies, particularly during the post 2007 global financial crisis period, and to weigh their implications on the local economies, including policy challenges for the central banks and banking supervisors in the region. ...|$|R

Universal banks can have control over borrowing firms by representation on the board of directors or by holding shares through direct stakes or institutional holdings. We investigate the effects of these bank-firm governance links on the <b>global</b> syndicated <b>loan</b> market. We find that banks are more likely to act as lead arrangers, charge higher interest rate spreads and face less credit risk after origination when they have some role in firm 2 ̆ 019 s governance. This increase in interest rate spread is less pronounced for borrowers with access to international capital markets.

40|$|Conference Theme: Emerging Technologies: New Direction for LibrariesPaper Session 2 : New Trends in Reference ServicesSeveral {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that usage, and in particular undergraduate student usage, of academic libraries is in serious and rapid <b>global</b> decline. <b>Loans</b> are decreasing. Use of journals and books (print and electronic) are on the decline. Use of the library for study, homework or leisure reading is also down. Perhaps the largest and most dramatic decline lies in the area of seeking assistance from librarians – what we commonly refer to as reference. Embedded in this decline are a number of factors including alternative forms of information access as well as the (mis) perception of what a librarian does and is capable of doing. This paper will look at these trends and will ask whether such trends are also visible in an Asian context, in particular multicultural and multilingual Hong Kong. The paper will conclude with the outline of a planned investigation {{to get to the bottom}} of Hong Kong undergraduate information skills...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{economic}} context, with a major increase in the foreign business of the Romanian companies, {{there is a need}} to finance their activities from various sources in order to meet competition. For this reason I aimed, with this paper, to identify the way to finance current business of foreign trade companies. Considering that for the majority of foreign trade transactions settlement is performed after a maturity established by agreement between the partners, in this interval various payment obligations may occur, reason for which companies resort to short-term funding sources, usually of the revolving type.

The global company, or multinational enterprise, worked within a global dimension well before 2008, yet a truly international regulatory regime for this phenomenon was not seriously considered until about 2011 (with just one exception). The contract and the company, or market transactions and the firm, would both seem to have gained or considerably increased their global dimension over the last five years or so, thus raising the question of a global perspective for European private law. Upon considering the global importance of EU private law, however, we can witness the degree of global openness to be found in contract law (and the law of transactions) and, conversely, the restriction to internal market cases which can be found in company (organization) law...|$|R

40|$|During the 1990 s, {{the concept}} of "catalytic {{official}} finance" (COF) gained prominence in policy debates. The concept revolves around {{the idea that the}} propensity of investors to lend to a country increases when the IMF provides its "seal of approval"-backed up by only limited official financing-on the country''s economic program. COF aims at avoiding, on the one hand, the massive use of public money to bail out private investors; on the other, the recourse to coercive bailing-in mechanisms. The paper concludes that COF, while possibly useful in other contexts, is less reliable when used to manage capital account crises.
