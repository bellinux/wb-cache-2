The present evidence mapping summarizes recent {{evidence for the}} efficacy of occupational therapy with older persons based on randomised controlled trials from 2004 - 2012. METHOD: An electronic search in Cochrane and Medline databases identified publications of randomised controlled trials on occupational therapy interventions for persons≥ 65 years old. Two raters independently extracted data and analysed the quality of samples, interventions and outcome <b>evalutations</b> according to PRISMA criteria. RESULTS: In all, 136 abstracts were identified and 48 studies analysed, from these 12 on stroke, 15 on falls and mobility, 7 on dementia, 4 on prevention and 10 on other conditions. Reports of adverse events and evaluations of costs and long-term outcomes are frequently lacking. CONCLUSION: The most promising fields for further research are primary and secondary prevention in persons with stroke, falls or mobility problems and tertiary prevention in persons with dementia. Future trials should be conducted and reported according to consented reporting guidelines of the equator network...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{improvements in}} the last two decades, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains a frequent and very bothersome medical problem. It is estimated that about one half to two thirds of all chemotherapy-treated patients experience CINV, the frequency depending on the chemotherapy regimen used and on patient-specific features. The impact of CINV, which may be acute, delayed or even anticipatory in experienced patients, on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is substantial in all domains.  Until recently, effective treatment choices included corticosteroids and first-generation 5 -HT 3 antagonists, which have been supported by aprepitant, the first clinically available NK 1 antagonist, and by palonosetron, considered the first second-generation 5 -HT 3 antagonist for its high receptor-subtype selectivity and affinity and long plasmatic half-life. In this paper, clinical pharmacology of the latter drug is briefly outlined and recent Italian papers on the epidemiology and HRQoL impact of CINV are reviewed, as well as national pharmacoeconomic <b>evalutations</b> conducted on palonosetron. The role in therapy of palonosteron and its potential for improved clinical, HRQoL and economic outcomes is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{difficulty of}} couples in achieving pregnancy related to male infertility has been reported. Several {{factors have been}} implicated as possible causes of this decrease, including the exposure to endocrine disruptors and the environmental toxicants, the changes in lifestyle and the exposure to heat. Aim pf study was to evaluate the role of working posture when associated to nitrogen oxides exposure. Three hundred and eseve male workers, employed in a motorway company, were enrolled into the study, uderwent a complete physical examination and laboratory <b>evalutations,</b> endocrine screening and sperm analysis. Taking into account the exposure to fuel combustion gases and the working posture, sitting or free, the study population was divided in 4 groups. In the subjects occupationally exposed to NO 2, a significant lower sperm total motility was observed than in in not exposed workers. In the workers with obliged sitting working posture, lower sperm motility was also observed than in the workers with free working posture. Differences in sperm quality were strong when chemical and postural riskk factors were associated. The findings of study confirmed detrimental effects of nitrogen dioxide as a marker of traffic pollutants, showing alterations of sperm quality even if the environmental concentration of gas is very low according to the limits established by Italian low.

40|$|This work {{looks at}} {{theories}} about cultural rituals and discusses the broad {{use of the}} idea that cultural forms may perform what is known as cognitive capture. Cognitive capture is the phenomenon where any cultural content can activate adaptive mental functions by containing content similar enough to the content that usually is the target of these functions. It is argued that in addition external mechanisms, such as writing, unintentional cognitive capture mechanisms can help preserve elements of tradition. First two distinct theoretical traditions are discussed. The Modes of Religiosity and the Hazard Precaution theories. These two theoretical traditions are seen as both referring to cognitive capture. The Modes theory {{in the sense that it}} argues that shocking and content containing startling images are preserved as these activate evolved mechanisms for putting special attention on such things. The HPS tradition is seen as arguing that content containing content referring to avoiding hazards similarly capture evolved cognitive mechanisms. It is then conjectured that other similar mechanisms may exist, one of the most apparent being cultural content with references to themes and motif relevant to coalitional psychology. Two previously published descriptions of initiation in Candomblé are then discussed in the light of these ideas. It is argued that the introduction of “guilds” and academic research by Europeans has worked towards creating doctrinal ways of practicing religion in Candomblé, although it mostly is non-doctrinal. It is further argued that quite evidently hazard precaution is dealt with on may levels within the initiations. But it is also suggested that much of the content of the possesions are viewed by participants in the light of <b>evalutations</b> that can be made about actions that people make...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Patients {{with the}} {{inflammatory}} bowel diseases ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease need lifelong treatment and care. Effect of traditional treatments is varied and may cause serious adverse events. Biological drugs aimed at blocking specific molecular {{steps in the}} inflammatory process have been developed. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α is a proinflammatory cytokine with {{a role in the}} inflammatory process associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Hence, a drug blocking this cytokine might be useful for patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. This report includes knowledge of the TNFα-inhibitors infliximab (Remicade®), adalimumab (Humira®), etanercept (Enbrel®) and certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®). METHOD We systematically reviewed and critically appraised available documentation on effect and safety of TNFα-inhibitors. In addition, we have reviewed health economic studies. We identified documentation by a systematic search in Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, PubMed and NHS Economics Evaluation Database. Our evaluation on efficacy and safety was based on systematic reviews. However, {{to make sure that all}} available data was included, we searched for randomized controlled trials published afer the literature seach in the systematic reviews was performed. RESULTS In patients with ulcerative colitis, infliximab was more effective than placebo in achieving improvement of the disease. Data on response and remission are available up to 54 weeks. Infliximab gives a higer proportion of patients with endoscopic remission compared to placebo. None of the other TNFα-inhibitors were tested in patients with ulcerative colitis. In patients with Crohn’s disease, infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab were more effective than placebo in achieving response after induction treatment (1 - 3 administrations of drug or placebo). Based on patients responding to induction treatment, it has been shown that maintenance treatment with infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab is more effective than placebo in maintaining the initial response. Infliximab have been showed to be more effective than placebo in achieving fistula closure. Data on etanercerpt in treatment of Crohn’s disease is limited. There is no basis to claim that etanercerpt has effect in treatment of Crohn’s disease. We identified four economic <b>evalutations</b> in a systematic literature search. All studies were from contries outside Norway and delt with infliximabtreatment of patients with Crohn’s disease. CONCLUSION Infliximab is effective in treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Adalimumab and certolizumab have documented effect in treatment of Crohn’s disease, while studies on patients with ulcerative colitis are lacking. There is too limited data available to conclude regarding safety of long-term treatment with TNFα-inhibitors for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Based on results from countries outside Norway, infliximab does not seem to be cost-effective as continuous treatment for patients with Crohn’s disease. There might be an exception in the case of patients exhibiting good and long-lasting response. No relevant economic studies were found for ulcerative colitis or for the other TNFα- inhibitors...|$|R
