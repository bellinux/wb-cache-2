5|$|In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General Medical Council (GMC) {{for having}} {{released}} medical details about Roger Sylvester, {{a man who}} had died in police custody. In 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, had {{died of a heart attack}} with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury to her head and a bite mark on <b>her</b> <b>thigh.</b> Anthony Hardy, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags. The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on <b>her</b> <b>thigh.</b> Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E

As she began to fall from the first bullet, the second bullet struck her femur, shattering it and knocking her to the ground. Hasan walked up to Munley and kicked her pistol out of reach.|$|E

The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since {{he was the one who}} had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses to {{instruct}} the Israelites about the test where a husband, {{in a fit}} of jealousy, accused his wife of being unfaithful — the ritual of the sotah. The man was to bring his wife to the priest, along with barley flour as a meal offering of jealousy. The priest was to dissolve some earth from the floor of the Tabernacle into some sacral water in an earthen vessel. The priest was to bare the woman's head, place the meal offering on her hands, and adjure the woman: if innocent, to be immune to harm from the water of bitterness, but if guilty, to be cursed to have <b>her</b> <b>thigh</b> sag and belly distend. And the woman was to say, [...] "Amen, amen!" [...] The priest was to write these curses down, rub the writing off into the water of bitterness, and make the woman drink the water. The priest was to elevate the meal offering, present it on the altar, and burn a token part of it on the altar. If she had broken faith with her husband, the water would cause her belly to distend and <b>her</b> <b>thigh</b> to sag, and the woman was to become a curse among her people, but if the woman was innocent, she would remain unharmed and be able to bear children.|$|E
