5|$|Some {{species of}} anurans {{hybridize}} readily. For instance, the <b>edible</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.|$|E
5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European <b>edible</b> <b>frog</b> is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E
5|$|Frog {{legs are}} eaten by humans {{in many parts}} of the world. French cuisses de grenouille or frog legs dish is a {{traditional}} dish particularly served in the region of the Dombes (département of Ain). The dish is also common in French-speaking parts of Louisiana, particularly the Cajun areas of Southern Louisiana as well as New Orleans, United States. In Asia, frog legs are consumed in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. Chinese <b>edible</b> <b>frog</b> and pig frogs are farmed and consumed on a large scale in some areas of China. Frog legs are part of Chinese Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine. In Indonesia, frog-leg soup is known as swikee or swike. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg.|$|E
50|$|For example, in {{the most}} {{widespread}} so called L-E system, <b>edible</b> <b>frogs</b> Pelophylax kl. esculentus (RE) produce gametes of the marsh frog P. ridibundus (R) and mate with coexisting pool frogs Pelophylax lessonae (L gametes) - see below in the middle.|$|R
50|$|Hybrids P. kl. esculentus (genotype RL) exclude {{here the}} P. lessonae genome (L) and make {{exclusively}} clonal P. ridibundus gametes (R). In other words, <b>edible</b> <b>frogs</b> produce gametes of marsh frogs! Their lineages are maintained usually through backcrosses {{of a female}} P. kl. esculentus (RL) with a male P. lessonae (LL). The offspring consist of only P. kl. esculentus.|$|R

25|$|The {{marsh frog}} (Pelophylax ridibundus, a {{non-native}} species introduced from Europe in the 1930s) is now {{commonly found in}} the upper Mole and its tributaries around Newdigate and Gatwick. There {{is no evidence that}} the presence of the frogs has had a deleterious effect on indigenous amphibians. A second non-native species, the <b>edible</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) was introduced to a site at Newdigate in the early 1900s. It has in 2008 been recorded in tributaries of the River Mole at Capel and Brockham.|$|E
25|$|Most {{amphibians}} of the Loire {{are found}} in the slow flow areas near the delta, especially in the floodplain, marshes and oxbows. They are dominated by the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), frogs and toads. The toads include Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Bombina variegata, Bufo calamita, Pelobates fuscus and Pelobates cultripes. The frogs are represented by the Parsley frog (Pelodites punctatus), European tree frog (Hyla arborea), Common Frog (Rana temporaria), Agile Frog (R. dalmatina), <b>Edible</b> <b>Frog</b> (R. esculenta), Perez's Frog (R. perezi), marsh frog (R. ridubunda) and Pool Frog (R. lessonae). Newts of the Loire include the Marbled Newt (Triturus marmoratus), Smooth Newt (T. vulgaris), Alpine Newt (T. alpestris) and Palmate Newt (T. helveticus).|$|E
500|$|After {{the common}} frog (Rana temporaria), the <b>edible</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax esculentus) and the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), the common toad {{is the fourth}} most common {{amphibian}} in Europe. [...] It is found throughout the continent {{with the exception of}} Iceland, the cold northern parts of Scandinavia, Ireland and a number of Mediterranean islands. These include Malta, Crete, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. Its easterly range extends to Irkutsk in Siberia and its southerly range includes parts of northwestern Africa in the northern mountain ranges of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A closely related variant lives in eastern Asia including Japan. The common toad is found at altitudes of up to [...] {{in the southern part of}} its range. It is largely found in forested areas with coniferous, deciduous and mixed woodland, especially in wet locations. It also inhabits open countryside, fields, copses, parks and gardens, and often occurs in dry areas well away from standing water.|$|E
50|$|Frog {{legs are}} one of the better-known delicacies of French and Chinese cuisine. The legs of <b>edible</b> <b>frogs</b> are also {{consumed}} {{in other parts of the}} world, including Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, northern Italy, the Alentejo region of Portugal, Spain, Albania, Slovenia, the northwest Greece, the Kerala state of India and the Southern regions of the United States. As of 2014, the world's largest exporter of frogs is Indonesia, also a large consumer. In such regions as Brazil, Mexico and the Caribbean, many frogs are still caught wild.|$|R
5000|$|By spinal {{administration}} {{of a range}} of opioid agonists, it has been demonstrated that frogs have mu (μ)-, delta (δ) and kappa (κ)-opioid binding sites. The kappa sub-types κ1 and κ2 are present in the brains of <b>edible</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana esculenta). In evolutionary terms, this means the opioid receptor sub-types are already present in amphibians, although the differences between these are less pronounced than in mammals. [...] Sequence comparisons show that the amphibian opioid receptors are highly conserved (70-84% similar to mammals) and are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) areas apparently involved in pain experience.|$|R
50|$|Later Adder finds Toad {{and asks}} him about some large paw prints {{he has found}} near the now deserted <b>Edible</b> <b>Frog's</b> pond. Adder {{explains}} that as {{he does not have}} paws he cannot judge whether they are from a toad or not. Toad tells him these prints are too big for a toad. A meeting is called and Toad informs the animals of the footprints seen by himself and Adder. Badger states that the graceful nature of this animal reminds him of the Warden's cat and suggests that the animal might be a sort of cat. Tawny Owl pooh-poohs this suggestion. Not long afterwards meeting the Beast kills one of the white deer herd and Friendly discovers the carcass, then talks to some of his younger relatives about his plan to track the creature down.|$|R

60|$|Another proof may {{be found}} in the {{presence}} of the <b>edible</b> <b>frog</b> of the Continent at Foulmire, on the edge of the Cambridge Fans. It is a moot point still with some, whether he was not put there by man. It is a still stronger argument against his being indigenous, that he is never mentioned as an article of food by the mediaeval monks, who would have known--Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, as many of them were- -that he is as dainty as ever was a spring chicken. But if he be indigenous, his presence proves that once he could either hop across the Straits of Dover, or swim across the German Ocean.|$|E
60|$|These animals, however, {{offer one}} {{interesting}} sexual difference, namely {{in the musical}} powers possessed by the males; but to speak of music, when applied to the discordant and overwhelming sounds emitted by male bull-frogs and some other species, seems, according to our taste, a singularly inappropriate expression. Nevertheless certain frogs sing in a decidedly pleasing manner. Near Rio de Janeiro I used often {{to sit in the}} evening to listen to a number of little Hylæ, which, perched on blades of grass close to the water, sent forth sweet chirping notes in harmony. The various sounds are emitted chiefly by the males during the breeding-season, {{as in the case of}} the croaking of our common frog.[42] In accordance with this fact the vocal organs of the males are more highly developed than those of the females. In some genera the males alone are provided with sacs which open into the larynx.[43] For instance, in the <b>edible</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana esculenta) “the sacs are peculiar to the males, and become, when filled with air in the act of croaking, large globular bladders, standing out one on each side of the head, near the corners of the mouth.” The croak of the male is thus rendered exceedingly powerful; whilst that of the female is only a slight groaning noise.[44] The vocal organs differ considerably in structure in the several genera of the family; and their development in all cases may be attributed to sexual selection.|$|E
40|$|The {{fisheries}} of Lakes Mutanda and Mulehe during 1998 / 9 {{were mainly}} at subsistence scale and only few fishers operated at irregular intervals. The commercial catch records between 1963 to 1999 showed that Lake Mulehe was landing more fish than Lake Mutanda {{despite the fact}} that Lake Mutanda (26. 4 km 2) was bigger than Lake Mulehe (4. 11 cm 2). The constant decline of catches was due to irregular restocking and applying low stocking densities of fry. However, restocking should consider using species that withstand low temperature (15 - 240 C) in the district. These include Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia), Macropterus salmoides (Black bass), and Cyprinus carpio (Common carp). Most of these species have either disappeared or declined to very low levels. Due to lack of commercial fish species for harvest, the fishers by 1998 / 9 resorted to harvesting the haplochromines, Clarias carsoni and <b>edible</b> <b>frogs</b> (Xenopus kigesiensis) as alternative resources. Experimental studies have shown the need and techniques to enhance fish production on these two lakes...|$|R
40|$|Orientation {{is a key}} {{component}} to successful movements between habitats. We hypothesized that barren agricultural landscapes hinder the ability of frogs to orient and move between habitats. Specifically, we predicted that when presented with a choice between a short route through a hostile environment and a longer but safer route, individuals would select the one that entails the least risk. During a field experiment, we translocated 104 <b>Edible</b> <b>Frogs</b> (Rana klepton esculenta) into a recently harrowed field according to two treatments: the distance to their pond of origin (5 - 70 m) and the distance to a wooded hedgerow (10 - 60 m). The frogs' ability to orient toward the pond decreased with pond distance and increased with distance to the hedgerow, {{but we did not}} detect interactive effects. In addition, frogs were more successful in orienting toward the pond under high wind conditions. We have shown that both the configuration of the landscape and weather variables influence the movement behavior of amphibians in agricultural settings, and these may have important implications for population persistence...|$|R
40|$|Several <b>edible</b> <b>frogs</b> (Pelophylaxkl. esculentus) {{collected}} into {{a single}} group from various ponds in Europe died suddenly with reddening of the skin (legs, abdomen) and haemorrhages in the gastrointestinal tract. Ranavirus was detected {{in some of the}} dead frogs using PCR, and virus was also isolated in cell culture. Over the following 3 years, another two outbreaks occurred with low to high mortality in between asymptomatic periods. In the first 2 years, the same ranavirus was detected repeatedly, but a new ranavirus was isolated in association with the second mass-mortality event. The two different ranaviruses were characterized based on nucleotide sequences from four genomic regions, namely, major capsid protein, DNA polymerase, ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase alpha and beta subunit genes. The sequences showed slight variations to each other or GenBank entries and both clustered to the Rana esculenta virus (REV-like) clade in the phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, a quiescent infection was demonstrated in two individuals. By comparing samples taken before and after transport and caging in groups it was possible to identify the pond of origin and a ranavirus was detected {{for the first time in}} wild amphibians in Germany...|$|R

In temperate species, lines of arrested growth (LAGs) in bones arc usually distinct and arc formed during winter (Halliday and Verrel 1988; Reaser 2000; Ryser 19 S 5). Few {{attempts have been made}} to estimate age using tlus method in tropical frogs (Guarino et al. 1998; Khonsue et al. 2000; Kumbar and Pancharatna 2001; Pancharatna et aI. lOOU) and it has not prcviously been applied to Indonesian frogs. As part of a population study of three species of <b>edible</b> <b>frogs</b> in Indonesia, we examined phalanges taken from toe clips of Fejervarya limnocharis, F. cancrivora, and Limnonectes macrodon to determine whether it is possible to estimate the ages of individuals of these tropical species using skeletochronology. For every frog captured, we recorded sex, body size as measured by SVL (snout-vent length) and mass, and clip code. Since each frog was numbered uniquely. phalanges used for skeletochronological analysis were taken from different toes. Fejervatya limnocharis and F. cancrivora were encountered in rice fields, and L. macrodon was found primarily at streams...|$|R

5000|$|In a year, {{the town}} proper were many times under water that {{includes}} some rice fields mostly destroyed. Some streets were inundated by stagnant water with makeshift pedestrian pathways adorned the streets, constructed made of bamboo {{to ease the}} movements of the town's folks on unpassable streets. Somehow the floods dried up during dry season and made the flooded streets passable again. The floods made the life of Licabenos very hard as palay dismal harvest made the farmers poorer. The local economy barely grew since its foundation and some families emigrated to the cities to seek better life. Prominent landmark such as [...] "Karaanan" [...] a low level lake between Villarosa and San Cristobal usually supplied plentiful organic delicacies to townsfolks such as Dalag, Hito, Gurami and <b>edible</b> <b>Frogs</b> during floods that usually graced our table. After so many years of floodings, silts and soils carried by the floods were deposited {{on the surface of the}} lake. The former lake vanished and dried up with its soil level rose, that now become precious additional rice fields. Many changes and developments of the town were attributed to the past administrations who contributed road repairs, rehabilitation and constructions to include flood protection with drainage/ canal systems. The present town's executive Mayor Wilfredo Sawit Domingo contributed additional construction and rehabilitated more roads and finally the makeshift bamboo pedestrian lanes on flooded streets are the things of the past. In the outer Barangays farm-to-market roads were constructed in coordination with barangay officers that made farm produce available in the local Market. Accordingly, local merchants made a way to sell their produce to other towns.|$|R
