40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the phenomenon of}} <b>tax</b> <b>evasion</b> in the 1980 s in Canada as an outgrowth of {{a crisis in the}} welfare state. The lack of social protest over the high incidence of <b>tax</b> <b>evasion</b> among the wealthiest stratum of Canadian individuals and corporations is, on this view, linked to the transformation of politicized citizens <b>into</b> depoliticized clients. <b>Tax</b> <b>evasion,</b> along with legal tax avoidance both proliferated in the 1980 s which reflects the convergence of a number of events including the increase in use of tax expenditures, the decreasing emphasis on enforcement in tax administration, the rise of neoconservatism and, more generally, the internalization within the income tax system of the contradictions of welfare state capitalism. This paper suggests that the premise of the income tax {{within the framework of the}} welfare state is needed and also advocates practical measures for addressing both the high incidence and the social acceptability of <b>tax</b> <b>evasion</b> in Canada...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I show that, in economies {{characterized}} by <b>tax</b> <b>evasion</b> and endogeneity of government spending, the qualitative {{characterization of the}} optimal factor income taxes depends on both these factors. In particular, the well known Chamley - Judd result that, in the long run, tax rates on capital income should be zero is, in many cases, overturned. It is shown {{that the nature of}} <b>tax</b> <b>evasion</b> matters: if a reproducible factor [...] a capital stock [...] or a whole sector evades taxes, then the long run tax code still displays no taxation of capital, but increased taxation of labor. If, on the other hand, it is a non-reproducible factor [...] e. g. labor [...] that is evading tax payments, then the optimal tax code requires that capital be either taxed or subsidized depending on the elasticity of substitution between capital and the evading factor. Next, I discuss the role of endogenous spending. I consider two types of public goods: utility enhancing [...] e. g. parks, arts [...] and productivity enhancing [...] e. g. infrastructure, education. I show that suboptimal settings for the spending variables can affect the long run taxation of capital. For example, in the case of productive public goods, I show that excessive [...] relative to the first best [...] levels of spending require taxes on capital income, while low levels of spending result in subsidies to capital. Overall, our results point to an interaction between <b>tax</b> <b>evasion,</b> spending and the design of the optimal tax code. Policy makers engaged in tax reforms need to take <b>into</b> account <b>tax</b> <b>evasion</b> not only for its revenue effects, which are secondary in our story, but also for efficiency considerations associated with the relative returns to all factors. Similarly, policy makers need to make assumptions about the structure of spending. Suboptimal [...] ...|$|R
