25|$|This {{replaces the}} {{proposal}} that Palin dropped to give Alaskans $100-a-month energy debit cards. The <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> the debit cards were {{too expensive for}} the state to administer and wouldn't work in some rural Alaskan communities.|$|E

25|$|A {{compromise}} {{was announced}} on June 24, 2005 by Governor Schwarzenegger. The <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> {{that he and}} State Senate President Pro Tempore Don Perata had reached agreement to resurrect plans for the signature span. Cost estimates of the contract deferral expenses and inflation range attributable to the delay have ranged up to $400 million. Direct costs due to cessation of work included some dismantling of temporary structures and their reconstruction upon the subsequent restart.|$|E
25|$|Following Act 72, Rendell and the Pennsylvania {{legislature}} {{looked at}} other proposals to reduce property taxes, {{a key component}} of his 2002 campaign. The <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> he was willing to consider legislation that changes Act 72, and legislative proposals were made to force school districts to accept the money. Other proposed legislation would have required the issue to be voted on in each district as a ballot question, rather than decided by school boards. Property tax relief and Act 72 were issues of great controversy and have been subject to political gridlock, and it was unclear when changes would be made.|$|E

2500|$|Moyles {{was accused}} of {{homophobia}} in May 2006, when he rejected a ringtone by saying [...] "I don't want that one, it's gay", live on air.

500|$|The {{prisoners were}} taken to Boston on 22 July and held until their trial on 31 July. They were brought before Governor John Endicott for {{questioning}} and were accused of being Anabaptists. [...] Clarke replied that he was neither an Anabaptist, nor a Pedobaptist (one favoring infant baptism), nor a Catabaptist (one opposing infant baptism).

500|$|In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old girl in Denmark, Barnwell County, {{alleged that}} an African American unknown to her had {{attempted}} to attack her. About twenty black men were detained and paraded before her; she stated that Henry Williams looked something like the man she had seen. Placed on what passed for a trial by the mob that took him from the jail, Williams produced several respected white men to support his alibi. A majority of the mob voted against killing him, and Williams was returned to jail. More searches were made for Baxter's attacker. A suspect in the case, John Peterson, appealed to Tillman for protection, fearing he would be lynched if taken to Denmark, and stating he could prove his innocence. Tillman sent Peterson to Denmark with a single guard. He {{was taken by the}} mob, put on [...] "trial", and after the mob found him guilty, was murdered. There was widespread outrage among both races across the country, both at the actions of the lynchers and at what Tillman had done. The <b>governor</b> <b>said,</b> in response, that he had assumed that, as the mob had been convinced by Williams' defense, it would allow Peterson to prove his innocence as well. He thereafter ignored the issue of the Denmark lynching.|$|E

Earlier reports put the figure at approximately $14 million. The precise figures are unknown since Nagano, after the IOC asked that the entertainment expenditures not be made public, destroyed the financial records.|$|E
50|$|The US House of Representatives {{passed the}} American SAFE Act of 2015, {{which makes it}} more {{difficult}} for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to enter the United States. The bill still needs to pass the Senate. At least 31 state <b>governors</b> <b>said</b> that they opposed accepting Syrian refugees into their states, although the decision to accept refugees belongs to the federal government; numerous mayors of major US cities have said they would welcome more refugees.|$|R

Hampshire County Council - which had unwisely {{withdrawn}} a £9-a-week grant from a student, Sally Williams, {{at the request of}} SCC - realized this might be illegal, immoral and bad publicity, and restituted it. 50 parents asked the Governors not to victimise students or staff. The <b>Governors</b> <b>said</b> nothing but brought an injunction against the security guards and cut off the electricity to the College. The students hired a generator and continued.|$|R
2500|$|On March 4, 2014, {{the state}} {{attorney}} general announced that he would neither appeal the state's position nor request further stays. Kentucky's <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> he would employ outside counsel to appeal Heyburn's ruling in Bourke to the [...] U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and to request a stay pending appeal.

The Virginia Municipal League reported: [...] "The <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> {{that there was no}} rush on this extension, and that the legislature should study the impact of the annexation moratorium on cities. The moratorium applies only to a limited number of cities. Many cities are barred from annexation by either geography or by other laws establishing the ability of counties to obtain complete or partial immunity from annexation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campbell {{went on to}} sue Superintendent of the Province of Canterbury James FitzGerald for libel on {{the grounds}} that he had been defamed in FitzGerald's letter to Governor of New Zealand George Grey while seeking Campbell's removal from office. Fitzgerald's letter to the <b>Governor</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I request the removal of an officer who has been {{condemned}} by the united voice of the public as wholly unfit to be entrusted with any public office whatever". Campbell initially won the case but the verdict was overturned on appeal on the basis that FitzGerald's letter to the Governor was privileged, that Campbell had not proven that FitzGerald acted in malice, and that Campbell had misstated the alleged libel.|$|E

University administration was criticized by some for the initiative, given budget shortfalls at the time. Brian Heidecker, chair of the University of Alberta's Board of <b>Governors,</b> <b>said</b> the purchase gave the university a strategic advantage, noting that the residence {{would serve as a}} strong inducement when recruiting future presidents. Samarasekera continues to live at the home and pays rent based on fair market value.|$|R
2500|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{dismissed}} in November 2011 under the ruling that Ventura should have filed the lawsuit in the Court of Appeals. In related {{comments to the}} media following the lawsuit's dismissal, Ventura stated he believed America had become [...] "fascist" [...] for the secret ruling and subsequent mainstream media blackout. The former <b>Governor</b> <b>said</b> he would seek dual citizenship in both the United States and Mexico, having lived in Baja California Sur {{for a number of}} years. He also said he no longer felt patriotic and would raise a fist during the playing of the national anthem at public events. Ventura has declared he would no longer fly commercially and has repeatedly stated, [...] "I love my country, not my government" [...] in post-press-release interviews.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small {{producer}} of sugar with {{a relatively small number of}} slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. William C. C. Claiborne, Louisiana's first United States <b>governor,</b> <b>said</b> that African slave labor was needed because white laborers [...] "cannot be had in this unhealthy climate." [...] Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the US and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade – the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.|$|E

Deval Patrick, Reilly's principal opponent for the Democratic nomination for <b>governor,</b> <b>said</b> [...] "There was a strong argument that this should have gone a different way." [...] Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin said: [...] "I {{think this is one of}} those instances where the institution of gay marriage may be less divisive to society than the referendum campaign will be.
