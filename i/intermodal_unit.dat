40|$|North American railroads are {{experiencing}} {{rapid growth in}} traffic demand and increasingly need to expand capacity to accommodate it. Efficient planning of new capacity requires understanding how the mixture of traffic interacts to affect capacity. Different freight and passenger trains have substantially different operating characteristics including speed, acceleration, braking and dispatching priorities. Heterogeneity in the mix of train types using a line reduces its capacity. Train dispatching simulation software was {{used to analyze the}} effect of various combinations of <b>intermodal,</b> <b>unit,</b> manifest and passenger trains on a hypothetical signalized single-track railroad subdivision with characteristics typical of a North American rail line. Analyses included the effect of traffic volume, varying percentages and combinations of different train types as well as the effect of priority and speed ratio of the different trains sharing a line. The effect of adding passenger trains to freight-only lines was also evaluated. As has been shown by previous investigators, heterogeneity did reduce capacity but different types of heterogeneity had differing effects, which has implications for capacity planning.

40|$|The {{railway freight}} {{terminals}} {{play a key}} role within the multimodal logistic chain. Therefore, the transit time through these terminals represents one of the most relevant terminal performances {{and at the same time}} a key component of the freight transport generalized cost, so that its quantitative analysis is a strategic activity, both in the terminal planning (for the existing and for the future terminal) and in the logistic chain organization. The transit time is composed of deterministic and stochastic components, which increases significantly the problem complexity. The authors developed an original model based on queuing theory allowing the calculation of the transit time for a large variety of terminals. Some pilot applications of the model showed that the arrival distributions of both classes of vehicles are critical inputs for the effectiveness of the results. In this framework the present paper focuses on the theoretical study of these distributions including an extended validation campaign based on data available for an Italian case study (intermodal terminal of Pomezia near Rome).

30|$|Three main {{types of}} {{transportation}} systems are {{defined in the}} utilization of multiple transportation modes. Multimodal transportation refers to passenger or freight transportation from an origin to a destination using two or more transportation modes. Intermodal transportation {{is a type of}} multimodal freight transportation that uses an <b>intermodal</b> transport <b>unit</b> (ITU) (e.g. container) with no handling of the goods themselves between mode changes. Combined transportation is a type of multimodal freight transportation that excludes air transport and where most the trip occurs by rail or on waterways with only the initial and final legs of the trip occurring on road. The reader is referred to [3] for a compilation of these definitions. It should also be noted here that air and sea transport do not lend themselves to unimodal (i.e. single-mode) transportation of freight. Air and sea transport are almost always coupled with either rail/road transport or both. On the other hand, rail and road transport could be used as unimodal and possibly interchangeably. Choice between rail and road transport depends mostly on economic matters and the availability of the required infrastructure (i.e. rail ramp, crane, etc.) and qualified human resource at the transhipment hubs.|$|R

The dry port concept {{is based on}} a seaport directly connected by rail to inland intermodal terminals, where shippers can leave and/or collect their goods in <b>intermodal</b> loading <b>units</b> as if directly at the seaport. In addition to the transhipment that a conventional inland intermodal terminal provides, services such as storage, consolidation, depot, maintenance of containers, and customs clearance are usually also available at dry ports.

A model of a transport system, with and without a dry port, is created and the results of the simulations compared. The benefits of the dry port implementation are defined from an environmental perspective; calculated CO 2 emissions are approximately 25 % lower with an implemented dry port for the chosen case, while congestion and truck waiting times at the terminal are significantly reduced.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} and review in-depth the impediments in implementing and developing dry ports, from a heuristic point of view. The dry port concept {{is based on}} the idea of a seaport directly connected by rail to inland intermodal terminals, where shippers can leave and/or collect their goods in <b>intermodal</b> loading <b>units</b> as if directly at the seaport. With dry port implementation, CO 2 emissions would be decreased, queues and long waiting times at seaport terminals avoided, and the risk of road accidents would be reduced; thus, regional sustainability would increase. As the container industry has gone through a huge boom up to the world economic crisis, the idea of implementing dry ports into international freight logistics,coping with the need for environmental protection and the creation of new jobs, might at least be part of the solution. Methodology used in this paper is based on extended literature review, interviews and case studies, with external validation regarding dry ports implementation, and is primarily meant to highlight the main impediments which may occur {{not only in terms of}} the actual implementation of dry ports but also as far as the actors involved in containerized freight trade are concerned. dry ports, impediments,heuristic view, waiting times...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an intermodal terminal is especially {{measured in terms}} of time waste for both traffic feeders and loading <b>units</b> (known as <b>intermodal</b> transport <b>units,</b> ITUs) from the moment they arrive at the terminal up to the leaving instant. This makes significant the estimation of the maximum traffic (normally referred to as “capacity”) which allows the terminal to work without loss of efficiency and congestion. The amount of the factors from which capacity depends and their nature (the most of them are stochastic processes with a huge grade of indeterminacy—e. g. traffic peaks, economical fluctuations, delays and so on) make the issue challenging and seldom addressed from scientific literature. This paper deals with a heuristic model for the estimation of the yearly capacity of an intermodal terminal and is organised as follows. General definitions and a wide dissertation on the complexity of the concept may be found in the Section 1, also briefly summarizing some interesting results of the scientific literature. Section 2 describes the model and the assumptions on which it is based. A mathematical formulation of the described problem is contained in the Section 3.

40|$|With {{increasing}} maritime containerized transport, efficient seaport terminals and inland access {{are essential}} for the entire intermodal transportation chain to function. Improvement only in maritime transport and in seaport terminals without improvements in seaport inland access is not sufficient since a growth in the sea flow implies an almost proportional increase in the inland flow. Therefore, implementation of rail for connecting seaports with their hinterland through inland terminals would be the strategic decision. Inland terminals are of major importance for the efficiency of intermodal transport and for the efficiency of seaport inland access. This thesis deals with the dry port concept.

30|$|The role of {{intermodal}} terminals is {{of fundamental}} {{importance for the}} competitiveness of railroad combined transport. Ballis [12] analysed {{the role of the}} quality of services in the design and operation of freight terminals. His goal was to provide a set of standards that would be useful for investment strategies and terminal design. The interesting aspect, {{from the point of view}} of our paper, is the typical cost versus volume curve for intermodal terminals. The purpose of Behrends and Flodén [13] was instead to analyse the effects of terminal costs on the network performance of intermodal line-trains. Their results confirmed that, in theory, intermodal transport could provide competitive services over short and medium transport distances when the transhipment costs are kept low. They also studied the effect of lower transhipment costs on the production costs. Their case study was focused on a path that included several terminals without road haulage, and which only had a line-train service. The position of terminals is a strategic issue: Carreira et al. [14] suggested an optimisation model for the location of intermodal terminals in a freight transport system. They in particular analysed how a catchment area around the terminal could increase if the external costs were included in the decision process. Limbourg and Jourquin [15] also evaluated terminal locations in their paper, using an iterative procedure based on the p-hub median problem, which takes into account the variation in trans-shipment costs according to the number of transhipped <b>intermodal</b> transport <b>units.</b> They considered the influence of terminal locations using the pre- and post-haulage costs.|$|R

Among the problems that have been identified are deficiencies in the information exchange between the actors, and lack of high quality real-time data. Differentiated Access Management - DAM is aimed at smaller organisations with limited resources for investing in larger ICT-systems. With DAM, a haulier could qualify for a higher level of differentiated access to an intermodal terminal based on digital information exchange in advance (or even in real-time). The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the information attributes that could be exchanged between intermodal terminal and haulier to enable DAM. A literature review on the topic is followed by semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, resulting in a classification framework for the actual information attributes that are transmitted in interactions between haulier and intermodal terminal. Individual parameters are identified and classified according to source and category (static, historical or dynamic). This compilation of parameters could help hauliers’ transport planners and intermodal terminal’s transport planners when applying DAM in order to improve the information exchange which in turn hopefully could help to make the transportation operations more efficient. The work has been focused solely on the interaction between intermodal terminal and haulier and has left out all other interactions and transportation modes that may be involved in intermodal freight transportation.
