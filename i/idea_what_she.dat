But in fact, ELIZA had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E

Using her celebrity as a former model, she brings in clients and tries to bring some order to a business previously run without any discipline. By the time he had written 50 pages for the pilot to the show, Caron says he realized he was writing the part for Cybill Shepherd. After reading the script, she immediately realized this was a part she wanted to do and, during her first meeting with Caron and producer Jay Daniel, remarked that it was reminiscent of a “Hawksian” comedy. [...] The two had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was talking about, so she suggested they screen Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby, and His Girl Friday, three of her favorites, to see how the overlapping dialogue was handled. [...] A week before shooting of the pilot began, Caron, Shepherd, and Willis watched Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{superiors}} held mixed {{opinions on}} her suitability for secret warfare, and her training was incomplete {{due to the}} need to get trained W/T operators into the field. Inayat Khan's [...] "childlike" [...] qualities, particularly her gentle manner and [...] "lack of ruse", had greatly worried her instructors at SOE's training schools. One instructor wrote that [...] "she confesses that she would not like to have to do anything 'two faced'", while another said she was [...] "very feminine in character, very eager to please, very ready to adapt herself to the mood of the company, the one of the conversation, capable of strong attachments, kind hearted, emotional, imaginative." [...] A further observer said: [...] "Tends to give far too much information. Came here without the foggiest <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was being trained for." [...] Later, others commented that she was also physically unsuited, claiming that she would not easily disappear into a crowd. Physically tiny, Inayat Khan also received poor athletic reports from her instructors: [...] "Can run very well but otherwise clumsy. Unsuitable for jumping" [...] "Pretty scared of weapons but tries hard to get over it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 29 May 1942 it was {{announced}} that all Jews living in the occupied zone had to wear a yellow star of David with the words Juif or Juive written on it at all times by 7 June 1942. Ousby described the purpose of the yellow star [...] "not just to identify but [...] to humiliate, and it worked".On 14 June 1942, a 12-year-old Jewish boy committed suicide in Paris as his classmates were now shunning the boy with the yellow star. As a form of quiet protest, many Jewish veterans started to wear their medals alongside the yellow star, which led the Germans to ban all Jewish veterans from wearing their medals alongside the yellow stars of David due to being [...] "inappropriate", as it increased popular sympathy for men who fought and suffered for France. At times, ordinary people would show sympathy for Jews; as a Scot married to a Frenchman, Janet Teissier du Cros wrote in her diary about a Jewish woman wearing her yellow star of David going shopping: [...] "She came humbly up and stood hesitating {{on the edge of the}} pavement. Jews were not allowed to stand in queues. What they were supposed to do I never discovered. But the moment the people in the queue saw her they signed to her to join us. Secretly and rapidly, as in the game of hunt-the-slipper, she was passed up till she stood at the head of the queue. I am glad to say that not one voice was raised in protest, the policeman standing near turned his head away, and that she got her cabbage before any of us".By 1942, the Paris Kommandantur was receiving an average of 1,500 corbeaux (poison pen letters) a day. One corbeaux written by a Frenchwoman read:"Since you are taking care of the Jews, and if your campaign is not just a vain word, then have a look at the kind of life led by the girl M.A, formerly a dancer, now living at 41 Boulevard de Strasbourg, not wearing a star. This creature, for whom being Jewish is not enough, debauches the husbands of proper Frenchwomen, and you may well have an <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is living off. Defend women against Jewishness-that will be your best publicity, and you will return a French husband to his wife". In the summer of 1942, a committee consisting of SS Hauptsturmführer Theodor Dannecker, the Commissioner for Jewish Affairs Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, and general secretary of the police René Bousquet had been planning a grand rafle (great round-up) of Jews to deport to the death camps. On the morning of 16 July 1942, the grand rafle was launched with 9,000 French policemen rounding up the Jews of Paris, leading to some 12,762 Jewish men, women and children being arrested and brought to the Val d'Hiv sports stadium, from where they were sent to the Drancy camp and finally Auschwitz. The grand rafle was a joint operation; the overwhelming majority of those who arrested the Jews were French policemen. During the grand rafle, some 100 Jews warned by friends in the police killed themselves, while 24 Jews were killed resisting arrest. One Jewish Frenchwoman, Madame Rado, who was arrested during the grand rafle with her four children, noted about the watching bystanders: [...] "Their expressions were empty, apparently indifferent". When taken with the other Jews to the Place Voltaire, one woman was heard to shout [...] "Well done! Well done!" [...] while the man standing to her warned her [...] "After them, it'll be us. Poor people!". Rado herself survived Auschwitz, but her four children were killed in the gas chambers.|$|E
