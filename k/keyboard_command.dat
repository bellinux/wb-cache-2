25|$|Control-Alt-Delete, often {{abbreviated}} as Ctrl-Alt-Del, is {{a computer}} <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> on PC compatible systems {{that can be used}} to reboot a computer, and summon the task manager or operating system. It is invoked by pressing the Delete key while holding the Control and Alt keys: Ctrl+Alt+Delete. Thus, it forces a soft reboot, brings up the task manager (on Windows and BeOS) or a jump to ROM monitor. Control-Alt-Delete was invented in 1981 by David Bradley while working at IBM.|$|E

50|$|Speakable items {{is part of}} {{the speech}} {{recognition}} feature in the classic Mac OS and macOS operating systems. It allows the user to control their computer with natural speech, without having to train the computer beforehand. The commands must be present in the Speakable items folder though but can be created with something as simple as a shortcut, AppleScript, <b>keyboard</b> <b>command,</b> or Automator workflows.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike Sinclair BASIC or Commodore 64 BASIC, {{which had}} various <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> shortcuts or {{specialized}} keys for choosing symbols or colors, Locomotive BASIC keywords were typed {{in full and}} the interpreter parsed, recognized and tokenised them. However, there were abbreviations like [...] "?" [...] for [...] "PRINT" [...] and a few shortcuts. Programs could be saved onto cassette tape or floppy disk and retrieved as binary or ASCII files.|$|E

50|$|The first 16 bit game Personal Nightmare {{based on}} a design by Keith Wadhams {{featured}} music, animation and some mouse control coupled with a traditional text based game system. It was followed by two games based around Elvira, Mistress of the Dark: Elvira: Mistress of the Dark and Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus, and a game named Waxworks, all of which moved away from <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> input to mouse driven gaming with animation and music from Jezz Woodroffe (a session musician with Robert Plant, Black Sabbath and other bands). Waxworks and the Elvira games used a modified AberMUD 5 game engine.|$|E
5000|$|Control-Alt-Delete (often {{abbreviated}} to Ctrl+Alt+Del, {{also known as}} the [...] "three-finger salute") is a computer <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> on IBM PC compatible computers, invoked by pressing the Delete key while holding the Control and Alt keys: [...] The function of the key combination differs depending on the context but it generally interrupts or facilitates interrupting a function. For instance, in pre-boot environment (before an operating system starts) or in DOS, Windows 3.0 and earlier versions of Windows or OS/2, the key combination reboots the computer. Starting with Windows 95, the command invokes a task manager or security related component that facilitates ending a Windows session.|$|E
50|$|Tires are modeled in much detail. The game {{keeps track}} of 3 {{temperatures}} for each tire, reflecting temperatures at the center, inner, and outer edges. Numerous variables can influence tire temperatures. For example, an underinflated tire will tend to heat more at the edges rather than the center. An incorrect camber setting can cause one edge to heat more than the other. Temperatures are also influenced by many other factors such as weight distribution, toe-in, driver behavior, and the cornering characteristics of the race track. Tires in the game perform optimally at elevated temperatures, but if they heat excessively this effect is lost. The player can view current tire temperatures using an in-game <b>keyboard</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E

50|$|The DOS-11 {{operating}} system kernel was one file called MONLIB.LCL. The LCL extension was the acronym for LInked Core Image Library (or LICIL). An LICIL could be stored on {{any type of}} media that the DOS-11 {{operating system}} was distributed on (disk, DECtape, punched tape or magnetic tape). When the LICIL file was installed (Hooked) onto a disk drive as a contiguous file, the monitor library name is changed to MONLIBCIL which could then be booted. The CIL extension was the acronym for Core Image Library. Core, was the term for the core memory systems common to the PDP-11. A Core Image Library could be created with the CILUS (Core Image Library Update and Save) program. A MONLIBCIL typically contained the resident monitor (RMON), the <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> routine, device drivers, EMT routines, the clock routines and the transient monitor.|$|E
50|$|The Walking Dead games {{follow the}} same point-and-click {{adventure}} game approach that other Telltale Games episodic series have followed. Within an episode, the player controls a protagonist as the story progresses through several scenes. Within a scene, the player can move the character to explore the area, examine items, and initiate conversation trees with non-player characters; in these dialogs, the player has the option of selecting a number of options to reply to characters, including the option to stay silent. Other scenes are based on cinematic elements using quick time events in which the player must hit a controller button or a <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> as indicated on screen to react to an event. Failure {{to do so in}} time can lead to the character's death or other undesirable ending, and the game will restart just prior to these scenes.|$|E
50|$|The RT-11 {{operating}} {{system could be}} booted from, and perform useful work on, a machine consisting of two 8-inch 250KB floppy disks and 56KB of memory, and could support 8 terminals. Other boot options include the RK05 2.5MB removable hard disk platter, or magnetic tape. Distributions were available pre-installed or on punched tape, magnetic tape, cartridge tape, or floppy disk. A minimal but complete system supporting a single real-time user could run on a single floppy disk and in 8K 16-bit words (16KB) of RAM, including user programs. This was facilitated by support for swapping and overlaying. To realize operation on such small memory system, the <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> user interface would be swapped out during the execution of a user's program and then swapped into memory upon program termination. The system supported a real-time clock, printing terminal, VT11 vector graphic unit, 16 channel 100 kHz A/D converter with 2 channel D/A, 9600 baud serial port, 16 bit bidirectional boards, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Command key is to allow the user to enter <b>keyboard</b> <b>commands</b> in {{applications}} and in the system. The Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines have always recommended that developers use the Command key (and not the Control or Option keys) for this purpose. A small set of <b>keyboard</b> <b>commands</b> (such as cut and paste, open and save) are standard across nearly all applications, and many other commands are standardized (Find, Show Fonts). If an application needs more shortcuts than can be obtained with the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet, double modifiers such as Command+Option are used.|$|R
50|$|VoiceOver — {{screen reader}} {{interface}} similar to Jaws for Windows and other Windows screen readers that offers {{the blind and}} visually impaired user keyboard control and spoken English descriptions of what is happening on screen. VoiceOver enables users with visual impairment to use applications via <b>keyboard</b> <b>commands.</b> VoiceOver is capable of reading aloud the contents of files including web pages, mail messages and word processing files. Complete keyboard navigation lets the user control the computer with the keyboard rather than the mouse, a menu is displayed in a window showing all the available <b>keyboard</b> <b>commands</b> that can be used.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} WordStar interface left a large legacy, {{and many}} of its control-key command are still available (optionally or as the default) in other programs, such as the modern cross-platform word processing software TextMaker and many text editors running under MS-DOS, Linux, and other UNIX variants. The popular Turbo Pascal compiler used WordStar keyboard commands in its IDE editor. The TEXT editor built into the firmware of the TRS-80 Model 100 portable computer supported a subset of the Wordstar cursor movement commands (in addition to its own). Home word processing software like Write&Set not only use the WordStar interface, but have been based on WordStar DOS file formats, allowing WordStar users who no longer have a copy of the application to easily open and edit their files. There are WordStar <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> emulators and keymappings, both freeware and shareware, for current versions of Microsoft Word. Popular modern word processing software like WordPerfect, StarOffice, and Microsoft Word (with the proper filters) can open and save to WordStar documents, enabling users to move back and forth.|$|E

The paper addresses the transition to the NASA Shuttle from the present era of expendable launch vehicles as it applies to the command and telemetry electrical interfaces. Final preparation of the spacecraft for launch into the transfer orbit rests with the Orbiter crew rather than the spacecraft contractor launch team. The added dimension of crew safety and the importance of simplifying the preparation task led the requirement for Electrical Airborne Support Equipment (EASE). The conceptual design of this microcomputer-based equipment is described. The EASE monitors the health of the spacecraft and takes adaptive action where appropriate. It also sends prestored command lists to the spacecraft in response to crew-initiated <b>keyboard</b> <b>command</b> functions...|$|E
