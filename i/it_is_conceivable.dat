5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting {{to make peace with}} the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that Ímar {{received}} {{some form of}} support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about eight years, {{and one of his}} first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that such a medium {{could be used in}} the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|Exactly who Ælfgar {{received}} {{aid from}} in the Irish Sea region is uncertain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that, after his flight from England in 1055, Ælfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord). Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of Ælfgar and Magnús in 1058which utilised Islesmen and Dublinerscould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well. That being said, {{there are several reasons}} to doubt a part played by Diarmait in Ælfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to Ælfgar's enemiesthe Godwinsonsin the 1050s and 1060s. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago (fl. 1064), a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of Ælfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Guðrøðr's {{authority}} in the Hebrides is unknown due to his apparent coexistence with Gilli, and to the uncertainty of Orcadian encroachment. Guðrøðr's successor is likewise uncertain. On one hand, {{he may have been}} succeeded by his son, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1004/1005). Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that either Gilli or Sigurðr capitalised on Guðrøðr's death, and extended their overlordship as far south as Mann, possible after-effects such as these are uncorroborated. Although it is possible that Gilli controlled the Hebrides whilst Guðrøðr ruled Mann, the title accorded to the latter on his death could indicate otherwise. If so, the chronology of Gilli's subordination to Sigurðr may actually date to the period after Rǫgnvaldr's death in 1004/1005.|$|E
5|$|Ælfgar's Irish confederate of 1055 is not {{identified}} in any source, {{and it is}} not clear that Diarmait had a part to play in the aforesaid events of that year. In fact, it is possible that Ælfgar received aid not from Diarmait, but from DonnchadDiarmait's enemy and Echmarcach's associatea man who then controlled the Norse-Gaelic enclaves of Limerick and possibly Waterford. Furthermore, although Diarmait appears to have gained overlordship of Mann by 1061, Echmarcach presumably enjoyed overlordship of at least part of the Hebrides in 1058. Since Magnús utilised Islesmen during his English campaign of that year, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that Echmarcach may have played a prominent part in these operations. If Echmarcach was indeed involved in the campaign, the enmity between him and Diarmait could indicate that these two were unlikely to have cooperated as allies.|$|E

5|$|If Lǫgmaðr {{was indeed}} a crusader, it is {{uncertain}} which particular crusade he undertook. One possibility is that he {{took part in the}} First Crusade, a movement that reached its climax with the successful siege and capture of Jerusalem in mid 1099. Lǫgmaðr could have embarked upon this enterprise in about 1096, the year the pope's calls reached England, and perhaps joined Robert's assembling forces that summer. Alternately, in light of Lǫgmaðr's capture by the Norwegians in 1098, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that his release from custody was made conditional upon his exile and participation in the First Crusade. On the other hand, it is not impossible that Lǫgmaðr originally undertook a pilgrimage before catching wind of the crusade en route. Whatever the case, if Lǫgmaðr indeed participated and perished in the First Crusade, he may have met his end on campaign in Syria or Anatolia.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Fergus' ecclesiastical patronage is uncertain.

In December 1471 Pope Sixtus IV ordered the present sculpture to be transferred to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill, and the twins were added some time around then. The Capitoline Wolf joined a number of other genuinely ancient sculptures transferred at the same time, to form the nucleus of the Capitoline Museum.|$|E
25|$|The MOF {{encapsulation}} approach invites {{comparison to}} earlier studies of oxidative catalysis by zeolite-encapsulated Fe(porphyrin) {{as well as}} Mn(porphyrin) systems. The zeolite studies generally employed iodosylbenzene (PhIO), rather than TPHP as oxidant. The difference is likely mechanistically significant, thus complicating comparisons. Briefly, PhIO is a single oxygen atom donor, while TBHP is capable of more complex behavior. In addition, for the MOF-based system, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that oxidation proceeds via both oxygen transfer from a manganese oxo intermediate {{as well as a}} manganese-initiated radical chain reaction pathway. Regardless of mechanism, the approach is a promising one for isolating and thereby stabilizing the porphyrins against both oxo-bridged dimer formation and oxidative degradation.|$|E
25|$|Given Rufinus’s {{dealings}} with the Visigoths, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that Marcellus should be identified with “a certain former high-ranking official from Narbonne” mentioned by Orosius as present in Bethlehem in 415 A.D. While visiting Jerome, Orosius says he heard this Gaul relate the declaration made by Athaulf, king of the Visigoths, at Narbonne regarding his intentions toward the Roman empire. John Matthews argued that Marcellus, {{who would have been}} about 60 at the time, is “clearly the most eligible candidate.” Since Orosius identifies the Gaul only as having served under Theodosius, and as a “devout, cautious, and serious” person, other figures have been put forth as the likely bearer of the Athaulf declaration.|$|E
