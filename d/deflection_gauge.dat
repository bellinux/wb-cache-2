40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a methodology to evaluate {{different types of}} non-nuclear technologies {{to see how they}} are competitive to the nuclear technology for quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) in soil condition measurement for highway pavement construction. The non-nuclear methods including the Electrical Density Gauge (EDG) and the Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD) were tested for their performance against a nuclear gauge, and traditional methods were used as baselines. An innovative way of comparing a <b>deflection</b> <b>gauge</b> to a density gauge was introduced. Results showed that the nuclear gauge generally outperformed the non-nuclear gauge in accuracies of soil density and moisture content measurements. Finally, a framework was developed as a guideline for evaluating various types of non-nuclear soil gauges. From other perspectives rather than accuracy, it was concluded that the non-nuclear gauges would be better alternative to the nuclear gauge when the followings are considered: (1) greater life-cycle cost savings; (2) elimination of intense federal regulations and safety/security concerns; and (3) elimination of licensing and intense training...|$|E

40|$|Standard fire {{endurance}} tests {{were performed on}} a full-scale floor assembly and a full-scale wall assembly constructed with cross-laminated timber (CLT) as the main structural element. The full-scale floor assembly consisted of CLT panels encapsulated with fiberglass wool and a single layer of 15. 9 mm thick Type X gypsum board on the exposed side and with two layers of 12. 7 mm thick cement board on the unexposed side. The full-scale wall assembly was constructed from CLT panels encapsulated with two layers of 15. 9 mm thick Type X gypsum board on both faces. Nine thermocouples were installed on the unexposed face of both assemblies to monitor the temperature rise throughout the test and nine <b>deflection</b> <b>gauges</b> were installed on each assembly to monitor deformations. The superimposed load applied on the floor assembly was 9. 4 kN/m 2 and the load imposed on the wall assembly was 449 kN/m. The {{fire endurance}} period of the full-scale floor assembly was 128 minutes {{and that of the}} full-scale wall assembly 219 minutes. Both the full-scale floor assembly and the full-scale wall assembly failed structurally afterwards under the applied loading.

5000|$|Aneroid gauges {{are based}} on a {{metallic}} pressure-sensing element that flexes elastically under the effect of a pressure difference across the element. [...] "Aneroid" [...] means [...] "without fluid," [...] and the term originally distinguished these gauges from the hydrostatic gauges described above. However, aneroid gauges can be used to measure the pressure of a liquid as well as a gas, and they are not the only type of gauge that can operate without fluid. For this reason, they are often called mechanical gauges in modern language. Aneroid gauges are not dependent on the type of gas being measured, unlike thermal and ionization gauges, and are less likely to contaminate the system than hydrostatic gauges. The pressure sensing element may be a Bourdon tube, a diaphragm, a capsule, or a set of bellows, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. The deflection of the pressure sensing element may be read by a linkage connected to a needle, or it may be read by a secondary transducer. The most common secondary transducers in modern vacuum gauges measure a change in capacitance due to the mechanical <b>deflection.</b> <b>Gauges</b> that rely on a change in capacitance are often referred to as capacitance manometers.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} cuspal {{deflection}} and cervical microleakage of standardised Class II cavities incrementally {{filled with a}} dimethacrylate RBC or bulk-fill flowable RBC bases. Methods: Twenty-four sound upper premolar teeth with Class II cavities were allocated to three groups (n = 8). Restoration of the teeth involved the placement of an RBC (GrandioSO) in eight oblique increments (Group A) or Groups B and C were restored to within 2 mm of the palatal cusp in a single increment with bulk-fill flowable RBC bases (SDR and x-tra base) before the two occlusal cavity increments were placed with GrandioSO. Buccal and palatal cusp deflections were recorded postirradiation using a twin channel <b>deflection</b> measuring <b>gauge.</b> Following restoration, the teeth were thermocycled, immersed in 0. 2 % basic fuchsin dye for 24 h, sectioned and examined for cervical microleakage Results: The mean total cuspal deflection for the oblique incremental restoration technique was 11. 26 (2. 56) ?m (Group A) and 4. 63 (1. 19) ?m (Group B) and 4. 73 (0. 99) ?m (Group C) for the bulk-fill flowable RBC bases. A {{significant increase in the}} mean total cuspal deflection for the incrementally filled GrandioSO compared with the SDR (P = 0. 007) and x-tra base (P = 0. 005) restored teeth was evident. No significant difference in the cervical microleakage scores were recorded between groups AC (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: The bulk-fill flowable RBC bases significantly reduced cuspal deflection compared with a conventional RBC restored in an oblique incremental filling technique with no associated change in cervical microleakage recorded...|$|R
30|$|The set-up {{consists}} of two beams of length 1  m each connected to a central column of height 650  mm. The beams and column were made of Universal Beam (UB) steel sections  306.6  ×  165.7  ×  11.8  ×  6.7  ×  46.1 of ultimate tensile strength of 410  MPa. Indian Standard angle of size ISA 65  ×  65  ×  6 and length of 180  mm is used as double web angle. An air-gap distance of 10  mm is provided between beam and column. The test specimen is given the id DWA- 6 - 180, in which 6 represents the thickness of angle in mm and 180 is the length of angle in mm. In order to simulate the simply supported conditions, {{one side of the}} beam was supported on hinge and other on roller. High-strength friction grip (HSFG) bolts of 16  mm diameter and 8.8 grade were used to connect the ends of beam web to the central stub column. The bolts were tightened by a pre-torque of 214  Nm. The present set-up has the advantage that column does not rotate, but only displaces up and down and the relative rotation between the column and beam is mainly due to connection deformation. Dial gauges of least count 0.01  mm were placed at every quarter effective span of the beam to measure the <b>deflection.</b> Strain <b>gauges</b> were pasted at various locations to measure the strain variation. Inclinometer was used to measure the relative rotation between the beam and column. The load was applied over the centre of the stub column {{with the help of a}} 60  T capacity hydraulic jack. Dial gauge, inclinometer and strain gauge readings are noted periodically up to collapse load.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the possible differences in deflection between two needles of same length and external gauge but with different internal gauges during truncal block of the inferior alveolar nerve. The initial working hypothesis was that greater deflection may be expected with larger internal gauge needles. Study design: Four clinicians subjected 346 patients to inferior alveolar nerve block and infiltrating anesthesia of the buccal nerve trajectory for the surgical or conventional extraction of the lower third molar. A nonautoaspirating syringe system with 2 types of needle was used: a standard 27 -gauge x 35 -mm needle with an internal gauge of 0. 215 mm or an XL Monoprotect® 27 -gauge x 35 -mm needle with an internal gauge of 0. 265 mm. The following information was systematically recorded for each patient: needle type, gender, anesthetic technique (direct or indirect truncal block) and the number of bone contacts during the procedure, the patient-extraction side, the practitioner performing the technique, and blood aspiration (either positive or negative). Results: 346 needles were used in total. 190 were standard needles (27 -gauge x 35 -mm needle with an internal gauge of 0. 215 mm) and 156 were XL Monoprotect®. Incidence of deflection was observed in 49. 1 % of cases (170 needles) where 94 were standard needles and 76 XL Monoprotect®. Needle torsion ranged from 0 º and 6 º.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the most {{appropriate}} functional and structural rehabilitation technique for damaged road pavements obviously mainly depends {{on the type of}} surface degradation. The most common rehabilitation technique for flexible pavements deals with the resurfacing of the degraded wearing course by means of a bituminous layer, when it can't be completely replaced by similar mixtures. Nevertheless, maintenance of degraded flexible pavements can be carried out resorting to a different procedure, which is rarely used in Italy, although it is quite popular abroad: Ultra-Thin Whitetopping (UTW). It involves the damaged pavement being resurfaced with small thin cement concrete slabs. The interaction between the existing bituminous pavement and concrete layer generates a monolithic system, the performance of which is conditioned by various parameters: the volume of vehicular traffic, environmental conditions, the thickness of cement and bituminous concrete layers, the distance between joints, the adhesion between layers and maintenance technique. The paper describes the results of an Italian application of this technique. The experiments regarded the identification and characterization of the existing bituminous pavements (through cores and bearing capacity tests), the design of the UTW, the cement concrete mix design (PP and SB fibres were added to the mixture to enhance compressive strength and elasticity), the mechanical characterization of the new layer (by means of compressive strength and dynamic modulus), the construction of joints, the execution of loading tests on the slabs and measurement of longitudinal, transversal and vertical <b>deflections</b> by strain <b>gauges</b> and LVDTs. The study emphasizes the effectiveness of the maintenance technique. The UTW ensures a good bearing capacity to the pavement, thanks to high values of compressive strength and elastic modulus of the concrete, according to future traffic needs. Moreover, deflections are rather limited. Adequate functional properties (evenness, skid resistance) are also guaranteed...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforced concrete (RC) {{can often be}} governed by the serviceability limit state of deflection. Currently, the evaluation of short-term deflection of FRP RC is undertaken using radically different approaches, in both research and codes of practice. This study investigates the short-term deflection behaviour of FRP RC, both experimentally and analytically, and examines the merits of those different approaches. Experimentally, 28 RC beams and slabs with glass, carbon or steel rebars are tested under four-point loading. The main variables considered are the reinforcement ratio, modulus of elasticity and bond. In addition to measuring <b>deflections,</b> closely-spaced strain <b>gauges</b> are used to measure rebar strains between one forced crack at midspan and two naturally-occurring cracks on either side. This setup enables the investigation of rebar strains, tension stiffening and bond between flexural cracks. Furthermore, in connection with concrete strains at the extreme compressive concrete fibre, the flexural load-curvature relationship is evaluated experimentally and used to decompose the total deflection into flexural and shear-induced deflections. Analytically two numerical analysis methods are used to provide further insight into the experimental results. Finite element analysis with smeared modelling of cracks is used to predict and examine the stress-displacement response in detail. Cracked section analysis is used to provide upper-bound deflections and strains. This study also deals with the ACI and Eurocode 2 approaches for prediction of short- term deflection. The deflection prediction and tension stiffening expressions of these codes are evaluated against the experimental results of this and other studies. The main conclusion is that deflection of FRP RC is essentially due to flexural curvatures, and can be reasonably evaluated by the tension stiffening model of Eurocode 2. However, with reinforcement of relatively low axial stiffness, and depending on the reinforcement bond characteristics, shear-induced deformations become significant and {{may need to be}} evaluated.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis studies the effects of foamed bitumen on the deformational behaviour and performance of pavement materials. The research was conducted in the laboratory and the field, using specific New Zealand materials. The aggregate used {{is a blend of}} a coarse aggregate imported from the Auckland region with a crushed dust from the Canterbury region. The bitumen selected for the study is an 80 / 100 bitumen grade, and the active filler was a Portland Cement, both commonly used for foamed bitumen stabilization in New Zealand. In the laboratory, samples of mixes with different foamed bitumen content were tested under various loading and stress conditions to investigate the effects of foamed bitumen on the deformational behaviour of the mix. The tests performed were: Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), Indirect Tensile Resilient Modulus (ITM), Repeat Load Triaxial compression (RLT) and Monotonic Load Triaxial compression (MLT). Preliminary ITS and RLT tests conducted on mixes with 1 % and 0 % cement, at different foamed bitumen contents, indicated that mixes without cement performed poorly compared to the mixes with 1 % cement. Therefore, the rest of the laboratory study was on mixes with 1 % cement. ITS tests were conducted on 150 mm specimens prepared with 0 % 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 % bitumen content, with a common 1 % cement. Results indicated that foamed bitumen increases the ITS values of the mix, up to an estimated optimum of 2. 8 % bitumen content. Similar trends were obtained with ITM tests, in which a diametrical load pulse was applied on 150 mm specimens, showing an estimated resilient modulus peak near to 2. 8 % bitumen content. RLT specimens were prepared at 0 %, 2 % and 4 % bitumen content, at two compaction efforts, creating specimens at low and high bulk density. Permanent deformation RLT tests involved the application of seven stages of 50, 000 load cycles each (4 Hz), with increasing deviator stress (from 75 kPa in the first stage, up to 525 kPa in the seventh stage) and at constant confining pressure of 50 kPa. Results of RLT permanent deformation tests indicated that the increase in the foamed bitumen content resulted in an increase in the permanent deformation of the material. MLT tests were conducted on specimens at 0 %, 2 % and 4 % bitumen contents, at two compaction efforts, creating specimens of low and high bulk density, at confining pressures ranging from 50 kPa to 300 kPa, with a deformation rate of 2. 1 % per minute. Results indicated that the effect of foamed bitumen was a reduction of the peak vertical stress, or a reduction in the peak strength. The peak stresses obtained in MLT tests were plotted in stress diagrams, and the failure was approximated as linear function of the confining stress. The fundamental shear parameters (angle of internal friction and apparent cohesion) were estimated, and results indicated that foamed bitumen has no apparent effect in cohesion but does reduce the angle of internal friction. The reduction of the angle of internal friction explains the general trends observed in the laboratory, that on one hand the compressive strength decreases with increasing bitumen content, but on the other hand, the tensile strength increases up to an optimum. A full-scale experiment was carried out using an accelerated testing of foamed bitumen pavements at the Canterbury Accelerated Pavement Testing Indoor Facility (CAPTIF). In the full-scale experiments, the same materials that were tested in the laboratory (aggregates, bitumen, cement) were used to construct six different pavement sections, each with different contents of bitumen and cement. Three were constructed using foamed bitumen contents of 1. 2 %, 1. 4 % and 2. 8 % respectively, plus a common active filler content of 1. 0 % cement. Two more pavements were constructed adding cement only (1. 0 %), and foamed bitumen only (2. 2 %). In addition, one control section with the untreated unbound material was tested. Strains were collected using a 3 D Emu soil strain system installed in each pavement section. The curing time between construction and pavement loading was approximately three months. The pavement response, such as surface deformation (rutting), surface deflections and strains were periodically recorded during the execution of the test. The strains were collected at different depths by using an array of Emu strain <b>gauges.</b> <b>Deflections</b> were recorded using both a Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) and CAPTIF Beam deflectometer, which is a modified Benkelmann beam. A total number of approximately 5. 6 million equivalent standard axles were applied on the pavement sections. The rutting measured in the sections stabilised with foamed bitumen and cement was the lowest, showing that the addition of foamed bitumen significantly improved the performance of materials with 1 % cement. The sections stabilised with cement only, foamed bitumen only, and the control untreated section showed large amounts of rutting and heaving {{by the end of the}} test. Deflection measurements showed that the effect of foamed bitumen content is a reduction of pavement deflections, with the lowest deflection measured in the section stabilised with 2. 8 % bitumen and 1 % cement. The elastic pavement strains showed that foamed bitumen reduced the tensile strains in the basecourse but did not have a significant effect on vertical compressive strains. During the construction of pavements, material samples were taken for ITS and RLT testing. Results indicated that the highest ITS was measured in the section with 2. 8 % foamed bitumen content and 1 % cement, and the ITS in the section without cement and foamed bitumen only was about 4 - 5 times lower than the ITS measured in specimens with cement. RLT specimens without cement performed poorly in comparison with the specimens with 1 % cement. The specimens with 1 % cement showed higher permanent deformation with increase in the foamed bitumen content, supporting the results from the previous laboratory study. To interpret and relate the results observed in the laboratory and the field, stress path analysis was used, in which the stress ratio of the foamed bitumen layers was calculated at different depths. The analysis showed that foamed bitumen content decreases the maximum stress ratio, hence reducing the proximity to failure and relative damage of the layer. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional finite element modelling of the CAPTIF pavements, were used to further investigate the stress and strain fields induced by the loading and to explain the pavement performance observed in the full-scale experiment...|$|R
