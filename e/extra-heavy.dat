5|$|The role of cavalry in {{the late}} army {{does not appear to}} have been greatly {{enhanced}} as compared with the army of the Principate. The evidence is that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2ndcentury and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. However, the cavalry of the Late Roman army was endowed with greater numbers of specialised units, such as <b>extra-heavy</b> shock cavalry (cataphractii and clibanarii) and mounted archers. During the later 4thcentury, the cavalry acquired a reputation for incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional reputation for excellence.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Orinoco oil sands contain <b>extra-heavy</b> oil which is easier to produce than Canada's similarly-sized {{reserves}} of bitumen, Venezuela's oil production has been declining in recent years because of the country's political and economic problems, while Canada's has been increasing. As a result, Canadian heavy oil and bitumen exports have been backing Venezuelan heavy and <b>extra-heavy</b> oil out of the US market, and Canada's total exports of oil to the US have become several times as great as Venezuela's.|$|E
25|$|Although Venezuelan <b>extra-heavy</b> oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, {{much of the}} {{difference}} is due to temperature. Once the oil {{comes out of the}} ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of <b>extra-heavy</b> oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move <b>extra-heavy</b> oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – {{as a result of the}} country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.|$|E
25|$|The <b>extra-heavy</b> {{crude oil}} or crude bitumen {{extracted}} from oil sands {{is a very}} viscous semisolid form of oil that does not easily flow at normal temperatures, {{making it difficult to}} transport to market by pipeline. To flow through oil pipelines, it must either be upgraded to lighter synthetic crude oil (SCO), blended with diluents to form dilbit, or heated to reduce its vicosity.|$|E
25|$|Except for a {{fraction}} of the <b>extra-heavy</b> oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology, oil sands must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated in-situ techniques. These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.|$|E
25|$|Oil-eating {{bacteria}} biodegrade {{oil that}} has escaped to the surface. Oil sands are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil {{still in the}} process of escaping and being biodegraded, but they contain so much migrating oil that, although most of it has escaped, vast amounts are still present—more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs. The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first, resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil, called crude bitumen in Canada, or <b>extra-heavy</b> crude oil in Venezuela. These two countries have the world's largest deposits of oil sands.|$|E
25|$|Between January and May 1915, the 6th Battle Squadron was dispersed. Exmouth {{left the}} {{squadron}} when she {{transferred to the}} Dardanelles on 12 May 1915 for service in the Dardanelles Campaign as Flagship, Rear Admiral, supporting squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Nicholson. She was fitted with <b>extra-heavy</b> anti-torpedo nets for this service. After the torpedoing and sinking of battleships , , and , all within the space of two weeks in May 1915, {{she was the only}} battleship allowed to remain off the Gallipoli Peninsula beaches. She supported the Allied attack on Achi Baba on 4 June 1915 and Allied attacks in the Cape Helles area in August 1915.|$|E
25|$|The Alberta {{government}} {{estimated that}} in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas {{the cost of}} new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel. These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors. Since the price of WTI rose to $100/bbl beginning in 2011, production from oil sands was then expected to be highly profitable assuming the product could be delivered to markets. The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan <b>extra-heavy</b> oil without upgrading.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{crude oil}} is {{normally}} {{extracted from the}} ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production {{is used in the}} Venezuelan oil sands, where the <b>extra-heavy</b> oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered {{only a small fraction of}} the oil in place, so it not often used today.|$|E
25|$|Modernized and new large {{refineries}} such as {{are found}} in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and <b>extra-heavy</b> oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.|$|E
25|$|The world's largest {{deposits}} of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela's {{deposits of}} <b>extra-heavy</b> crude oil are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources {{of all types}} and its {{oil and natural gas}} resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. In a scenario with oil prices above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs, with the excess oil production from its oil sands probably going to export. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.|$|E

2500|$|The crude bitumen {{contained}} in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as [...] "a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow."

2500|$|The world's {{largest oil}} sands are in Venezuela and Canada. The geology of the {{deposits}} {{in the two}} countries is generally rather similar. They are vast heavy oil, <b>extra-heavy</b> oil, and/or bitumen deposits with oil heavier than 20°API, found largely in unconsolidated sandstones with similar properties. [...] "Unconsolidated" [...] in this context means that the sands have high porosity, no significant cohesion, and a tensile strength close to zero. The sands are saturated with oil which has prevented them from consolidating into hard sandstone.|$|E
2500|$|No {{significant}} {{development of}} Venezuela's <b>extra-heavy</b> oil deposits was undertaken before 2000, {{except for the}} BITOR operation which produced somewhat less than 100,000 barrels of oil per day (16,000 m3/d) of 9°API oil by primary production. This was mostly shipped as an emulsion (Orimulsion) of 70% oil and 30% water with similar characteristics as heavy fuel oil for burning in thermal power plants. However, when a major strike hit the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, most of the engineers were fired as punishment. Orimulsion had been {{the pride of the}} PDVSA engineers, so Orimulsion fell out of favor with the key political leaders. As a result, the government has been trying to [...] "Wind Down" [...] the Orimulsion program.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was {{the largest}} oil {{importer}} in the world. Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, {{many of which have}} been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined. The main market for Canadian bitumen as well as Venezuelan <b>extra-heavy</b> oil was assumed to be the US. The United States has historically been Canada’s largest customer for crude oil and products, particularly in recent years. American imports of oil and products from Canada grew from [...] in 1981 to [...] in 2013 as Canada's oil sands produced more and more oil, while in the US, domestic production and imports from other countries declined. However, this relationship is becoming strained due to physical, economic and political influences. Export pipeline capacity is approaching its limits; Canadian oil is selling at a discount to world market prices; and US demand for crude oil and product imports has declined because of US economic problems.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian bitumen {{does not}} differ {{substantially}} from oils such as Venezuelan <b>extra-heavy</b> and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition, {{and the real}} difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common {{in areas such as}} the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over [...] per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Crude oil varies {{greatly in}} {{appearance}} depending on its composition. It is usually black or dark brown (although {{it may be}} yellowish, reddish, or even greenish). In the reservoir it is usually found in association with natural gas, which being lighter forms a [...] "gas cap" [...] over the petroleum, and saline water which, being heavier than most forms of crude oil, generally sinks beneath it. Crude oil may {{also be found in}} a semi-solid form mixed with sand and water, as in the Athabasca oil sands in Canada, where it is usually referred to as crude bitumen. In Canada, bitumen is considered a sticky, black, tar-like form of crude oil which is so thick and heavy that it must be heated or diluted before it will flow. Venezuela also has large amounts of oil in the Orinoco oil sands, although the hydrocarbons trapped in them are more fluid than in Canada and are usually called extra heavy oil. These oil sands resources are called unconventional oil to distinguish them from oil which can be extracted using traditional oil well methods. Between them, Canada and Venezuela contain an estimated [...] of bitumen and <b>extra-heavy</b> oil, about twice the volume of the world's reserves of conventional oil.|$|E
