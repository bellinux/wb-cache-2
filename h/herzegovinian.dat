5|$|On 4–5 October the Chetniks {{crossed the}} Neretva River in Konjic and headed, {{as did the}} Italians, towards Prozor, Šćit, Gornji Vakuf, Donji Vakuf, and on to Bugojno, Komar, and Travnik where the {{headquarters}} of the 5th Montenegrin and the 10th <b>Herzegovinian</b> Partisan brigades were situated. The offensive took place from three directions with light and heavy artillery and a large number of tanks and trucks converging. Three battalions of the 10th <b>Herzegovinian</b> Brigade intended to assemble near Prozor, but withdrew and escaped on 6 October before the arrival of the Italian–Chetnik forces. The Partisan battalions estimated that 1,200–1,500 soldiers of the Italian army and about 3,000–3,500 Chetniks were approaching, while they had a little over 300 men, a ratio of approximately 1:15.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Belgrade on 20 October 1944, Mihailović and a force {{of a few hundred}} of his Chetniks withdrew from Serbian territory, crossed the Drina and based {{themselves}} in the Majevica mountain area north of Tuzla in north-eastern Bosnia. Ostojić, who was commanding <b>Herzegovinian</b> Chetniks, was joined by Đurišić and his Montenegrin Chetniks and together they withdrew towards Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were {{under the impression that}} the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta {{was under the impression that}} Jevđević represented the <b>Herzegovinian</b> Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the <b>Herzegovinian</b> Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E
50|$|In March 1852, Ottoman general Omar Pasha {{decided to}} disarm the <b>Herzegovinians,</b> which sparked an outrage in the region. The {{chieftain}} of the <b>Herzegovinians</b> was Luka Vukalović.

5|$|Detailed {{planning}} and orders for Operation Trio were finalised {{at a conference}} in Ljubljana on 28–29 March 1942. Laxa, General Mario Roatta (the commander of the Italian Second Army), and General der Artillerie Paul Bader (the commander of German forces in the NDH) negotiated a compromise permitting temporary non-political agreements to be concluded with the <b>Herzegovinian</b> Chetniks, led by Dobroslav Jevđević, but not with any of the Bosnian Chetnik groups, whose leaders were Petar Baćović in the area of Foča and Jezdimir Dangić, who was aligned with the Serb collaborationist Milan Nedić.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović did not assign titles to his works, as he {{felt that}} if a {{painting}} was well composed viewers {{would be able to}} deduce the title themselves. Thus, the majority of the artist's works are referred to by a number of different titles.

5|$|On 22 and 23 July 1942, Mihailović held {{a conference}} at Zimonjić Kula, near Avtovac in eastern Herzegovina, which was {{attended}} by Trifunović-Birčanin, Đurišić, Jevđević, Zaharije Ostojić, Radovan Ivanišević, Milan Santić {{and a group of}} Chetnik commanders from Herzegovina. The purpose of the meeting was to establish co-operation between the <b>Herzegovinian</b> and Montenegrin Chetnik leaders. Baćović was appointed as the Chetnik commander for eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, replacing Boško Todorović, who had been captured and executed by the Partisans in late February 1942. Trifunović-Birčanin was appointed the Chetnik commander for Dalmatia, Lika and western Bosnia.|$|E
25|$|According to some, a Bosnian can {{be anyone}} who holds {{citizenship}} {{of the state}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thus is largely synonymous with the all-encompassing national demonym Bosnians and <b>Herzegovinians.</b> This includes, but is not limited to, members of the constituent ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats. Those who reside in the smaller geographical region of Herzegovina usually prefer to identify as <b>Herzegovinians.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{plan that}} Ostojić drew up {{called for the}} Chetniks to remain south of the Neretva to avoid being outflanked by the Partisans. However, this {{essentially}} defensive strategy was rejected by <b>Herzegovinian</b> Chetnik commanders such as Dobroslav Jevđević and Bajo Stanišić, who wished to follow the Axis-led offensive strategy. This placed Ostojić {{in a very difficult}} position, with some of his key detachment commanders following the orders of the Italians rather than his, while the Chetniks were reliant on Italian air and artillery support, particularly around Jablanica. Ostojić subsequently changed his mind and supported the Italian offensive plans, launching an attack against the Partisans retreating from Jablanica to Prozor on 27 February 1943. The attack was indecisive and Ostojić reprimanded the detachment commanders responsible, particularly Stanišić.|$|E
5|$|Planning for Operation Trio and the {{associated}} Operation West-Bosnien in the Bosanska Krajina occurred during two Axis conferences in March 1942. During the initial conference at Opatija on 2–3 March, the NDH Chief of the General Staff Vladimir Laxa objected to an Italian proposal to involve the Bosnian and <b>Herzegovinian</b> Chetniks in the planned operations, and {{with the support of}} the Germans, this idea was initially shelved. Operation Trio was to be one of a series of counter-insurgency operations planned for eastern Bosnia, Herzegovina, Sandžak, Montenegro, western Bosnia and Lika. Despite this, the only operations that were actually conducted between March and June 1942 were Operation Trio, and a combined Italian-Montenegrin Chetnik offensive in Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina which is also associated with the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography.|$|E
5|$|They fought alone, or in bands {{composed}} of {{individuals from the}} same area. Thus {{it was thought that}} the zduhaći from eastern Bosnia fought together against those from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The zduhaći from Sandžak fought jointly against the Albanian zduhaći. On the Adriatic coast, battles were waged between a band of zduhaći from Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and northern Albania on one side, and a band of zduhaći from Apulia in southeast Italy on the other side. The latter were also called the transmarine zduhaći, as Apulia is situated across the Adriatic Sea from Montenegro. Each band had its leader. A man named Mato Glušac (1774–1870), from the village of Korita in Herzegovina, was reputed the supreme commander of the <b>Herzegovinian</b> and Montenegrin zduhaći; he was also a famous seer.|$|E

50|$|Perlič (also spelt Perlich or Perlitch) is a South Slavic surname that {{is common}} among Serbians, Croatians, Bosnians, <b>Herzegovinians,</b> and Montenegrins. It {{is from the}} South Slavic word perla which {{is a person who}} is small and/or highly valued.|$|R
25|$|The {{national}} language of Montenegro has historically and traditionally been called Serbian. According to Pavle Ivić, two sub-dialects of the Shtokavian dialect (of the Serbian language) were spoken in Montenegro: the Eastern <b>Herzegovinian</b> dialect and Zeta-South Sanjak dialect. The Eastern <b>Herzegovinian</b> dialect is spoken in Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Today, the national standard {{is based on}} the Zeta-South Sanjak dialect.|$|E
25|$|Despite winning several notable victories, {{the rebels}} were {{eventually}} defeated {{in a battle}} near Sarajevo in 1832. Internal discord contributed {{to the failure of}} the rebellion, because Gradaščević was not supported by much of the <b>Herzegovinian</b> nobility.|$|E
25|$|The Porte's {{efforts at}} modernizing the Ottoman state {{were met with}} great hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the {{proposed}} reforms. This, combined with frustrations over political concessions to nascent Christian states in the east, culminated in a famous (albeit ultimately unsuccessful) revolt by Husein Gradaščević in 1831. Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Later, agrarian unrest eventually sparked the <b>Herzegovinian</b> rebellion, a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, which eventually forced the Ottomans to cede administration {{of the country to}} Austria-Hungary through the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.|$|E
25|$|Ethnic {{minorities}} in this territory, such as Jews, Roma, Albanians, Montenegrins and others, may consider Bosnian as an adjective modifying their ethnicity (e.g. Bosnian Roma) to indicate place of residence. Other times they use (with equal rights) the term <b>Herzegovinians.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} Serbs who {{immigrated to the}} United States is {{difficult}} to determine as Serb immigrants were often variously classified by their country of origin, thus as Turks, Bulgarians, Croats, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Dalmatians, Bosnians, <b>Herzegovinians</b> and Austro-Hungarians. In the 1910 census, there were 16,676 Serbs from Austria-Hungary, 4,321 from Serbia, and 3,724 from Montenegro.|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms were {{analyzed}} in of 1, 610 randomly chosen adult men from 11 different regions from southeastern Europe (Croatians, Bosnians and <b>Herzegovinians,</b> Serbians, Macedonians and Macedonian Romani). MtDNA HVS-I region together with RFLP sites diagnostic for main Euroasian and African mtDNA haplogroups were typed to determine haplogroup frequency distribution. The most frequent haplogroup in studied populations was H {{with the exception}} of Macedonian Romani among whom the most frequent were South Asian (Indian) specific variants of haplogroup M. The multidimensional scaling plot showed two clusters of populations and two outliers (Macedonian Romani and the most distant from mainland Croatian island of Korčula). The first cluster was formed by populations from three Croatian islands (Hvar, Krk and Brač) and the second cluster was formed by Macedonians, Serbians, Croatians from mainland and coast, <b>Herzegovinians,</b> Bosnians, Slovenians, Poles and Russians. The present analysis does not address a precise evaluation of phylogenetic relations of studied populations although some conclusions about historical migrations could be noticed. More extended conclusions will be possible after deeper phylogenetic and statistical analyses...|$|R
25|$|After the {{creation}} of a multiparty system in Serbia, Milošević and his political allies in Serbia elsewhere in Yugoslavia pushed for {{the creation}} of a democratic multiparty system of government at the federal level, such as Serbian state media appealing to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina in early 1992 with the promise that Bosnia and Herzegovina could peacefully coexist in a democratic Yugoslav federation alongside the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Outside of the Serb population, the remainder of Bosnian and <b>Herzegovinian</b> population voted in favour of secession. In the aftermath, Serbia and Montenegro agreed to create the new Yugoslav federation called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, which dismantled the remaining communist infrastructure and created a federal democratic multiparty system of government.|$|E
25|$|During {{the war in}} Croatia, arms {{had been}} pouring into the country. The JNA armed Bosnian Serbs and the Croatian Defence Force the <b>Herzegovinian</b> Croats. The Bosnian Muslim Green Berets and Patriotic League were {{established}} already in fall 1991, and drew up a defense plan in February 1992. It was estimated that 250–300,000 Bosnians were armed, and that some 10,000 were fighting in Croatia. By March 1992, perhaps {{three quarters of the}} country were claimed by Serb and Croat nationalists. On 4 April 1992, when Izetbegović ordered all reservists and police in Sarajevo to mobilize, and SDS called for evacuation of the city's Serbs, came the 'definite rupture between the Bosnian government and Serbs'. Bosnia and Herzegovina received international recognition on 6 April 1992. The most common view is that the war started that day.|$|E
25|$|The final {{battle was}} {{played out on}} 4 June at Stup, a small {{locality}} on the road between Sarajevo and Ilidža. After a long, intense battle, it seemed Gradaščević had once again defeated the Sultan's army. Near the very end, however, <b>Herzegovinian</b> troops {{under the command of}} Ali-paša Rizvanbegović and Smail-aga Čengić broke through defenses Gradaščević had set up on his flank and joined the fighting. Overwhelmed by the unexpected attack from behind, the rebel army was forced to retreat into the city of Sarajevo itself. It was decided that further military resistance would be futile. Gradaščević fled to Gradačac as the imperial army entered the city on 5 June and prepared to march on Travnik. Upon realizing the difficulties that his home and family would experience if he stayed there, Gradaščević decided to leave Gradačac and continue on to Austrian lands instead.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} team coached by Safet Sušić reached their second consecutive play-off berth during qualification for the UEFA Euro 2012 {{as they were}} unable to beat France national football team in Paris to qualify directly. The Bosnians and <b>Herzegovinians</b> had to win the game to top Group D and qualify for the tournament. Edin Džeko scored and they led 0-1 until the 77th minute when Scottish referee Craig Thomson awarded a penalty to France. The French leveled the game which meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina finished second, one point behind France.|$|R

25|$|Balassa sent a copy to Stratimirović recommending the book, and the {{metropolitan}} informed the eparchies under his jurisdiction about its publication. It {{was bought by}} students, priests, scholars, merchants, and other people, mostly in Vienna, Budapest, Novi Sad, Osijek, and Oradea, where Avramović was the district inspector for Serbian and Romanian schools from 1792 {{until his death in}} 1806. In 1792, Stefan Novaković bought Kurzbeck's Cyrillic press and warehouse of books. When he sold them to the Pest University Press in 1795, there were 360 unsold copies of the Avramović Dictionary in the warehouse. The book was listed in the university's sale catalogues until 1829. It was part of the library of Sava Tekelija, who wrote additional entries in his copy. The first edition of Vuk Karadžić's Serbian Dictionary appeared in 1818 as the first book in modern literary Serbian, based on the Eastern <b>Herzegovinian</b> dialect. There are indications that Karadžić used the Avramović Dictionary as a source for his work.|$|E
25|$|Hrabak was {{the first}} scholar to connect the {{historical}} documents and their relation to the persons mentioned on rare inscriptions on the stećci. In 1953 he concluded that the smith-stonemason Grubač from Boljun necropolis near Stolac built stećak of Bogavac Tarah Bol(j)unović not later than 1477, and {{that most of the}} monuments of <b>Herzegovinian</b> Vlachs, and not only Herzegovian and not only Vlachs, could be dated to {{the second half of the}} 15th century. Wenzel in one of her studies researched sixteen stećci with similar dating and historically known persons. She noted the possibility that initially the stone monuments as such could have been introduced by the feudal nobility in the mid 14th century, which tradition was embraced by the Vlach tribes who introduced figural decoration. The termination of the stećci production Wenzel related to the Ottoman invasion and new social circumstances, with the transition of Vlachs and near Slavs to Islam resulting with loss of tribal organization and characteristics of specific ethnic identity.|$|E
25|$|Smaïl-aga's {{contribution}} to the Ottoman victory at Grahovo {{was so great that}} the Porte had granted him a personal fiefdom that stretched from Gacko to Kolašin and was larger than all the Montenegrin-held territories combined. These land acquisitions were met with much trepidation by Smaïl-aga's fellow beys, who feared that his rise would threaten their hold on power. In 1839, Serbia's Prince Miloš sent a letter to Ali Pasha informing him that Smaïl-aga would conspire with the Porte to have him removed as vizier of Herzegovina. Ali Pasha promptly wrote to Njegoš, asking that he arrange for Smaïl-aga's murder. He felt that Njegoš—who held Smaïl-aga primarily responsible for the slaughter at Grahovo—would be enthusiastic about the prospect of avenging his kinsmen. Ali Pasha also reasoned that by allowing the Montenegrins to kill the ambitious <b>Herzegovinian</b> bey he would be deflecting suspicion from himself, as the Montenegrins had more than enough reason to want Smaïl-aga dead. In mid-1839, Njegoš began exchanging letters with Smaïl-aga. The letters made it seem that he had forgiven Smaïl-aga for the deaths, and were meant to lull him into a false sense of security.|$|E
50|$|However, Jukić's {{national}} belonging {{was always}} and primarily defined as Bosnian (he regularly wrote under the pseudonym of Slavoljub Bošnjak (Slavophile Bosniak), {{and in such}} a way so as to include all ethnic and denominational groups inhabiting this space. The only other cultural identity he recognised was Illyrian, as a cultural supra-identity of all South Slavs, however, he never saw the future or destiny of Bosnia as anything else but its national and organisational unity and independence. Until his death, no other idea of collective cultural identity of Bosniaks and <b>Herzegovinians</b> had a more significant presence or a more significant advocate.|$|R
50|$|Despite poor start, Bosnia had {{a chance}} to top their Euro 2004 {{qualifying}} group with a victory on the last match-day. Blaž Slišković's men started the qualifying campaign with two losses, home to Romania and away to Norway in Oslo. The following year, team beat Luxembourg and came out with a 2-0 win versus Denmark in Copenhagen. Romania however proved too strong once again for the Bosnians and <b>Herzegovinians,</b> scoring once in each half to prevail in Craiova. In September 2003 Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to Zlatan Bajramović's 87th-minute strike, beat Norwegians in Zenica. This followed with a victory over Luxembourg. Bosnia and Herzegovina climbed to third on the table with 12 points, and {{had a chance}} to top the group with a win over Denmark in Sarajevo. However, the game finished in a heartbreaking 1-1 home draw for the home side who had to settle for a fourth-place finish instead.|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the ethnic Macedonian identity arose from the writings of Georgi Pulevski, who identified {{the existence of a}} distinct modern [...] "Macedonian" [...] language and nation. Pulevski summarized the folk histories of the Macedonian people and concluded that the Macedonians were descendants of the Ancient Macedonians. This opinion was based on the claim that the ancient Macedonian language had Slavic components in it, and thus, the ancient Macedonians were Slavic, and that modern Macedonians were descendants of them. However his Macedonian self-identification was ambiguous. Pulevski viewed Macedonian identity as being a regional phenomenon, similar to <b>Herzegovinians</b> and Thracians. He also sometimes described himself as a [...] "Serbian patriot", but he also viewed his ethnic designation as [...] "Bulgarian from the village of Galičnik". Pulevski's different identifications actually revealed the absence of a clear ethnic identity among part of the local Macedonian population at that time.|$|R
