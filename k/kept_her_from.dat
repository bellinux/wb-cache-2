When Albert {{decided to return}} to Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.|$|E

Life saving crews from the Coast Guard Stations at Blue Point, Lone Hill and Bellport were able to rescue much of her crew from the wreck using {{breeches}} buoys on the first day. Salvage operations began almost immediately by men and tugs from the Merritt Wrecking Company, which likely <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> breaking up during a storm that swept waves in over the deck and pushed her farther inland. At the first break in the storm the remaining crew, and one small Spanish pony, were rescued. After her cargo was removed, she was refloated on 26 February and towed to New York.|$|E
500|$|During the {{remainder}} of her assignment at Queenstown, Winslow attacked two more submarines, the first on 11 October and the second on 3 January 1918. In both cases, she depth-charged oil slicks which appeared to originate from damaged, submerged U-boats. In neither case did she receive visible confirmation of a sinking; however, during the 3 January attack, one of her depth charges threw a large mass of dark liquid high in the air.

500|$|William McGurk {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} Contemporary Psychology. Although McGurk praises the book's description of the est seminars, noting that it [...] "present {{a clear picture of}} the process", he also criticizes Fenwick's subsequent analysis, saying she [...] "sounds like a different person" [...] than in the first section. [...] McGurk writes that [...] "It's as though she put on her psychoanalytically oriented, professional hat and ran a tape that was far from being effective." [...] A review in Publishers Weekly states that Fenwick's [...] "inbred detachment may have <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> the full impact of the 'experience' the training was meant to be (and is for many)". [...] Even so, the review notes that Fenwick [...] "scores heavily" [...] in the section where she questions the nature of the est training and Erhard's background; it recommends that Getting It be read alongside Luke Rhinehart's The Book of est.|$|E
500|$|Stanton's mother, Margaret Livingston Cady, a {{descendant}} of early Dutch settlers, {{was the daughter of}} Colonel James Livingston, an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Having fought at Saratoga and Quebec, Livingston assisted in the capture of Major John Andre at West Point, New York where Andre and Benedict Arnold, who escaped aboard the HMS Vulture, were planning to turn West Point over to the English. Margaret Cady, an unusually tall woman for her time, had a commanding presence, and Stanton routinely described her mother as [...] "queenly." [...] While Stanton's daughter, Harriot Stanton Blatch, remembers her grandmother as being fun, affectionate, and lively, Stanton herself did not apparently share such memories. Emotionally devastated by the loss of so many children, Margaret Cady fell into a depression, which <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> being fully involved in the lives of her surviving children and left a maternal void in Stanton's childhood.|$|E

500|$|Little {{was heard}} from Katsura {{for many years}} after the 1961 world championship. McGoorty lamented her retirement, stating various {{theories}} {{that he had heard}} bandied about in billiard circles, such as that her husband (who died in June 1967) <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> playing for various reasons. In 1976 Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco. She borrowed a cue from someone present and proceeded to run 100 points at straight rail without problem. Prolific pool and billiard author Robert Byrne wrote that after Katsura finished that 100-point run, [...] "without a miss she smiled and bowed to the applauding crowd, stepping away from the spotlight, and disappeared forever from the American billiard stage." [...] Katsura returned to Japan in or about 1990 to live with her sister, Noriko, where she said she planned to live out her days. Katsura died in 1995. In September 2002 a memorial tournament for Katsura, billed as Katsura Memorial: The First Ladies Three Cushion Grandprix, was held in Japan and aired on SKY PerfecTV! ...|$|E

In 191314, she frequently patrolled the coast of Mexico to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution, and in April 1914 she took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, South Carolina trained sailors for the rapidly expanding wartime navy, and in late 1918, she was assigned to convoy escort duty.

In 1919, she made four trips [...] to bring American soldiers back from Europe. Midshipmen training cruises followed in 1920–21, but the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 cut her career short. She was broken up for scrap as part of the arms limitation treaty, starting in mid-1924.|$|E

While recuperating in her hospital room at Roosevelt Hospital she said, [...] "other than my bruises and my black and blues I feel fine". Although able to sing Brünnhilde for the first two performances with her arm in a sling, her injury caused her to miss subsequent performances, including that season's Götterdämmerung broadcast.

He testified that he took the dog into his home where it became more agitated. Boztepe took the dog for a walk at approximately 12:00 midnight and testified that the dog tugged on its leash and led him to Nicole's house. There he discovered Nicole Simpson's dead body. Minutes later, Boztepe flagged down a passing patrol car.|$|E

Norwood eventually decided to scrap most of the project, and instead enlisted producer Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean's Simple Girl album, as the album's main contributor. Impressed by Timbaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on Full Moon and its technical priority.|$|E
