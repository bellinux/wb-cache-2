25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E
500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. So you could give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then come to you later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?' It just isn't capable of doing that by design." ...|$|E
500|$|Joined on Anaheim's {{blueline}} by Chris Pronger, Niedermayer {{helped the}} Ducks set franchise records in 2006–07 for most wins (48) and points (110). Both were named finalists for the Norris Trophy, but lost to Detroit's Nicklas Lidström. Individually, Niedermayer played his 1,000th career game, against the Edmonton Oilers on November 28, 2006. He set career highs of 15 goals, 54 assists and 69 points {{during the regular}} season and was named a First Team All-Star. He added 11 points in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs, and was named recipient of the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player of the post-season after leading Anaheim to the franchise's first championship in a five-game series victory over the Ottawa Senators in the final. As team captain, Niedermayer was the first player given the chance to hoist the Stanley Cup. He passed the trophy to his brother; it was Rob's first championship victory. Of the moment, Scott stated: [...] "You don't really dream of passing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> brother. I never have. To {{be able to do that}} is definitely a highlight of my career." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} have found less to favor in Smith's second book, Court Duel, though reviews have still been mainly positive. It was noted by Carolyn Phelan of Booklist to be [...] "different in setting, structure, and tone" [...] from its predecessor, {{who added that}} [...] "readers who loved Crown Duel for its strongly realized fantasy world, adventurous characters, and scenes of action may find the sequel disappointing," [...] though she found Meliara to be [...] "as compelling as ever." [...] Ruth Cox of Emergency Librarian observed [...] "a flicker of the love/hate relationship often found in adult romance novels between Meliara and Shevraeth." [...] Contributing to Brigham Young's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson called the second part [...] "fast paced and intriguing," [...] and said it could [...] "stand on its own as an enthralling story." [...] Jo Walton believed that the second story's changing fashions and fan customs were [...] "done very well," [...] and added that the court's culture of terror felt real. She opined that [...] "Mel's eruption into their midst has in it something of the stranger coming to Versailles, and it's fascinating," [...] but called [...] "Mel's continued obliviousness to the identity of her mysterious Unknown correspondent" [...] "slightly implausible." [...] Walton concluded that the combined volume Crown Duel is [...] "a charming book with a solid background and a great first person voice. Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> twelve year old friends, and read it with your inner twelve-year-old eyes." [...] The publication Voice of Youth Advocates included Crown Duel in its list of [...] "fantasy for people who don't like fantasy," [...] and wrote that the novel [...] "ha few fantastical creatures, and readers will relate easily to the main characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|On release, Is This What You Want? {{received}} enthusiastic reviews. In a 1970 {{interview with}} Robert Greenfield of Rolling Stone, however, Lomax lamented that commentators {{tended to focus}} on the line-up of superstar backing musicians, saying, [...] "they're always talkin' about who's on the album and not the album itself." [...] Writing in ZigZag in July 1974, Andy Childs advised the magazine's readers: [...] "it's worth its weight in gold, so if it's absent from your collection, add <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> shopping list of second-hand records."

2500|$|..... {{it ought}} to be the {{happiness}} and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> opinion.|$|E

2500|$|One of the band's most {{striking}} aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals. In the book Check the Technique, B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is [...] "high and annoying... the nasal style I have {{was just something}} that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's ears" [...] {{and talking about the}} nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, [...] "you want to stand out from the others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> advantage." [...] In the film Art of Rap, B-Real credits the Beastie Boys as an influence when developing his rapping style. Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding another background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, [...] "Sen's voice is so strong," [...] and [...] "it all blends together" [...] when they are both on the same track.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{praised the}} overall gameplay. [...] Brandon Justice of IGN said, [...] "I can't stress enough how addictive this game is." [...] Of the Dreamcast port Game Revolution's reviewer stated [...] "a great arcade game became {{a good home}} game." [...] They further noted the game's high difficulty, and added that while the game was difficult it was not frustrating. [...] Michael Goncalves of PALGN added that the game was either a [...] "love or hate" [...] title, adding [...] "if you love it, you will cherish the game and play <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> hearts content." [...] Goncalves {{also pointed out that}} the game featured occasional pop up and clipping. [...] Reviews were split across the releases in regards to the game's soundtrack. PALGN cited Bad Religion and The Offspring as a high point of the game, while Game Revolution felt that the tracks were repetitive. GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann felt that the soundtrack was subjective to personal preference, stating [...] "you'll either want to crank the volume up or turn the music all the way down." [...] In a review for the PC version's altered soundtrack, fellow GameSpot reviewer Andrew Park felt that the new music was fitting for the game. However, they criticized the PC version for frame rate issues and recommended the Dreamcast version instead.|$|E
