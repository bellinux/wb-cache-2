5|$|Because of {{its design}} focus on player choice, Deus Ex has been {{compared}} with System Shock, a game that inspired its design. Together, these factors give the game a great degree of replayability, as the player will have vastly <b>different</b> <b>experiences,</b> depending on which methods he or she uses to accomplish objectives.|$|E

5|$|Theme park guests {{may use the}} Hogwarts Express {{to travel}} between Hogsmeade and King's Cross in London, close to Diagon Alley. They can travel in either {{direction}} {{as long as the}} guest has purchased a Park-to-Park ticket, which gives guests access to both of Universal Orlando's theme parks within the same day. Two <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> are provided depending on the destination of the train, both of which are approximately four minutes long.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rates}} of the leading causes of death, {{cardiovascular}} disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have <b>different</b> <b>experiences.</b> Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, {{and is one of the}} more important chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually transmitted disease. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E

Some say that women were and are completely equal to men on the kibbutz while others insist there has always been inequality.|$|E
25|$|Xtra's {{original}} {{web portal}} opened in 1996 and offered two <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> - XWorld and Text World. Later, XVille was also introduced. You could choose which version of Xtra you visited using a front screen called Xtra Theme Park. XWorld was a virtual world {{where you could}} click on virtual buildings to perform functions (such as searching via Yahoo!). Text World was a simpler interface using just text for slower modems.|$|E
25|$|Although {{bilateral}} {{activation of}} the brain has been seen with unilateral stimulation (accomplished by placing a stimulus under one nostril only), the activation seen is not exactly equal in both hemispheres. Different {{parts of the brain}} are involved in olfactory memory, depending on what type of memory is being processed (e.g. implicit memory-habituation or explicit memory-recognition) and this is evident in the results of explicit and implicit tasks of memory. Studies have shown that the left hemisphere is activated during verbal semantic retrieval of odor-related memories, while the right hemisphere shows activation during non-verbal retrieval of semantic odor-related information. Much overlap does occur between regions, however. Information of odors of a semantic nature is distributed across both sides of the brain, although the right hemisphere is more involved in the processing of odor quality and previous encounter of the stimulus than the left. Neural plasticity is also an important part of olfaction, as <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> may result in alterations of both cortical and subcortical circuitry in the brain.|$|E

25|$|Owners and {{occupants}} of colonial shophouse in Malaysia underwent <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> involving {{a series of}} rent control legislation put in place between 1956 and 1966. Under the most recent 1966 Control of Rent Act, privately owned buildings constructed before 1948, including scores of shophouses, were subjected to rent price controls to alleviate housing shortages, {{with the intent of}} providing the increasingly urbanised population with sufficient affordable housing. In the decades following the introduction of the Act in 1966, development of sites that the shophouses rest on were often unprofitable due to poor rental takings, leading to historical urban districts stagnating but being effectively preserved, although entire blocks of shophouses were known to be demolished {{for a variety of reasons}} during the upsurge of the economy (from government acquisitions to destruction from fires). With the repeal of the act in 1997, landowners were eventually granted authority to determine rent levels and be enticed to develop or sell off pre-1948 shophouses; as a result, poorer tenants were priced out and many of the buildings were extensively altered or demolished for redevelopment over the course of the 2000s and 2010s. Shophouses have also been documented to be illegally sealed for use to cultivate and harvest edible bird's nests, leading to long-term internal damage of the buildings.|$|E
500|$|The attraction, {{which was}} {{manufactured}} by the Doppelmayr Garaventa Group, is operated with two {{replicas of the}} Hogwarts Express. [...] The two directions of travel provide two <b>different</b> <b>experiences.</b> Because the trains transport guests between stations in two separate theme parks, riders must have an admission pass valid for both theme parks, with ticket inspectors checking prior to boarding.|$|E
500|$|Another {{theme in}} the series {{is the use of}} {{identical}} people {{as a result of the}} characters travelling to parallel worlds where they find alternative versions of people they met before. Despite sharing the same physical appearances, these identical versions have been through <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> earning their own identities. Syaoran also has his own doppelgänger commonly referred as [...] "The Other Syaoran" [...] who at the same time shares the same identity as the protagonist from xxxHolic, Kimihiro Watanuki. Across the series, these character are developed and choose their own paths to earn their own identities.|$|E

500|$|Ed O'Brien {{described}} the lyrics, saying [...] "They were universal. There wasn't a political agenda. It's being human." [...] The song [...] "Bodysnatchers" [...] {{is inspired by}} Victorian ghost stories, the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke's feeling of [...] "your physical consciousness trapped {{without being able to}} connect fully with anything else." [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] is about a set of observations and <b>different</b> <b>experiences,</b> partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used {{to go out on the}} weekend in Oxford. Yorke said [...] "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|E
500|$|According to {{academic}} Derek Royal, Jewish ethnicity is prominent throughout the stories; in [...] "A Contract with God" [...] and [...] "Cookalein", {{religious and cultural}} Jewish symbolry are prominent, though in the middle two stories, there is little outward evidence of the characters' Jewishness. [...] The two outer stories further emphasize Jewish identity with the extra-urban portions of their settings—the rural Russian origin of the religious Hersh in [...] "Contract", and the Catskill mountains in [...] "Cookalein", a retreat commonly associated with Jews in the 20th century. [...] Eisner deals with representing Jewish identity through community. [...] He juxtaposes individual stories and individual characters, who have <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> which may be incompatible with one another; this confounds any single definition of [...] "Jewishness", {{though there is a}} communal sense that binds these characters and their Jewishness together. [...] Royal argues that Eisner shows the unresolved nature of American identity, in which ethnicities are conflicted between cultural assimilation and their ethnic associations. [...] As the book progresses, the characters move from overt Jewishness to greater levels of assimilation, presented as an ambivalent change that has costs of its own.|$|E
50|$|Ramanujacharya had {{a totally}} <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> than Shankaracharya. During {{the time of}} Ramanuja, {{followers}} of Advaitha tradition in Tamil Nadu had distorted the teachings of Shankaracharya so much that Ramanuja started correcting them.|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the position of}} Alevi identity and Alevi community {{with regard to the}} Turkish national identity-building project. There was a partial compatibility between the Kemalist objective of laicization and nation building and the Alevi practice and understanding of a ‘local’ version of ‘Turkish Islam’. Besides these compatibilities, Alevis faced the challenges of nation-building and homogenization policies, which involved homogenization in ethnic, religious and sectarian domains. Kurmanji- and Zazaki-speaking ethnically Kurdish/Zaza Alevis of Eastern Anatolia had a <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> during the project of centralization and ethnic homogenization, in comparison to Turkish-speaking Turcoman Alevis. This <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> still is a source of division among Alevi communities...|$|R
500|$|Ubisoft {{promised that}} Far Cry 4 would {{have much more}} of a {{multiplayer}} element than Far Cry 3. Some elements that were scrapped for Far Cry 3 due to time constraints were featured in Far Cry 4, such as the [...] "Guns for Hire" [...] co-operative multiplayer mode. Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting {{from the beginning of the}} game's development. Originally intended to be a separate mode, it was later made to be seamlessly integrated into the main campaign. The game's competitive multiplayer was designed to give players freedom, allowing players to progress and defeat enemies through a variety of different ways. Red Storm Entertainment also considered players' feedback from the multiplayer aspect of Far Cry 3, and decided to include vehicles to the game. The company chose an asymmetrical structure for the match, so that players could have <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> in different matches, as well as to make matches feel more chaotic. The developers originally planned to feature female playable characters, but the plan was scrapped due to animation problems. Ubisoft announced a 'Keys to Kyrat' offer for players that owned a copy of the game for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4. It allows those owners to send out game keys to up to ten other people who do not own a copy of the game. Players who are offered a key can join the person that sent them the key and play the co-operative mode for two hours.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Davidson found Haywood in his office, {{playing the}} {{keyboard}} part which was later revived for the song's riff. [...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, I kept going back, saying, 'Man, there's something about what you were playing earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.' So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something [...] special.' We started talking about that and going back and forth with [...] <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> when we wrote the song." [...] The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher, with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew Bazinet. The B-side track, [...] "Bottle Up Lightning", was written by Kelley, Haywood, Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley.|$|E
500|$|Spec Ops: The Line {{includes}} several choices for players to make. According to Williams, {{it was a}} key concept to be featured {{right from the start}} of the game's development. The game does not feature a morality system, but instead has situations that give players some freedom of choice. The consequences of some of these choices were deliberately made unclear in an attempt to make them more realistic, encouraging players to explore the other potential options not directly presented by the game. These choices were inspired by Fallout 3, and are often between: [...] "what the character knows and what the player would maybe try and do". To make choices more realistic, and to increase the impact of the story, the team put in a lot of morally ambiguous choices and [...] "bad or worse" [...] decisions. Williams added that absolute good choices are not practical and sometimes may not exist in real-world situations, so to reflect that combat sequences sometimes force players to make split-second decisions and accept whatever the consequences are. According to Williams, this is something that people frequently do in real-world scenarios, and they must [...] "live with it" [...] after their decision. Williams added that they hoped that the game's players would have different feelings after making these choices, as this would show that they had created an opportunity for players to examine their own inner emotions, and that they had successfully provided <b>different</b> <b>experiences</b> for players without having a branching storyline. Replay value was also considered when the development team was designing these choices.|$|E
