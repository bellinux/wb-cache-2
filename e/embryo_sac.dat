5|$|Gynoecium : Superior ovary (hypogynous), syncarpous (with fused carpels), {{with three}} connate (fused) carpels and is trilocular (three locules, or chambers) or unilocular (single locule, as in Scoliopus and Medeola). There {{is a single}} style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less {{elongated}} along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The <b>embryo</b> <b>sac</b> (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria). Embryo sacs in which {{three of the four}} megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus, are referred to as Fritillaria-type, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the <b>embryo</b> <b>sac</b> type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The <b>embryo</b> <b>sac</b> is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
40|$|At each of 17 {{collecting}} points between Johannesburg and Brits in the Transvaal, three plants which {{belong to}} the  Eragrostis curvula Complex were collected and studied.

40|$|Twenty <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> {{from each}} of 20 different  Lantana camara L. cultivars {{naturalized}} in South Africa were examined. The normal sexual <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> were monosporic 8 -nucleated <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> of the polygonum type and were encountered in 55 % of the material examined. Several deviations from this pattern were recorded. Occasionally one of the nuclei failed to develop into a synergid, resulting in three polar nuclei. Contrary to published information, the antipodal cells did not increase in size, nor was there {{an increase in the}} number of nuclei per cell. Although the occurrence of sexuality is confirmed, no definite evidence exists for the occurrence of apomixis. The occurrence of two <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> per locule might be the result of either apospory or of sexuality whereby two <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> were formed from two megaspores. </p...|$|R
25|$|Late-acting {{self-incompatibility}} (LSI) is also termed ovarian self-incompatibility (OSI). In this mechanism, self pollen germinates {{and reaches}} the ovules, but no fruit is set. LSI can be pre-zygotic (e.g. {{deterioration of the}} <b>embryo</b> <b>sac</b> prior to pollen tube entry, as in Narcissus triandrus) or post-zygotic (malformation of the zygote or embryo, as in certain species of Asclepias and in Spathodea campanulata).|$|E
500|$|The {{diversity}} of characteristics complicates description of Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance (see Evolution). The Liliaceae family are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous {{in the case}} of Medeoleae) flowering plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers.

The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is superior, i.e. placed above the attachment of the other parts. There are three fused carpels (syncarpous) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The <b>embryo</b> <b>sac</b> is of the Fritillaria type.

40|$|Apomixis is an asexual mode of {{reproduction}} through the seed {{that results in}} maternal offspring. A female sterile mutant in pearl millet was identified previously as having apomictic characteristics. The objectives {{of this study were}} to observe the cytology of female sterile ovules after pollination to determine possible reasons for sterility and a possible link to the aposporous apomictic developmental process. Cytological examination of 273 ovules revealed that they are small and deformed; 50 % failed to form <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs,</b> and 35 % formed multiple <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs,</b> which indicates the potential for apospory.

40|$|The {{effect of}} auxin {{treatment}} on {{the formation of}} apomictic – endospermless grains in Poa pratensis was investigated in the study. Four Polish cultivars: Skiz, Eska 46, Alicja, Ani as well as six breeding lines: POB 13, SK-W- 33, SKW- 15, SKW- 35 A, SK-W- 35 A and SK-W- 35 B were tested by embryological methods to reveal the reproduction pathway in greenhouse and field conditions. The obtained results showed that four genotypes, i. e. Alicja, Ani, Eska 46 and SK-W- 35 B are facultative apomictic and the other have formed seeds only on the apomictic way. In facultative apomicts {{it was found that}} in many cases both endospermless ovules containing <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> with <b>embryos</b> or <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> with well developed endosperm were formed.

40|$|Mendel used hawkweeds {{and other}} plants to verify the laws of {{inheritance}} he discovered using Pisum. Trait segregation was not evident in hawkweeds because many form seeds asexually by apomixis. Meiosis does not occur during female gametophyte formation and the mitotically formed <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> do not require fertilization for seed development. The resulting progeny retain a maternal genotype. Hawkweeds in Hieracium subgenus Pilosella form mitotic <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> by apospory. The initiation of sexual reproduction is required to stimulate apospory in ovules and to promote {{the function of the}} dominant locus, LOSS OF APOMEIOSIS, which stimulates the differentiation of somatic aposporous initial (AI) cells near sexually programmed cells. As AI cells undergo nuclear mitosis the sexual pathway terminates. The function of the dominant locus LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS in aposporous <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> enables fertilization-independent <b>embryo</b> and endosperm development. Deletion of either locus results in partial reversion to sexual reproduction, and loss of function in both loci results in reversion to sexual development. In these apomicts, sexual reproduction is therefore the default reproductive mode upon which apomixis is superimposed. These loci are unlikely to encode factors critical for sexual reproduction but might recruit the sexual pathway to enable apomixis. Incomplete functional penetrance of these dominant loci is likely to lead to the generation of rare sexual progeny also derived from these facultative apomicts...|$|R
5000|$|Megagametogenesis is the {{development}} of a megaspore into an <b>embryo</b> <b>sac,</b> which is the gametophyte - though a highly reduced one - stage in the life cycle of vascular plants.|$|E
50|$|In {{flowering}} plants, the megagametophyte (also {{referred to}} as the <b>embryo</b> <b>sac)</b> is much smaller and typically consists of only seven cells and eight nuclei. This type of megagametophyte develops from the megaspore through three rounds of mitotic divisions. The cell closest to the micropyle opening of the integuments differentiates into the egg cell, with two synergid cells by its side that are involved in the production of signals that guide the pollen tube. Three antipodal cells form on the opposite (chalazal) end of the ovule and later degenerate. The large central cell of the <b>embryo</b> <b>sac</b> contains two polar nuclei.|$|E

40|$|Many higher eukaryotes {{have evolved}} {{strategies}} for the maternal control of growth and development of their offspring. In higher plants this is achieved in part by postmeiotic gene activity controlling {{the development of the}} haploid female gametophyte. stunter 1 (stt 1) is a novel, recessive, maternal effect mutant in maize that displays viable, miniature kernels. Maternal inheritance of stt 1 results in seeds with reduced but otherwise normal endosperms and embryos. The stt 1 mutation displays reduced transmission through the male and female parents and causes significant changes in the sizes of both male and female gametophytes. stt 1 pollen grains are smaller than wild type, have reduced germination efficiency, and reduced pollen tube growth. stt 1 <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> have smaller central cells and abnormal antipodal cells that are larger, more vacuolated, and fewer in number than wild type. Embryos and endosperms produced by fertilization of stt 1 <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> develop and grow more slowly than wild type. The data suggest that the morphology of mutant <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> influences endosperm development, leading to the production of miniature kernels in stt 1. Analysis of seeds carrying a mutant maternal allele of stt 1 over a deletion of the paternal allele demonstrates that both parental alleles are active after fertilization in both the endosperm and embryo. This analysis also indicates that embryo development until the globular stage in maize can proceed without endosperm development and is likely supported directly by the diploid mother plant...|$|R
40|$|Calcium was {{localized}} in ovules of Plumbago zeylanica from 1 {{day before}} anthesis to 3 days after anthesis using potassium antimonate and {{transmission electron microscopy}} in pollinated and emasculated flowers. At 1 day before anthesis, <b>embryo</b> <b>sacs</b> (containing an egg cell, a central cell and zero to three accessory cells) appear mature and contain abundant calcium precipitates (ppts), in contrast to nucellar cells.

As pollen tubes elongate through ovular tissues, ppts diminish in ovular cells and become concentrated in the pollen tube cell wall. After fertilization? the calcium ppts sharply diminish in fertilized ovules; in unfertilized ovules, calcium ppts remain abundant up to 3 days after anthesis (when unfertilized ovules are shed).
