500|$|In 1972 Larkin {{wrote the}} oft-quoted [...] "Going, Going", a poem which expresses a romantic fatalism in {{its view of}} England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a {{complete}} destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: [...] "And that will be England gone... it will linger on in galleries; but all that remains for us will be concrete and tyres". The poem ends with the blunt statement, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will happen, soon." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Overprotected" [...] was {{directed}} by Billie Woodruff and produced under Geneva Films, while choreographed by Brian Friedman. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2011, Spears recalled the music video, saying, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> says a lot. It was directed so well, it was really colorful and the dancing was amazing". It begins with Spears driving away from the paparazzi, with {{a part of the}} instrumental version of the song [...] "Bombastic Love", featured on the album Britney, playing. She makes her way into an alleyway and decides to enter an abandoned factory, hoping her pursuers will be thrown off course. When she enters the building she begins to dance her way around the warehouse. Britney's dancers, having spotted her walking into the factory, follow her inside. They find Britney dancing around and joke about it, before heading into a heavy dance routine. Towards the end of the video, segments of Spears in a room with walls covered in pictures and articles about herself are also shown. These walls move in and out before the video ends, signifying that she is [...] "overprotected". At the end of the video, Britney walks to a wall, and exits the building.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that [...] "it would be cool {{to be in a}} club, and we're dorky waitresses, and we break out and start dancing." [...] At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her [...] "to the next level". To promote the film Drive Me Crazy, actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, [...] "I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be great for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around." [...] Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she [...] "came to the set completely rehearsed." [...] The music video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special that aired on July 18, 1999.|$|E

2500|$|Point Lookout {{has had a}} {{generally}} positive reception, averaging a 79 for the PC and an 83 for the Xbox 360. Eurogamer stated [...] "Like a compacted version of its parent game, {{this is the first}} DLC that has felt like a genuine expansion, as opposed to a just a few inconsequential missions thrown together." [...] IGN noted that [...] "he stories and characters here are filled with that trademark Fallout dark humor, elevating these quests to a level that rivals the main game" [...] and that [...] "he major draw to Point Lookout... is its emphasis on exploration." [...] Edge calls it [...] "the best expansion so far and the game at its worst," [...] stating [...] "if you want a microcosm of Fallout 3, equal parts adventuring, grinding, questing and scavenging, you might <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> the best expansion so far." [...] Edge goes on to criticize Point Lookout for using [...] "a lot of what you might call 'economy content' in Point Lookout: recycled enemies, text journals, variant weapons, and bogus forks in the storyline." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] I just felt like Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s the day I was born, and each year, I evolve and change with time. It also has {{a whole new meaning}} to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there and I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title was nothing but a homage, “I need for everybody to know that, if it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for me. She was the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E
