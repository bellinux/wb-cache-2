5|$|In 2010, Norman {{became the}} 17th {{city in the}} United States to adopt a council {{resolution}} giving it status as a <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> Town. The resolution states that the city of Norman supports the purchasing of goods from the local community; when goods cannot be purchased locally the city will support buying from producers abroad who meet <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> standards. These standards include supporting {{quality of life in}} developing countries and planning for environmental sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University student {{organizations}} {{include a}} {{diverse array of}} groups focused on social justice issues, including organizations run through both Student Affairs and the Center for Social Justice. Oriented against gender violence, Take Back the Night coordinates an annual rally and march to protest against rape {{and other forms of}} violence against women. Georgetown Solidarity Committee is a workers' rights organization whose successes include ending use of sweatshops in producing Georgetown-logoed apparel, and garnering pay raises for both university cleaning staff and police. Georgetown Students for <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> successfully advocated for all coffee in campus cafeterias to be <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> Certified.|$|E
5|$|Petrossian {{originally}} thought {{to write a}} video treatment about a refugee trying to enter the United States, but knew that the band was going to receive several treatments with the same idea. Instead, he decided to portray {{the plight of the}} refugee from a different angle. The band members unanimously agreed upon Petrossian's treatment. The video deals various themes, including consumerism, <b>fair</b> <b>trade,</b> and sweatshops, and attempts showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations.|$|E

50|$|Following media coverage, the NSW Department of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> became {{involved}} {{and met with}} eBay representatives. The then-Fair Trading Minister John Hatzistergos instructed the Office of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> to investigate the reselling of tickets and determine whether resellers were in breach of the <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> Act.

5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E
5|$|The menu largely {{comprises}} traditional English inspired cuisine, {{and includes}} {{such items as}} burgers, curries, pasta and salads. In drinks, the chain focuses on beer, wine and spirits based cocktails such as the Long Island Ice Tea and mojitos. Some outlets sell cask ale. In 2006 the chain switched to selling exclusively <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee. In 2000, average annual turnover of each site was just below £900,000. Outlets typically occupy around 2,000 square feet in area, and include converted banks and churches.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} does {{significant}} community outreach work. For the past 16 years team members have operated their award-winning International Market. They import and sell {{arts and crafts}} created by struggling indigenous artisans from all across the planet. They {{work closely with the}} <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> Federation to ensure that all of the artists they work with are treated fairly and paid top wages for their creations. The team has sold well over $100,000 worth of arts and crafts. Their efforts keep people in the developing world solvent and ancient art forms alive.|$|E
50|$|On 24 March 2009 {{after the}} reelection of the Bligh Labor Government, the Premier {{announced}} that Lawlor {{would be one}} of eight Members to be promoted to the Cabinet as a Minister. Lawlor was sworn in by the Governor as the Minister for Tourism and <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> on 26 March 2009. The ministerial portfolio of Tourism and <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> holds responsibility for tourism, <b>fair</b> <b>trading,</b> charities, occupational licensing, art unions, Golden Casket, casinos, machine gaming, liquor licensing and racing.|$|R
50|$|Office for <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> (Malta) brings {{together}} the official and independent authorities {{responsible for the}} enforcement of the national and European Union legislation on trade competition as well as on consumer protection in Malta. As such, its scope is wider than the nearly homonymous official bodies like the Office of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> of the United Kingdom and of the states of Australia, which are almost exclusively focused on competition matters, a task undertaken more specifically in Malta by units within the frame of the Office through the Consumer and Competition Division; the Office for Fair Competition and the Commission for <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading.</b> Its director, the Director for Fair Competition, has wide investigatory powers facilitating the collection of evidence. The premises of the Maltese Office for <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> are based in Santa Venera.|$|R

5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a {{tradition}} of political activism. Edmund Burke, MP for the Bristol constituency for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that {{he was a member of}} parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second. Women's-rights advocate Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol, and left-wing politician Tony Benn was MP for Bristol South East in 1950–1960 and 1963–83. In 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott, following the Bristol Omnibus Company's refusal to hire black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act. The 1980 St. Pauls riot protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with the social and economic circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a Fairtrade zone.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} price war caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and <b>fair</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
25|$|World <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> Organization (formerly the International <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> Association) is {{a global}} {{association}} created in 1989 of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national, and regional <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> networks and <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> support organizations. In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products).|$|E

25|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> {{textiles}} {{are primarily}} made from <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> cotton. By 2015, almost 75,000 cotton farmers {{in developing countries}} have obtained Fairtrade certification. The minimum price that <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods. <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> textiles are frequently grouped with <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> products are more likely to pay the premium associated with <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing <b>fair</b> <b>trade,</b> companies are more likely to carry <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> products. Safeway Inc. began carrying <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E
25|$|Large {{transnational}} {{companies have}} begun to use <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> commodities in their products. In April 2000, Starbucks began offering <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee in all of their stores. In 2005, the company promised to purchase ten million pounds of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee over the next 18 months. This would account {{for a quarter of}} the <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee purchases in the United States and 3% of Starbucks' total coffee purchases. The company maintains that increasing its <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> purchases would require an unprofitable reconstruction of the supply chain. <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> activists have made gains with other companies: Sara Lee Corporation in 2002 and Procter & Gamble (the maker of Folgers) in 2003 agreed to begin selling a small amount of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee. Nestlé, the world's biggest coffee trader, began selling a blend of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee in 2005. In 2006, The Hershey Company acquired Dagoba, an organic and <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> chocolate brand.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> school or <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> {{university}} emerged from the United Kingdom, where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order {{to be considered a}} <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> products. They have to learn and educate about <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is {{the most}} {{well-established}} <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> commodity. Most <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> coffee is Coffea arabica, a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put {{on the quality of}} the coffee when dealing in <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> markets because <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers. While initially sold at small scale, currently multinationals like Starbucks and Nestlé use <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> coffee.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> Federation (FTF), {{created in}} 1994, is an {{association}} of Canadian and American <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> wholesalers, importers, and retailers.
