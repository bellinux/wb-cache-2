5|$|On June 8, 1844, after fierce {{partisan}} struggles, the Senate {{rejected the}} Tyler–Texas treaty {{by a vote}} of 35–16, a margin of more than two-to-one. The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted largely in favor (15–8). Nevertheless, the disclosure of the treaty placed the issue of Texas annexation {{at the center of the}} 1844 general election.|$|E

5|$|The 1945 Allied {{conference in}} San Francisco {{established}} the multi-national United Nations (UN) {{for the maintenance}} of world peace, but the enforcement capacity of its Security Council was effectively paralyzed by individual members' ability to use veto power. Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> exclusively as a propaganda tribune.|$|E

5|$|The Treaties of 1823 and 1826, {{although}} fraudulent {{at their}} roots, {{were allowed to}} stand.

5|$|The opera was {{composed}} under severe pressure of time; the composer later {{said that the}} effort of creating <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> killed him.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 30. <b>It</b> <b>almost</b> immediately displayed signs of tropical cyclone formation with the development of deep convection and curved rainbands. Organization continued, and late on August 30 Dvorak classifications began on the system. On August 31, after passing well south of the Cape Verde islands, the system stopped its organization trend. Convection became sporadic, and the system became poorly organized as it moved westward at 20mph (32km). However, environmental conditions remained favorable. On September 1, the cloud pattern became better organized, and a low-level circulation quickly developed. Following an increase in convection and conformation of a low-level circulation by a buoy, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Six late on September 1 while located 1,600miles (2,590km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E

It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified it as part of a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the battle}} began, the Swedish {{flagship}} Kronan sank, taking with <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, Lorentz Creutz. The allied force {{under the leadership of}} the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral Claes Uggla, was surrounded and his flagship Svärdet battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a fire ship. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.|$|E

5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. <b>It</b> <b>almost</b> always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
5|$|The 12th SS Panzer Division (by {{the end of}} {{the battle}} the division's {{infantry}} strength had been reduced to that of a battalion)—claimed over the course of two days to have destroyed 103 British and Canadian tanks for the loss of 20. On entering Caen the Anglo-Canadian troops found it in ruins, with four-fifths of the Old City reduced to rubble by the 7 July bombings. The debris that choked the streets made <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> impossible for British armour to manoeuvre through the northern half of the city, preventing Second Army from exploiting I Corps's success. Without possession of the terrain flanking the south of the city, no further gains could be made within Caen so by mid-afternoon on 9 July, Operation Charnwood was over.|$|E
5|$|The Balts {{were largely}} driven to unite by {{external}} threats from aggressive German religious orders. In 1202, the Order of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword {{was established by}} Albert, the Bishop of Riga, to promote the Christianization and conquest of the Livonians, Curonians, Semigallians, and Estonians near the Gulf of Riga. The Order waged a number of successful campaigns and posed a great danger to the Lithuanian territories. The Order's progress was halted by its defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, after which <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> collapsed. The following year, it merged into the Teutonic Knights.|$|E

5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year; almost all winters have {{no more than one}} day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> never settles on the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9.|$|E
5|$|Until 2001, {{participation}} in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system {{was seen as a}} major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> ended her career. The introduction of weekly semifinals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semifinals and final since 2003.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15b has {{a mass of}} 0.542 times Jupiter's {{mass and}} a radius that is 1.428 times Jupiter's radius. Due in part to its {{proximity}} to its host star, a distance of 0.0499 AU (7,500,000km), WASP-15b is greatly inflated, with a density of 0.247 g/cm3. Another factor, such as an internal heat source, is suspected to add to this extremely high radius and extremely low density. WASP-15b orbits its host star every 3.7520656 days. It also has an orbital inclination of 85.5º, making <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> edge-on {{as seen from the}} Earth's perspective.|$|E
