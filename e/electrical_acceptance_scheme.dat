30|$|The SBSs {{are faced}} with some {{constrained}} backhaul bandwidth and limited storage capacity. [4] exploits caching capabilities in SBSs to overcome the backhaul capacity limitations and enhance the QoS of users. A network deployed with M mobile UEs and N SBSs is considered based on Manhattan mobility model. Each SBS experiences unique network conditions due {{to the number of}} UEs currently serviced and the existing traffic load on the backhaul, therefore the SBSs individually decide which UEs to serve, which is then transformed into the problem of UE-SBS association. A utility function is defined as the amount of bits that SBS i (i ∈ N) deliver to UE m (m ∈ M) during the service time in order to formulate the UE-SBS association problem, and the problem is modeled as a one-to-many matching game for a SBS and many UEs. To solve the problem in a decentralized approach, the aim of each SBS is to maximize its own utility. An algorithm based on the deferred <b>acceptance</b> <b>scheme</b> is proposed to identify a UE-SBS matching. The results show that the proposed cell association scheme yields significant performance improvement comparing to a cell association technique without caching considerations.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAnticipating {{multimedia}} file requests via caching at {{the small}} cell base stations (SBSs) of a cellular network has emerged as a promising technique for optimizing the quality of service (QoS) of wireless user equipments (UEs). However, developing efficient caching strategies must properly account for specific small cell constraints, such as backhaul congestion and limited storage capacity. In this paper, we address the problem of devising a user-cell association, in which the SBSs exploit caching capabilities to overcome the backhaul capacity limitations and enhance the users' QoS. In the proposed approach, the SBSs individually decide on which UEs to service based on both content availability and on the data rates they can deliver, given the interference and backhaul capacity limitations. We formulate the problem as a one-to-many matching game between SBSs and UEs. To solve this game, we propose a distributed algorithm, based on the deferred <b>acceptance</b> <b>scheme,</b> that enables the players (i. e., UEs and SBSs) to self-organize into a stable matching, in a reasonable number of algorithm iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed cell association scheme yields significant gains, reaching up to 21 % improvement compared to a traditional cell association techniques with no caching considerations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractStrong local {{histories}} {{have led}} {{in the past}} to particular local safety concepts, requirements and <b>acceptance</b> <b>schemes</b> for metro, tram and light rail systems from country to country and even from city to city. Urban guided transportation has often been the trendsetter in technology application, driverless or unattended operation projects for example, impacting the life cycle complexity for these kinds of systems. Furthermore, interchangeability of components (crossacceptance) is more and more a driving force to reduce procurement costs and commercial risks, but turns out to be technically challenging. Recent Urban Guided Transport applications have been increasingly assessed by taking into account the existing European railway application standards. The European Commission is encouraging a harmonization drive, notably through its support of major European research projects such as MODSafe – Modular Urban Transport Safety and Security Analysis, one of the latest EU-funded projects in the European Transport sector. The purpose of the MODSafe project is to undertake research of major steps of the Safety Life Cycle of urban guided transport systems in Europe. Even if the rail safety landscape in urban guided transport is highly diversified, the sector will benefit from some kind of harmonization. Beyond safety and security related aspects the MODSafe project deals with life cycle responsibilities as well as acceptance, approval and certification processes. This paper presents one of the key results of the MODSafe project, namely a life cycle approach proposal for urban guided transport systems with typical life cycle phase related roles & responsibilities and key activities. Its application aims reducing the future efforts needs for new or upgraded urban guided transport systems. This paperpresents an overview of the life cycle approach proposal...|$|R

While computational methods to delineate the free energy landscape are routinely used to analyze the relative stability of conformational states, to determine phase boundaries, and to compute ligand-receptor binding energies its use in problems involving the cell membrane is limited. Here, we present an overview of four different free energy methods to study morphological transitions in bilayer membranes, induced either by the action of curvature remodeling proteins or due to the application of external forces. Using a triangulated surface {{as a model for the}} cell membrane and using the framework of dynamical triangulation Monte Carlo, we have focused on the methods of Widom insertion, thermodynamic integration, Bennett <b>acceptance</b> <b>scheme,</b> and umbrella sampling and weighted histogram analysis. We have demonstrated how these methods can be employed in a variety of problems involving the cell membrane. Specifically, we have shown that the chemical potential, computed using Widom insertion, and the relative free energies, computed using thermodynamic integration and Bennett acceptance method, are excellent measures to study the transition from curvature sensing to curvature inducing behavior of membrane associated proteins. The umbrella sampling and WHAM analysis has been used to study the thermodynamics of tether formation in cell membranes and the quantitative predictions of the computational model are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements.

40|$|Two global {{optimization}} {{methods are}} proposed in this thesis. They are the multicanonical basin hopping (MUBH) method and the basin paving (BP) method. The MUBH method combines the basin hopping (BH) method, {{which can be}} used to efficiently map out an energy landscape associated with local minima, with the multicanonical Monte Carlo (MUCA) method, which encourages the system to move out of energy traps during the computation. It is found to be more efficient than the original BH method when applied to the Lennard-Jones systems containing 150 - 185 particles. The asynchronous multicanonical basin hopping (AMUBH) method, a parallelization of the MUBH method, is also implemented using the message passing interface (MPI) {{to take advantage of the}} full usage of multiprocessors in either a homogeneous or a heterogeneous computational environment. AMUBH, MUBH and BH are used together to find the global minimum structures for Co nanoclusters with system size N ≤ 200. The BP method is based on the BH method and the idea of the energy landscape paving (ELP) strategy. In comparison with the <b>acceptance</b> <b>scheme</b> of the ELP method, moving towards the low energy region is enhanced and no low energy configuration may be missed during the simulation. The applications to both the pentapeptide Met-enkephalin and the villin subdomain HP- 36 locate new configurations having energies lower than those determined previously. The MUBH, BP and BH methods are further employed to search for the global minimum structures of several proteins/peptides using the ECEPP/ 2 and ECEPP/ 3 force fields. These two force fields may produce global minima with different structures. The present study indicates that the global minimum determination from ECEPP/ 3 prefers helical structures.

40|$|Abstract. Most {{cost-effective}} concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) {{systems are}} based on an optical train comprising two stages, the first being a Fresnel lens. Among them, the Fresnel-Köhler (FK) concentrator stands out owing to both performance and practical reasons. We describe the experi-mental measurements procedure for FK concentrator modules. This procedure includes three main types of measurements: <b>electrical</b> efficiency, <b>acceptance</b> angle, and irradiance uniformity at the solar cell plane. We have collected here the performance features of two different FK prototypes (ranging different f-numbers, concentration ratios, and cell sizes). The electrical efficiencies measured in both prototypes are high and fit well with the models, achieving values up to 32. 7 % (temperature corrected, and with no antireflective coating on SOE or POE surfaces) in the best case. The measured angular transmission curves show large acceptance angles, again perfectly matching the expected values [measured concentration acceptance product (CAP) values over 0. 56]. The irradiance pattern on the cell (obtained with a digital camera) shows an almost perfectly uniform distribution, as predicted by raytrace simulations. All these excellent on-sun results con-firm the FK concentrator as a potentially cost-effective solution for the CPV market. © 2012 Societ...|$|R
