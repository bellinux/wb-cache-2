40|$|We have {{experimentally}} realized a {{white light}} cavity (WLC) {{in a wide}} range of the cavity <b>input</b> <b>field's</b> intensity in an N-type atomic system. As the linear and nonlinear dispersion can be tuned conveniently, for different cavity <b>input</b> <b>field's</b> intensity, the condition of WLC can be satisfied. In our experiment, the WLC with broad linewidth of about 100 MHz can be achieved with the cavity <b>input</b> <b>field's</b> intensity from a few mu W to dozens of mW. This can be applied in the gravitation wave detectors, pulse shaping, nonlinear spectroscopy, atom and ion cooling, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

We discuss their influence by {{a comparison of}} the experimental FWM with calculations based on extended optical Bloch equations including local-field effects, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation. The investigations show that, for copolarized <b>input</b> <b>fields,</b> excitation-induced dephasing is the dominant FWM mechanism, followed by the conventional density-grating FWM process, biexcitonic contributions, and local-field effects. For cross-linear polarized <b>input</b> <b>fields</b> the excitation-induced dephasing mechanism is canceled so that the conventional density-grating FWM process and biexcitonic contributions are dominating...|$|R

40|$|To {{automatically}} test web applications, crawling-based {{techniques are}} usually adopted to mine the behavior models, explore the state spaces or detect the violated invariants of the applications. However, in existing crawlers, rules for identifying {{the topics of}} <b>input</b> text <b>fields,</b> such as login ids, passwords, emails, dates and phone numbers, have to be manually configured. Moreover, the rules for one application are very often not suitable for another. In addition, when several rules conflict and match an <b>input</b> text <b>field</b> {{to more than one}} topics, {{it can be difficult to}} determine which rule suggests a better match. This paper presents a natural-language approach to automatically identify the topics of encountered <b>input</b> <b>fields</b> during crawling by semantically comparing their similarities with the <b>input</b> <b>fields</b> in labeled corpus. In our evaluation with 100 real-world forms, the proposed approach demonstrated comparable performance to the rule-based one. Our experiments also show that the accuracy of the rule-based approach can be improved by up to 19 % when integrated with our approach. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

50|$|For example, if an <b>input</b> <b>field</b> {{is meant}} to accept only integer values 0-100, then {{examples}} of boundary cases would be entering the values -1, 0, 100, and 101.
