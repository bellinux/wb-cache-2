Major stresses and transitions such as marriage, parenthood, retirement, death or loss of a partner, and financial success and failure are all important, as is how the patient has dealt with them.

40|$|Information {{supply is}} the genuine task of {{academic}} institutions {{as well as}} of publishers. Publishers profit from copyright provisions which give them exclusive rights in their products. The same copyright provisions are often the limiting factor when academic institutions try to improve their service to the academic community. This is the case in particular when it comes to digital access to information. In a so-called "Second Basket", the German copyright act has just been revised, introducing explicit legal exemptions for <b>document</b> <b>deliveries</b> and on the spot consultation of works contained in public libraries' collections. At the same time, unresolved issues remain with respect to existing legal exemptions as well as the new ones.

40|$|Nanoscale {{secondary}} ion MS (NanoSIMS) imaging {{makes it possible}} to visualize stable isotope-labeled lipids in cells and tissues at 50 nm lateral resolution. Here we report the use of NanoSIMS imaging to visualize lipids in mouse cells and tissues. After administering stable isotope-labeled fatty acids to mice by gavage, NanoSIMS imaging allowed us to visualize neutral lipids in cytosolic lipid droplets in intestinal enterocytes, chylomicrons at the basolateral surface of enterocytes, and lipid droplets in cardiomyocytes and adipocytes. After an injection of stable isotope-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), NanoSIMS imaging <b>documented</b> <b>delivery</b> of lipids to cytosolic lipid droplets in parenchymal cells. Using a combination of backscattered electron (BSE) and NanoSIMS imaging, it was possible to correlate the chemical data provided by NanoSIMS with high-resolution BSE images of cell morphology. This combined imaging approach allowed us to visualize stable isotope-enriched TRLs along the luminal face of heart capillaries and the lipids within heart capillary endothelial cells. We also observed examples of TRLs within the subendothelial spaces of heart capillaries. NanoSIMS imaging provided evidence of defective transport of lipids from the plasma LPs to adipocytes and cardiomyocytes in mice deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HDL binding protein 1...|$|R
