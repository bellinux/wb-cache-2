5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, {{so there was}} little for Ismay to <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder of}} their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.|$|E
5|$|After a British spy boat sinks, {{a marine}} archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is tasked to {{retrieve}} its Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC) communication system before the Russians <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> Havelock is murdered by Gonzales, a Cuban hit-man, Bond is ordered {{to find out}} who hired Gonzales. While investigating, Bond is captured, but Gonzales is subsequently killed by Havelock's daughter Melina, and she and Bond escape. Bond identifies one of those present with Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque and so follows a lead to Italy and meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos. Kristatos tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, Kristatos' former organised crime partner.|$|E
5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} told what she can and cannot <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E

5|$|The Cottage was {{originally}} developed in 1977â€“1978 by three children: brothers Viggo Kann (then Eriksson) and Kimmo Eriksson, and their friend Olle Johansson, {{who at the}} time of the project's start were ten, twelve and fourteen years old, respectively. As Viggo and Kimmo's parents worked at Stockholms Datamaskincentral ("Stockholm's Computer Center", QZ) and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), and Johansson's father worked at an office that was a client for QZ, they had access to QZ's DEC-10 mainframe computer Oden. Using Oden and the book What to <b>Do</b> <b>After</b> You Hit Return (1975), the Eriksson brothers and Johansson learned programming.|$|E
5|$|When the {{children}} that work for the Vulture are discussing what to <b>do</b> <b>after</b> Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) brutally defeats the Vulture, the Green Goblin approaches them and tells them {{that he will be}} the one that crushes Superior Spider-Man. Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E
5|$|While {{fighting}} the Lydians, Cyrus had sent {{messages to the}} Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule, which the Ionians had refused to <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms {{as they had been}} subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians' unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia. He first attacked Phocaea; the Phocaeans decided to entirely abandon their city and sail into exile in Sicily, rather than become Persian subjects (although many subsequently returned). Some Teians also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos, {{but the rest of the}} Ionians remained, and were in turn conquered.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to <b>do</b> <b>after</b> his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly <b>do).</b> <b>After</b> exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo {{plan their}} next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo {{that his team}} is incomplete, and that {{he knows what he}} must <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila {{questions}} Yaotl's actions. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nsara (and all the Muslim nations) becomes {{increasingly}} difficult as {{they face the}} effects of defeat in the war. Since casualties were so massive, {{there is a great}} shortage of men over women and many men who survived the fighting returned as disabled veterans (Budur volunteers to help veterans blinded by gas at a hospital by reading to them). The Muslims were forced to pay reparations to the victorious countries and to make various humiliating concessions such as allowing Buddhist monasteries to open in their cities. There is a general depression and malaise in post-war Muslim society, made worse by the economic difficulties; hyperinflation, food shortages and strikes. In many counties this leads to governments being overthrown in coups of various kinds. In Nsara itself, order begins to break down as people are near starvation and the military attempts to overthrow the government and impose a police state. However many liberals, including Budur and Kirana start mass street protests against this reactionary dictatorship. Eventually the Hodenosaunee League (who have become very powerful after their victory in the war) intervene by sending a fleet (from their naval base at Orkney) to Nsara, insisting that the military relinquish power, which they <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> this, things slowly start to improve, but most of the Muslim states continue to suffer grave problems. Even in China, a victorious country, there is unrest which turns into a civil war.|$|E
5|$|The {{diplomatic}} context at Constance {{included the}} revolt of the Bohemian Hussites, who looked upon Poland {{as an ally}} in their wars against Sigismund, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw on condition that he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague, which he {{was not prepared to}} <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw's nephew, Sigismund Korybut, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429 â€” apparently with WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw's blessing â€” but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E

This variety is sown in the end of November after the harvesting of crops like Basmati rice and Potato on a large area of Punjab each year. Wheat was cultivated according to package of practices issued by PAU, Ludhiana. Seeding was done at a rate of 40 kg/acre with a spacing of 20 cm between rows. 1 st irrigation was <b>done</b> <b>after</b> 5 weeks of sowing. 2 nd irrigation was <b>done</b> <b>after</b> 3 weeks of previous irrigation. 3 rd irrigation was <b>done</b> <b>after</b> 2 weeks of previous.|$|R
