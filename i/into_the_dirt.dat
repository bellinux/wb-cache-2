5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. Heading down the back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt.</b> Spencer was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E

The video ends with the same grass at the beginning growing out of the dirt, causing it to dry up.|$|E

500|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona was {{temporarily}} usurped through the trickery {{of his son}} Andriantomponimerina, who ruled the western territory from his rova at Ambohidratrimo. Once Andriamasinavalona's sons had been installed in their territories, Andriantomponimerina tested his authority by imposing a particular hairstyle upon the Marovatana people he ruled, in disregard of the promise that the king had made to respect the diverse customs and taboos of Imerina. The Marovatana reminded the king of this vow and refused to submit, prompting the king and his sons to prepare for war against {{the people of the}} fief. This conflict provided the prince with an opportunity to seize power. Upon the suggestion of the prince's half-brother, Andrianentoarivo, the prince hid himself in a trench he dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> floor of his royal residence at Ambohidratrimo, then ordered his people to send word to his father that he was [...] "in the ground". Believing his son to be buried alive by the Marovatana as a punitive measure, Andriamasinavalona hurried to Ambohidratrimo carrying reeds as a symbol of peace; upon the king's entrance into the residence, however, Prince Andriantomponimerina locked Andriamasinavalona inside and refused to release him for the next seven years. During this time the prince repeatedly offered to free the king on the condition that Andriamasinavalona accept to transfer power to him, which the king repeatedly refused. Andriantomponimerina prevented his brothers from taking action against him by telling their messengers that the king simply preferred his company and had decided to reside with him at Ambohidratrimo.|$|E

Gaut then drove the vehicle around Foley and toward Mansker, who fired two shots into the vehicle's hood in what he claims was self-defense. Foley continued to advance and Mansker, fired a warning shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt,</b> later testifying that he did so because earlier in the confrontation Foley had stated that he did not believe the gun was real. Mansker then saw Foley reach into his waistband and reacted by shooting Foley in the knee. Foley still continued to advance, causing Mansker to fire three more times. Foley was taken to a local hospital where the wounds were found to be non-life-threatening. He was placed on the non-football injury list the following day and did not play during the 2006 NFL Season, forfeiting his $775,000 salary for the season. The incident occurred a week after Foley was cleared of multiple charges that included resisting arrest and battery of an officer.

50|$|In 1979 a solo {{exhibition}} entitled “Little Red Sealings” {{opened at the}} “Sarah Levy Gallery.” The exhibition included paper and photographs that had been treated with red paint, a color which was to become significant in Moshe Gershuni’s work in the coming years. The works exhibited a number of artistic influences by citing the names of artists such as the Italian sculptor Medardo Rosso, the Israeli painter Aviva Uri, etc. A group of his works included imagery taken from iconic art works. In an untitled work (1980) Gershuni stained {{a portrait of the}} Pope in red. In addition Gershuni added many-legged graphic symbols that were reminiscent of swastikas. This symbol appears several times, including on the groin of the Pope. In another untitled work from the same year Gershuni drew on a reproduction of a portrait of Bernard Van Orley (1521) by Albrecht Dürer.16 Gershuni covered the face with transparent blue paint, like a kind of veil, and he drew on the lapel of his black garment a Star of David the edges of which were stained in red. Itamar Levy described in retrospect Moshe Gershuni’s act of creating that painting as a test of his relationship to painting. “In Gershuni’s treatment <b>the</b> portrait turns <b>into</b> <b>dirt,</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> is makeup, <b>the</b> makeup is makeup in blood. In Gershuni’s treatment, <b>the</b> painting turns <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arena for an enraged attack on the painting.
