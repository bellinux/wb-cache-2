His father had died still striving to bring the railroad in across the mountains that averaged a hundred thousand dollars to the mile. He, Frederick, had brought it in. He had sat up nights over that railroad; bought newspapers, entered politics, and subsidised party machines; and he had made pilgrimages, more than once, at his own expense, to the railroad chiefs of the East. While all the county knew how many miles of his land were crossed by the right of way, none of the county guessed nor dreamed the number of his dollars which had gone into guaranties and railroad bonds. He had done much for his county, and the railroad was his last and greatest achievement, the capstone of the Travers' effort, the momentous and marvellous thing that had been brought about <b>just</b> <b>yesterday.</b> It had been running two years, and, highest proof of all of his judgment, dividends were in sight. And farther reaching reward was in sight. It {{was written in the}} books that the next Governor of California was to be spelled, Frederick A. Travers.|$|E

50|$|The album, {{which also}} {{included}} Moris Birabent's Ayer nomás (<b>Just</b> <b>Yesterday)</b> {{was the first}} local rock production to outsell either American or British rock titles locally, and the milestone {{became known as the}} birth of Argentine rock. The Argentine edition of Rolling Stone Magazine, in a 2007 retrospective, named the melancholy La balsa number one in the list of the 100 best albums in Argentine rock. Commercially, the album rescued the struggling group. Invited to perform the hit on television following its release, the group could only see themselves when the show aired at the kindness of an appliance store owner, who tuned a window display set to the program at their request. Controversy ensued shortly after the hit's release however. A contentious debate soon arose as to whether Nebbia or Tanguito had contributed more to the composition (particularly after the latter's tragic, 1972 death). La balsa also aggravated officials in General Juan Carlos Onganía's conservative dictatorship, who stopped short of banning a song they believed encouraged escapism and drug abuse, but retaliated by shuttering La Cueva, whose stage had become the focal point for local rock groups (including Los Gatos). The band itself began losing cohesion, as well: guitarist Kay Galiffi relocated to Brazil, and Nebbia left the group in 1969; by 1970, Los Gatos had dissolved.|$|E

The compilation contains 25 tracks in two discs, 19 of which are previously released singles. It comes with two newly recorded songs, [...] "Something in the Water" [...] and [...] "Little Toy Guns". It also features four additional tracks, including her previously unreleased, live version of [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] with Vince Gill, a song they performed together for the ACM Presents: Girls’ Night Out TV concert. About including [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] on her collection, Underwood stated: [...] "'How Great Thou Art' kind of took {{on a life of its}} own. I hear people all the time come up to me and tell me, 'I love that, I look at it online all the time', so I thought it was important to make that available on an album. That was a really amazing moment - I think for myself and for Vince - and we felt it". The other three additional tracks are songwriting worktape versions of [...] "So Small", [...] "Last Name" [...] and [...] "Mama's Song". On including these songwriting worktapes, Underwood said [...] "I wanted to do something different with extras, so we’re including three worktapes that were recorded the day we wrote the songs - which I think is pretty special".|$|E
