5|$|Finally, the Tories {{contended that}} the Liberals had been in power too long, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change. The PC party stated that the Liberals were arrogant, inflexible, and not capable of looking at {{problems}} from a new point of view. Liberals responded that with the country prosperous, {{there was no point}} to a change.|$|E
5|$|Game three {{was also}} {{held at the}} Polo Grounds. With each team having won one game, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> matchup between the two teams' ace {{pitchers}}. Sal Maglie was on the mound for New York, while Brooklyn called on Don Newcombe; both pitchers had winning records against the opposing team heading into the matchup. After Maglie walked two batters {{in the top of}} the first inning, Jackie Robinson singled, scoring the game's first run when Pee Wee Reese crossed home plate. No further hits were allowed until the bottom of the second, when Whitey Lockman and Bobby Thomson singled; neither scored, and it remained 1–0 through two innings.|$|E

50|$|Fellow troopers, I {{submit to}} you that our Army {{would be better served}} by {{recognizing}} our soldiers who have faced an enemy in direct-fire combat with a Combat Action Badge. We are an Army in transformation. A few years ago, we donned the black beret as a symbol of that transformation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the disparity of the Combat Infantry Badge to end. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the perceived badge wars to end. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> now <b>time</b> to take our transformation one step further. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the Combat Action Badge.|$|R

5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, {{when the}} club survived relegation by virtue of a final-day victory at home to Leyton Orient, {{chairman}} Owen Oyston decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change and sacked Ayre. His replacement, in July 1994, was Sam Allardyce. His assistant was Phil Brown, who had just finished his playing career with the Seasiders.|$|E

25|$|After {{five years}} at AZ, De Cler felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change. Both PSV and Feyenoord showed interest. His agent Rob Jansen, who also works with Roy Makaay and Kevin Hofland, made a unique effort to discuss the future of his players with them, each other and their future club Feyenoord to bring them all {{together}} at the club. Also Sigi Lens the agent of Giovanni van Bronckhorst {{was a part of}} the deal and when manager Bert van Marwijk signed his contract as the new Feyenoord manager, all these players were contracted within a few weeks time span.|$|E
25|$|The match went to extra time, and France {{finished}} slightly {{the stronger}} {{of the two}} sides. No more goals were scored, and so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> penalty shoot-out. Socrates, who had earlier missed an open goal and headed an easy chance straight into the French keeper's arms, failed with the first kick for Brazil. The next six penalties were all converted, and then Platini fired over the bar. Brazil were back on level terms – but not for long. Julio Cesar struck the post with his penalty, and Luis Fernández then scored to put France through 4–3 on penalties.|$|E
25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, {{for the past four}} years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E

25|$|Which was, you know, {{that was}} cool – {{somebody}} had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up.

And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous – hugely successful. So I kept thinking, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> raise... I did {{talk to him about}} it, but he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, 'That's just business, Paul.' You know.

25|$|Sensing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change, Kiss {{made the}} {{decision}} to abandon their trademark make-up and costumes. The band officially appeared in public without make-up {{for the first time on}} a September 18, 1983 appearance on MTV, which coincided with the release of Lick It Up. The tour to promote the new album and the unmasked band members began in Lisbon, Portugal, on October 11, 1983, at Pavilhão Dramático de Cascais, their first concert without make-up since early 1973. Lick It Up became Kiss' first gold record in three years, but the tour was even more sparsely attended than the previous one. Vincent did not get along with Simmons and Stanley, and he left the band at the conclusion of the tour in March 1984. Vincent's replacement was St. John, a session player and guitar tutor.|$|E
25|$|Next up was an away {{series against}} the West Indies, early in 1968. D'Oliveira didn't turn in his best showing in the five matches, scoring only 137 runs {{at an average of}} 27.4. He did a lot of bowling, but picked up only three wickets, even though he was economical. Once back in England, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> five-Test Ashes series. The Aussies crushed England by 159 runs in first Test as England crumbled in their second innings, despite D'Oliveira's top scoring effort of 87 not out. He was then dropped for the {{subsequent}} three Tests. He was recalled by the selectors for the final Test at the Oval, and 158 runs in the first innings against Australia seemed to have guaranteed his place in the side to play the 1968–69 Test series in South Africa. He was left out of the touring party under the pretext that his bowling would not be effective in his native country.|$|E

500|$|In 1908, Selfe {{presented}} new proposals {{based upon}} the old design to the Royal Commission on Communication between Sydney and North Sydney. However, this time the commissioners preferred a tunnel scheme; again, no work proceeded. Agitation for a bridge was renewed {{with the election of}} a Labor government at the 1910 state election. But with Selfe's death in 1911, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new generation of bridge builders. In 1912 the government appointed J.J. Bradfield as [...] "engineer-in-chief of Sydney Harbour Bridge and City Transit"; the call for tenders for constructing the bridge was not made until a decade later. Over the following decades, versions of what Selfe had much earlier articulated for a city circle railway link and a bridge to the north shore were realised. Selfe's contribution received little public or formal recognition.|$|E
500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in {{the crack in the}} universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness was placed in a Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform and tried to make it [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E
500|$|Another {{writer who}} left the show during season two was David Gerrold. He wrote an episode for The Original Series called [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] and came {{on-board}} The Next Generation before the pilot and wrote {{the first version of}} the bible for the series. Rick Berman stated in an early memo that the new series was intended to be an issues-based show in the same mold as the original. Creator Gene Roddenberry concurred, and under questioning from fans at a convention which Gerrold also attended, Roddenberry agreed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> homosexual character to appear in Star Trek. Roddenberry told his staff that [...] "Times have changed and we have got to be aware of it." [...] This resulted in Gerrold pitching a story called [...] "", which included two homosexual crew members and an AIDS allegory. Roddenberry cleared the idea to be produced into a script, and Gerrold went off to appear on a Star Trek cruise having received a telegram telling him that everyone in the office was pleased with the new story.|$|E

500|$|The {{unexpected}} {{defeat of}} the Liberals was ascribed to various causes. The Ottawa Citizen stated that the defeat {{could be attributed to}} [...] "the uneasy talk... that the Liberals have been in too long." [...] Tom Kent of the Winnipeg Free Press, a future Liberal deputy minister, wrote that though the Liberal record had been the best in the democratic world, the party had failed miserably to explain it. Author and political scientist H.S. Ferns disagreed with Kent, stating that Kent's view reflected the Liberal [...] "assumption that 'Nobody's going to shoot Santa Claus and that Canadians in the 1957 election were motivated by things other than material interests. Peter Regenstreif cited the Progressive Conservative strategy in the 1957 and 1958 elections [...] "as classics of ingenuity unequalled in Canadian political history. Much of the credit belongs to Diefenbaker himself; at least some must go to Allister Grosart". A survey taken of those who abandoned the Liberals in 1957 showed that 5.1% did so because of Suez, 38.2% because of the Pipeline Debate, 26.7% because of what they considered an inadequate increase in the old age pension, and 30% because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change.|$|E
500|$|In a June 9, 2009 interview, Craven {{expressed}} his displeasure in the remaking of his 1984 film, primarily because the filmmakers {{chose not to}} have him {{as a consultant to}} the film, unlike with the 2009 remake The Last House on the Left where he [...] "shepherd it towards production". In contrast, Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy throughout the film series, felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>A</b> Nightmare on Elm Street to be remade. Englund liked the idea of being able to [...] "exploit the dreamscape" [...] with CGI and other technologies that did not exist when Craven was making the original Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984. Subsequently, Bayer believed that the film is designed to pay homage to what Craven did in 1984, but not replicate it entirely. Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films, and that the character of Freddy Krueger was one that affected the lives of a certain generation of people. For Bayer, remaking A Nightmare on Elm Street was about bringing that feeling to a new generation, with a new spin on the character and story.|$|E
