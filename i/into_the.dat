This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E

5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water <b>into</b> <b>the</b> CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries <b>into</b> <b>the</b> choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely <b>into</b> <b>the</b> CSF.|$|E
