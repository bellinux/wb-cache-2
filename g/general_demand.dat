Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explain {{previously}} reported high levels of psychological distress in lawyers. <b>General</b> <b>demands</b> (i. e., time pressure and emotional demands) and lawyer demands (i. e., emphasis on profits and competitiveness), as well as three resources (i. e., control, pay, and praise) were examined, along with the moderating role of overcommitment. Participants included 448 Australian lawyers who completed an online questionnaire distributed to them by their state or territory law society. Results revealed significant direct relationships between the demands, resources, and overcommitment on depression and anxiety. Significant two-way interactions indicated that the positive relationship of <b>general</b> <b>demands</b> on depression and anxiety were more marked for high overcommitted lawyers, as was the negative relationship of pay on anxiety. Contrary to predictions for the three-way interaction, in the presence of high <b>general</b> <b>demands,</b> there was a trend to suggest that high control was positively related to psychological distress for high overcommitted lawyers. The theoretical and practical implications of these results, including the importance of identifying overcommitted lawyers and developing preventive interventions to reduce overcommitment prior to the development of strain, are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The Ottoman fleet, {{under the}} Kapudan Pasha, which {{had arrived in}} the Saronic Gulf to {{reinforce}} the Ottoman positions in Corinth, was forced by these news to turn back to its base in the Dardanelles. In early October, Morosini led his own ships in a vain search for the Ottoman fleet; as part of this expedition, Morosini landed at the Piraeus, where he was met by the Metropolitan of Athens, Jacob, and notables of the town, who offered him 9,000 reales as tribute. After visiting Salamis, Aegina, and Hydra, Morosini returned with the fleet to the bay of Nauplia on 16 October. At about the same time, the dissatisfaction among the German mercenaries, due to their losses to disease and the perceived neglect in the sharing of spoils, reached its peak, and many, including the entire Saxon contingent, returned home. Nevertheless, Venice was able to make up the losses by a new recruitment drive in Hesse, Württemberg, and Hannover. Due to the imminent outbreak of the Nine Years' War and the <b>general</b> <b>demand</b> for mercenaries, however, most of the new recruits were not veteran soldiers; the recruiters were even forced to recruit French deserters, and over 200 men deserted in turn during the march to Venice. Once again, the need to await reinforcement delayed the start of Venetian operations in 1687 until July.|$|E

6000|$|General supply {{consists}} in the commodities offered {{in exchange for}} [...] other commodities; <b>general</b> <b>demand</b> likewise, if no money exists, [...] {{consists in}} the commodities offered as purchasing power in [...] exchange for other commodities. That is, one can not increase the [...] demand for certain things without increasing the supply of some [...] articles which will be received {{in exchange for the}} desired [...] commodities. Demand is based upon the production of articles [...] having exchange value, in its economic sense; and the measure of [...] this demand is necessarily the quantity of commodities offered in [...] exchange for the desired goods. <b>General</b> <b>demand</b> and supply are thus [...] reciprocal to each other. But as soon as money, or general [...] purchasing power, is introduced, Mr. Cairnes(208) defines “demand [...] as the desire for commodities or services, seeking its end by an [...] offer of general purchasing power; and supply, as the desire for [...] general purchasing power, seeking its end by an offer of specific [...] commodities or services.” But many persons find a difficulty [...] because they insist upon separating the idea of supply from that [...] of demand, owing to the fact that producers seem to be a distinct [...] class in the community, different from consumers. That they are in [...] reality the same persons can be easily explained by the following [...] statement: “A certain number of people, A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., [...] are engaged in industrial occupations—A produces for B, C, D, E, [...] F; B for A, C, D, E, F; C for A, B, D, E, F, and so on.

The spirit and manner in which he did this are well illustrated by the plan he pursued in studying Latin. It was this: ...|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{cartography}} has {{the task}} {{to develop and}} research new methods of cartographic visualization. <b>General</b> <b>demands</b> are set upon modern cartographic visualization, which encompasses digital cartography and computer graphics: legibility, clearness, accuracy, plainness and aesthetics.

In order to satisfy the demand of legibility, one should respect conditions of minimal sizes, appropriate graphical density and better differentiation of known features. Demand of clearness needs to be met by fulfilling conditions of simplicity, contrasting quality and layer arrangement of cartographic representation. Accuracy, as the demand on cartographic visualization, can be divided into positioning accuracy and accuracy signs. For fulfilling the demand of plainness, the conditions of symbolism, traditionalism and hierarchic organization should be met. Demand of aesthetics will be met if the conditions of beauty and harmony are fulfilled. </p...|$|R

60|$|The inconveniences of barter are {{so great}} that, without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges, the {{division}} of employments {{could hardly have been}} carried to any considerable extent. A tailor, who had nothing but coats, might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat: besides, he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat, and the coat could not be divided. Every person, therefore, would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which, though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants, was in great and <b>general</b> <b>demand,</b> and easily divisible, so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale. The thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which, besides being divisible and generally desired, does not deteriorate by keeping. This reduces the choice to a small number of articles.|$|E
60|$|Simon Glover being thus left {{to his own}} painful reflections, {{nothing better}} remained, after having seen after the comforts of the dumb {{companion}} of his journey, than to follow the herdsman's advice; and ascending towards the top of an eminence called Tom an Lonach, or the Knoll of Yew Trees, after a walk of half an hour he reached the summit, and could {{look down on the}} broad expanse of the lake, of which the height commanded a noble view. A few aged and scattered yew trees of great size still vindicated for the beautiful green hill the name attached to it. But a far greater number had fallen a sacrifice to the <b>general</b> <b>demand</b> for bow staves in that warlike age, the bow being a weapon much used by the mountaineers, though those which they employed, as well as their arrows, were, in shape and form, and especially in efficacy, far inferior to the archery of merry England. The dark and shattered individual yews which remained were like the veterans of a broken host, occupying in disorder some post of advantage, with the stern purpose of resisting to the last. Behind this eminence, but detached from it, arose a higher hill, partly covered with copsewood, partly opening into glades of pasture, where the cattle strayed, finding, at this season of the year, a scanty sustenance among the spring heads and marshy places, where the fresh grass began first to arise.|$|E
60|$|The theory will {{possibly}} be objected to {{by many of}} our readers: the best proof in its favor, we think, is, {{that the state of}} art amongst the people in France and Germany, where publishers are not so wealthy or enterprising as with us,* and where Lithography is more practised, is infinitely higher than in England, and the appreciation more correct. As draughtsmen, the French and German painters are incomparably superior to our own; and with art, as with any other commodity, the demand will be found pretty equal to the supply: with us, the <b>general</b> <b>demand</b> is for neatness, prettiness, and what is called EFFECT in pictures, and these can be rendered completely, nay, improved, by the engraver's conventional manner of copying the artist's performances. But to copy fine expression and fine drawing, the engraver himself must be a fine artist; and let anybody examine the host of picture-books which appear every Christmas, and say whether, for the most part, painters or engravers possess any artistic merit? We boast, nevertheless, of some of the best engravers and painters in Europe. Here, again, the supply is accounted for by the demand; our highest class is richer than any other aristocracy, quite as well instructed, and can judge and pay for fine pictures and engravings. But these costly productions are for the few, and not for the many, who have not yet certainly arrived at properly appreciating fine art.|$|E
