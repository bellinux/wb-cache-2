The game's lead programmer, Dwight Luetscher, created a <b>formula</b> <b>that</b> {{was used by the}} game's artists to create individual Lego elements in the game. The pieces available to the player were selected from hundreds of Lego elements by the developers, chosen first by aesthetics, and then analysed to see if they would fit into Luetscher's formula. The developers chose to affect the attributes of the player's car, such as handling, acceleration and top speed, through how many bricks are placed on the chassis, as this is simpler to understand for the game's main age demographic.|$|E
40|$|This note {{presents}} {{a collection of}} mathematical formulas involving the mathematical constant π. 1 Background The mathematical constant known as π = 3. 14159 [...] . is undeniably the most famous mathematical constant. Mathematicians {{since the days of}} Euclid and Archimedes have analyzed its properties and computed its numerical value. This is a collection of many of <b>formulas</b> <b>that</b> have been established by mathematicians over the years involving π. Preference is given in this list for <b>formulas</b> <b>that</b> satisfy the following criteria: • <b>Formulas</b> <b>that</b> give π (or a very simple expression involving π) explicitly, as opposed to implicit relations such as e iπ + 1 = 0. • <b>Formulas</b> <b>that</b> give π (or a very simple expression involving π) as a straightforward infinite series or definite integral, as opposed to iterative algorithms or other multiple-formula schemes. • <b>Formulas</b> <b>that</b> involve only simple notation (such as binomial coefficients, square roots, logs, summations, integrals, etc.) that would be familiar to anyone who has completed a beginning course in calculus. • <b>Formulas</b> <b>that</b> are relatively new (discovered say within the last 15 years) or have current researc...|$|R
40|$|NNIL {{formulas}} are propositional <b>formulas</b> <b>that</b> do {{not allow}} nesting of implication to the left. These formulas were introduced in [15], where it was shown that NNIL-formulas are (up to frame-equivalence) exactly the <b>formulas</b> <b>that</b> are closed under taking submodels of Kripke models. In this paper we show that NNIL-formulas are exactly those <b>formulas</b> <b>that</b> are closed under taking subframes of (descriptive and Kripke) frames. As a result we obtain that the set of NNIL-formulas coincides with the set of subframe <b>formulas</b> and <b>that</b> subframe logics can be axiomatized by NNIL formulas. We also introduce ONNILLI formulas, only NNIL {{to the left of}} implications, and show <b>that</b> ONNILLI <b>formulas</b> are (up to frame-equivalence) the <b>formulas</b> <b>that</b> are closed under order-preserving images of (descriptive and Kripke) frames. As a result, we obtain that the set of ONNILLI-formulas coincides with the set of stable formulas, which was introduced in [4]. Thus, ONNILLI is a syntactically defined set of <b>formulas</b> <b>that</b> axiomatizes all stable logics. This resolves an open problem of [4]...|$|R

5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm.

5|$|The {{number of}} maximal {{directed}} pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge.

5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a <b>formula</b> <b>that</b> compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{activity}} ceased {{during the}} course of World War I (WWI) and many nationalists were killed in the trenches. The nationalist movement was revived by the periodical Breiz Atao, which was founded in 1919. In 1923, it adopted Pan-Celticist ideals, drawing a line between Gauls and Bretons, and arguing that the traditionally federal Bretons were oppressed by the autocratic Latins of France. Support was instead to be sought in the north, the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence were portrayed as the implementations of a successful <b>formula</b> <b>that</b> was to be emulated shall France find itself in dire straits. The incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine into France as a consequence of Germany's defeat in WWI, {{led to the creation of}} an Alsatian autonomist movement that opposed the French imposition of Laïcité. In 1928, Breizh Atao established contacts with the Alsace-Lorraine Party, which in turn facilitated the spread of Nordism and Völkisch ideology into Breton nationalist circles. Ties with the ethnically German Alsatians strengthened and with them the idea of accepting Abwehr assistance, which was already being provided to the Flemish and Alsatians alike.|$|E

5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases {{and the threat of}} a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a <b>formula</b> <b>that</b> permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a <b>formula</b> <b>that</b> takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
