25|$|On 14 October 2010, {{engineers}} at {{the launch pad}} first discovered a small leak in a propellant line for Discoverys orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines. The leak was detected after they noticed a fishy smell coming from the aft of the shuttle, {{thought of as a}} sign of fuel vapor in the air. Upon inspection, the leak was found at a flange located at the interface where two propellant lines met in Discoverys aft compartment. The line carried monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) propellant, one of two chemicals (the other is an oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide) used to ignite the OMS engines. Engineers replaced an Air <b>Half</b> <b>Coupling</b> (AHC) flight cap. However, the new cap failed to solve the problem since vapor checks still showed signs of a leak. An aspirator was activated to collect the vapor at the leak-site allowing work to continue in other locations around the aft segment of Discovery.|$|E

40|$|Two {{alternative}} {{designs of}} a hermetically sealed extractor, the drive of which utilizes a cylindrical magnetic clutch, are examined. In the first version, the driving <b>half</b> <b>coupling</b> is internal, and the driven <b>half</b> <b>coupling</b> external. In the second version, the driving <b>half</b> <b>coupling</b> is external, and the driven internal. It is shown {{that as the}} extractor based on the first design begins to accelerate with use of a frequency regulator that permits smooth variation in current frequency, the maximum angle of mismatch between the half couplings of the magnetic clutch is less then 0. 5 π rad. The proposed design of the extractor has been tested at an establishment manufacturing radiochemical products, and placed in experimental-industrial service. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E

50|$|Ohio State {{employed}} {{an effective}} vertical passing {{game in the}} first half and a relentless ball control offense in the second <b>half,</b> <b>coupled</b> with a defense that improved in both efficiency and stamina as the game progressed, to beat 2nd-ranked Texas 24-7 in Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, Austin. Quarterback Troy Smith, well protected by the Buckeye offensive line, threw for 269 yards and two touchdowns without an interception, directing a 10-play 72-yard drive in the fourth quarter that took 5:47 off the clock and secured the win. Although the teams were nearly equal in yardage (348 Ohio State to 326 Texas) and first downs (20-17 in favor of Texas), Ohio State did not turn the ball over and converted a recovered fumble and a Colt McCoy interception, both forced by linebacker James Laurinaitis, into 10 points.|$|R

5|$|Braham {{stayed in}} the RAF and joined the Night Fighter Development Wing of the Central Fighter Establishment where he tested and {{developed}} existing and new night fighting equipment. However, the massive disarmament and reduction of the RAF—mimicking that of the early 1920s—disillusioned Braham even more. Flying was reduced to save costs and removed the one activity that had drawn him into the RAF in 1937. Initially he still managed regular flights to Belgium, where the RAF retained large bases. While there {{he was awarded the}} Order of the Crown and Croix de guerre with Palm for his wartime work. The arrangement was short-lived. The Central Fighter Establishment was cut by <b>half.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with rationing and a declining standard of living and low-wages, Braham resigned from the RAF in March 1946 and applied to join the Rhodesian Colonial Police. Bill Gregory heard of Braham's decision and contacted Basil Embry, Braham's former commanding officer. Embry soon persuaded him to return to the RAF at the rank of flight lieutenant with the pay of an acting wing commander. There followed a period of two years of non-flying appointments in the Air Ministry in London.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of the 4 -site plaquette order in a model recently introduced by Katoh and Imada to explain the spin gap observed in CaV 4 O 9. We show that all relevant types of order (4 -site plaquette, dimerized, Néel) can be described within the framework of Schwinger boson mean field theory, and we make predictions regarding their relative stability. The results are compared to exact diagonalization of finite clusters. 1 In a recent paper, Taniguchi et al. [1] reported the presence of a spin gap in CaV 4 O 9. The structure of the two dimensional crystal of VO 4 pyramids of CaV 4 O 9 is shown on figure 1. In the Mott insulating phase, one can consider Vanadium atoms as localized spin one <b>half</b> <b>coupled</b> by superexchange interactions, and, as pointed out by Katoh and Imada [2] a minimal model consists of spin 1 / 2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model including an exchange term J between nearest neighbors Vanadium atoms. These authors have shown using Monte Carlo simulations that this model has a spin gap. In order to determine the origin of the gap, they introduce a slightly more general Hamiltonian...|$|R

500|$|In the {{behind the}} scenes video {{published}} by HBO following the airing of the fifth and sixth episodes, Benioff described Bran's visions {{at the beginning of}} the episode as being something that was put together very precisely and purposefully, noting [...] "Even though some of those images flash by in just a fraction of a second each of them was very carefully chosen. And the Mad King was probably the most dramatic of those because we've been hearing about the Mad King from the very beginning of the show, but he's never appeared on screen before. And shooting it, you know, spending a lot of time on what ended up being maybe like a second and a <b>half,</b> <b>couple</b> seconds, of screen time." [...] The new scenes of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, are interspersed with previously shown footage of the White Walkers, as well as wildfire explosions, and other landmark moments from throughout the series, such as Ned Stark's beheading, the Red Wedding, and Bran falling from the Broken Tower in the series premiere. In the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, the Mad King is described as having long, unkempt hair and beard, with nine inch long fingernails. The show's version portrayed his look in a more tidy fashion, with David Rintoul playing the role of the Mad King.|$|R
