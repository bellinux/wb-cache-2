I construct an exhaustive dataset of objective measures on cyclones and earthquakes worldwide between 1980 and 2006 and complement existing reports on direct damages.

The economic slack piles up to. 4 points of GDP when I instrument by actual exposure to alleviate censorship issues and declaration biases. This output loss is superior to what would suggest a model of labor frictions and capital losses and points to large business disruptions.

40|$|Although {{studies on}} {{entrepreneurship}} are conducted outside the main trend of economics, {{it is generally}} believed that entrepreneurial activity is a factor fostering <b>economic</b> development. <b>Declarations</b> of entrepreneurship stimulation are frequently formulated by politicians but in case {{of the lack of}} a comprehensive homogeneous theory of entrepreneurship, it is essential to show the political tools which influence entrepreneurship. This is the main aim of the paper. The research has shown that budget revenues have a stronger influence on entrepreneurship than budget expenditures. While entrepreneurs negatively react to budget revenues from indirect taxes and corporate income tax, an increase in budget revenues from personal income tax has a positive influence on entrepreneurship. At the same time budget expenditures on national insurance and investments negatively shape the rate of proper entrepreneurs. The rate of quasi-entrepreneurs, however, is negatively influenced by budget expenditures on national insurance influence, but positively by the budget expenditures on investments. The results of the analysis allow us to recommend a policy of reducing fiscal charges, and direct taxes and corporate income tax in particular, as a tool of stimulating entrepreneurial activity...|$|R

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{national economic}} interests {{that form the}} basis of national security (food, raw materials, finance, infrastructure including transport) and set the priorities for the development of economic sectors (industry, scientific and technological development, entrepreneurship, social sector and innovation development). The authors carry out brief analysis for each type of national economic interests and find out how they are reflected in the national documents on socio-economic development and in international documents on economic cooperation with Russia’s participation. These interests in the national aspect are reflected in the Concept for long-term socio-economic development, and in the strategies and state programs for development of economic sectors. As for the international economic aspect, the authors consider Russia’s contracts with individual countries on trade and/or cooperation, the Agreement on the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union, the <b>Declaration</b> and agreements of the BRICS countries, the Program for Trade and Economic cooperation between the SCO countries, and international standards relating to socio-economic ratings and indexes. The analysis shows that the country requires the development of a unified conceptual project that would link strategic priorities of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation with changing geoeconomic conditions. This independent project should represent a set of system strategic guidelines on different levels, enhancing the role and increasing the importance of Russia in the new architecture of the geo-economic world order, the country’s participation in the joint strategies implemented by the Russian Federation together with other interested countries and new integration groups, and also defending conceptual interests of national development...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to observe the EU's {{institutional}} system {{from the viewpoint of}} its effectivity and impact on the economic growth and various trasnmission mechanisms. The EU is a group consisting of 27 countries from different cultural backgrounds, with different national mentalitities, economic, social and politic systems. The economical and political integration is not taking place in a spontaneous way, as a process of continuous cognition, analysis and learning from mistakes, but according to a plan comming from upper political levels and with emphasis on the aims more than on the means. In the EU there are at least 2 levels of legislature, executive and jurisdiction, each on the national and supranational level. The nature of these 2 levels is rather parallel than vertical. An important link and therefore effective feedback is missing between the supranational level and the national level represented through the vote of the population and the performance of the economic environment. Constructivistic efforts are encumbering the economy of the EU with balast, that can be understood as a pool of from the system arising ineffectivities. The result of this balast is an inhibition of the <b>economic</b> growth despite <b>declarations</b> to accelerate it. This thesis will observe these ineffectivities through a more detailed analysis of macroeconomic fields as are monetary policy, labour markets and tax systems. The emphasis will be put on concrete impacts of supranational policies on individual countries, areas inside the EU and the EU as a whole. The USA will serve as a benchmark, because the EU has the ambition to get ahead of them as the world largest economy and that by the year 2010. The nature of these ineffectivities is of a rather hidden nature and therefore I will preffer the studying of literature in fields of interest as a mean of identifying the ineffectivities rather than atual quantifications...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation {{is one of}} the {{principal}} water uses in temperate countries, as in France. Limiting some consumption of this natural resource by the agricultural sector is therefore one of the more undisputed environmental problems. Moreover a better use of the water resource by farmers is now an explicit aim of the French Agriculture Ministry. Sharing a limited resource to optimize its use may be done using different tools, but it is all the more complicated in France that the resource legally does not belong to anybody. A lot of tools have been long documented in the literature, and sometime used, too much often without much success. But once recognized that "Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an <b>economic</b> good» (Dublin <b>declaration,</b> 1992), the progresses in different fields of economic science may be used to diminish water “wastes”. Among them, water pricing tools, which are too commonly used, are also well documented. Their objectives are multiple, well established, and sometimes contradictory: allocating water to users who valorise it at the best, guaranteeing an access to this essential good to everybody, recovering costs induced by water extraction/distribution/use, guaranteeing financial stability to providers, being transparent and simple enough to be understandable, being “acceptable” to be applied, etc. The economists are interested essentially in the first four ones that correspond to efficiency, equity and cost recovery objectives. Here we present an original water pricing device, constructed through ‘mechanism design’, i. e. by using game theory models in order that the pricing system is constructed precisely to meet the preceding five objectives (including then intelligibility by water users). We show how introducing some degree of freedom in the system, and using the fact that farmers will keep secret some private information and acquire public information {{in the course of the}} plant growth period, may allow the manager of the irrigation area and the farmers to meet these objectives in an acceptable way. Some field data, analysed through econometric tools, confirm this possibility, and the acceptability of such pricing mechanism. At the cost of some formal work in economics, by using the tools of game theory and concepts developed in finance, we think that our preliminary results open new possibilities to a better sharing of water between the different usages, in temperate countries...|$|R
40|$|Die artikel oorweeg sekere ekonomiese implikasies van die Accra-verklaring van die Wêreldbond van Gereformeerde Kerke (World Alliance of Reformed Churches, wat algemeen as die WARC afgekort word) [Kyk addendum]. Die Wêreldbond, wie se ledetal uit 218 gereformeerde kerkgenootskappe in 107 lande bestaan, het die Verklaring tydens sy jaarlikse konferensie in Accra in September 2004 aanvaar. Die Wêreldbond beskou die Verklaring as 'n beroep op ryk, ontwikkelde lande, hoofsaaklik in die Noordelike halfrond, om die voordele van ekonomiese groei en ontwikkeling meer eweredig met arm inwoners van arm lande te deel. Uit 'n ekonomiese perspektief plaas die Verklaring die blaam vir voortgesette armoede op globalisering en 'n neoliberale wêreldorde, bestaande uit die Verenigde State en sy bondgenote, en instellings soos die Internasionale Monetêre Fonds, die Wêreldbank en die Wêreldhandelsorganisasie. Hierdie artikel oorweeg die Verklaring se menings oor globalisasie; die Verenigde State en internasionale organisasies; en die neoliberale wêreldorde. Die voordele van globalisasie is inderdaad nie eweredig tussen ryk en arm lande verdeel nie. Voorts het die Verenigde State en internasionale organisasies foute gemaak wat tot voortgesette armoede gelei het, eerder as om tot die bekamping daarvan by te dra. Die Verklaring is egter ongebalanseer in soverre dit nie ook onderdrukkende regerings en diktatorskappe in dieselfde terme as die neoliberale wêreldorde verwerp nie. Die gevolgtrekking is dat die verantwoordelikheid vir armoedebekamping, hoewel nie eweredig nie, deur ryk en arm lande gedeel moet word, eerder as om dit uitsluitlik as 'n uitdaging voor die deur van ryk lande te lê. A {{critical}} analysis of the Covenanting for Justice in the Economy and the Earth (Accra declaration) This paper considers certain economic implications of the Covenanting for Justice in the Economy and the Earth of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC) [See appendix]. The WARC, an alliance of 218 reformed churches from 107 countries, adopted the declaration during its conference in Accra in September 2004. The WARC regards the declaration as a call on the rich, developed world to share the fruits of economic progress more equally with poor people in poor countries. Decisions and declarations of the WARC are not binding on its member churches, but members are encouraged to support such initiatives. As the WARC has six members in South Africa, the declaration will also become the subject of local debate in coming months. In terms of an <b>economic</b> perspective, the <b>declaration</b> blames globalisation and a neo-liberal world order, comprising the United States and its allies, and {{institutions such as the}} International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, for continued underdevelopment and poverty. This paper considers the views of the declaration on globalisation; the United States and international organisations; and the neo-liberal world order from an economic perspective. The analysis leaves no doubt that the benefits of globalisation are indeed not spread evenly between rich and poor countries. This difference between rich countries in the north and poor countries in the south has on occasion been described as a golden curtain of divide between the rich and the poor. The United States and international organisations have made mistakes that perpetuated poverty, rather than to alleviate it. Developed countries also produce externalities such as pollution that contributes to global warming with concomitant negative consequences for poor countries. However, the declaration is not balanced in as much as it does not reject dictatorships and unrepresentative governments in poor countries in the same terms as the neo-liberal world order. Unrepresentative governments are often instrumental in perpetuating poverty and underdevelopment by not permitting economic freedom, fostering property rights or supporting the rule of law. As an alternative to current development problems and the failure of neo-liberal developmental prescriptions, the Barcelona Consensus on economic development and poverty alleviation was formulated in 2004. This consensus achieves a more balanced approach in its recommended solutions for overcoming poverty problems in developing countries than the declaration of the WARC. The conclusion is that the responsibilities for overcoming development problems and poverty should be shared, albeit not equally, in terms of adjustments required by rich and poor countries, rather than to be regarded as a challenge facing only rich countries. Theology and ethics, rather than only economic theory, should determine the principles in terms of which economic laws are used to eradicate poverty. In this way the melting of the golden curtain will be enhanced...|$|R
