25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
25|$|Semiotic {{art history}} seeks {{to uncover the}} codified meaning or {{meanings}} in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to {{understand the meaning of}} frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a , or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations {{as much as it is}} to reveal new possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Academic archaeologists criticised Jones' work at Mucking {{as one of}} {{the prime}} {{examples}} of [...] "excavation without publication". They argued that since the primary aim of any archaeological excavation is [...] "preservation by record", failing to publish the results amounted to destroying the archaeology without purpose, and that it was irresponsible to excavate large areas without the means to properly process and disseminate the results. Indeed, in thirteen years of continuous excavation at Mucking, Jones only published a single, short paper on the results of her trial excavations in 1965. When the project was completed in 1978, despite the huge volume of material that had been recovered, very little had been analysed and none had been published. Ultimately, the final publication of Mucking was undertaken by others (English Heritage and the Cambridge Archaeological Unit), the first volume of which did not appear until 2015, fourteen years after Jones' death. Jones argued that as the site was being constantly destroyed by the gravel extraction on the site, she could not afford to take time out of the year for post-excavation, nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> the funding to complete it.|$|E

Davis previously had worked with Irving Rapper on films where he served as a dialogue director, but his gratitude for her support turned into a grudging realization that Davis could control the film. Although his approach was conciliatory, the to-and-fro with Davis slowed production and [...] "he would go home evenings angry and exhausted".

2500|$|In {{addition}} to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language {{and the use of}} language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, [...] "If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text." [...] Technically, not only <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, [...] "What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something—it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art." [...] Walter Legge states that, ...|$|E

60|$|Then Granny jumped lightly to {{a little}} shelf that ran along {{in front of the}} nesting boxes. From this she could reach the lower roost on which four fat hens were asleep.

6000|$|A word upon a {{question}} of authorship. Not that quite; but, rather, {{a question}} of emendation and revision.

There seems to be evidence that she had help. For there are four several copyrights on it--1875, 1885, 1890, 1894. It did not come down in English, for in that language it could not have acquired copyright--there were no copyright laws eighteen centuries ago, and in my opinion no English language--at least up there. This makes it substantially certain that the Annex is a translation. Then, was not the first translation complete? If it was, on what grounds were the later copyrights granted? ...|$|E
