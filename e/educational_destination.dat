40|$|This paper uses {{data for}} England {{to test the}} {{effectively}} maintained inequality (EMI) hypothesis that individuals from ‘high’ and ‘low’ socioeconomic backgrounds have qualitatively different modal <b>educational</b> <b>destinations</b> at a given educational level. In so doing, the paper highlights how a focus on modal <b>educational</b> <b>destinations</b> seriously detracts from {{the usefulness of the}} EMI hypothesis as a basis for identifying qualitative educational inequalities. First, tests of the EMI hypothesis are shown to be of questionable reliability because they involve calculating the predicted probabilities of different <b>educational</b> <b>destinations</b> based on ultimately arbitrary operationalisations of ‘high’ and ‘low’ socioeconomic background, with more polarised formulations being more likely to find in favour of EMI. Second, tests of the EMI hypothesis are shown to be of questionable validity in {{that it is possible to}} find in favour of EMI even when the degree of qualitative inequality is negligible and to find against EMI even when the degree of qualitative inequality is substantial. These limitations have been recognised by the originator of the EMI hypothesis but dismissed as unimportant. However, this paper argues that these limitations are so serious that analysts seeking to identify qualitative inequalities in education should discard the focus on modal <b>educational</b> <b>destinations</b> advocated by the EMI hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} motivations and {{meanings}} of international student mobility. Central {{to the discussion}} are {{the results of a}} large questionnaire survey and associated in-depth interviews with UK students enrolled in universities in six countries from around the world. The results suggest, first, that several different dimensions of social and cultural capital are accrued through study abroad. It is argued that the search for ‘world class’ education has taken on new significance. Second, the paper argues that analysis of student mobility should not be confined to a framework that separates study abroad from the wider life-course aspirations of students. It is argued that these insights go beyond existing theorisations of international student mobility to incorporate recognition of diverse approaches to difference within cultures of mobility, including class reproduction of distinction, broader notions of distinction within the life-plans of individual students, and how ‘reputations’ associated with <b>educational</b> <b>destinations</b> are structured by individuals, institutions and states in a global higher education system that produces differentially mediated geographies of international student mobilit...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{education}} and training received by {{the sons of the}} English gentry in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Using information from the herald’s visitations of four counties, it offers quantitative evidence of the proportion of gentry children who entered university, spent time at one of the inns of court or became apprentices in London. We show that over the period there was little change in the <b>educational</b> <b>destinations</b> of gentry sons: university and apprenticeship absorbed roughly equal proportions; the inns of court slightly less. We also show that a son’s position in the birth order had a very strong influence on the kind of education he received. Eldest sons {{were much more likely to}} go to university or one of the inns of court. Younger sons were much more likely to become apprentices in London – as we show, trade clearly was an acceptable career for the gentry. There is little sign of a change in the status of different educational choices in this period. Our findings confirm some traditional assumptions about the importance of birth order and normative expectations in determining the life-courses of gentry children in the seventeenth century: historians should not over-state the autonomy of elite children in deciding their futures...|$|R

Further, through MANOVA, it was found that customer focus and facilities are the main factors used by respondents in their choice decisions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} why {{international students}} opt for their chosen study destination. It also investigates their behaviour as tourists while studying, whether they hosted visits from {{friends or relatives}} and their overall economic contribution. The sample consisted of 600 international students studying in higher education institutions in Melbourne, Australia of which 219 responded. A stratified random sampling method was used with the key variables identified as country of origin, gender and university attended. Key questions included: What were the factors that prompted students to study in Australia? How did they become familiar with destinations and tourist attractions {{during the course of}} their studies? What tourist attractions and activities were most popular? It was discovered that word-of-mouth was the most significant medium of communication in the selection of <b>educational</b> <b>destination.</b> Most travel undertaken during the period of enrolment was for private purposes. The most popular Melbourne attraction was the Queen Victoria Market and The Great Ocean Road was the most popular attraction statewide.

40|$|One of the {{features}} of today’s globalised living is multiculturalism and the growing internationalization of education that has resulted in greater movements of student population across various cultural boundaries. Most sojourner studies tend to focus on the experiences of immigrants, refugees, and the business communities while the experiences of the growing number of international students have been downplayed. Economic conditions and political situations in the late 1990 ’s have created educational opportunities for many developing countries including Malaysia. There was {{an increase in the number}} of students from developing countries with collectivist cultures studying in more similar cultural environments. Malaysia is the 12 th most popular <b>educational</b> <b>destination.</b> It has been assumed theoretically that similarities in the cultural framework between the host culture and that of the international students will allow for a comfortable and more natural adaptation process. However, it is during sojourn that these students claim cultural group membership in the local context. It is here that the cultural identities of a group are negotiated, reinforced and challenged through everyday communication practices. This paper presents focus group findings with 30 Indonesian graduate students that explore their daily living experiences in an effort to unravel their process of enacting and engaging their identities through daily communication. Through their issues, challenges, and strategies for learning, living and adapting in a presumably similar cultural setting, this paper presents an account of their adaptation that reveal the unpacking of labels and norms that distinguishes them from the locals and affirms their cultural identity as Indonesians...|$|E

The main purpose of tourists visiting Smart Park is to obtain an educational tourism experience.

Tourism supply had a higher effect than tourism demand. Tourism demand did not particularly affect tourism experience. However, the results of the path analysis indicate that tourism supply had direct and indirect effects on tourism experience through the variation of tourism activities, with the indirect effect being the most predominant. In the management of Smart Park, there is still a gap between tourism demand and supply, so the tourism experience has not been maximized to its full potential...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{migration}} on the provision of public <b>educational</b> subsidies in <b>destination</b> countries. In a framework in which productivity is fostered by an individual’s own human capital {{as well as by}} the average level of human capital in the economy (à la Stark and Wang, 2002), it is shown how immigration can be a way for destination countries to free-ride on foreign educational subsidies. On the other hand, in the presence of externalities and of a positive weight of migrants in the social welfare function, an increase in the number of immigrants might increase public subsidies. Using data on a panel of 19 OECD countries over the period 1980 - 2000, this paper provides empirical evidence on the free-riding hypothesis: an increase in foreign labour is found to reduce public education spending in destination countries.
