2500|$|By late 2000, Shaik {{knew that}} the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Scorpions would be {{watching}} all financial transactions made between him and Zuma, so the international division of Thomson-CSF sent an <b>encrypted</b> <b>fax</b> to Nkobi Holdings detailing a “service provider agreement" [...] which updated the contract signed between Nkobi Holdings and Thomson-CSF for the delivery of the Corvettes. This agreement was used to disguise the payment of the bribe. The fax, which was later obtained in a raid on Shaik’s office by the Scorpions, contained a non-bribery clause next to which Shaik wrote “conflicts with intention", yet despite the careful set-up, Thomson-CSF did not transfer any money to Shaik. Subsequently, Zuma went to meet with Thétard in Paris, following which R250,000 (US$38,000) was transferred by Thomson-CSF to the “Jacob Zuma Education Fund".|$|E
50|$|Since then he {{has focused}} in prosecuting {{corruption}} and other high-profile cases. One of his more successful cases was the State vs Shaik trial. His investigations, {{which led to the}} discovery of a handwritten <b>encrypted</b> <b>fax</b> in French promising an amount of R500,000 per annum to 'JZ' until the payment of ADS dividends, were key in securing the conviction of Schabir Shaik on two counts of corruption and one count of fraud.|$|E
50|$|Der Spiegel {{revealed}} NSA {{spying on}} multiple diplomatic missions of the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Headquarters in New York. During specific episodes within a four-year period, the NSA hacked several Chinese mobile-phone companies, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and the Asian fiber-optic network operator Pacnet. Only Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK are explicitly exempted from NSA attacks, whose main {{target in the}} EU is Germany. A method of bugging <b>encrypted</b> <b>fax</b> machines used at an EU embassy is codenamed Dropmire.|$|E
50|$|Milcode also boasted {{significantly}} higher levels of security than previous secure telephones. The base model offered a proprietary encryption algorithm with a key length of 512 bits, and a more advanced model with a key length of 1024 bits. Key exchange used a public key, based on Diffie-Hellman, as opposed to a plug-in datakey. A new key was generated for each phone call. Milcode was also able to <b>encrypt</b> <b>fax</b> and data and was electromagnetically shielded to NATO TEMPEST standards.|$|R
