In these applications they are mainly used to reinforce, repair or straighten existing structures, but recently full-composite structures have also been built. Independently from the domain of the use, there is a need for these composite structures to be monitored. Since the composite materials are usually applied in form of thin tapes or sheets, sensors have to be embedded within the structure, depending on structural layer that has to be monitored. Embedding the sensors may have as a consequence a significant decrease of the mechanical properties of the composite material due to the dimensions of the sensor.

Navier-Stokes and Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations are {{used to describe the}} melt flow in a pure fluid region and porous media, considering the non-Newtonian flow behavior of thermoplastic melts. Experimental and numerical results are compared determining the filling fronts and fiber impregnation of the injection molded test samples. A clear relationship between the degree of impregnation, verified by magnified photomicrograph, and the position of flow front can be detected. A good correlation of simulated and experimental flow fronts against the degree of filling of the mold is observed too. The differences in macroscopic flow behavior between the cavity with and without an <b>integrated</b> <b>fiber</b> bundle <b>with</b> respect to the impregnation process can be simulated with high accuracy...|$|R
