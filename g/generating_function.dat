5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
25|$|The {{logarithm}} of {{a characteristic}} function is a cumulant <b>generating</b> <b>function,</b> which {{is useful for}} finding cumulants; some instead define the cumulant <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> as the logarithm of the moment-generating function, and call the logarithm of the characteristic function the second cumulant <b>generating</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

30|$|The <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> {{are the key}} tool in {{analytic}} {{number theory}} for defining and obtaining properties to special polynomials such as Bernoulli, Euler, Hermite, and Genocchi polynomials. The idea behind the <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> are that we can effectually transform problems about sequences into problems about <b>functions.</b> The <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> have many advantages.

25|$|The {{method of}} {{estimating}} {{the ratio of the}} number of favourable cases to the whole number of possible cases had been previously indicated by Laplace in a paper written in 1779. It consists of treating the successive values of any function as the coefficients in the expansion of another function, with reference to a different variable. The latter is therefore called the probability-generating function of the former. Laplace then shows how, by means of interpolation, these coefficients may be determined from the <b>generating</b> <b>function.</b> Next he attacks the converse problem, and from the coefficients he finds the generating function; this is effected by the solution of a finite difference equation.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} indirect {{influence was}} Thomas Simpson, who achieved {{a result that}} closely resembled de Moivre's. According to Simpsons' work's preface, his own work depended greatly on de Moivre's; the latter in fact described Simpson's work as an abridged version of his own. Finally, Thomas Bayes wrote an essay discussing theological implications of de Moivre's results: his solution to a problem, namely that of determining the probability of an event by its relative frequency, was taken as a proof {{for the existence of}} God by Bayes. Finally in 1812, Pierre-Simon Laplace published his Théorie analytique des probabilités in which he consolidated and laid down many fundamental results in probability and statistics such as the moment <b>generating</b> <b>function,</b> method of least squares, inductive probability, and hypothesis testing, thus completing the final phase in the development of classical probability. [...] Indeed, in light of all this, there is good reason Bernoulli's work is hailed as such a seminal event; not only did his various influences, direct and indirect, set the mathematical study of combinatorics spinning, but even theology was impacted.|$|E
