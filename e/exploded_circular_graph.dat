40|$|Routing is {{a problem}} domain with an {{infinite}} number of final-solutions. One of the possible approaches to solving such problems is using graph theory. This paper presents mathematical analysis methodologies based on <b>circular</b> <b>graphs</b> for solving a shortest path routing problem. The problem is focused on searching for the shortest path within a <b>circular</b> <b>graph.</b> Such a search coincides with the network routing problem domain. In this paper, we introduce in the detail all necessary parts needed to understand such an approach. This includes: definition of the routing problem domain, introduction to <b>circular</b> <b>graphs</b> and their usage, circular graphʼs properties, definition of walks through a <b>circular</b> <b>graph,</b> searching and determining the shortest path within a <b>circular</b> <b>graph,</b> etc. The state of the art routing methods, implemented in contemporary highly sophisticated routers, includes well-known weight-based algorithms and distance-vectors-based algorithms. The proposed solution can be placed between the two abovementioned methods. Each of these known methods strives for optimal results, but each of them also has its own deficiencies, which should be rectified with the proposed new method. This theoretically presented method is argued by a practical example and compared with the RIP (Routing Information Protocol) technique, where we look for the shortest path and possible walks through a specified <b>circular</b> <b>graph...</b>|$|R

40|$|Conjectured in 1943, Hadwiger’s {{conjecture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging open problems in graph theory. Hadwiger’s conjecture states that if the chromatic number of a graph G is k, then G has a clique minor of size at least k. In this thesis, we give motivation for attempting Hadwiger’s conjecture for <b>circular</b> arc <b>graphs</b> and also prove the conjecture for proper <b>circular</b> arc <b>graphs.</b> <b>Circular</b> arc <b>graphs</b> are graphs whose vertices can be represented as arcs on a circle such that any two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding arcs intersect. Proper <b>circular</b> arc <b>graphs</b> are a subclass of <b>circular</b> arc <b>graphs</b> that have a circular arc representation where no arc is completely contained in any other arc. It is interesting to study Hadwiger’s conjecture for <b>circular</b> arc <b>graphs</b> as their clique minor cannot exceed beyond a constant factor of its chromatic number as We show in this thesis. Our main contribution is the proof of Hadwiger’s conjecture for proper <b>circular</b> arc <b>graphs.</b> Also, in this thesis we give an analysis and some basic results on Hadwiger’s conjecture for <b>circular</b> arc <b>graphs</b> in general...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{direction}} that generalizes interval graphs and permutation graphs to trapezoid graphs, researchers {{are now trying to}} generalize the class known as trapezoid graphs. A circle trapezoid is the region in a circle that lies between two non-crossing chords; thus, circle trapezoid graphs are the intersecting graphs of circle trapezoids within a circle. It should be noted that circle trapezoid graphs properly contain trapezoid graphs, circle graphs and circular-arc graphs as subclasses.

40|$|We {{study the}} entire {{function}} zeta(n,s) {{which is the}} sum of l to the power -s, where l runs over the positive eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the <b>circular</b> <b>graph</b> C(n) with n vertices. We prove that the roots of zeta(n,s) converge for n to infinity to the line Re(s) = 1 / 2 in the sense that for every compact subset K in the complement of this line, and large enough n, no root of the zeta function zeta(n,s) is in K. To prove this, we look at the Dirac zeta function, which uses the positive eigenvalues of the Dirac operator D=d+d^* of the <b>circular</b> <b>graph,</b> the square root of the Laplacian. We extend a Newton-Coates-Rolle type analysis for Riemann sums and use a derivative which has similarities with the Schwarzian derivative. As the zeta functions zeta(n,s) of the <b>circular</b> <b>graphs</b> are entire functions, the result does not say anything about the roots of the classical Riemann zeta function zeta(s), which is also the Dirac zeta function for the circle. Only for Re(s) > 1, the values of zeta(n,s) converge suitably scaled to zeta(s). We also give a new solution to the discrete Basel problem which is giving expressions like zeta_n(2) = (n^ 2 - 1) / 12 or zeta_n(4) = (n^ 2 - 1) (n^ 2 + 11) / 45 which allows to re-derive the values of the classical Basel problem zeta(2) = pi^ 2 / 6 or zeta(4) =pi^ 4 / 90 in the continuum limit.
