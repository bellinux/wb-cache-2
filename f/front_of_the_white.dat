25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Burnside Burn" [...] was {{organized}} by Portland NORML, the {{local chapter of the}} National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, in celebration of the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Oregon and to circumnavigate a temporary limit on recreational sales. According to Russ Belville, the chapter's executive director, the event began with the idea of taking a photograph in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Stag sign. He recalled: [...] "It evolved from me saying that when legalization happens, I want to take a photo under the Portland, Oregon sign. Other people said, 'Can we give marijuana away?'

500|$|A notorious Shetland sheep was a ram kept by United States President Thomas Jefferson {{for several}} years {{in the early nineteenth}} century. Unlike modern Shetlands (but like some related breeds) this ram had four horns. He was kept with about 40 other sheep on President's Square in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. In the spring of 1808, it {{attacked}} several people who had taken shortcuts across the square, injuring some and actually killing a small boy. Having been moved to Jefferson's private estate at Monticello, the ram was eventually killed after having killed several other rams: it was described by Jefferson as [...] "this abominable animal". Such aggressive Shetland rams, however, are unusual.|$|E

Cora relates that {{after he left the}} hospital, Luther {{realized}} that the coroner would be forced to conduct an autopsy if he were charged with murder. Wharton assures Cora that he will stand by Luther, and after he leaves with Edie, Cora's stoic demeanor in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> crumbles and she cries in Gladys' arms.|$|R

500|$|Frank Kameny soon {{realized}} the pivotal change {{brought by the}} Stonewall riots.

When he and other people marched in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, [...] "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Burnside Burn" [...] was {{an event}} {{held on the}} Burnside Bridge in Portland, Oregon, {{starting}} at midnight on July 1, 2015, the day recreational marijuana became legal in the U.S. state of Oregon.

The crowd, larger than anticipated, numbered in the thousands and at times blocked traffic lanes on the bridge. Some attendees wanted to commemorate the moment, while others were motivated by announcements of free marijuana and seeds. No fines were issued for consumption in public. The event was covered by cannabis publications, local and national news outlets, and the HBO television series Vice.|$|E

In 2005, following Borat's {{appearance at the}} MTV Movie Awards, the country's Foreign Ministry threatened to sue Sacha Baron Cohen, and Borat's [...] "Kazakh-based" [...] website, www.borat.kz, was taken down. Kazakhstan also launched a multi-million dollar [...] "Heart of Eurasia" [...] campaign to counter the Borat effect; Baron Cohen replied by denouncing the campaign at an in-character press conference in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House as the propaganda of the [...] "evil nitwits" [...] of Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan is, throughout the film, referred to by Borat as his nation's second leading problem, with the first being the Jews. In November 2006, Kazakh TV personality Jantemir Baimukhamedov travelled to London with the stated aim of presenting Baron Cohen with horse meat and horse urine, which were claimed by Borat to be the national food and drink of Kazakhstan, although {{he was unable to}} organise a meeting with him.|$|E

500|$|Stevens met {{her first}} husband, Dudley Field Malone, when he {{represented}} {{her for her}} protest in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. He had been serving as an Assistant Secretary of State in the Wilson cabinet, but was converted to the suffragist cause and resigned his post. He appeared with Stevens at fundraising events and helped raise {{thousands of dollars for}} their cause, which was gaining momentum, as President Wilson finally endorsed enfranchisement. Between 1918 and 1919, Stevens continued alternating speaking engagements and picketing. She was arrested again, along with Elsie Hill, Alice Paul and three [...] "Jane Doe" [...] suffragists at the NWP demonstration of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York in March 1919. On 4 September 1920, the fight was won when Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby proclaimed the necessary 36 states had ratified the 19th Amendment with Tennessee's ratification. Stevens published the quintessential insider account of the imprisonment of NWP activists, Jailed for Freedom, in 1920.|$|E
500|$|Ohio-born farmer Ezra Meeker (1830–1928) {{traveled}} the Oregon Trail in 1852; {{he and his}} young wife and infant child went by ox-drawn wagon from Iowa to Oregon Territory. [...] In his old age, he {{came to believe that}} the Oregon Trail, and the sacrifice of those who had died along it, were being forgotten. [...] Amid considerable publicity as one of the last survivors of the pioneers who had blazed the way west, Meeker retraced his route along the Trail between 1906 and 1908. [...] The Trail had in some places disappeared, swallowed up by town and farm, and in his journeys, he sought to find where he had passed, seeking to have historical markers erected. [...] He took his ox team and wagon across the nation to publicize his cause, parking his rig in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House where he met President Theodore Roosevelt. In New York, he crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. [...] In 1910, he and his oxen participated in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. [...] In the succeeding years, he {{traveled the}} route by oxcart, automobile, and, at age 93 in 1924, airplane, attempting to further his cause, and seeking federal recognition and funding for his efforts.|$|E
500|$|When Fischer was 16, {{his mother}} {{moved out of}} their {{apartment}} to pursue medical training. Her friend Joan Rodker, who had met Regina when the two were [...] "idealistic communists" [...] living in Moscow in the 1930s, believes that Fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent as a mother, a communist activist and an admirer of the Soviet Union and that this led to his hatred for the Soviet Union. In letters to Rodker, Fischer's mother states her desire to pursue her own [...] "obsession" [...] of training in medicine and writes that her son would {{have to live in}} their Brooklyn apartment without her: [...] "It sounds terrible to leave a 16-year-old to his own devices, but he is probably happier that way". The apartment was on the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood that had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in New York City. Despite the alienation from her son, Regina, in 1960, protested the practices of the American Chess Foundation and staged a five-hour protest in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, urging President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send an American team to that year's chess Olympiad (set for Leipzig, East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain) and to help support the team financially.|$|E
