50|$|Ever since 1936 caving {{groups have}} been seeking to extend the <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of the cave, and thus far eleven {{principal}} sumps have been passed. Sump 12 has so far proved impassable. Work continues {{to find a way}} through the adjacent Sump 12b.|$|E
50|$|Fedor Soimonov {{was sent}} to map the then little <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of the Amur in 1757. He mapped the Shilka, which was partly in Chinese territory, but was turned back when he reached its {{confluence}} with the Argun.The Russian proselytization of Orthodox Christianity to the indigenous peoples along the Amur River {{was viewed as a}} threat by the Qing.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the obvious}} {{military}} {{applications of the}} subject, there are few readily available experimental studies of plasma's effect on the radar cross section (RCS) of aircraft, but plasma interaction with microwaves is a well <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of general plasma physics. Standard plasma physics reference texts are {{a good starting point}} and usually spend some time discussing wave propagation in plasmas.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 15 Kristoff {{made his}} own improvised {{climbing}} tools and started rock climbing and rappelling. He later joined caving clubs, including the Speleo Club. During caving activities {{in the western part}} of Bulgaria, he discovered new extensions of the Cave [...] "Goliamata Balabanova". The club mapped the new areas and extended the <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of the cave by more than 4,500 metres.|$|E

50|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} reviewed in many journals. In particular Ralph Alexander {{wrote in the}} Bulletin (New Series) of the American Math Society the following"Ambartzumian established a base camp in a little <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of geometry. From here a number of interesting problems {{can be seen from}} a new perspective. With luck a boom town could arise. At the very least this work is a significant contribution to the foundations of integral geometry".|$|E
50|$|Hornbostel's {{students}} include American composer Henry Cowell. Hornbostel specializ in African and Asian music, making many {{recordings and}} developing a system that facilitated the transcription of non-Western music from record to paper. He saw the musical tunings used by various cultural groups as an essential element in determining the character of their music, and did much work in comparing different tunings. A lot of this work has been criticized since, but in its time, this was a rarely <b>explored</b> <b>area.</b> Hornbostel also argued that music should {{be a part of}} more general anthropological research.|$|E
50|$|Exploration is a {{key element}} in most {{strategy}} games. The landscape is often shrouded in darkness, and this darkness is lifted as a player's units enters the area. The ability to explore may be inhibited by different kinds of terrain, such as hills, water, or other obstructions. Even after an area is explored, that area may become dim if the player does not patrol it. This design technique is called the fog of war, where the player can see the terrain but not the units within the <b>explored</b> <b>area.</b> This makes it possible for enemies to attack unexpectedly from otherwise explored areas.|$|E

50|$|The fourth {{mechanism}} of generation of ARF {{is related to}} an actively <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of manipulation of biological cells and particles in standing ultrasonic wave fields. It has been known since the 19th century that an object in a sound field is affected by a steady-state acoustic radiation force. In a classical experiment, Kundt and Lehman trapped dust particles in a tube by applying a standing-wave field. However, {{it is only in}} the last decades the phenomenon has found widespread application ranging from manipulation of cells in suspension, increasing the sensitivity of biosensors and immunochemical tests.|$|E
50|$|The impetus behind Operation Deep Freeze I was the International Geophysical Year 1957 - 58. IGY as it {{was known}} was a {{collaborative}} effort among forty nations to carry out earth science studies from the North Pole to the South Pole and at points in between. The United States along with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Norway, Chile, Argentina, and the U.S.S.R. agreed {{to go to the}} South Pole, the least <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> on Earth. Their goal was to advance world knowledge of Antarctic hydrography and weather systems, glacial movements, and marine life. The U.S. Navy was charged with supporting the U.S. scientists for their portion of the IGY studies.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at Hanlin village {{have also}} unearthed a city enclosed within walls which have twelve gates {{and show the}} tell tale marks of a moat. This city is in a rectangular shape and has an area of 541.4 ha. It is situated on an undulating terrain of volcanic material {{at a distance of}} about 16 km from the Ayeyarwady River and 27 km from the Mu River to its western side. In the <b>explored</b> <b>area,</b> hot water springs have been found which are stated to have curative properties. A particular find of interest is at excavation site designated HL-22 where three sets of standing stone slabs dating to the 2nd AD are indicative of the megalithic culture. The Southern Gateway has been dated to about 200 AD.|$|E

50|$|In 1740 Soimonov {{fell from}} grace {{after having been}} accused of conspiring against Empress Anna of Russia's lover Ernst Johann von Biron. He was exiled to Okhotsk, the main Russian base on the Pacific coast at that time, where he was {{condemned}} to live as a serf. He regained freedom in 1749 under Empress Elizabeth of Russia's rule {{and went back to}} his estate in Moscow where he kept a low profile until 1753, when he was appointed to lead the Nerchinsk Expedition and was sent to map the then little <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of the Amur River and its tributaries. He made the cartography of the Shilka, which was partly in Chinese territory, but was turned back when he reached its confluence with the Argun. As a result of these explorations he published the 'Atlas of Nerchinsk'.|$|E
5000|$|The second, {{much larger}} Cucuteni-Trypillian {{settlement}} {{is located on}} the left bank of the Tal'ianki River, west of Maidanets, which was inhabited near 3700-3600 BC. The settlement encompassed about 250 hectares (600 acres), measuring 1.5 km in length and 1.1 km wide, and was laid out in an oval pattern. This site was explored by an archaeologcal team led by M. Shmalij from 1971 to 1991, who employed magnetometric analysis to map out the settlement (made by V. Dudkin), revealing a total of 1575 buildings, including dwellings, fortifications, sanctuaries, and some two-storied houses (on 180 ha <b>explored</b> <b>area).</b> The excavation of the site produced almost 50 artifacts, including a unique collection of painted pottery and figurines. This settlement was one of the largest of the Cucuteni-Trypillian, making it also one of the largest settlements in the world during the time that it flourished.|$|E
50|$|Many games enhance replayability by {{unlocking}} a second, minor story mode {{once the}} main game's beaten. This second story or sub-scenario usually functions {{on the same}} game physics/mechanics and is set in an already <b>explored</b> <b>area,</b> and its main function is to expand on the main game's story and its unanswered questions, often focusing on a secondary character now turned protagonist, and his/her point of view. Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories features a 'Revers/Rebirth' sub-scenario that differs from regular gameplay and centers on secondary character Riku rather than Sora. This story plays {{during and after the}} events of the main game. Likewise, the 'Separate Ways' mini-game has the player take hold of Ada Wong, whose path intertwines with that of the game's protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy. The same plotpoints and events are retold from her perspective. A reedited version of Silent Hill 2 features the 'Born From a Wish' scenario, chronicling events prior to the game's main scenario through the eyes of key character Maria.|$|E

50|$|Jacqueline Eales is {{professor}} of early modern history at Canterbury Christ Church University and was appointed president of the Historical Association in 2011. She was educated at the University of London, where {{under the supervision of}} Conrad Russell she completed a PhD on the Harleys of Brampton Bryan and the English Civil War, which was later published under Cambridge University Press. She then taught at the University of London and the University of Kent, before taking up a post at what was then Canterbury Christ Church University College, now Canterbury Christ Church University. Her research interests also extend into the realm of women's history, which has led her to make a significant contribution to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, correcting the very masculine bias of the original dictionary. Her recent work, Women in Early Modern England, 1500-1700, published under UCL press has helped open up this under <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of research. As a testament to Eales' ability as a researcher, writer and an inspiring teacher she received a national teaching award in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The {{study of}} photogeochemistry is {{primarily}} concerned with naturally occurring materials, but may extend to include other materials, inasmuch as they are representative of, or bear some relation to, those found on Earth. For example, many inorganic compounds have been synthesized in the laboratory to study photocatalytic reactions. Although these studies are usually not undertaken {{in the context of}} environmental or Earth sciences, the study of such reactions is relevant to photogeochemistry if there is a geochemical implication (i.e. similar reactants or reaction mechanisms occur naturally). Similarly, photogeochemistry may also include photochemical reactions of naturally occurring materials that are not touched by sunlight, if there is the possibility that these materials may become exposed (e.g. deep soil layers uncovered by mining).Except for several isolated instances, studies that fit the definition of photogeochemistry have not been explicitly specified as such, but have been traditionally categorized as photochemistry, especially at the time when photochemistry was an emerging field or new facets of photochemistry were being explored. Photogeochemical research, however, may be set apart in light of its specific context and implications, thereby bringing more exposure to this [...] "poorly <b>explored</b> <b>area</b> of experimental geochemistry". Past studies that fit the definition of photogeochemistry may be designated retroactively as such.|$|E
5000|$|Attempts to {{preserve}} what it {{left of the}} area’s wild vegetation include a number of wildlife reserves. The Parque Estatal de la Sierra or Sierra State Park {{is located in the}} municipalities of Tacotalpa and Teapa. It also includes the village of Oxolotan, which is a traditional indigenous community and Tapijulapa, a Pueblo Mágico [...] The Villa Luz Ecological Reserve extends over forty hectares, with eighty percent covered in dense vegetation and in all there are various streams both fresh water and sulfur laced liquid which rise from springs in the earth. The Oxolotan River also passes through with several waterfalls, as well as the Sardinas Cave which has almost 1500 meters of <b>explored</b> <b>area.</b> The Kolem Jaa Ecological Ranch is a reserve of rainforest and springs with sulfur water. It is part of a reforestation effort in the higher elevations of the region. It contains a botanical garden with a large collection of orchids. The La Chontalpa Ecological Reserve is a state protected area on the Colegio de Postgraduado-Campus Tabasco campus founded in 1995 with 277 hectares. It {{is one of the last}} remains of the medium growth evergreen rainforest of Tabasco dominated by a tree called “canacoite” (Bravaisia integerrima). The reserve has 247 species of plants with some in danger of extinction. Other plants include cachimbo (Platymiscium yucatanum), tinco (Vatairea lundelii) and zapote prieto (Diospyros digyna). Wildlife includes mammals (20.2%), birds (61.3%), reptiles (10.9%) and amphibians (7.6%). It is located just off the Cárdenas-Coatzacoalco highway.|$|E
