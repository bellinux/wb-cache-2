50|$|The {{sympathetic}} storage reflex or pelvic-to-hypo-gastric reflex is initiated {{when the}} bladder swells. Stretch receptors cause postganglionic neurons to release norepinephrine (NE). NE causes the bladder {{to relax and}} the urethra to contract, thus preventing urine loss. The somatic storage reflex or the pelvic-to-pudendal or guarding reflex is initiated when one laughs, sneezes, or coughs, which causes increased bladder pressure. Glutamate is the primary <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitter</b> for the reflex. Glutamate activates NMDA and AMPA receptors which produce action potentials. These action potentials activate the release of acetylcholine causing the rhabdosphincter muscle fibers to contract. When the guarding reflex does not function normally, SUI occurs.|$|E
50|$|HSD2 neurons {{express the}} {{transcription}} factor Phox2b.

HSD2 neurons {{do not produce}} {{a wide array of}} other proteins that typify most other subtypes of NTS neurons, including tyrosine hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, nitric oxide synthase, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, neuropeptide FF, substance P, somatostatin, inhibin-β, glucagon-like peptide-1, corticotropin-releasing hormone, dynorphin, calretinin, and calbindin. A small number of HSD2 neurons (less than 2%) may express the neuropeptide galanin. Their lack of expression of the aforementioned markers suggests that HSD2 neurons form a unique subpopulation within the NTS. To date, there is no information available about the electrophysiologic characteristics of these neurons.|$|E
50|$|The {{neurotransmitter}} {{most often}} associated with EPSPs is the amino acid glutamate, and is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} of vertebrates. Its ubiquity at excitatory synapses has led to it being called the excitatory neurotransmitter. In some invertebrates, glutamate is the main <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitter</b> at the neuromuscular junction. In the neuromuscular junction of vertebrates, EPP (end-plate potentials) are mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which (along with glutamate) is one of the primary transmitters in the central nervous system of invertebrates.At the same time, GABA is the most common neurotransmitter associated with IPSPs in the brain. However, classifying neurotransmitters as such is technically incorrect, as there are several other synaptic factors that help determine a neurotransmitter's excitatory or inhibitory effects.|$|E

40|$|Most neurons {{release a}} single {{fast-acting}} low-molecular-weight transmitter at synapses to activate and open postsynaptic ion channels. We challenge this principle with evidence for corelease {{of the two}} major <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters,</b> glutamate and acetylcholine (ACh), from single identified neurons in the developing frog tadpole spinal cord. Whole-cell patch electrodes were used to record from single spinal neurons. When action potentials and inhibition were blocked, spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded. These were fully blocked only by joint application of glutamate [α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ] and nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) antagonists. Fast nAChR and slow NMDAR mEPSCs were isolated pharmacologically. We then show that some mEPSCs have both the fast nAChR rise and slow NMDAR decay and conclude that some individual synaptic vesicles corelease glutamate and ACh. Whole-cell recordings from pairs of neurons were then used to identify the spinal interneurons coreleasing the two <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters.</b> One anatomical class of interneuron with descending axons was found to excite other spinal neurons by activating nAChR, AMPAR, and NMDAR simultaneously at its synapses. Although Jonas, Bischofberger, and Sandkuhler [Jonas, P., Bischofberger, J. & Sandkuhler, J. (1998) Science 281, 419 - 424] showed that the inhibitory transmitters GABA and glycine can be coreleased at spinal synapses, the Xenopus tadpole provides a case where the two main CNS <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters</b> are released from single vesicles, and where the presynaptic neuron coreleasing two transmitters has been identified...|$|R

By trying to understand how naturally occurring neuromodulators might act, Margaret Livingstone, {{a graduate student at}} the time, injected serotonin or octopamine into two different lobsters. The results were surprising: the lobster injected with serotonin stood tall and looked just like a dominant animal while the lobster injected with octopamine adopted a lowered posture and looked like a subordinate animal. These lobster injection experiments were the birth of the aggressive behavior studies that are still ongoing in Kravitz's laboratory today.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{mechanisms}} that exist {{to regulate the}} expression of system Xc-, {{although it is not}} the sole determinate of extracellular glutamate or intracellular glutathione. An example is amino acid deprivation, which triggers up regulation of the transporter. A key regulator is extracellular glutamate; when it becomes excessive, it goes from an <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitter</b> to an excitotoxin. The inhibition of uptake of extracellular glutamate leads to oxidative glutamate toxicity or ferroptosis. This regulation may be done through Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs), which decrease extracellular glutamate and increase intracellular glutamate in astrocytes. When looking at its structure, xCT seems to be the main determinant for the system's activity. Glutamate and cystine can be transported in both directions, but, generally, more cystine is imported and more glutamate is exported. Extracellular glutamate acts as a competitive inhibitor for cystine uptake via system Xc-.|$|E
50|$|After neurotransmitters are synthesized, {{they are}} {{packaged}} {{and stored in}} vesicles. These vesicles are pooled together in terminal boutons of the presynaptic neuron. When there {{is a change in}} voltage in the terminal bouton, voltage-gated calcium channels embedded in the membranes of these boutons become activated. These allow Ca2+ ions to diffuse through these channels and bind with synaptic vesicles within the terminal boutons. Once bounded with Ca2+, the vesicles dock and fuse with the presynaptic membrane, and release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by a process known as exocytosis. The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to postsynaptic receptors embedded on the postsynaptic membrane of another neuron. There are two families of receptors: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors are a combination of a receptor and an ion channel. When ionotropic receptors are activated, certain ion species such as Na+ to enter the postsynaptic neuron, which depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane. If more of the same type of postsynaptic receptors are activated, then more Na+ will enter the postsynaptic membrane and depolarize cell. Metabotropic receptors on the other hand activate second messenger cascade systems that result in the opening of ion channel located some place else on the same postsynaptic membrane. Although slower than ionotropic receptors that function as on-and-off switches, metabotropic receptors have the advantage of changing the cell's responsiveness to ions and other metabolites, examples being gamma amino-butyric acid (inhibitory transmitter), glutamic acid (<b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitter),</b> dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, melanin, serotonin, melatonin, endorphins, dynorphins, nociceptin, and substance P.|$|E
40|$|Bv 8 is a pronociceptive peptide {{that binds}} to two G-protein coupled prokineticin receptors, PK-R 1 and PK-R 2. These receptors are {{localized}} in the dorsal horn of {{the spinal cord}} and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of nociceptive neurons in rodents. Systemic administration of Bv 8 elicits a biphasic reduction in nociceptive thresholds to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Here, the possibility that Bv 8 might directly modulate the expression and release of <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters</b> within the early and late phases of hyperalgesia was evaluated. Administration of Bv 8 to mouse lumbar spinal cord sections produced a direct, significant and concentration-related release of CGRP. Bv 8 - or capsaicin-stimulated CGRP release was markedly enhanced in tissues taken from Bv 8 -pretreated mice during the late, but not the early, phase of hyperalgesia. Pretreatment of rats with protein synthesis inhibitors blocked {{the expression of the}} late, but not early, phase of Bv 8 -induced hyperalgesia. Finally, during the late-phase of hyperalgesia, there was an upregulation of CGRP and substance P immunoreactivity in the rat lumbar dorsal horn and DRG. Such upregulation was prevented by pretreatment with protein synthesis inhibitors. These data suggest that Bv 8 induces hyperalgesia by direct release of <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters</b> in the spinal cord, consistent with the first phase of hyperalgesia. Additionally, Bv 8 elicits a subsequent, protein-synthesis dependent increase in expression and release of <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters</b> that may underlie the long-lasting second phase of hyperalgesia. Activation of prokineticin receptors may therefore contribute to persistent hyperalgesia occurring as a consequence of tissue injury further suggesting that these receptors are attractive targets for development of therapeutics for pain treatment. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The ampullae detect {{electric}} {{fields in}} the water, or more precisely the potential difference between the voltage at the skin pore and the voltage {{at the base of}} the electroreceptor cells. A positive pore stimulus would decrease the rate of nerve activity coming from the electroreceptor cells, and a negative pore stimulus would increase the rate of nerve activity coming from the electroreceptor cells. Each ampulla contains a single layer of cells that contains electrically excitable receptor cells separated by supporting cells. The cells are connected by apical tight junctions so that no current leaks between the cells. The apical faces of the receptor cells have a small surface area with a high concentration of voltage dependent calcium channels and calcium activated potassium channels. Because the canal wall has a very high resistance, all of the voltage difference between the pore of the canal and the ampulla is dropped across the receptor epithelium which is about 50 microns thick. Because the basal membranes of the receptor cells have a lower resistance, most of the voltage is dropped across the apical faces which are excitable and are poised at threshold. Inward calcium current across the receptor cells depolarizes the basal faces causing presynaptic calcium release and release of <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitter</b> onto the afferent nerve fibers. One of the first descriptions of calcium activated potassium channels was based on studies of the ampulla of Lorenzini in the skate. Large conductance calcium activated potassium channels (BK channels) have recently been demonstrated in the ampulla by cloning.|$|E

40|$|SummaryStable {{wakefulness}} requires orexin/hypocretin neurons (OHNs) and OHR 2 receptors. OHNs sense diverse environmental cues {{and control}} arousal accordingly. For unknown reasons, OHNs contain multiple <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters,</b> including OH peptides and glutamate. To analyze their cotransmission within computational frameworks for control, we optogenetically stimulated OHNs and examined resulting outputs (spike patterns) in a downstream arousal regulator, the histamine neurons (HANs). OHR 2 s were essential for sustained HAN outputs. OHR 2 -dependent HAN output increased linearly during constant OHN input, {{suggesting that the}} OHN→HANOHR 2 module may function as an integral controller. OHN stimulation evoked OHR 2 -dependent slow postsynaptic currents, similar to midnanomolar OH concentrations. Conversely, glutamate-dependent output transiently communicated OHN input onset, peaking rapidly then decaying alongside OHN→HAN glutamate currents. Blocking glutamate-driven spiking did not affect OH-driven spiking and vice versa, suggesting isolation (low cross-modulation) of outputs. Therefore, in arousal regulators, cotransmitters may translate distinct features of OHN activity into parallel, nonredundant control signals for downstream effectors...|$|R

In particular, A 1 adenosine receptors inhibit release of <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters,</b> and A 2 A and P 2 Y receptors may modulate the release of dopamine. Sequential ECT may lead to changes in purinoceptor expression in mesolimbic and mesocortical regions of the brain implicated in depression and other mood disorders. In particular, increased expression of P 2 X 7 receptors on glial cells would lead to increased release of cytokines, chemokines and neurotrophins. In summary, we suggest that ATP release following ECT involves neurons, glial cells and neuron–glial interactions acting via both P 2 and after breakdown to adenosine via P 1 receptors.

The presence in dendrites of polysomes and of mRNAs encoding microtubule-associated protein 2, calcium calmodulin kinase II, alpha-synapsin-associated protein, and components of the GABA(A) and NMDA receptors strongly suggests that these proteins can be translated in the dendrites, close to the sites at which they function.

40|$|Synaptic {{activity}} in {{the central nervous system}} undergoes rapid state-dependent changes, requiring constant adaptation of the homeostasis between excitation and inhibition. The underlying mechanisms are, however, largely unclear. Chronic changes in network activity result in enhanced production of the inhibitory transmitter GABA, indicating that presynaptic GABA content is a variable parameter for homeostatic plasticity. Here we tested whether such changes in inhibitory transmitter content do also occur at the fast time scale required to ensure inhibition-excitation-homeostasis in dynamic cortical networks. We found that intense stimulation of afferent fibers in the CA 1 region of mouse hippocampal slices yielded a rapid and lasting increase in quantal size of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This potentiation was mediated by the uptake of GABA and glutamate into presynaptic endings of inhibitory interneurons (the latter serving as precursor for the synthesis of GABA). Thus, enhanced release of inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters</b> from active networks leads to enhanced presynaptic GABA content. Thereby, inhibitory efficacy follows local neuronal activity, constituting a negative feedback loop and providing a mechanism for rapid homeostatic scaling in cortical circuits...|$|R

Experimental neuropathic pain, however, also depends on central changes, including descending facilitation arising from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and upregulation of spinal dynorphin. A possible intersection of these influences at the spinal level was explored by measuring evoked, <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitter</b> release in tissues taken from nerve-injured animals with or without previous manipulation of descending modulatory systems. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) produced expected tactile and thermal hyperesthesias. Capsaicin-evoked calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release was markedly enhanced in lumbar spinal tissue from SNL rats when compared with sham-operated controls. Enhanced, evoked CGRP release from SNL rats was blocked by anti-dynorphin A (1 – 13) antiserum; this treatment did not alter evoked release in tissues from sham-operated rats. Dorsolateral funiculus lesion (DLF) or destruction of RVM neurons expressing �-opioid receptors with dermorphin–saporin, blocked tactile and thermal hypersensitivity, as well as SNL-induced upregulation of spinal dynorphin. Spinal tissues from these DLF-lesioned or dermorphin–saporin-treated SNL rats did not exhibit enhanced capsaicinevoked CGRP-IR release. These data demonstrate exaggerated release of <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitter</b> from primary afferents after injury to peripheral nerves, supporting the likely importance of increased afferent input as a driving force of neuropathic pain.

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of the fetal and newborn brain to events in utero or at birth that cause damage arising from perturbations of cerebral blood flow and metabolism, such as the accumulation of free radicals and <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters</b> to neurotoxic levels, has received considerable attention {{over the last few}} decades. Attention has usually been on the damage to cerebral structures, particularly, periventricular white matter. The rapid growth of the cerebellum {{in the latter half of}} fetal life in species with long gestations, such as the human and sheep, suggests that this may be a particularly important time for the development of cerebellar structure and function. In this short review, we summarize data from recent studies with fetal sheep showing that the developing cerebellum is particularly sensitive to infectious processes, chronic hypoxia and asphyxia. The data demonstrates that the cerebellum should be further studied in insults of this nature as it responds differently to the remainder of the brain. Damage to this region of the brain has implications not only for the development of motor control and posture, but also for higher cognitive processes and the subsequent development of complex behaviours, such as learning, memory and attention...|$|R
40|$|The loss {{of tissue}} {{perfusion}} represents the pathological basis underlying acute cerebrovascular events. The occlusion of the brain's blood supply by intravascular thrombotic and/or atherosclerotic phenomena {{results in a}} disruption in tissue oxygen and glucose delivery. This inevitably impairs the cell's capacity to synthesize ATP. Despite initial attempts to maintain consistent ATP stores through anaerobic glycolysis and adenosine release, the starving tissue experiences loss of membrane ionic gradients, secondary to the inactivation of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. A significant increase in intracellular calcium concentration is triggered by the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels, the activation of ligand-gated calcium channels, and by the inactivation of the Na+/Ca+ exchanger. In addition, massive release of the main excitatory, inhibitory, and monoamine neurotransmitters (many of which become excitotoxins at high concentration) is also observed. The above <b>excitatory</b> <b>transmitters,</b> such as glutamine, for example, {{play an important role}} in the over-stimulation of the NMDA receptor, which in turn promotes excessive calcium influx (1). The cytotoxic effects of calcium are associated with the activation of lipases, proteases, and endonucleases, as well as xanthine oxidase and neuronal NO synthase, capable of either direct or indirect destruction of cellular structures (2) ...|$|R
