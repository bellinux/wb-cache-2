40|$|Whether to keep {{products}} segregated (e. g., unbundled) or integrate {{some or all}} of them (e. g., bundle) {{has been}} a problem of profound interest in areas such as portfolio theory in finance, risk capital allocations in insurance and marketing of consumer products. Such decisions are inherently complex and depend on factors such as the underlying product values and consumer preferences, the latter being frequently described using value functions, also known as utility functions in economics. In this paper, we develop decision rules for multiple products, which we generally call ‘exposure units’ to naturally cover manifold scenarios spanning well beyond ‘products’. Our findings show, e. g. that the celebrated Thaler's principles of mental accounting hold as originally postulated when the values of all <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> are positive (i. e. all are gains) or all negative (i. e. all are losses). In the case of <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> with mixed-sign values, decision rules are much more complex and rely on cataloging the Bell number of cases that grow very fast depending on the number of <b>exposure</b> <b>units.</b> Consequently, in the present paper, we provide detailed rules for the integration and segregation decisions in the case up to three <b>exposure</b> <b>units,</b> and partial rules for the arbitrary number of units. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assess dermal {{exposure}} to bitumen condensate among road pavers and indoor mastic workers in multiple crews using a semi-quantitative observational method [DeRmal Exposure Assessment Method (DREAM) ]. Methods: Two skilled observers assessed {{dermal exposure}} to bitumen condensate among 85 asphalt workers from 12 crews from nine companies active within four European countries using the DREAM methodology, which produces {{an estimate of}} exposure expressed in dimensionless DREAM units. Both observers independently evaluated each crew member's job (N = 14 jobs) for road paving and mastic applications. Potential and actual dermal exposures were estimated for hands {{and for the rest}} of the body separately, taking into account the effect of protective clothing. To evaluate the reproducibility of the observational method intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated. The <b>exposures</b> in DREAM <b>units</b> were modelled using linear mixed models to estimate average relative scores for each job. Correlations between dermal exposure parameters were evaluated by estimating Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: A total of 170 observations were completed by two observers independently (n = 118 and n = 52 for 59 road pavers and 26 mastic workers, respectively) in 11 days. The mean ICCs (for potential and actual <b>exposure</b> in DREAM <b>units)</b> varied between 0. 74 and 0. 80 with values for actual units being slightly higher. Geometric mean potential dermal <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> of mastic workers were higher than for road pavers (factor 3 for hands and factor 4 for rest of the body). Differences for actual dermal <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> were smaller for hands (factor 2) and larger for actual <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> of rest of the body (factor 5). Differences in dermal exposure at the hands between jobs within a paving crew were much larger than between jobs within a mastic crew. Within paving crews, a consistent pattern for all <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> emerged with 'screed man' and 'raker' as the two highest exposed jobs. Within mastic crews, 'driver dumper truck' and 'spreader of mastic' were scored as the two jobs with the highest <b>exposure</b> <b>units.</b> Potential and actual <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> were highly correlated. Hands were more profoundly exposed than the rest of the body, with transfer from contaminated surface to the hands as the most important route. Conclusions: DREAM observations were reproducible and showed a consistent dermal exposure pattern among the observed crews. The study provided a clear picture of dermal exposure among road pavers and indoor mastic workers, with the mastic workers being considerably more highly exposed. The most important route of exposure appeared to be transferred from contaminated surfaces to the hands. © The Author 2011...|$|R

40|$|Background There is an {{increasing}} need for allergen inhalation systems to perform basic clinical research and test anti-allergic drugs under well-controlled conditions. This requires stability of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity, as well as allergen concentration and reproducible induction of allergic symptoms. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to validate an environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>unit</b> for controlled human pollen inhalation studies in participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Methods Temperature, relative humidity, and air flow rate were kept constant with an air conditioning system. Pollen atmosphere was generated using a specially designed feeding system and monitored online by laser counter and offline using rotating rod samplers. Efficacy (total nasal symptom score, nasal air flow rate, nasal secretion) and safety (lung function) parameters were evaluated at different pollen concentrations and repeated allergen challenges. Results Temperature, humidity, and air flow rate in the environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>unit</b> remained constant within a range of < 2 %. The spatial distribution and the temporal stability of the pollen concentration varied only slightly over 4 h (+/- 10 % and < 4 %, respectively). Dose-dependent induction of allergic rhinitis symptoms, reduction in nasal air flow rate, and increase in nasal secretion were observed over time. These effects were reproducible from day to day. Lung function remained clinically normal at all concentrations and from day to day. Conclusions Thus, pollen exposure in the environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>unit</b> is an effective, reproducible, safe, and suitable method for single-centre clinical studies on the efficacy of anti-allergic treatment or basic clinical research...|$|E

During smoke exposure only the lower surface of each Transwell is supplied with culture medium {{from the bottom of the}} culture chambers.

Hazard index results indicated no unacceptable risk to the falcon from the soil ingestion pathway, including a measure of cumulative effects from multiple contaminants that assumes a linear additive toxicity type. Scaling home ranges {{on the basis of}} maximizing falcon height for viewing prey decreased estimated risk by 69 % in a canyons-based home range and increased estimated risk by 40 % in a river-based home range. Improving model realism by weighting simulated falcon foraging based on distance from potential nest sites decreased risk by 93 % in one <b>exposure</b> <b>unit</b> and by 82 % in a second <b>exposure</b> <b>unit.</b> It was demonstrated that choice of toxicity reference values can have a substantial impact on risk estimates.

50|$|The PAR model understands a {{disaster}} as the intersection between socio-economic pressure and physical exposure. Risk is explicitly {{defined as a}} function of the perturbation, stressor, or stress and the vulnerability of the exposed unit (Blaikie et al, 1994).

Used primarily to address social groups facing disaster events, the model emphasises distinctions in vulnerability by different <b>exposure</b> <b>units</b> such as social class and ethnicity. The model distinguishes between three components on the social side: root causes, dynamic pressures and unsafe conditions, and one component on the natural side, the natural hazards itself. Principal root causes include “economic, demographic and political processes”, which affect the allocation and distribution of resources between different groups of people. Dynamic Pressures translate economic and political processes in local circumstances (e.g. migration patterns).
