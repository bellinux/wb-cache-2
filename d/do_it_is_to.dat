The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54. Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the film, Thiruvilaiyadal, is {{justified}} {{in the beginning of}} the film as a voiceover.

Hence the title symbolically means the games played by Shiva. By opening in media res, the film follows a nonlinear narrative.

There will be doubt about it, whether he gained or lost more by that deep devotion to another creature which made his life a misery to him because that other one had gone; whether, too, he might not have better hidden his sorrow than have shown it even to his friend.

60|$|And {{his wife}} had given him up.

60|$|The {{fact that}} he was about to do so, and even the hour of the start, appear to have been the common {{property}} of the camp some days before the actual move. The 'Times' correspondent under the date December 7th details all that it is intended to <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the credit of our Generals as men, but to their detriment as soldiers, that they seem throughout the campaign to have shown extraordinarily little power of dissimulation. They did the obvious, and usually allowed it to be obvious what they were about to do. One thinks of Napoleon striking at Egypt; how he gave it abroad that the real object of the expedition was Ireland, but breathed into the ears of one or two intimates that in very truth it was bound for Genoa. The leading official at Toulon had no more idea where the fleet and army of France had gone than the humblest caulker in the yard. However, it is not fair to expect the subtlety of the Corsican from the downright Saxon, but it remains strange and deplorable that in a country filled with spies any one should have known in advance that a so-called 'surprise' was about to be attempted.|$|E
60|$|The pessimist is {{commonly}} spoken {{of as the}} man in revolt. He is not. Firstly, because it requires some cheerfulness to continue in revolt, and secondly, because pessimism appeals to the weaker side of everybody, and the pessimist, therefore, drives as roaring a trade as the publican. The person who is really in revolt is the optimist, who generally lives and dies in a desperate and suicidal effort to persuade {{all the other people}} how good they are. It has been proved a hundred times over that if you really wish to enrage people and make them angry, even unto death, the right way to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> tell them that they are all the sons of God. Jesus Christ was crucified, it may be remembered, not because of anything he said about God, but on a charge of saying that a man could in three days pull down and rebuild the Temple. Every one of the great revolutionists, from Isaiah to Shelley, have been optimists. They have been indignant, not about the badness of existence, but about the slowness of men in realizing its goodness. The prophet who is stoned is not a brawler or a marplot. He is simply a rejected lover. He suffers from an unrequited attachment to things in general.|$|E

60|$|Surely {{the art of}} {{reporting}} speeches is in a strange state of degeneration. We should not object, perhaps, to the reporter's making the speeches much shorter than they are; but we do object to his making all the speeches much worse than they are. And the method which he employs is one which is dangerously unjust. When a statesman or philosopher makes an important speech, there are several courses which the reporter might take without being unreasonable. Perhaps the most reasonable course of all would be not to report the speech at all. Let the world live and love, marry and give in marriage, without that particular speech, as they did (in some desperate way) {{in the days when}} there were no newspapers. A second course would be to report a small part of it; but to get that right. A third course, far better if you can <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> understand the main purpose and argument of the speech, and report that in clear and logical language of your own. In short, the three possible methods are, first, to leave the man's speech alone; second, to report what he says or some complete part of what he says; and third, to report what he means. But the present way {{of reporting}} speeches (mainly created, I think, by the scrappy methods of the Daily Mail) is something utterly different from both these ways, and quite senseless and misleading.|$|E
60|$|Are {{people happy}} together? Do they pull well together?

Do not men try to better {{themselves}} {{at the expense of}} the parish--to the injury of the parish? Do not men, when they try to raise their own family, seem to think that the simplest way to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pull down their neighbour's family; to draw away their custom; oust them from their places, or hurt their characters in order to rise upon their fall? so that though they are brothers, members of the same church, nation and parish, the greater part of them are, in practice, at war with each other--trying to live at each other's expense. Now, is this profitable? So far from it, that if you will watch the history, either of the whole world, or of this country, or of this one parish, you will find that by far the greater part of the misery in it has sprung from this very selfishness and separateness--from the perpetual struggle between man and man, and between family and family: so that there have been men, and those learned, and thoughtful, and well-meaning men enough, who have said that the only cure for the world's quarrelling and selfishness was to take all children away from their parents, and bring them up in large public schools; ay, and even to try plans which are sinful, foul, and wicked, all in order to prevent parents knowing which were their own children, that they might care for all the children in the parish as much as if they were their own.|$|E
6000|$|Third. Prayer is a sincere, sensible, and an AFFECTIONATE {{pouring out}} of the soul to God. O! the heat, strength, life, vigour, and affection, that is in right prayer! [...] "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God" [...] (Psa 42:1). [...] "I have longed after thy precepts" [...] (Psa 119:40). [...] "I have longed for thy salvation" [...] (ver 174). [...] "My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God" [...] (Psa 84:2). [...] "My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy {{judgments}} at all times" [...] (Psa 119:20). Mark ye here, [...] "My soul longeth," [...] it longeth, it longeth, &c. O what affection is here discovered in prayer! The like you have in Daniel. [...] "O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God" [...] (Dan 9:19). Every syllable carrieth a mighty vehemency in it. This is called the fervent, or the working prayer, by James. And so again, [...] "And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly" [...] (Luke 22:44). Or had his affections more and more drawn out after God for his helping hand. O! How wide are the most of men with their prayers from this prayer, that is, PRAYER in God's account! Alas! The greatest part of men make no conscience {{at all of the}} duty; and as for them that <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be feared that many of them are very great strangers to a sincere, sensible, and affectionate pouring out their hearts or souls to God; but even content themselves with a little lip-labour and bodily exercise, mumbling over a few imaginary prayers. When the affections are indeed engaged in prayer, then, then the whole man is engaged, and that in such sort, that the soul will spend itself to nothing, as it were, rather than it will go without that good desired, even communion and solace with Christ. And hence it is that the saints have spent their strengths, and lost their lives, rather than go without the blessing (Psa 69:3; 38:9,10; Gen 32:24,26).|$|E
