40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the Asian, European, North American and Middle East air freight networks of combination passenger and freight and all-freight carriers using air freight capacity datasets {{for the period}} 1999 - 2009. The chapter begins by reviewing {{some of the key}} trends that have shaped and characterised air freight markets during the 1990 s and 2000 s. The impact of air transport market liberalisation is identified as a key determinant of changing carrier behaviour, particularly in relation to network structure organisation. The second major section of the chapter {{examines the}} sources of data available for tracking trends in the air freight sector. The lack of comprehensive datasets detailing the activities of the <b>integrated</b> <b>carriers</b> is discussed. Using the Official Airline Guide (OAG) historical databases that list ex-post carrier schedules for each year globally, annual data series indicating freight capacity of all Asian, European and North American and selected Middle Eastern carriers are determined and the general trends are described. The US T- 100 Database is used to derive an equivalent distribution for the two largest <b>integrated</b> <b>carriers,</b> FedEx and UPS. The changing nature of industry organisation is discussed and the key players in each region are distinguished. For the combination carriers, passenger and freight network structures are compared for the period 1999 - 2009. The fortunes of the key air freight hubs are reviewed over the same period. The chapter concludes with a discussion about the key driving factors in dictating the future direction of the industry in the coming decade.

40|$|SummaryNonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are modular {{proteins}} that produce peptide antibiotics and siderophores. These enzymes act as catalytic assembly lines where substrates, covalently bound to <b>integrated</b> <b>carrier</b> domains, are delivered to adjacent catalytic domains. The carrier domains are initially loaded by adenylation domains, which use two distinct conformations to catalyze sequentially the adenylation of the substrate and the thioesterification of the pantetheine cofactor. We have used a mechanism-based inhibitor {{to determine the}} crystal structure of an engineered adenylation-carrier domain protein illustrating the intermolecular interaction between the adenylation and carrier domains. This structure enabled directed mutations to improve the interaction between nonnative partner proteins.

40|$|Abstract—The Hatch filter is a code-smoothing {{technique}} using <b>integrated</b> <b>carrier</b> phase observations. It is an {{averaging filter}} that can smooth pseudorange measurements with continuous carrier phase. It {{is well known}} that if the smoothing window is an averaging constant, the filter diverges because of opposite signs of the ionospheric error in the code pseudorange and carrier phase. To solve the problem, this paper suggests a new algorithm for the optimal Hatch filter whose smoothing window width varies adaptively depending on the ionospheric delay variation and the satellite elevation. We use the ionosphere mesh model of the SBAS to calculate the ionosphere delay variation. Based a single day’s GPS data, the position accuracy of the pseudorange using optimal Hatch filter outperforms both the pseudorange calculation using classical Hatch filter and the pseudorange calculation without smoothing.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Naval Oceanographic Office developed the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Carrier</b> Acoustic Prediction System (ICAPS) {{in order to}} perform on-scene acoustic forecasts for the Fleet. To evaluate the system, bathythermographic information was obtained for points in the North Atlantic during the naval exercise "SEACONEX. " Fleet Numerical Weather Center (FNWC) provided climatological and synoptic temperature profiles along with related acoustical forecasts for the points under study. Similarly, ICAPS supplied a combined climatological and synoptic temperature profile and related acoustics forecasts {{for each of the}} points. Comparisons of the two systems were made against an actual mean temperature profile and the acoustic forecasts that it generated. It appears that the acoustic forecasts were not reliable tactically. Yet, the synoptic forecasts by FNWC did yield reliable low frequency acoustic forecasts within the limits of computer roundoff error. ICAPS capability for only a single temperature profile input proved to yield reliable acoustic forecasts, and should be used as the real-time acoustic forecast system for the Fleet.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{the theory and}} simulation results of a GPS-based Azimuth/Gradient determination instrument for a land vehicle, using two GPS receivers to realize interferometry. Our purpose is to design a system, which is both robust and accurate. A simulation system is designed and developed to simulate the GPS constellation, the required carrier phase observation and ephemeris, {{the dynamics of the}} land vehicle and the signal processing for Azimuth / Gradient determination. This system uses the interferometric processing of the GPS L 1 signals to determine the Azimuth / Gradient using Euler angle rotations. On the basis of the carrier phase observation model, the non-linear equation is solved iteratively. After coordinate system transformation, the Azimuth / Gradient are computed in body frame. Utilizing the proper maneuver of the vehicle, the integer ambiguity is resolved by an instantaneous method, i. e. solution for the GPS <b>integrated</b> <b>carrier</b> Doppler wavelength ambiguities (integer ambiguity) doesn’t depend on the observations over a long time. In this way, further improvement in the robustness of the realization is achieved because the system could be quickly reset and initialized at any time. This instantaneous property, together with the cycle slip detection routine, renders the system resistant to cycle slip. Results are presented using simulated GPS L 1 signal with the effects of multi-path, ionosphere, troposphere and receiver electronic noise, proving its accuracy and stability...|$|E
40|$|I. The {{reversible}} {{reaction of}} oxygen with cobaltodihistidine to form oxy-bis-(cobaltodihistidine) in aqueous olutions {{was used as}} a model system to study the characteristics of facilitated iffusion in membranes. The cobaltodihistidine molecule served as the model carrier species, and the unequal diffusivities of the two carrier forms as well as a two-step reaction mechanism added a degree of complexity not treated in previous tudies. 2. Facilitation of the oxygen flux through the membrane increased with oxygen gradients but also showed saturation effects at high oxygen partial pressures. Facilitation was proportional to (membrane thickness) -°. 92 in the range of 5 o- 28 o #, and to total carrier concentration up to o. o 3 o M cobaltodihistidine. There was no further increase in facilitation at higher carrier concentration because of the solubility limit for cobaltodihistidine. Facilitation increased with temperature and showed an apparent activation energy of 4. 44 kcal/mole. Maximum facilitation was found in a pH region near neutrality. 3. The facilitated fluxes were about one-third of the magnitude predicted by a simple model which assumes chemical equilibrium throughout the film but could be accurately predicted by a complete model which allows for a finite reaction rate within the membrane. The correct equations and boundary conditions for both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium odels are delineated, as well as numerical techniques for obtaining solutions. The total carrier concentration, free plus complexed, is not necessarily uniform throughout each position in the membrane, but the <b>integrated</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration profile across the membrane is a constant...|$|E
40|$|Time-resolved optical {{techniques}} of photoluminescence (PL), light-induced transient grating(LITG), and differential transmission spectroscopy {{were used to}} investigate carrier dynamics in a single 50 -nm thick In 0. 13 Ga 0. 97 N epilayer at high photoexcitation levels. Data in wide spectral, temporal, excitation, and temperature ranges revealed novel features in spectral distribution of recombination rates as follows: at low injection levels, an inverse correlation of carrier life time increasing with temperature and diffusivity decreasing with temperature confirmed a mechanism of diffusion-limited nonradiative recombination at extended defects. Carrier dynamics in the spectral region below the absorption edge but ∼ 70 [*]meV above the PL band revealed a recombination rate that increased with excitation, while recombination rate in PL emission band (420 – 430 [*]nm) decreased after saturation of trapping centers. Monitoring of spectrally <b>integrated</b> <b>carrier</b> dynamics by LITG technique allowed us to ascribe the enhanced recombination rate to bimolecular recombination and determine its coefficient B[*]=[*] 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 11 [*]cm 3 /s. Complementary measurements unveiled the cause of PL efficiency saturation at injection levels above 5 [*]×[*] 1018 [*]cm− 3, attributable to bandgap renormalization in the extended states above the PL emission band, which encumbers carrier transfer from high-to-low energy states. As the degree of localization, and therefore, {{the total number of}} band tail states is expected to increase with In content, their impact to dependence of PL efficiency on excitation density could even be stronger for higher In compositions. These results provided insight that spectrally resolved carrier generation-recombination rates are excitation-dependent and would {{play a critical role in}} saturation of internal quantum efficiency in InGaN alloys used in light emitters, such as light emitting diodes...|$|E
