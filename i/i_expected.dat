I try to take {{characters}} that I think are challenging and a little complicated and hopefully really smart and thoughtful and compassionate. I think Michael is all those things. He {{seems to have a}} lot of bad luck." [...] He defends Michael's behavior in season two, saying [...] " [...] keeps stepping into more trouble than he actually asked for". Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!" [...] and [...] "Have you seen my boy?".|$|E
500|$|Depp said {{of working}} with Baron Cohen, when asked what he was like in real life (meaning, not doing one of his {{trademark}} characters), [...] "He's not what <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> I didn't look at those characters and think, 'This will be the sweetest guy in the world'. He's incredibly nice. A real gentleman, kind of elegant. I was impressed with him. He's kind of today's equivalent of Peter Sellers." ...|$|E
500|$|The memoirs were controversial, and sparked {{complaints}} from many quarters. [...] Grant (serving as President when Sherman's memoirs first appeared) later remarked that others {{had told him}} that Sherman treated Grant unfairly but [...] "when I finished the book, I found I approved every word; that ... it was a true book, an honorable book, creditable to Sherman, just to his companions—to myself particularly so—just such a book as <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> Sherman would write." ...|$|E

500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time I told him what <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
500|$|On {{collaborating with}} Ludacris, Cruz said, [...] "With Ludacris, {{pretty much every}} track he's ever {{featured}} on sounds amazing. I gave him a quick call {{and asked him if}} he could get on the record, and he recorded it and sent it over. As <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> there was nothing I needed to change. It sounded perfect. He put my name in there, which is great – so people know to pronounce it now properly, hopefully." [...] The version featuring Ludacris was originally released digitally as the b-side to [...] "No Other One" [...] in November 2009, before in the United States in February 2010.|$|E
500|$|By the 1970s Tunis {{felt his}} message had been ignored or {{misunderstood}} by most Americans, saying [...] "Nobody has paid attention... There {{was a time}} when <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> to do some good. But that was a long while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|E

500|$|In August 2010, Walker {{signed for}} Watford on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract, with Watford having the option {{on a third}} year. He made his Watford debut a day after joining the club, coming on as a 76th-minute {{substitute}} in a 0–0 draw away at Hull City. Walker also came on as a late substitute in three more games in September 2010, including in Watford's 3–1 victory against his former employers, Middlesbrough.

500|$|When Songz began {{recording}} for Ready; {{the purpose}} of the album was to crossover and increase his exposure on radio. The album's lead single, [...] "I Need a Girl" [...] was released to connect to mainstream radio. Songz said that [...] " [...] was a very radio-geared record which would do great and play on radio heavily during whatever time. It wasn't a record <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> to last forever, or one I was even excited about singing, but it was a record I knew would do well." [...] Speaking of the following singles, Songz thought that [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] would be a [...] "career-defining record, and I knew 'Say Aah' would be a monster club record." ...|$|E
500|$|Asch {{suggested}} that Sherif's {{results could be}} largely influenced from the environment of a laboratory experiment. Because the experiment was designed to have each of the passages have very few differences between them, participants were faced with a dilemma when asked to distinguish between them. The experimenter and other neighboring participants may appear to find the task obvious, so the participant attends to any clues that might help him make the decision. In fear of looking ridiculous, the participant might now approach the task as, [...] "Which of these am <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> to like and dislike?" [...] With the only information that varies being the author, the participant might make conclusions about the quotes based on this one piece of information that varies.|$|E

500|$|Known as an {{offensive}} defenceman {{at the outset}} of his NHL career, Pronovost played an aggressive rushing style that led Red Wings fans to call him [...] "Detroit's own Flying Frenchman". He also established a reputation as a physical player who rarely missed time to serious injury. He overcame numerous injuries, including a cracked vertebrae suffered in 1954. [...] Among his other injuries, he suffered a broken jaw, broke his wrist twice, separated his shoulder and broke his nose 14 times. By age 32, he had required over 200 stitches to close various cuts and lacerations. Pronovost viewed the injuries as part of the game: [...] "My game is a contact sport. It's a game of men. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> to get bounced and get my lumps. I also expected to play in every single game." ...|$|E
500|$|Gabby West, who won {{the second}} season of Scream Queens, plays Kara in the film. [...] Chester Bennington, the lead vocalist of the {{alternative}} rock band Linkin Park, has {{a role in the}} film playing Evan, a white power skinhead. Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role. He said, [...] "It was actually a little more difficult than <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> because it took a lot for me {{to figure out how to}} portray this guy and what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I thought maybe I was overthinking it, and I met with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' [...] ". Devon Bostick was offered to reprise his role as Brent from Saw VI, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Mint {{officials}} originally {{assumed that}} whatever design {{was selected for}} the double eagle would simply be scaled down for the three lower denominations. [...] In May 1907, however, President Roosevelt decided that the eagle and double eagle would bear different designs, a departure from past practice. [...] In August (the month of Saint-Gaudens' death from cancer), outgoing Mint Director George E. Roberts wrote, [...] "no instructions have been received from the President as to the half and quarter eagle, but <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> that the eagle design would be used upon them". [...] After considerable difficulties, the Mint issued the eagle and double eagle based on Saint-Gaudens' designs later that year. [...] The eagle featured Liberty wearing an Indian headdress on the obverse and a perched bald eagle on the reverse; the double eagle featured Liberty striding forward on the obverse and a flying eagle on the reverse.|$|E

500|$|On August 7, Roosevelt ordered Secretary Cortelyou to {{have the}} designs for the eagle and double eagle {{finalized}} and in production by September 1.

Norris, instructing him to [...] "have this matter taken up at once and the President's instructions carried out; and everything possible {{must be done to}} expedite the work." [...] Preston wrote to Roberts, asking for information about the new coinage, and the former Mint director responded on August 12, outlining the correspondence with Saint-Gaudens, and noting that [...] "no instructions have been received from the President as to the half and quarter eagle, but <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> that the eagle design would be used upon them...

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{left for}} Paris in December 1792 and arrived {{about a month}} before Louis XVI was guillotined. Britain and France were {{on the brink of}} war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British {{visitors}} such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. On 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found the sight of Louis riding down the streets as a prisoner in a wagon [...] "made the tears flow insensibly from my eyes, when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity than <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed". During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate Girondins rather than the more radical Jacobins.|$|E

500|$|Darabont wrote a 60-page pilot {{script for}} [...] "Days Gone Bye". His initial script for the episode was split {{in half and}} embellished. Darabont {{explained}} that he did this to [...] "slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation." [...] Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene. Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. [...] "Reading that pilot was just a revelation. It's extremely faithful. There {{are things that are}} so much like the comic, I can't really remember the nuance of what's different and what's not from the comic. He's definitely being more faithful than <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> and everything that he's changing is brilliant. I couldn't be happier. I think the fans of the book are going to just love it." [...] The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series.|$|E
500|$|The game went gold on August 5, 2002, and was {{released}} on August 27. After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, [...] "I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [...] came out..." [...] and, [...] "... managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff." [...] In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, [...] " [...] came out better than <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> but still, not exactly awe-inspiring." [...] Chris Avellone later said, [...] "Icewind Dale was a fun series, but it didn't try to set the bar for {{anything other than a}} fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls." [...] A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E
500|$|... "Sectionals" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics.

IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm not sure <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But what we got from [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E
