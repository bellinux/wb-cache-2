25|$|The Daily Telegraph, citing {{anonymous}} sources, {{reported that}} in December 2006, a top Syrian official (according to one article this {{was the head of}} the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, Ibrahim Othman) arrived in London under a false name. The Mossad had detected a booking for the official in a London hotel, and dispatched at least ten undercover agents to London. The agents were split into three teams. One group was sent to Heathrow Airport to identify the official as he arrived, a second to book into his hotel, and a third to monitor his movements and visitors. Some of the operatives were from the Kidon Division, which specializes in assassinations, and the Neviot Division, which specializes in breaking into homes, embassies, and hotel rooms to install bugging devices. On the first day of his visit, he visited the Syrian embassy and then went shopping. Kidon operatives closely followed him, while Neviot operatives broke into his hotel room and found his laptop. A computer expert then installed software that allowed the Mossad to monitor his activities on the computer. When the computer material was examined at Mossad headquarters, officials found blueprints and hundreds of pictures of the Kibar facility in various stages of construction, and correspondence. One photograph showed North Korean nuclear official Chon Chibu meeting with Ibrahim Othman, Syria's atomic energy agency director. Though the Mossad had originally planned to kill the official in London, it was decided to spare his life following the discovery. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was notified. The following month, Olmert formed a three-member panel to report on Syria's nuclear program. The CIA was also informed and the American intelligence network joined the quest for more information. Six months later, Brigadier-General Yaakov Amidror, one of the panel's members, informed Olmert that Syria was working with North Korea and Iran on a nuclear facility. Iran had funneled $1 billion to the project, and planned on using the Kibar facility to replace Iranian facilities <b>if</b> <b>Iran</b> was unable to complete its uranium enrichment program.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} {{affirmed that}} [...] "Congress may indeed direct courts to apply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in pending civil cases," [...] citing its previous decisions in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.(1995), Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society(1992), and Landgraf v. USI Film Products(1994). Accordingly, the majority found that §8772 [...] "changed {{the law by}} establishing new substantive standards"—essentially, that <b>if</b> <b>Iran</b> owns the assets, they would be available for execution against judgments against Iran—for the district court {{to apply to the}} case. Section8772 left several issues for the District Court to adjudicate: it did not define its key terms [...] "beneficial interest" [...] and [...] "equitable title"; whether any other party had a constitutionally protected interest in the account; and whether the assets were [...] "held in the United States" [...] (Clearstream argued the assets were located in Luxembourg, not New York).|$|E
500|$|The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari {{and heard}} oral {{arguments}} in the case in January 2016, releasing their opinion in April 2016. A 6–2 majority found that §8772 was not unconstitutional, because it [...] "changed the law by establishing new substantive standards"—essentially, that <b>if</b> <b>Iran</b> owns the assets, they would be available for execution against judgments against Iran—for the district court {{to apply to the}} case. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority, explained that the federal judiciary has long upheld laws that affect one or {{a very small number of}} subjects as a valid exercise of Congress' legislative power and that the Supreme Court had previously upheld a statute that applied to cases identified by docket number in Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society(1992). The majority also upheld §8772 as a valid exercise of Congress' authority over foreign affairs. Prior to the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act(FSIA) in 1976, Congress and the Executive branch had authority to determine the immunity of foreign states from lawsuits. Despite transferring the authority to determine immunity to the courts through the FSIA, the majority contended that [...] "it remains Congress' prerogative to alter a foreign state's immunity." ...|$|E
