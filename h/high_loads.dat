5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to <b>high</b> <b>loads</b> or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E

40|$|Several {{industrial}} applications require rolling bearings to operate under both <b>high</b> <b>load</b> and oscillating motion. While the oscillating motion {{does not allow}} for EHD regime, the <b>high</b> <b>load</b> applied induces <b>high</b> contact pressures. Even if many works in the literature deal with rotating bearings, few works address <b>high</b> <b>loaded</b> oscillating bearings. The degradation scenario of <b>high</b> <b>loaded</b> oscillating bearings is here analysed step by step for both greased and ungreased bearings. Subsurface plastic damage of the balls was found to be at the origin of greased bearing degradation, while progressive superficial degradation lead to a faster degradation of ungreased bearings...|$|R

25|$|An {{anchored}} {{retaining wall}} {{can be constructed}} {{in any of the}} aforementioned styles but also includes additional strength using cables or other stays anchored in the rock or soil behind it. Usually driven into the material with boring, anchors are then expanded {{at the end of the}} cable, either by mechanical means or often by injecting pressurized concrete, which expands to form a bulb in the soil. Technically complex, this method is very useful where <b>high</b> <b>loads</b> are expected, or where the wall itself has to be slender and would otherwise be too weak.|$|E

25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the <b>high</b> <b>loads</b> required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E
500|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation found a rail had fragmented as trains passed {{and that the}} likely cause was [...] "rolling contact fatigue" [...] (defined as multiple surface-breaking cracks). Such cracks are caused by <b>high</b> <b>loads</b> where the wheels contact the rail. Repeated loading causes fatigue cracks to grow. When they reach a critical size, the rail fails. Portions of the failed track at Hatfield were reassembled and numerous fatigue cracks were identified; these contributed to spalling of the running surface to around [...] deep and [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{originally}} {{thought that the}} distance between aponeuroses did not change during the contraction of a pennate muscle, thus requiring the fibers to rotate as they shorten.

This dynamic gearing automatically shifts in order to produce either maximal velocity under low loads or maximal force under <b>high</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Cantilevered {{retaining}} walls {{are made from}} an internal stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often {{in the shape of}} an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a beam) to a large, structural footing, converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back, to improve their strength resisting <b>high</b> <b>loads.</b> Buttresses are short wing walls at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth. [...] This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.|$|E

40|$|Load Theory (Lavie, 1995, 2005) {{states that}} the level of perceptual load in a task (i. e.,the amount of {{information}} involved in processing task-relevant stimuli) determines the efficiency of selective attention. There is evidence that perceptual load affects distractor processing, with increased inattentional blindness under <b>high</b> <b>load.</b> Given that <b>high</b> <b>load</b> can result in individuals failing to report seeing obvious objects, it is conceivable that load may also impair memory for the scene. The current study is the first to assess the effect of perceptual load on eyewitness memory. Across three experiments (two video-based and one in a driving simulator), the effect of perceptual load on eyewitness memory was assessed. The results showed that eyewitnesses were less accurate under <b>high</b> <b>load,</b> in particular for peripheral details. For example, memory for the central character in the video was not affected by load but memory for a witness who passed by the window {{at the edge of the}} scene was significantly worse under <b>high</b> <b>load.</b> <b>High</b> <b>load</b> memories were also more open to suggestion, showing increased susceptibility to leading questions. <b>High</b> visual perceptual <b>load</b> also affected recall for auditory information, illustrating a possible cross-modal perceptual load effect on memory accuracy. These results have implications for eyewitness memory researchers and forensic professionals...|$|R
