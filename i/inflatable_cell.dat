40|$|AbstractA novel method using {{inflatable}} leading lip cell for suppressing duct lip stall of {{ducted fan}} system is presented and numerically simulated using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The lip inflatable mechanism {{consists of an}} <b>inflatable</b> <b>cell</b> and a faring cell. The <b>inflatable</b> <b>cell</b> size is controllable via inflating or deflating, while the faring cell is basically used to help form a desirable shape of a smooth configuration. The <b>inflatable</b> <b>cell</b> can change {{the shape of the}} duct lip, resulting in the change of flow pattern around the duct lip. This method has advantages of no rotating or transmission mechanism, minimum change to the original duct structure, and maximum shape control range. Preliminary results of the numerical simulation demonstrate that the method presented is effective in suppressing the duct lip stall, and it is a promising applicable stall suppression approach...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An <b>inflatable</b> <b>cell</b> {{model of}} paragrlider’s wing canopy has been {{investigated}} in wind tunnel experiments, {{which is designed to}} represent the dynamic behaviors of each cell comprising the canopy. Effects of air-intake of paraglider canopy have also been investigated in this study. The improvement of the shape of air intake and pressure distribution from the standpoints of aerodynamics will contribute to raise flexible wing gliding ratio and safety. To perform the experiment, flexible wing canopy cell model and simplified rigid air intake model had been prepared. Cross-sectional wing profiles and internal surface pressures of the cell model are measured at different angle of attack and Reynolds number, to understand the formation characteristic of paraglider wing canopy model. The cell model is fully inflated at greater than a few degrees angle of attack. In order to understand the lift and drag behaviors, external pressure distributions of the cell model are measured...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{satellites}} have a rigid structure {{defining the}} basic {{configuration of the}} satellite and holding in place all subsystems. A variation of the shape or configuration of the satellite is normally achieved {{through the use of}} deployable structures or appendices (antennas, solar arrays, booms, etc.). Although modern structural solutions are modular and multifunctional, the structure of a satellite still represents a significant portion of its mass and a limitation on the achievable configuration, extension of deployable components and packing efficiency during launch. The goal of this project is to design and build an initial prototype of an all-inflatable satellite with disaggregated electronics for deployment on-board a BEXUS balloon as proof of concept. The idea is to use <b>inflatable</b> <b>cell</b> structures as support for all the subsystems composing a typical nano-satellite. Each subsystem and component is mounted on a different cell. Cells are both individually inflated and individually controlled. The aim is to design and build an inflatable satellite, demonstrating the deployment, communication among components and local control enabling structure shape adaption via soft robotic actuators and micro pumps. The experiment will deploy two inflatable structures made of 5 x 2 cells which are packed in a 10 x 10 x 10 cm 3 cubesat reaching a size of 70 x 18 x 14 cm 3 once deployed. Flexible circuitry was used to mount all the electronic subsystems {{on the surface of the}} folded inflatable. The experiment will be flown onboard the BEXUS 16 stratospheric balloon to an altitude of 29 km for 2 - 5 hours from the Swedish space port ESRANGE in October 2013...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel attempt to develop a spatial {{tangible}} user interface (TUI) [1] based on a deformable structure, the so-called HoverMesh. It consists of a stiff cubical, whose upper wall is composed of a deformable mesh of particle filled <b>inflatable</b> <b>cells.</b> This mesh can be deformed by inflating and/or deflating the cubical while consolidating (evacuating) and/or releasing (inflating) the cells. The HoverMesh is both an input and output device and we see its major benefit in the wide interaction area. The haptic feedback modality is thus embedded as well.

40|$|Various {{plants are}} capable of comparably fast {{movements}} due to so called motor cells able of changing their internal pressure causing the flower head to rotate towards the sun. This principle, known as heliotropism, can be adapted by assembling an array of <b>inflatable</b> <b>cells</b> with highly flexible walls interconnected by micro pumps and valves to facilitate a pressure change between cells. Due to this internal pressure change, the volume of specific cells will vary causing the structure to deform and bend. By producing an array of a few cells thick but hundreds of cells long and wide, a plate that is able to change its shape can be created. The idea {{presented in this paper}} is to combine the folding capability of the developed smart plate with the origami principle of creating complex shapes from a single sheet of material without the need of irreversible cutting...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pressure sores {{affect people}} {{who are unable to}} change {{position}} regularly. Sustained pressure on those areas which support the body leads to reduced blood supply and eventually death of the skin and underlying muscles (a pressure sore). There are two main approaches to preventing these sores; (1) use of a conforming support surface to distribute the body weight over a large area; (2) use of an alternating support surface where <b>inflatable</b> <b>cells</b> alternately inflate and deflate. Treatment of pressure sores also requires reduction of pressures at the damaged area of skin. Special support surfaces, aimed at pressure redistribution, including beds, mattresses and cushions, are widely used and range. It is unclear to what extent these surfaces can prevent or treat pressure sores and whether any system is better than any other. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of pressure relieving beds, mattresses and cushions (support surfaces) in the prevention and treatment of pressure sores. Search strategy: Searches of 19 databases, hand searching of journals, conference proceedings, and bibliographies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating support surfaces for the prevention or treatment of pressure sores. There was no restriction on articles based on language or publication status. Data collection and analysis: Data extraction and assessment of study quality were undertaken by two reviewers independently. Trials with similar patients, comparisons, and outcomes were pooled. Where pooling was inappropriate, trials are discussed in a narrative review. Main results: Prevention: Twenty nine RCTs of support surfaces for pressure sore prevention were identified. Some high specification foam mattresses were more effective than 'standard' hospital foam mattresses in moderate-high risk patients. Pressure relieving mattresses in the operating theatre reduced the incidence of pressure sores post-operatively. The relative merits of alternating and constant low pressure, and of the different alternating pressure devices are unclear. Seat cushions and simple, constant low-pressure devices have not been adequately evaluated. Limited evidence suggests that low air loss beds reduce the incidence of pressure sores in intensive care. Treatment: Six RCTs of support surfaces for pressure sore treatment were identified. There is good evidence that air-fluidised and low air loss beds improve healing rates. Seat cushions have not been adequately evaluated. Two RCTs evaluated surfaces for both prevention and treatment in the same trial...|$|R
40|$|The Australia, New Zealand <b>Inflatable</b> (ANZI) strain <b>cell</b> is an {{instrument}} {{used to determine}} the three dimensional in situ stresses {{with a high level of}} confidence, through the overcoring method of stress relief. The ANZI cell has been used for over three decades at numerous sites around the world, typically in short inclined boreholes drilled from underground mines. Technical advances during the last decade have seen the ANZI cell deployed and overcored in increasingly deeper surface exploration boreholes. Recent development of a downhole electronic data logger, a wireline enabled drilling system and {{an instrument}} deployment system has greatly simplified the process of obtaining three dimensional overcore measurements at depth. This paper describes the ANZI strain cell, its operation and recent development for overcoring in exploration boreholes. The capability to deploy ANZI strain cells in exploration boreholes represents a significant breakthrough for the design of underground mines and underground excavations generally. Being able to obtain high confidence measurements of the in situ stresses at the planning stage of any underground construction activity provides the opportunity to take advantage of these stresses. Not only does it become possible to protect key infrastructure by locating it away from areas of stress concentration, advantage can be taken of the major stresses to promote caving through appropriate design...|$|R

And while mere survival may be enough, most must carry such loads efficiently. Building on ideas from Courses E and F in Part IA, this course aims to understand the approaches {{that can be used to}} enable materials and structures to withstand stresses efficiently by considering both the nature of stresses and how materials respond to them both elastically and irreversibly, illustrating these concepts using both synthetic and biological materials and structures.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Due to {{advances}} {{in the field of}} medicine, infants born prematurely now have greater chances of survival despite not being carried to Full Term. However, serious health complications exist due to premature birth. Therefore, premature neonates require a specialized form of individualized care. Developmentally supportive care stresses the importance of proper handling, positioning and regular repositioning of the patient. In Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) there does not exist a standardized form of care in regards to the proper positioning of these patients. Currently, healthcare providers use rolled blankets, towels or foam positioning barriers and pillows to position and reposition the neonate. However, these forms of handling the neonate require some form of manual intervention which can cause undue stress and harm to the infant’s already fragile and compromised condition. As a result, there exists a need for a novel automated repositioning device that can safely and effectively position the neonate in a slow and controlled manner to ensure that they reach proper developmental milestones {{while at the same time}} preventing any further medical complications. In this study, an automated repositioning device was created. This system employs the use of inflatables to serve as air cells in order to achieve the safe positioning of these patients. The system is comprised of two pumps, four valves and four <b>inflatable</b> air <b>cells</b> that safely and slowly direct the air flow into the desired air cells by means of an Arduino Uno and a multi-directional control switch in order to obtain safe and proper positioning. The four air cells that comprise this system position the patient in either a Fowler’s, Trendelenburg, Left or Right position. Testing was conducted on this automated inflatable repositioning system using a manikin that was similar to the size of a full term infant. Range of motion testing was conducted and it was discovered that this system is successful in achieving a sufficient range of motion in order to safely position the manikin. A pressure sensor was also connected to the system to measure the amount of pressure in the air cells over time during inflation. From this testing, it was found that the system is successful in inflating the air cells in a slow and controlled manner. Additionally, four NICU nurses from the Kapi’olani Medical Center for Women and Children tested the device and a survey was conducted to obtain feedback about the performance of the system. Overall the device created was found to be successful in achieving positions in four directions in a safe, slow and controlled manner by means of an easy to use system that has the potential to be integrated into current neonatal health care technology...|$|R
40|$|StrathSat-R is an {{experiment}} proposed for ESA/DLR's REXUS 13 sounding rocket campaign to validate different inflation deployment techniques in space conditions. The primary {{objective was to}} deploy and validate two structures in micro-gravity and near vacuum conditions by using residual air inflation. The experimental setup consisted of two CubeSat-based ejectables, the first of them deploying a pyramidal structure {{that can be used}} for passive orbit transfer and de-orbiting, and the second containing a morphing <b>inflatable</b> with multiple <b>cells,</b> which will actively modify its shape during flight by using pumps connected to cells to alter the distribution of air. StrathSat-R was originally selected to be launched from Esrange Space Centre in Kiruna on board of the REXUS 13 rocket in May 2013. Unfortunately, due to a procedural omission by the launch service provider, the two ejectable sections of the StrathSat-R experiment were not ejected during flight and remained inside the rocket. The experiment did perform nominally and recorded the flight, but could not carry out its experimental goals without ejection. Therefore, a second launch opportunity was granted to the team with the experiment launched once again on REXUS 15 in May 2014. This paper presents the design changes and improvements made in the different subsystems between both launches, as well as the results of the second sounding rocket flight. The new experiment presents a more robust and reliable electronic subsystem, avoiding problematic components in the original design, and includes slight modifications in the design and the fabrication procedures of the two inflatable structures. The recovery system, comprising a GPS receiver, a Globalstar antenna and an RF beacon, has also undergone a series of, mainly software, improvements. This particular subsystem was critical to mission success, enabling the recovery of the ejectables after flight, and hence will be a focus of the paper. Finally, a new ground segment interface software has been implemented with the aim of providing clarity to the ground operators during the mission...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{identification}} and analysis of a reference mission scenario defined to test advanced technologies needed for future human space exploration missions. Some technologies are critical for future manned missions to outer space, like regenerative fuel <b>cells,</b> <b>inflatable,</b> environment protection and rendezvous and docking systems (especially for what concerns the software). In order to have them available for future missions, a specific scenario was identified to test and validate these technologies in a significant environment. The first step was {{the identification of the}} technologies to be tested and the assessment of the final target, which can be for example a mission on the Moon surface. Then the scenario was defined, identifying the various missions to consider for the qualification of the selected technologies. In particular, the building blocks associated to the missions were assessed and the way of implementing the technologies was determined through the definition of specific requirements. Several trade-offs are performed to select the most suitable solutions, in terms of mass/cost and cost effectiveness. For example, a specific technology could be firstly deployed as a demo in a low Earth orbit, maybe at the International Space Station; then it can be moved to a higher orbit to test different functionalities. In particular several options are considered and among them only the most convenient is selected: different requirements are derived and the relevant missions are described in details. The scenario evaluations have been done relying on the Scenario Evaluator Tool (SET), which is a tool conceived to support the engineering team in the framework of space mission design process. SET allows building mission architectures with significant reduction of development time and computational effort, allowing the characterization, comparison, and optimization of exploration scenarios and building blocks design through a user friendly graphical interface. The tool is one of the results of STEPS (Sistemi e Tecnologie per l'EsPlorazione Spaziale) and is currently used for further analyses being carried out in the frame of STEPS- 2 (Phase 2), which is a research project co-founded by EU on the "Misura Piattaforme Innovative" - Phase 2 of POR FESR 2007 / 2013. The paper describes both the adopted methodology and the major obtained results, focusing on the technologies and the way they are implemented through several missions and building blocks to be tested and validate...|$|R
