25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal <b>dominant</b> <b>mutation</b> is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
500|$|Any {{horse that}} shows Appaloosa core {{characteristics}} of coat pattern, mottled skin, striped hooves, and a visible white sclera, carries {{at least one}} allele of the dominant [...] "leopard complex" [...] (LP) gene. The {{use of the word}} [...] "complex" [...] is used to refer to the large group of visible patterns that may occur when LP is present. LP is an autosomal incomplete <b>dominant</b> <b>mutation</b> in the TRPM1 gene located at horse chromosome 1 (ECA 1). [...] All horses with at least one copy of LP show leopard characteristics, and it is hypothesized that LP acts together with other patterning genes (PATN) that have not yet been identified to produce the different coat patterns. Horses that are heterozygous for LP tend to be darker than homozygous horses, but this is not consistent.|$|E
500|$|HD is {{typically}} inherited from a person's parents, with 10% of cases {{due to a}} new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal <b>dominant</b> <b>mutation</b> in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin. This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called [...] "huntingtin". Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which {{can be carried out}} at any time, {{regardless of whether or not}} symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dominant</b> gain-of-function <b>mutations</b> {{can give}} unique {{insights}} into the study of gene function. In addition, gain-of-function mutations, unlike loss-of-function alleles, are not biased against the identification of genetically redundant loci. To identify novel genetic functions active during Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis, we have collected a set of dominant temperature-sensitive maternal-effect embryonic lethal mutations. In a previous screen, we isolated eight such mutations, distributed among six genes. In the present study, we describe eight new <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> that identify only three additional genes, yielding a total of 16 <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> found in nine genes. Therefore, it appears that {{a limited number of}} C. elegans genes mutate to this phenotype at appreciable frequencies. Five of the genes that we identified by <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> have loss-of-function alleles. Two of these genes may lack loss-of-function phenotypes, indicating that they are nonessential and so may represent redundant loci. Loss-of-function mutations of three other genes are associated with recessive lethality, indicating nonredundancy...|$|R
40|$|The MutS protein of Escherichia coli {{is part of}} the dam-directed MutHLS {{mismatch}} repair pathway which rectifies replication errors and which prevents recombination between related sequences. In order to more fully understand the role of MutS in these processes, <b>dominant</b> negative mutS <b>mutations</b> on a multicopy plasmid were isolated by screening transformed wild-type cells for a mutator phenotype, using a Lac+ papillation assay. Thirty-eight hydroxylamine- and 22 N-methyl-N 2 ̆ 7 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> were isolated. Nine of these mutations altered the P-loop motif of the ATP-binding site, resulting in four amino acid substitutions. With one exception, the remaining sequenced mutations all caused substitution of amino acids conserved during evolution. The <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> in the P-loop consensus caused severely reduced repair of heteroduplex DNA in vivo in a mutS mutant host strain. In a wild-type strain, the level of repair was decreased by the <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> to between 12 to 90...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDominant {{mutations}} of the Drosophila ninaE-encoded rhodopsin {{are described}} that reduce {{the expression of}} wild-type rhodopsin and cause a slow, age-dependent form of retinal degeneration. A posttranslational event subsequent to the requirement for the ninaA-encoded cyclophilin is disrupted by the <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations.</b> Most of these <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> are missense mutations that affect the physical properties {{of one of the}} seven transmembrane domains; another affects the cysteine involved in a disulfide linkage. The results indicate that misfolded or unstable mutant rhodopsin can interfere with maturation of wild-type rhodopsin, and that these cellular conditions may trigger retinal degeneration. In addition, these <b>dominant</b> rhodopsin <b>mutations</b> suppress the rapid degeneration seen in rdgC and norpA flies, indicating that high levels of rhodopsin are required...|$|R

5000|$|... 1968/9 & 1985: Dutch Rex. The first {{occurrence}} was in Zaandam in 1968 or 1969 when {{a female}} cat produced a rexed daughter. The daughter produced rexed offspring when mated to unrelated straight-haired males, including Siamese cats, demonstrating {{this to be}} a <b>dominant</b> <b>mutation.</b> The fur tended to form dreadlocks and had a coarse, unruly texture. The cats were also prone to balding. Cat fanciers believed the strain originated from an American Wirehair belonging to military personnel. The mutation reappeared in 1985 and was also known as the Wirehair Rex. These cats were traceable as descendents of the discontinued Dutch Rex breeding program. The last known Dutch Rex was a female cat of unknown origin found in Amsterdam in the late 1990s. The <b>dominant</b> <b>mutation</b> produced a rex type of coat in the heterozygote and a sparse coat in the homozygote.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> in GJB 2 {{may lead}} to various degrees of sensorineural hearing {{impairment}} and/or hyperproliferative epidermal disorders. So far studies of <b>dominant</b> GJB 2 <b>mutations</b> were mostly limited to case reports of individual patients and families. In this study, we identified 7 families, 11 subjects with <b>dominant</b> GJB 2 <b>mutations</b> by sequencing of GJB 2 in 2168 Chinese Han probands with sensorineural hearing impairment and characterized the associated spectrum, de novo rate and genotype-phenotype correlation. We identified p. R 75 Q, p. R 75 W and p. R 184 Q as the most frequent <b>dominant</b> GJB 2 <b>mutations</b> among Chinese Hans, which had a very high de novo rate (71 % of probands). A majority (10 / 11) of subjects carrying <b>dominant</b> GJB 2 <b>mutations</b> exhibited palmoplantar keratoderma in addition to hearing impairment. In two families segregated with additional c. 235 delC or p. V 37 I mutations of GJB 2, family members with the compound heterozygous mutations exhibited more severe phenotype than those with single <b>dominant</b> GJB 2 <b>mutation.</b> Our study suggested that the high de novo mutation rate {{gives rise to a}} significant portion of <b>dominant</b> GJB 2 <b>mutations.</b> The severity of the hearing and epidermal phenotypes associated with <b>dominant</b> GJB 2 <b>mutations</b> may be modified by additional recessive mutations o...|$|R

40|$|Ryanodine {{receptor}} 1 (RYR 1) mutations are {{a common}} cause of congenital myopathies associated with both dominant and recessive inheritance. Histopathological findings frequently feature central cores or multi-minicores, more rarely, type 1 predominance/uniformity, fiber-type disproportion, increased internal nucleation, and fatty and connective tissue. We describe 71 families, 35 associated with <b>dominant</b> RYR 1 <b>mutations</b> and 36 with recessive inheritance. Five of the <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> and 35 of the 55 recessive mutations have not been previously reported. <b>Dominant</b> <b>mutations,</b> typically missense, were frequently located in recognized mutational hotspot regions, while recessive mutations were distributed throughout the entire coding sequence. Recessive mutations included nonsense and splice mutations expected to result in reduced RyR 1 protein. There was wide clinical variability. As a group, <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> were associated with milder phenotypes; patients with recessive inheritance had earlier onset, more weakness, and functional limitations. Extraocular and bulbar muscle involvement was almost exclusively observed in the recessive group. In conclusion, our study reports {{a large number of}} novel RYR 1 mutations and indicates that recessive variants are at least as frequent as the dominant ones. Assigning pathogenicity to novel mutations is often difficult, and interpretation of genetic results in the context of clinical, histological, and muscle magnetic resonance imaging findings is essential...|$|R

40|$|RYR 1 {{mutations}} are {{the most}} common cause of structural congenital myopathies and may exhibit both dominant and recessive inheritance. Histopathological findings are variable and include central cores, multi-minicores, type 1 predominance/ uniformity, fibre type disproportion, increased internal nucleation and fatty and connective tissue. Until recently, diagnostic RYR 1 sequencing was limited to mutational hotspots due to the large size of the gene. Since the introduction of full RYR 1 sequencing in 2007 we have detected pathogenic mutations in 77 families: 39 had dominant inheritance and 38 recessive inheritance. In some cases with presumably recessive inheritance, only one heterozygous mutation inherited from an asymptomatic parent was identified. Of 28 <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations,</b> 6 were novel; 37 of the 59 recessive mutations were also novel. <b>Dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> were more frequently in recognized hotspot regions, while recessive mutations were distributed throughout the coding sequence. <b>Dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> were predominantly missense, whereas recessive mutations included many nonsense and splice mutations expected to result in reduced RyR 1 protein. There was wide clinical variability in patients with both dominant and recessive inheritance. As a group, those with <b>dominant</b> <b>mutations</b> were generally more mildly affected than those with recessive inheritance, who had earlier onset and were weaker with more functional limitations. Extraocular muscle involvement was almost exclusively observed in the recessive group. Bulbar involvement was also more prominent in this group, resulting in a larger number requiring gastrostomy insertion. In conclusion, genomic sequencing of the entire RYR 1 leads to the detection of many novel mutations, but may miss large genetic rearrangements in some cases. Assigning pathogenicity to novel mutations is often difficult and interpretation of genetic results in the context of clinical, histological and, increasingly, muscle MRI findings is essential...|$|R
