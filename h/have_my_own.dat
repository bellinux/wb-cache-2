5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E

In {{an early}} November 2013 {{interview}} with Latina magazine, {{she said that}} she finds spirituality to be an important part of maintaining balance in life.

60|$|We dined {{together}} by the fireside. Peggotty was in attendance to wait upon us, but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old plate, with a brown view of a man-of-war in full sail upon it, which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time I had been away, {{and would not have}} had broken, she said, for a hundred pounds. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old mug with David on it, and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old little knife and fork that wouldn't cut.|$|R
500|$|For {{much of his}} childhood, Smith's {{family was}} a part of the Community of Christ but began {{attending}} services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him [...] "really scared of Hell". In 2001, he said: [...] "I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> version of it." ...|$|E

I thought if I'm going to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> Las Vegas show, it has to be right and it has to have heart and soul and it has to be {{something}} memorable... My whole objective here is for people to see what they don't get to see. Just give me my band, give me a stage, some cool smoke and lights and you see the sweat, you see the pain, you see the love, you see the soul and it's about music." ...|$|E
500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It's Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E

500|$|While Stafford {{was still}} working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, [...] "Some day I'm going to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> record company, and you're going to record for me." [...] She {{subsequently}} became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her {{as a member of}} the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.|$|E
500|$|However, {{executive}} producer Bill Panzer {{was intrigued by}} the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an Immortal, this choice having several drawbacks. MacLeod does not age, while Tessa is mortal and will age. Despite their mutual wish, they know growing old together is impossible and this uneasy thought [...] "...haunts them both, sometimes more than others." [...] As an Immortal, MacLeod is also sterile and Tessa resigns herself to having no children. [...] "" [...] deals with Tessa's choice and its impact upon her life. In this episode, Tessa becomes very fond of a four-year-old girl and muses; [...] "For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But, she's not... I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> life and it's more than enough." [...] Panzer commented that [...] "The Sea Witch" [...] "...brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly 's giving up to be with MacLeod." ...|$|E

Her performance {{was backed by}} her all-female band, Suga Mama, and an orchestra. The show was choreographed by Beyoncé and Frank Gatson Jr. Regarding her I Am... Yours revue, Beyoncé said, [...] "I've always wanted to perform in Las Vegas, I've {{always wanted to do}} my own show there, {{because a lot of the}} icons that I look up to had amazing shows in Las Vegas.

500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Zinta {{joined a}} group of South Asian {{commentators}} for BBC News Online. She expressed joy at participating in the project, saying, [...] "I am pretty outspoken and <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> view on every subject. So {{it will be a}} good platform for me to air my views." [...] Her first column, [...] "The changing face of Bollywood", published in January 2004, discussed the evolution of Bollywood in the past decade. The column became one of the site's ten most read stories of the day. In her second column, [...] "Odds stacked against Indian women", Zinta analysed the eve teasing phenomenon in India, and criticised those who practice it. She wrote, [...] "Incidences like these take away a woman's dignity, her space and her freedom...why the state is so helpless in protecting the women. Why should women feel unsafe in a country which had an internationally revered woman prime minister?" [...] The column caught the attention of readers worldwide, and she received thousands of e-mails about it. It was applauded particularly by women for its stand against abuse of Indian women. Her third column, [...] "The darkness that all actors fear", was a more personal column and dealt with her stardom, fans, insecurity and fears as an actor. Her fourth and final column, titled [...] "Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand", described her two near-death experiences in late 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Palmer {{switched}} {{political parties}} throughout his life, starting out a Democrat.

2500|$|White founded Third Man Records in 2001. However, it was {{not until}} after he moved to Nashville that White {{purchased}} a space in 2009 to house his label. He explained, [...] "For the longest time I did not want to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> studio gear, mostly because with the White Stripes I wanted to have the constriction of going into a studio and having a set time of 10 days or two weeks to finish an album, and using whatever gear they happen to have there. After 10 to 15 years of recording like that I felt that it was finally time for me to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> place to produce music, and have exactly what I want in there: the exact tape machines, the exact microphones, the exact amplifiers that I like, and so on." [...] Using the slogan [...] "Your Turntable’s Not Dead," [...] Third Man also presses vinyl records, for the artists on its label, for White's own musical ventures, as well as for third parties for hire.|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{presents}} several {{perspectives on}} the topic. One point he makes {{is that it is}} incoherent to talk of knowing that one is in some particular mental state. Whereas others can learn of my pain, for example, I simply <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> pain; it follows that one does not know of one's own pain, one simply has a pain. For Wittgenstein, this is a grammatical point, part {{of the way in which}} the language-game involving the word [...] "pain" [...] is played.|$|E

2500|$|Lee {{responds}} [...] "Well, such {{question has}} been raised, in fact, it is being discussed. That is why The Warrior is {{probably not going to}} be on." [...] Lee adds, [...] "They think that business-wise it is a risk. I don't blame them.

2500|$|... "I've {{never stopped}} doing music. I've created a label called Planet 9 and I {{released}} an album in Japan. I invested {{in my own}} studio and it cut the recording cost down 95 percent. I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> in-house producers {{and they are not}} as expensive as an established producer. The return is greater and now I own my masters. I see six dollars per album sold versus 10 cents. You may not sell as many units because you don't put as much money in promotions, but the returns are better." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film premiered in 1986 {{and drew}} some {{controversy}} {{due to its}} subject matter. Almodóvar justified his use of violence, explaining [...] "The moral of all my films is {{to get to a}} stage of greater freedom". Almodóvar went on to note: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> morality. And so do my films. If you see Matador through the perspective of traditional morality, it's a dangerous film because it's just a celebration of killing. Matador is like a legend. I don't try to be realistic; it's very abstract, so you don't feel identification with the things that are happening, but with the sensibility of this kind of romanticism".|$|E
