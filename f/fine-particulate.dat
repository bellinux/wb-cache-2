This study directly evaluated the changes in life expectancy associated with differential changes in fine particulate air pollu-tion that occurred in the United States during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Methods We compiled data on life expectancy, socioeconomic status, and demographic char-acteristics for 211 county units in the 51 U. S. metropolitan areas with matching data on <b>fine-particulate</b> {{air pollution}} for the late 1970 s and early 1980 s and the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. Regression models were used to estimate the association between reductions in pollution and changes in life expectancy, with adjustment for changes in socioeconomic and demographic variables and in proxy indicators for the prevalence of cigarette smoking.

Although the product prepared with a TEA:starch ratio of 1 : 1 by a 10 h calcination at 800 ◦C showed the highest first-cycle capacity (127 mAh g− 1), the cyclability was the highest for the product synthesized by a 500 ◦C 10 h calcination of a 1 : 1 TEA:starch precursor.

40|$|Organic {{matter from}} aquatic and {{terrestrial}} sources provides the carbon energy that ‘drives ’ aquatic food webs. Most {{streams and rivers}} are heterotrophic — that is, more carbon is consumed (e. g. by animals and bacteria) than is produced within the system by aquatic plants. However, {{despite the presence of}} vast amounts of carbon in streams and rivers, only a small proportion of the total is truly available for consumption by aquatic animals. ~ A large proportion of the total carbon pool in many streams and rivers {{is in the form of}} wood, which provides an important substrate for algal colonisation, especially in lowland rivers. ~ In temperate forest streams, coarse-particulate organic matter, <b>fine-particulate</b> organic matter and dissolved organic matter derived largely from the riparian zone are important sources of carbon for aquatic food webs. ~ Food webs in tropical, subtropical and arid zone streams show a greater dependence on algal carbon, as do those in most lowland rivers.

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that <b>fine-particulate</b> air pollution increases the incidence of lung disease and premature death. In this paper, single fibre filter theory was used to predict the theoretical particulate collection efficiency of air permeable walls (dynamic insulation). The relationship between particle diameter and filtration efficiency for dynamic insulation, {{as a function of}} flow rate, is examined and compared to that for a conventional filter. Factors such as filter penetration as a function of flow rate, filter thickness, and packing density for a range of particle diameters are also presented. The findings suggest that, in addition to reducing heat loss through the building fabric, dynamic insulation can act as a high performance air filter in naturally ventilated buildings, thus providing a viable and attractive alternative to mechanical air-conditioning in congested urban environments.

40|$|We present new {{laboratory}} {{thermal infrared}} emissivity spectra {{of the major}} silicate minerals identified on the Moon measured under lunar environmental conditions and evaluate their application to lunar remote sensing data sets. Thermal infrared spectral changes between ambient and lunar environmental conditions are characterized {{for the first time}} over the 400 ∼ 1700 cm - 1 (6 - 25 m) spectral range for a <b>fine-particulate</b> mineral suite including plagioclase (albite and anorthite), pyroxene (enstatite and augite), and olivine (forsterite). The lunar environment introduces observable effects in thermal infrared emissivity spectra of fine particulate minerals, which include: (1) a shift in the Christiansen feature (CF) position to higher wave numbers (shorter wavelengths), (2) an increase in the overall spectral contrast, and (3) decreases in the spectral contrast of the reststrahlen bands and transparency features. Our new measurements demonstrate the high sensitivity of thermal infrared emissivity spectra to environmental conditions under which they are measured and provide important constraints for interpreting new thermal infrared data sets of the Moon, including the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment onboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Full resolution laboratory mineral spectra convolved to Diviner's three spectral channels show that spectral shape, CF position and band ratios can be used to distinguish between individual mineral groups and lunar lithologies. The integration of the thermal infrared CF position with near infrared spectral parameters allows for robust mineralogical identifications and provides a framework for future integrations of data sets across two different wavelength regimes.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on the protection of soil organic C from decomposition suggests that soil texture affects soil C stocks. However, different pools of soil organic matter (SOM) might be differently related to soil texture. Our objective was to examine how soil texture differentially alters the distribution of organic C within physically and chemically defined pools of unprotected and protected SOM. We collected samples from two soil texture gradients where other variables influencing soil organic C content were held constant. One texture gradient (16 - 60 % clay) was located near Stewart Valley, Saskatchewan, Canada and the other (25 - 50 % clay) near Cygnet, OH. Soils were physically fractionated into coarse- and <b>fine-particulate</b> organic matter (POM), silt- and clay-sized particles within microaggregates, and easily dispersed silt-and clay-sized particles outside of microaggregates. Whole-soil organic C concentration {{was positively related to}} silt plus clay content at both sites. We found no relationship between soil texture and unprotected C (coarse- and fine-POM C). Biochemically protected C (nonhydrolyzable C) increased with increasing clay content in whole-soil samples, but the proportion of nonhydrolyzable C within silt- and clay-sized fractions was unchanged. As the amount of silt or clay increased, the amount of C stabilized within easily dispersed and microaggregate-associated silt or clay fractions decreased. Our results suggest that for a given level of C inputs, the relationship between mineral surface area and soil organic matter varies with soil texture for physically and biochemically protected C fractions. Because soil texture acts directly and indirectly on various protection mechanisms, {{it may not be a}} universal predictor of whole-soil C content...|$|E
40|$|New {{laboratory}} {{thermal infrared}} emissivity {{measurements of the}} plagioclase solid solution series over the 1700 ∼ 400 cm- 1 (6 - 25 m) spectral range are presented. Thermal infrared (TIR) spectral changes for <b>fine-particulate</b> samples (0 - 25 m) are characterized {{for the first time}} under different laboratory environmental conditions: ambient (terrestrial-like), half-vacuum (Mars-like), vacuum, and vacuum with cooled chamber (lunar-like). Under all environmental conditions the Christiansen Feature (CF) is observed to vary in a systematic way with Na-rich end-member (albite) having a CF position at the highest wave number (shortest wavelength) and the Ca-rich end-member (anorthite) having a CF position with the lowest wave number (longest wavelength). As pressure decreases to< 10 - 3 mbar four observations are made: (1) the CF position shifts to higher wave numbers, (2) the spectral contrast of the CF increases relative to the RB, (3) the spectral contrast of the RB in the ∼ 1200 - 900 spectral range decreases while the spectral contrast of the RB in the ∼ 800 - 400 spectral range either increases or remains the same and (4) the TF disappears. A relationship between the wavelength position of the CF measured under simulated lunar conditions and plagioclase composition (An#) is developed. Although its exact form may evolve with additional data, this linear relationship should be applied to current and future TIR data sets of the Moon. Our new spectral measurements demonstrate how sensitive thermal infrared emissivity spectra of plagioclase feldspars are to the environmental conditions under which they are measured and provide important constraints for interpreting current and future thermal infrared data sets. © 2012 American Geophysical Union.

40|$|The {{competitive}} adsorption between phosphate {{and either}} one of seven benzenecarboxylates (benzoate, phthalate, trimellitate, trimesoate, hemimellitate, pyromellitate, and mellitate) on the surfaces of <b>fine-particulate</b> goethite (alpha-FeOOH) was investigated {{as a function of}} pH. The series of ligands contained Molecules with an increasing number of functional groups as well as three structural isomers of the tricarboxylates. Thus, the effects of both the number of carboxylate groups and the relative positions of these groups on the competitive efficiency toward phosphate were probed ill this Study. Quantitative adsorption experiments in batch mode and infrared spectroscopy were collectively Used to evaluate the competitive adsorption reactions. Under the conditions probed, mono- and dicarboxylates had no detectable effect on phosphate adsorption whereas the ligands containing three or more carboxylate groups were able to partially outcompete phosphate. However, the pH dependency and the extent of these competitive effects were strongly dependent on (lie structure and composition of the benzenecarboxylate. The collective results showed that it was the competition for hydrogen-bonding surface sites rather than inner sphere Surface sites that primarily determined the outcome of the competitive adsorption experiments,and it was the ability of the organic ligand to act as hydrogen-bonding acceptor and/or donor {{in various parts of the}} pH range that also determined the competitive pH dependency. The importance of H-bonding for the competitive adsorption between phosphate and benzenecarboxylic acids suggested that H-bonding interactions contributed substantially to the stabilities of both the adsorbed benzenecarboxylates and the phosphate ions and that these interactions were structurally specific: i. e., they were sensitive to the locations and the directional properties of the H-acceptor and H-donor surface sites.

40|$|Leaf litter breakdown, a {{critical}} ecosystem level process in streams and other aquatic environments, has been conceptualized using models borrowed from terrestrial systems. We argue that current {{views of the}} process in fresh waters need to be conceptually improved. Specifically, we think the idea that breakdown proceeds in three distinct temporal stages (leaching, conditioning, fragmentation) has been over emphasized. Leaching, the massive loss of soluble leaf components within 24 h after immersion, is generally considered to constitute a well-defined first stage. Recent evidence suggests, however, that the initial solute losses are largely an effect of the un natural drying procedures to which experimental leaves are normally subjected. Fresh leaf litter does lose solutes when immersed,but gradually throughout the breakdown process rather than instantly upon wetting. Conditioning, the second breakdown stage, describes the enhancement of leaf palatability for detritivores by microbial colonization, and is thus ultimately targeted towards a group of organisms (which contribute to litter degradation) rather than addressing the breakdown process per se. Furthermore,conditioning implies a key role for detritivorous invertebrates and underrates the established direct degradative activity of microbial decomposers. If, thus, leaching and conditioning are not generally useful operators to describe portions of the litter breakdown process in freshwaters, the traditional concept, which emphasises leaching, conditioning and fragmentation as three sequential stages, loses much of its appeal. Consequently, we propose a new conceptual model, in which the coincidence and interplay of various subprocesses of litter breakdown is more strongly recognized. In this model, we propose to view the process {{in terms of the}} products of litter breakdown-as a complement to the usual perspective which focuses on litter mass loss. Six primary breakdown products are considered : bacterial, fungal and shredder biomass; dissolved organic matter; <b>fine-particulate</b> organic matter; and inorganic mineralization products such as CO 2, NH+ and PO 3 -. We present a scheme illustrating the hypothesized formation of these products throughout breakdown. However, to improve understanding of the process, application of the proposed conceptual framework in experimental work is necessary. ...|$|E

We have {{previously}} shown that reduced defenses against oxidative stress due to glutathione S-transferase M 1 (GSTM 1) deletion modify {{the effects of}} PM 2. 5 (<b>fine-particulate</b> air pollution of < 2. 5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) on heart rate variability (HRV) in a cross-sectional analysis of the Normative Aging Study, an elderly cohort. We have extended this to include a longitudinal analysis with more subjects and examination of the GT short tandem repeat polymorphism in the heme oxygenase- 1 (HMOX- 1) promoter. METHODS. HRV measurements were taken on 539 subjects. Linear mixed effects models were fit for the logarithm of HRV metrics-including standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), high frequency (HF), and low frequency (LF) -and PM 2. 5 concentrations in the 48 hr preceding HRV measurement, controlling for confounders and a random subject effect. RESULTS. PM 2. 5 {{was significantly associated with}} SDNN (p = 0. 04) and HF (p = 0. 03) in all subjects. There was no association in subjects with GSTM 1, whereas there was a significant association with SDNN, HF, and LF in subjects with the deletion. Similarly, there was no association with any HRV measure in subjects with the short repeat variant of HMOX- 1, and significant associations in subjects with any long repeat. We found a significant three-way interaction of PM 2. 5 with GSTM 1 and HMOX- 1 determining SDNN (p = 0. 008), HF (p = 0. 01) and LF (p = 0. 04). In subjects with the GSTM 1 deletion and the HMOX- 1 long repeat, SDNN decreased by 13 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), - 21 % to - 4 %], HF decreased by 28 % (95 % CI, - 43 % to - 9 %), and LF decreased by 20 % (95 % CI, - 35 % to - 3 %) per 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM. CONCLUSIONS. Oxidative stress is an important pathway for the autonomic effects of particles.
