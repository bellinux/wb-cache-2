There exists a strong empirical support to positive relationship between effort levels in R&D and productivity. The objective {{of this paper is}} to determine and estimate the gaps in Philippine R&D. Given the causality chain, the paper tries to identify the amount of corresponding/mandatory increase in research and development. It estimates the <b>investment</b> <b>gaps</b> using growth regression model involving total factor productivity of different countries on the one hand and the research and development expenditure and research and development manpower, on the other.

40|$|The EU spends {{only about}} half as much on R&D in ICT as the US. This holds true both in {{absolute}} amounts and relative {{to the size of}} the economy. Indeed, the ICT sector alone is responsible for as much of the overall R&D <b>investment</b> <b>gap</b> as all other sectors combined. From the current data analysis, there are no signs of the ICT R&D <b>investment</b> <b>gap</b> closing. At ICT sector level, the R&D <b>investment</b> <b>gap</b> exists partly because the ICT sector is smaller in the EU than in the US and partly because of the lower R&D intensity of the sector in the EU. The lower R&D intensity is, in turn, primarily due to two sub-sectors: computer services and software on the one hand, and electronic measurement instruments on the other hand. On the positive side, and contrary to the rest of the ICT sector, these two sub-sectors also show strong R&D growth in the EU. Company data indicates that EU companies have R&D intensities similar to their US counterparts in every sub-sector, but are concentrated in less R&D intensive sub-sectors (e. g. telecom services). The US companies are also larger and more numerous in most sub-sectors. These data suggest that the ICT R&D gap between the US and the EU reflects, more than anything, a lack of European firms in the ICT sector. Among the member states, Finland and Sweden make the highest R&D effort in this sector, relative to their size. In general, Northern member states invest more than Southern member states, and the Western member states invest much more than the Eastern ones, which display very low levels of ICT R&D. JRC.

40|$|Energy {{access and}} the {{transformation}} of energy systems into reliable and modern ones are key policy priorities, given the strict interrelation between energy, economic growth and sustainability. The current and projected trends on Africa's access to energy and electricity indicate that - unless new policies are implemented - the continent's ability to transition economically will be hindered by energy scarcity. The reality of climate change edicts that, while industrialization is a pre-requisite for Africa’s growth, clean energy should propel development. Gas and renewables will emerge in the energy mix of the continent. Providing energy access will not significantly exacerbate other global challenges such as climate change mitigation and will {{play a crucial role}} in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda targets as a driver of social and economic growth.

40|$|Starting {{with the}} {{liberalization}} of capital account in 1989, speculative capital inflows have significantly raised due {{to the increase in}} interest rates resulting from incremental budget deficits in Turkey. Because of the fact that current account deficit problem has been kept in agenda while the budget deficit in Turkey has got closer to balance, a new potential determinant of current account, namely the gap between private savings and investment, net private saving is proposed recently. Therefore, as a further step, the study explores the determination of net private saving, {{within the context of the}} effect of oil price shocks on private savings and <b>investment</b> <b>gap</b> before and after the 2001 crisis. Thus, the reason of introducing the oil price as an additional variable to the model is to explain the effect of oil prices on current account deficit thru the private savings and <b>investment</b> <b>gap.</b> For this purpose, the bound testing approach to cointegration, within an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework and error-correction model (ECM) methodology, is applied for the period of 1990 : Q 1 - 2007 : Q 3.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how firms’ financial flexibility affects {{the profitability of}} three of the most commonly used style investing strategies. They are the value-growth trading strategy (going long on stocks with high Book-to-Market ratio and short on stocks with low Book-to-Market ratio), the momentum trading strategy (going long on stocks that have performed well and short on stocks that have performed poorly recently), and the accruals based trading strategy (going long on stocks with low accruals and short on stocks with high accruals). The findings suggest the value premium exists when controlling for risks using the Fama and French three factor model. However, it is explained when the risk factors are conditioned on firms’ investment irreversibility and the business cycle. Next, the momentum profit can be explained by (a) adjusting returns for risks using the Fama and French model that is conditioned on firms’ financial constraints and the business cycle, and (b) accounting for the interaction between the momentum profit and firms’ investments beyond the risk-return relationship. Finally, the accruals based trading strategy is most successful at the two ends of the financial inflexibility spectrum, supporting both an explanation based on the risk-return relationship and an explanation based on the catering theory. When controlling for the cyclicality in stock returns, the strategy ceases to be profitable. The results suggest that the understanding of corporate investment decisions can help improve the understanding of securities markets and portfolio investment strategies. There are a few lessons that investors can learn from the findings of this thesis. Value-growth investors should focus on value and growth firms with high <b>investment</b> irreversibility <b>gap.</b> Momentum investors should pursue the trading strategy among firms with high financial constraints and during economic upturns. They could also benefit from forming their portfolio from past winners and past losers with high <b>investment</b> <b>gaps.</b> Accruals based investors would benefit from pursuing the strategy among firms with high investment and financing flexibility and during economic upturns.

Some believe that FDI can fill <b>investment</b> <b>gaps,</b> either private or public and mobilizes savings (Lee and Suruga, 2005; Todaro and Smith, 2003; Hayami, 2001). This study seeks to verify the interactions and transmission mechanism between FDI, private direct investment and public direct investment in Nigeria. Furthermore, these variables were examined to ascertain their direction of causality {{and whether or not they}} have long run linear relationship. Also, the impulse responses of these variables to shocks in the extraneous variables were verified; using the Multiple-Equation VAR models with time series data ranging from 1970 - 2012. The co-integration result indicates that there is no long run relationship between these variables. In addition, the variance decomposition result shows that 46 percent of innovations in FDI were explained by its own past values, while 21 percent of the innovations were due to shocks, to private domestic investment with 31 percent due to public investment. The response of public and private investment to shocks in FDI is positive and significant in the short run and so is consistent with the findings of Jansen (1995), Misun and Tomsik (2002).

40|$|There is a stark {{contrast}} between the ambitious investment promotion efforts of many least developed countries (LDCs) and their often minimal commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Service (GATS). At a time of urgent need to address domestic infrastructure and <b>investment</b> <b>gaps,</b> this situation cannot be a positive signal for investors (either domestic or foreign), and may be a missed opportunity to address services aspects of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). LDCs often lack internationally credible mechanisms for making commitments, which contributes to their evident difficulty in attracting the more employment-generating types of investment that could bring greater opportunities for poverty alleviation. Considering that most LDCs, under domestic laws, have already opened {{a wide range of}} services sectors to foreign direct investment (FDI), there may be an opportunity to enhance the international consistency and credibility of LDC investment promotion efforts by making GATS commitments, while preserving substantial policy space with regard to the actual status quo. While reforms to domestic regulations are undoubtedly of greater importance to attracting FDI, GATS commitments, including partial commitments, can be used to publicize LDC investment priorities in services (such as attracting new businesses, encouraging joint ventures and technology transfer, etc.), and make them legally binding internationally. Offers to make new GATS commitments can further be used as bargaining chips in the current Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations.
