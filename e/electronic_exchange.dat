25|$|On 21 December 2000, HLS {{was dropped}} from the New York Stock Exchange because its market {{capitalization}} had fallen below NYSE limits, and on 29 March 2001, HLS lost both of its market makers and its place on the London Stock Exchange. Shortly after this, HLS moved its headquarters to the United States, incorporating as Life Sciences Research (LSR), and secured a $15m loan from investment bank Stephens, Inc, its largest shareholder. In September 2005, after the firebombing of the homes of a Canadian brokerage employee and a British pharmaceutical executive, the New York Stock Exchange asked LSR to delay moving its listing from the OTC Bulletin Board to the main exchange. LSR has since transferred its listing to the NYSE Arca <b>electronic</b> <b>exchange.</b> HLS {{is no longer a}} publicly traded company after being bought by CEO Andrew Baker.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first months}} of 2008 was a {{particularly}} troublesome period which caused Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to [...] "work holidays and weekends" [...] and which did an [...] "extraordinary series of moves". It bolstered U.S. banks and allowed Wall Street firms to borrow [...] "directly from the Fed". These efforts were highly controversial at the time, but {{from the perspective of}} 2010, it appeared the Federal exertions had been the right decisions. By 2010, Wall Street firms, in Clark's view, were [...] "getting back to their old selves as engine rooms of wealth, prosperity and excess". A report by Michael Stoler in The New York Sun described a [...] "phoenix-like resurrection" [...] of the area, with residential, commercial, retail and hotels booming in the [...] "third largest business district in the country". At the same time, the investment community was worried about proposed legal reforms, including the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which dealt with matters such as credit card rates and lending requirements. The NYSE closed two of its trading floors in a move towards transforming itself into an <b>electronic</b> <b>exchange.</b> Beginning in September 2011, demonstrators disenchanted with the financial system protested in parks and plazas around Wall Street.|$|E

In this context, the research aims at distinguishing factors influencing the decision for a company to adopt <b>electronic</b> data <b>exchanges</b> with its partners, and factors influencing the decision to adopt technologies supporting these <b>electronic</b> data <b>exchanges.</b> We investigate product information exchanges in the French consumer goods and retail industries through external catalogues, internal catalogues and Extranets.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Electronic</b> <b>exchanges</b> of {{information}} in Business to Business relationships have continued to grow over the last decades. In the retail industry, Product Information, defined {{as a set of}} data that represents the product, is now in the scope of retailers and their suppliers. Indeed, {{since the beginning of the}} century, projects for <b>electronic</b> <b>exchanges</b> of Product Information have accelerated because of the emergence of new technologies that facilitate them. This qualitative research focuses on Product Information exchanges in the French large retail industry and introduces Data Quality aspects in the adoption of an interorganizational information system (IOS). By using previous classifications of Data Quality dimensions [19; 47], this research aims to present Data Quality dimensions retailers and manufacturers consider to be relevant for Product Information. Secondly, it explains how IOS adoption is expected to contribute to Data Quality improvement...|$|R
