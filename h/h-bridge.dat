40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new hybrid nine-level {{inverter}} topology for IM drive. The nine-level structure is realized by using two three-phase two-level inverters fed by isolated DC voltage sources and six <b>H-bridges</b> fed by capacitors. The {{number of switches}} required in this topology is only 36 where as the conventional nine-level topologies require 48 switches.

In this topology, the requirement of DC link voltage is {{only half of the}} maximum magnitude of the voltage space vector. As the two-level inverters are powered by isolated voltage sources, the circulation of triplen harmonic current in the motor winding is prevented.
