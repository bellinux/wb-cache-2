Three months later, however, Li Dunyong dropped his case, {{reporting}} that he had been ordered to do so by judicial authorities. Another lawyer was reportedly threatened with the closing of his law firm if he chose to defend Dhondup Wangchen.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held <b>incommunicado</b> for three days. The attack {{was a major}} setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers. The incident suggested that al-Qaeda {{might not be as}} weakened as previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Abe refines this {{proof-of-concept}} {{and builds}} a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized {{to accommodate a}} human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits <b>incommunicado</b> in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{members of}} Abdel-Rahman’s legal team, {{including}} lawyer Lynne Stewart, {{were convicted of}} facilitating communication between Abdel-Rahman {{and members of the}} terrorist organization Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya in Egypt. They received long federal prison sentences, based on their violated obligation to keep Abdel-Rahman <b>incommunicado</b> while providing him legal counsel.|$|E
25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{security}} forces continued to torture and ill- treat detainees to extract confessions {{to be used}} as evidence against them at trial. According to the organization, 32 defendants accused of spying for Iran were subjected to torture and forced to confess. Detainees were held <b>incommunicado</b> and denied access to their families.|$|E
25|$|Bahrain {{security}} forces (A force encompass foreign national forces) arrested Sami Mushaima in March 2014 {{and held them}} <b>incommunicado</b> for at least 11 days. Security officials subjected Mushaima to beatings, electrocution, and sexual assault. His front teeth were severely damaged. Mushaima's family believes he was coerced into falsely confessing {{through the use of}} torture.|$|E
25|$|Human {{rights lawyer}} Mohammed al-Tajer was {{detained}} on 16 April 2011, apparently for providing legal support to other arrested activists. He was held <b>incommunicado</b> {{for two months}} before being charged with inciting hatred for the regime, engaging in illegal protests, and inciting people to harm police. He was released on 7 August, though {{the charges against him}} were not dropped.|$|E
25|$|Human Rights Watch {{also stated}} that Hamas {{authorities}} were obligated {{by the laws of}} war to allow Shalit to correspond with his family, and noted that three letters and a voice recording cannot be counted as regular correspondence. HRW also called for him to receive visits from the ICRC, and said that the prolonged <b>incommunicado</b> detention of Shalit was cruel and inhumane and amounted to torture.|$|E
25|$|Police often {{arbitrarily}} {{arrested and}} detained persons without filing charges, often to extort money from family members. Authorities rarely pressed charges {{in a timely}} manner and often created contrived or overly vague charges. No functioning bail system existed, and detainees had little access to legal counsel if unable to pay. <b>Incommunicado</b> detention was common; security forces regularly held suspects before acknowledging their detention or allowing them contact with family or counsel.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, {{during the}} H1N1 outbreak, {{while working as}} scout for Pachuca, Meza was {{detained}} <b>incommunicado</b> in Ghana for over 27 hours under terrible hygienic conditions since he flew in from Mexico. His father, Enrique Meza, strongly protested this human rights violation and inhumane treatment of his son in a letter for the Government of Ghana through the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations. Meza Jr. was later sent to Nigeria from where he left for Mexico.|$|E
25|$|According to GlobalSecurity, police {{impunity}} {{and corruption}} are serious problems. In 2008 President Assad issued {{a law that}} mandates that only the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces may issue an arrest warrant {{in the case of}} a crime committed by a military officer, member of the internal security forces, or customs police officer in the pursuit of his normal duties, and that such cases must be tried in military courts. Arbitrary and false arrests are also problems, and detainees had no legal redress. According to the accusations, the authorities use the Emergency Law to detain persons critical of the government and charge them with a wide range of political crimes, including treason. <b>Incommunicado</b> detention was a severe problem. Many persons who disappeared were believed to be either in long-term detention without charge or possibly to have died while detained. Many detainees brought to trial were held <b>incommunicado</b> for years, and their trials were often marked by irregularities and lack of due process. A shortage of available courts and lack of legal provisions for a speedy trial or plea bargaining led to lengthy pretrial detentions.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, Germer {{was elected}} to the {{governing}} National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party. At that same time, he worked as an organizer for the UMWA. In December of that year, Germer was arrested while getting off a train at Walsenberg, Colorado, the site of an ongoing mine strike. Germer was held <b>incommunicado</b> in the local jail for nearly a week in solitary confinement and his papers searched. HIs wife, Mabel Germer, was also briefly arrested. Upon his release, Germer continued to work as a UMWA organizer in the bitterly fought Colorado coal strike.|$|E

At the age of 18, Antía embarks on a spiritual retreat and announces that she will be <b>incommunicado</b> for three months.|$|E
25|$|According to Human Rights Watch {{annual report}} 2016, Emirates {{authorities}} forcibly disappeared and detained people who criticized {{the government or}} its allies. February 2015, Human Rights Watch documented {{a case in which}} three Emirati sisters, Asma, Mariam, and Al Yazzyah al-Suweidi, were forcibly disappeared by Emirates authorities. They released them without charge after spending 3 months in <b>incommunicado</b> detention. The three sisters had arrested after posting comments criticizing government for arresting their brother Dr. Issa al-Suweidi. In August 2015, Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith was arrested after posting some comments on social media in which he criticized the mass killing of Rab'a protesters in Cairo in 2013. Bin Ghaith's fate still unknown at time of writing.|$|E
25|$|Increases in the {{security}} surrounding rich infrastructure targets in Britain also had a major effect on IRA team's ability to conduct operations. The seizure of war material and inability to get newly acquired war material into Britain under wartime restrictions meant increased improvisation, which in turn led to increased exposure to discovery. It {{is also clear that}} the campaign generated a good deal of anti-Irish sentiment, which increased the British public's suspicion of Irish people in general. All these factors led to attacks tapering off around early to mid-1940. The death of Seán Russell on 14 August 1940, (he had already been effectively <b>incommunicado</b> since April 1939), and the succession of Stephen Hayes as IRA Chief of Staff also contributed to the petering out of the attacks.|$|E
25|$|The Indian National Congress, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Maulana Azad, denounced Nazi Germany {{but would}} not fight it or anyone else until India was independent. Congress {{launched}} the Quit India Movement in August 1942, refusing to co-operate in any way with the government until independence was granted. The government was ready for this move. It immediately arrested over 60,000 national and local Congress leaders, and then moved to suppress the violent reaction of Congress supporters. Key leaders were kept in prison until June 1945, although Gandhi was released in May 1944 because of his health. Congress, with its leaders <b>incommunicado,</b> played little role on the home front. The Muslim League rejected the Quit India movement and {{worked closely with the}} Raj authorities.|$|E
25|$|The other {{captured}} airmen {{remained in}} military confinement on a starvation diet, their health rapidly deteriorating. In April 1943, they {{were moved to}} Nanking, where Meder died on 1 December 1943. The remaining men—Nielsen, Hite, Barr and DeShazer—eventually began receiving slightly better treatment and were given {{a copy of the}} Bible and a few other books. They were freed by American troops in August 1945. Four Japanese officers were tried for war crimes against the captured Doolittle Raiders, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor, three for five years and one for nine years. Barr had been near death when liberated and remained behind in China recuperating until October, by which time he had begun to experience severe emotional problems. Untreated after transfer to Letterman General Hospital and a military hospital in Clinton, Iowa, Barr became suicidal and was held virtually <b>incommunicado</b> until November, when Doolittle's personal intervention resulted in treatment that led to his recovery. DeShazer graduated from Seattle Pacific University in 1948 and returned to Japan as a missionary, where he served for over 30 years.|$|E
25|$|Political prisoners: Political {{prisons are}} the harshest {{long-term}} punishment {{that can be}} inflicted to an individual in the DPRK, and are used as the means to remove from society those individuals and families that are seen as an irredeemable threat to the regime. As such, these inmates cease to be considered citizens with any rights. Persons accused of major political crimes become victims of enforced disappearance; they are detained and, if not executed immediately, brought without trial to political prison camps (kwanliso) and held <b>incommunicado.</b> Their families are never informed of their fate. The State uses this system to instill fear in the population. The inmate population has been gradually eliminated through deliberate starvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape and the denial of reproductive rights. The Commission estimates that {{hundreds of thousands of}} political prisoners have perished in these camps over the past five decades, with atrocities that resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian states established during the twentieth century. Between 80,000 and 120,000 people are believed to remain incarcerated. The DPRK has always denied the existence of this prison network.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Morse code {{began to}} be used {{extensively}} for early radio communication, before {{it was possible to}} transmit voice. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most high-speed international communication used Morse code on telegraph lines, undersea cables and radio circuits. In aviation, Morse code in radio systems started to be used on a regular basis in the 1920s. Although previous transmitters were bulky and the spark gap system of transmission was difficult to use, there had been some earlier attempts. In 1910, the US Navy experimented with sending Morse from an airplane. That same year, a radio on the airship America had been instrumental in coordinating the rescue of its crew. Zeppelin airships equipped with radio were used for bombing and naval scouting during World War I, and ground-based radio direction finders were used for airship navigation. Allied airships and military aircraft also made some use of radiotelegraphy. However, there was little aeronautical radio in general use during World War I, and in the 1920s, there was no radio system used by such important flights as that of Charles Lindbergh from New York to Paris in 1927. Once he and the Spirit of St. Louis were off the ground, Lindbergh was truly alone and <b>incommunicado.</b> On the other hand, when the first airplane flight was made from California to Australia in 1928 on the Southern Cross, one of its four crewmen was its radio operator who communicated with ground stations via radio telegraph.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", it is {{explained}} that Chapel abandoned {{a career in}} bio-research for a position in Starfleet.

Five years after Korby's disappearance, Chapel {{was assigned to the}} USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain James T. Kirk. She served as head nurse, working under Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley).|$|E

Furthermore, they {{notice that the}} guard at the checkpoint seems to already know who the bomber is. Unfortunately, the guard is in a coma from the blast, and Archer and T'Pol are <b>incommunicado.</b> Though it violates standard Vulcan ethics, Phlox and Tucker consider a mind meld, and Soval decides to perform it himself. To his surprise, he discovers that the suspect is Stel, a Vulcan investigator attached to V'Las. Soval then resolves to inform the High Command.|$|E

Walter is able to get a tissue sample, while Peter administers some medicine to calm Loeb's heart. After a DNA analysis, Walter discovers a pattern [...] "too organized to be accidental, too perfect to be natural." [...] Astrid thinks it is a Caesar cipher, and she and Olivia decipher the acronym [...] "ZFT". After talking with Broyles, Olivia is directed to talk to David Robert Jones (Jared Harris), a biochemist being held <b>incommunicado</b> in [...] "Wissenschaft Prison", Frankfurt, Germany ("Wissenschaft" [...] is German for [...] "science"). Broyles explains to her that ZFT are privately funded cells in 83 recorded countries that traffic in scientific progress, not weapons or drugs. Some fringe events in previous episodes may have been orchestrated by this group. He says little else is known.|$|E
500|$|Gui's {{confession}} {{was received}} with incredulity, {{and many of}} the facts surrounding his disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after his disappearance, were called into question. The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Jasper Tsang, said: [...] "the China Central Television (CCTV) report [...] {{did not seem to be}} able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation". Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying: [...] "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months <b>incommunicado,</b> in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility". The Washington Post said: [...] "The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even". Amnesty International’s China researcher cast doubt on the narrative, asking: [...] "Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case?" [...] The Guardian drew a connection to Operation Fox Hunt, a Chinese government campaign launched by Xi Jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of the regime who had fled abroad, and which may also have been responsible for the abduction of the other missing booksellers. By mid-June 2016, Gui's family had not yet received official confirmation that he was under detention, according to Gui's daughter.|$|E

Durrani sued Sethi for mental torture, and he countersued for defamation. An earlier dispute over the foreign rights had been settled out of court in 1992. A review of the contracts by the UK newspaper The Independent described Sethi as acting in good faith and described him and Mohsin as [...] "the injured party".|$|E
2500|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{responded by}} switching to more subtle techniques, but the courts held that such techniques, {{even if they}} do not involve physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible.
