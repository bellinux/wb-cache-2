30|$|We {{consider}} a duty-cycled sensornet including {{a set of}} ID-distinctive sensor nodes and one sink node. These nodes are organized into a multi-hop wireless network and the sink node collects the data generated by sensor nodes. Each sensor node has two alternate states: the active (awake) state and the dormant (sleeping) state. In the active state, the node can create packets and communicate with other nodes; in the sleeping state, it only maintains an alarm clock to wake up itself, <b>keeping</b> its <b>sensing</b> and radio modules turned off. During term T, if a node keeps in the active and the sleeping states for T 1 and T 0 =(T−T 1), respectively, the duty cycle of this node can then be expressed with T_ 1 /T_ 1 + T_ 0. The greater the difference between two nodes’ duty cycles, the more significant the duty cycle heterogeneity of the sensornet.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} maintaining the coverage degree of a wireless sensor network at an application specific level while <b>keeping</b> the <b>sensing</b> units of only a subset of sensor nodes active at any time to save energy. Two distributed coverage service protocols are proposed, namely NCP (Neighbor- Based Coverage Protocol) and GCP (Grid-Based Coverage Protocol), which identify redundant sensor nodes for the desired degree of coverage to turn off their sensing units. NCP introduces a novel method for evaluation of the coverage degree of a node’s sensing region by its neighbors to determine its redundancy. GCP explores the idea of dividing the target area using a virtual hexagonal-grid during which all but one sensor node with the highest residual energy are identified as redundant for {{the coverage of the}} corresponding grid unit. Performance evaluations show that both protocols result in significant energy savings while providing differentiable coverage service in the wireless sensor network with low message and computational overhead.

In this paper, we leverage the {{spatial and temporal}} correlation among the data sensed in different sub-areas to significantly reduce the required number of sensing tasks allocated (corresponding to budget), yet ensuring the data quality. Specifically, we propose a novel framework called CCS-TA, combining the state-of-the-art compressive sensing, Bayesian inference, and active learning techniques, to dynamically select a minimum number of sub-areas for sensing task allocation in each sensing cycle, while deducing the missing data of unallocated sub-areas under a probabilistic data accuracy guarantee. Evaluations on real-life temperature and air quality monitoring datasets show the effectiveness of CCS-TA. In the case of temperature monitoring, CCS-TA allocates 18. 0 - 26. 5 % fewer tasks than baseline approaches, allocating tasks to only 15. 5 % of the sub-areas on average while <b>keeping</b> overall <b>sensing</b> error below 0. 25 °C in 95 % of the cycle...|$|R
