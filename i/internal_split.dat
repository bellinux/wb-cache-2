5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened {{to ruin the}} Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> were the same issues raised in the <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E
5|$|In late 1929, {{the party}} was {{weakened}} by an <b>internal</b> <b>split.</b> Under increasing French pressure, the VNQDD leadership switched tack, replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against individuals {{with a plan to}} expel the French in a single blow with a large-scale popular uprising. After stockpiling home-made weapons, the VNQDD launched the Yên Bái mutiny on February 10, 1930 with the aim of sparking a widespread revolt. VNQDD forces combined with disaffected Vietnamese troops, who mutinied against the French colonial army. The mutiny was quickly put down, with heavy French retribution. Học and other leading figures were captured and executed and the VNQDD never regained its political strength in the country.|$|E
25|$|The Teamsters {{also had}} a number of general locals; Local 574 in Minneapolis, which had no more than 75 members in 1934, was one of them. A number of militant members, {{including}} several Communist Party members who had gone to the newly formed Communist League of America (Left Opposition) in the <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> following Trotsky's expulsion, became members of Local 574 in the early 1930s.|$|E
50|$|In May 2008, the Alliance {{suffered}} <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> and in-fighting {{between its}} more radical and moderate Islamist members over holding {{peace talks with}} the official Somalian government.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{decision}} {{on behalf of the}} Kerala Communist Unity Centre to merge with UCCRI(ML) in June 1975, but that organization suffered <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> and the merged was cancelled.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Four Powers Commission, the LPP was weakened by <b>internal</b> <b>splits.</b> Woldeab Woldemariam left the party to form a group of his own. The party was dissolved in December 1950.|$|R
25|$|The party {{carried out}} clandestine {{political}} activity until 1990, and was registered as the National Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party on 10 February 1997. It had initially sought to register as the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1995, but that name {{was given by}} the authorities to the pro-Syria Ba'athist party. Politically, the party is allied with the ruling General People's Congress; during the 2011 Arab Spring, this position caused an <b>internal</b> <b>split.</b> In March 2011, {{it was reported that}} the Hodeidah branch of the party had sided with the uprising after violent attacks on protesters in the city.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> of 1188 was {{sparked by}} {{opposition}} to the leadership of Fralmo and {{he was forced to}} leave Alfambra, the Order's headquarters, by the supporters of Rodrigo. In 1198 his supporters claimed that at that time (1188) Rodrigo had been acclaimed master (he had not). In March 1195, Pope Celestine III issued a bull granting a [...] "certain house", evidently the Holy Redeemer, which Fralmo had been seeking for his own purposes, to the Templars. The validity of this action was subsequently to be challenged by the knights of Mountjoy opposed to a merger with the Templars. The final split within the Order of Mountjoy occurred only with the Templar merger in 1196. The discontents managed to hold onto Monfragüe, which they made their centre of operations, and make Rodrigo González their master. They were confined to Castile.|$|E

50|$|Despite its {{landslide}} victory, {{the party}} began to suffer <b>internal</b> <b>splits.</b> Following the 1999 coup one faction supported {{the new regime}} headed by Azali Assoumani, whilst another called for the reinstatement of temporary head of state Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde.|$|R
25|$|Sambanthan Thevar {{took over}} the mantle of the MIC {{during a period of}} turmoil in the party in 1955, barely months before the first federal elections, and over time {{strengthen}} the party and consolidated its position in the coalition. He did not always please his members, but was able to gradually unite a party that had considerable <b>internal</b> <b>splits.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unlike other {{traditional}} criminal organizations in Mexico, {{a large portion}} of Los Zetas income comes from local operations. Drug trafficking makes up at least 50% of their revenue (other sources say less). The Zetas were more prone to activities such as kidnapping, extortion, theft and piracy. This decentralized structure opened the gang to <b>internal</b> <b>splits,</b> given the influence of low-level and regional leaders.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2013 {{the party}} {{suffered}} an <b>internal</b> <b>split.</b> On 12 April 2013 the Liberal Party Reform Council was launched, with Ion Hadârcă as leader. The {{members of this}} Council were called [...] "Liberal Reformers" [...] by the media. The <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> became permanent when a separate Liberal Reformist Party (PLR) joined the Pro-European Coalition, formed after {{the dissolution of the}} Alliance for European Integration, remaining on in the Leancă Cabinet after the Liberal Party left the government.|$|E
50|$|Island FM, {{along with}} Channel 103 were {{merged with the}} Midlands Radio group in Ireland in 2013 {{as part of an}} <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> within the Tindle group.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the Croatian Social Liberal Party lost {{representation}} in Parliament {{because of an}} <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> between Ivan Čehok, Đurđa Adlešič and others with newly elected party leader Darinko Kosor.|$|E
50|$|Despite the NYM's {{success in}} the 1938 general elections, when it had won all three seats in Lagos, its {{popularity}} in the town had diminished, {{partly due to the}} <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> caused by the row over the party's candidate for the 1941 by-election. Separately, the alliance of the NNDP with the new National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons had restored some of its credibility.|$|R
50|$|When Latvia became {{independent}} {{again in}} 1991, the LSDSP returned to Latvia. In the early 1990s, it struggled with <b>internal</b> <b>splits.</b> At one point, Latvia had 3 social democratic parties, {{two of them}} being descendants of the LSDSP, and the third being the reformed faction of the former Communist Party of Latvia (LSDP). Eventually, all three parties merged, {{under the name of}} the LSDSP.|$|R
5000|$|Within a few years, {{while holding}} onto power, the party began to split and fall apart. Wheatcroft seeks {{to explain this}} decline by {{offering}} factors long discussed by commentators: <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> over Britain's place in Europe, political sleaze, a fundamental lack of ideology and a growing desire {{in the country for}} change after eighteen years of Conservative rule, coinciding with Tony Blair's [...] "brilliant cynical sincerity".|$|R
50|$|Following an <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> from Sevilla FC, another {{club was}} formed, Betis Football Club. In 1914, they merged with Sevilla Balompié. The club {{received}} its royal patronage {{in the same}} year, and therefore adopted the name Real Betis Balompié.|$|E
50|$|During this period, an <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> in the PCdoB {{led to the}} {{formation}} of the Revolutionary Communist Party (PRC), led by José Genoíno and Tarso Genro, which would later join the Workers Party (PT) alongside the Ala Vermelha or Red Wing.|$|E

50|$|The New Left (shin-sayoku) in Japan {{refers to}} a 1960s Japanese {{movement}} that adopted the radical political thought of the Western New Left, breaking from the established Old Left of the Japanese Communist Party and Japan Socialist Party. In the 1970s the Japanese New Left became known for violent <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> and terrorism, and its influence waned, but it continued to develop new political ideologies such as Anti-Japaneseism (hanNichi-bokoku-ron).|$|R
40|$|The Future of Europe study {{conducted}} by Chatham House across different EU member states offers revealing insights on the splits both within and between elites {{and the general public}} in their attitudes towards the EU. When zooming in on the Belgian dataset, these divides are loud and clear. The Belgian general public is considerably less enthusiastic about the EU than the average of European elites. Moreover, both elite and public opinion display deep <b>internal</b> <b>splits...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1988, {{after three}} {{decades in the}} Knesset, he lost his seat over <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> in the Labour Party. He devoted {{the rest of his}} life to writing and teaching, {{including}} serving as a visiting academic at Princeton University, Columbia University and George Washington University. He also narrated television documentaries including Heritage: Civilization and the Jews (PBS, 1984), for which he was host, Israel, A Nation Is Born (1992), and On the Brink of Peace (PBS, 1997).|$|R
50|$|During the 15th {{century the}} Metropolitans worked {{together}} with the Patriarch of Constantinople to re-establish Christian Unity and in 1439 participated in the Union of Florence. In 1596 the Metropolia entered the Union of Brest, re-establishing full communion with the Holy See, however suffering a deep <b>internal</b> <b>split.</b>|$|E
50|$|In late 1980s, he quit UGDP {{and joined}} Indian National Congress. He became Chief Minister {{for a brief}} period (18 days) as part of Progressive Democratic Front led by Congress. He had to resign due to the <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> in the party. After that Luis Proto Barbosa became Chief Minister.|$|E
50|$|Politically, {{the party}} is aligned with the ruling General People's Congress. During the Arab Spring, this posture caused an <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> in the party.

50|$|Jerkov {{received}} the twenty-first {{position on the}} Democratic Party's coalition list for the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election. The party had been weakened by <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> by this time, and the list won only nineteen seats. Jerkov was not immediately re-elected, although {{she was able to}} enter the assembly on April 26, 2014, as a replacement for an elected member who resigned. She subsequently led a parliamentary committee that reviewed allegations that internal affairs minister Nebojša Stefanović had plagiarized parts of his Ph.D. thesis.|$|R
5000|$|The News of Texas {{was not a}} {{technical}} masterpiece, either. A [...] "cannon-boom" [...] music theme and amateurish graphics, along with <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> (the head of TXN was asking for drug tests) were problematic for TXN's news department. In 2000, TXCN expanded its carriage immensely with a 10-year deal on most of Texas' Time Warner Cable systems. A 2000 refresh gave it a new news theme (its own Texas Highway by Stephen Arnold Music) - but affiliates were dropping the program quickly.|$|R
5000|$|By 1958, {{despite an}} {{economic}} recovery and the unexpected success of U Nu's 'Arms for Democracy' offer that saw the surrender {{of a large number}} of insurgents most notably the PVO, the AFPFL had become riven with <b>internal</b> <b>splits,</b> which worsened following the party's congress in January 1958. In July 1958 it formally split, with one group led by Prime Minister U Nu, which he named the [...] "Clean AFPFL"; the other was led by Kyaw Nyein and Ba Swe and was known as the Stable AFPFL.|$|R
50|$|The cable also {{highlighted}} an <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> in the Kennedy administration, with anti-Diem {{officials in}} the State Department prevailing over generals and Department of Defense officials who remained optimistic that the Vietnam War was proceeding well under Diem. This was underlined by {{the manner in which}} the cable was prepared before being transmitted to Lodge.|$|E
50|$|After an <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> in late 1945, Aiséirghe's {{influence}} weakened. It was in {{some respects}} overtaken by the radical Clann na Poblachta, which shared some of its economic and cultural theories but without the anti-democratic and anti-Semitic elements. It held its last formal meeting in 1958, though the party newspaper, Aiséirghe, continued to appear until the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Mansager {{left the}} Assemblies of Yahweh, Bethel Pa. He then formed Yahweh's New Covenant Assembly in 1985. The name {{was changed to}} Yahweh's Assembly in Yahshua after an <b>internal</b> <b>split</b> in 2006. Alan Mansager (Donald Mansager's son) parted ways in 1998 as Alan {{disagreed}} with his father on the scriptural qualifications for ordaining ministers. Alan formed Yahweh's Restoration Ministry.|$|E
50|$|The Farouq Brigades (كتائب الفاروق), also spelt Farooq and Farook, was a armed rebel {{organisation}} {{formed by}} a number of Homs based members of the Free Syrian Army early in the Syrian Civil War. The group rapidly expanded in size and prominence in 2012, before suffering <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> and battlefield reversals in 2013 that greatly reduced its influence. By 2014, the group was largely defunct, with member factions joining other rebel groups. The brigades were named Farouq after Omar bin al-Khattab, a Sahaba (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the second Caliph.|$|R
50|$|Ecuador's {{political}} parties have historically been small, loose organizations that depended more on populist, often charismatic, leaders to retain support than on programs or ideology. Frequent <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> have produced extreme factionalism. However, a pattern has emerged in which administrations from the center-left alternate with those from the center-right. Although Ecuador's political elite is highly factionalized along regional, ideological, and personal lines, a strong desire for consensus on major issues often leads to compromise. Opposition forces in Congress are loosely organized, but historically they often unite to block the administration's initiatives and to remove cabinet ministers.|$|R
50|$|The {{political}} influence of these Mayan organizations has subsided {{in the last}} decade. Along with the difficulty of uniting regional and linguistic differences in the group, <b>internal</b> <b>splits</b> {{have occurred in the}} organizations due to politico-ideological lines as well as religious ones. Organization sectorization has risen, where each organization focuses on a specific issue, which resulted in blocking a development of a common political agenda. The end of the peace talks ended the common political agenda that made the movement strong in the mid-1990s. The Coordinadora de Organizaciones del Pueblo Maya (Coordinator of Organizations of the Maya People of Guatemala, COPMAGUA) only lasted six years due to internal divisions.|$|R
