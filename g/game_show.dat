5000|$|<b>Game</b> <b>shows</b> were {{sweetened}} {{during the}} 1970s and early 1980s, often played when a contestant or the host says something {{considered to be}} funny and only a small reaction comes from the live audience. Douglass' laugh track was especially heard in Chuck Barris' <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> (i.e. The Gong Show and The Newlywed <b>Game),</b> whose <b>shows</b> were designed mainly to entertain the audience; the [...] "prizes" [...] were often rudimentary or derisive. <b>Game</b> <b>shows</b> that were produced at CBS Television City and NBC Studios Burbank were also sweetened, often to intensify audience reactions, including shows like Press Your Luck (used during [...] "Whammy" [...] segments). During a typical <b>game</b> <b>show's</b> closing credits, the show used canned cheers and applause noises to sweeten the live studio audience applause noises that viewers did not hear during the credits. This was common on daytime <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> on CBS and NBC and some syndicated <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> from the 1970s through the 1990s. <b>Game</b> <b>shows</b> taped at NBC Studios Burbank used three different applause tracks for sweetening: one with a smaller crowd, one with a medium crowd, and one with a large crowd with a cheerful male audience member in the background. However, many kids' <b>game</b> <b>shows,</b> most ABC <b>game</b> <b>shows,</b> and most Mark Goodson-Bill Todman productions, such as The Price Is Right, Match Game and Family Feud were taped with a live audience present, though sweetening was used on rare occasions.|$|R

50|$|Within economics, <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> are a {{frequently}} studied form {{of natural}} experiment.

25|$|For many decades, British <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for being cheap, low-budget affairs that focused more on entertainment than actual game play and prizes, {{in large part because of}} the restrictions put on <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> following the scandal. In addition to prize limits, games of chance were also largely forbidden, meaning that a number of American <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> could not be faithfully reproduced in the UK. The lifting of these limits initially allowed more American shows to be adapted into British versions, and within a few years, the rise of <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> with much higher prize limits would originate largely in the UK and make its way to the U.S. in the late 1990s.|$|R

50|$|In general, though, a {{majority}} of early multi-player <b>game</b> <b>shows</b> - even those dealing with trivia - simply lacked the gameplay element of pitting contestants against each other simultaneously.
