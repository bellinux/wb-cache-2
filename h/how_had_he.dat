6000|$|... 'I knew it,' he said kindly. 'But {{how did he}} {{find you}} out, and <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> the {{impertinence}} to write to you at your Aunt Lily's--' ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{carried it}} out? He {{could hardly have}} broken into the house. Yet that seemed the only {{way in which it}} could have been done.|$|E
60|$|Where did he live? Bloomsbury. Did he {{know many}} people? No--nobody except {{a man in}} the orchestra. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> got his job? Through an agent. Etc. Etc.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So!' said Sigismund. 'That fellow is the Baron Rudiger von Batchburg Der Schelm! <b>How</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{the face}} to show himself here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{got into}} a ferment of anxiety, and Violet persuaded him to walk it off. He is gone out with Johnnie and Helen. Well, <b>how</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> fared?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, I know that. But now let us drop business. Tell me {{all about}} Tom. Just <b>how</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been acting? I know you didn't want to let {{out in front of}} the girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{this manner}} was Mr. Slope received. But when he left, {{he was allowed}} by each lady to take her hand and to make his adieux as gentlemen do who have been graciously entertained! Yes, he shook hands with them, and was curtseyed out courteously, the buttoned page opening the door {{as he would have}} done for the best canon of them all. He had touched the baby's little hand and blessed him with a fervid blessing; he had spoken to the widow of her early sorrows, and Eleanor's silent tears had not rebuked him; he had told Mary Bold that her devotion would be rewarded, and Mary Bold had heard the praise without disgust. And <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done all this? <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> so quickly turned aversion into, at any rate, acquaintance? <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> over-come the enmity with which these ladies had been ready to receive him, and made his peace with them so easily? ...|$|E
60|$|Oh! None. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> struck Nedda? And Felix {{looked at}} his little {{daughter}} with a certain humble curiosity. He always felt that the young instinctively knew {{so much more than}} he did.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two he stared at them incredulously. Then his {{thoughts}} flashed backwards--where or <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> become possessed of them? A few seconds were sufficient. Some one had been there in the night--most likely a woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only, after all," [...] asked Densher, {{who himself}} somehow, at this point, was having more {{to think of}} even than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> yet had--"only, after all, <b>how</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{happened}} to know? That is, to know enough." ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} following questions, each of which corresponds, sequentially, to chapter in this thesis: (1) What is the internal composition and the historical contextualization of the 18 th chapter of the Qur'an, the Surat al-Kahf? (2) Who is al-Khadir, a figure in the Surat al-Kahf, verses 66 - 82 ? <b>How</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been described in Muslim commentary and <b>how</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been analyzed in nineteenth and twentieth century scholarship; and with whom <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been associated and/or identified in such commentary and scholarship? (3) How are probable prototypes or parallels of Khadir portrayed in non-Islamicate documents traceable to before the advent of Islam? (4) What are the characteristics of the association/identification of Khadir with Elijah (Ilyas) ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pickwick {{proceeded}} {{to pour into}} the horror-stricken ear of Mr. Nupkins, an abridged account of all Mr. Jingle's atrocities. <b>He</b> related <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> first met him; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> eloped with Miss Wardle; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniary consideration; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> entrapped himself into a lady's boarding-school at midnight; and how he (Mr. Pickwick) now felt it his duty to expose his assumption of his present name and rank.|$|R
6000|$|And now flashed across Amyas {{all that}} had passed between him and Eustace in the moorland inn, and Parracombe's story, too, of the {{suspicious}} gipsy. Eustace had been beforehand with them, and warned Don Guzman! All was explained now: but <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> got hither? ...|$|E
6000|$|Carefully I {{recalled}} every circumstance of my {{pursuit of}} Thurid, and my conclusion was identical with my original belief--that Thurid had {{come this way}} without other assistance than his own knowledge and passed through the door that barred my progress, unaided from within. But <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> accomplished it? ...|$|E
6000|$|I did {{not know}} how long he might thus beat about the bush with dreadful hintings, and I was already beside myself with terror. What had he done? I saw he had been tempted; I knew from his letters that he was in no {{condition}} to resist. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> sacrificed the absent? ...|$|E
6000|$|P. 791. Burnet. Soon after that. Prince George, the Duke of Ormonde, and the Lord Dramlanrig, the Duke of Queensberry's eldest son, {{left him}} [King James], {{and came over}} to the Prince.--Swift. Yet <b>how</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been since used? [referring to the Duke of Ormonde.] ...|$|R
40|$|In conclusion, for his notable and {{creative}} contributions to physics teaching, in particular <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> alerted {{us to the}} implications of our cultural assumptions, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> found interesting physics everywhere, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> valued the humanity of physics, the American Association of Physics Teachers presents to Albert A. Bartlett the 1981 Robert A. Millikan Award...|$|R
60|$|Lisle {{explained}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found a plant which was, as he knew, {{used for}} that purpose; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> extracted the colouring matter from it.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the rail}} Kar Komak turned {{to speak to}} the warrior who had been {{detailed}} to accompany him. His eyes went wide as they rested upon the face of the young man whom he had met beside the granite cliffs that guard mysterious Lothar. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come in place of the Dusarian? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> lost it? When? Where? And {{in a flash}} {{came back}} to his outwearied, aching head remembrance of how, in {{the height of the}} eagle-fighting, there had come the plunge of a lean, gaping beak and the sudden rending of his coat. Vanished for ever was Tishnar's Wonderstone, then. The Valleys faded, Nōōmanossi drew near.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{long time}} there was nothing at all. Nothing beyond the crystal mesh of the cage. Thoughts rushed through Conger's mind, helter-skelter. How would he know the man? How could he be certain, in advance? What had he looked like? What was his name? <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> acted, before he spoke? Would he be an {{ordinary}} person, or some strange outlandish crank? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha, ha, ha!" [...] laughed Mr. Moss. [...] "Is {{that the}} little game with which he {{attempts}} to cajole you? <b>How</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> got his hand into the treasury of the theatre, so {{that he may be}} able to help you so conveniently? You have not got the money yet, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Complicated {{series of}} {{gestures}} and passes with the hands. That's <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{come in and}} that's <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to get out again. Lord! what a business I had!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>he</b> that <b>has</b> to {{bear the}} punishment; it is he that suffers," [...] said Eleanor; [...] "and what for? what <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done wrong? <b>how</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{deserved}} this persecution? <b>he</b> that never <b>had</b> an unkind thought in his life, he that never said an unkind word!" [...] and here she broke down, and the violence of her sobs stopped her utterance.|$|R
60|$|The first {{question}} was readily answered. Stepping forward, Jerry stumbled over some loose coal. He {{was in a}} coal-cellar. Around and above were brick walls. The door was of sheet-iron, and it was tightly closed and barred. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come to that place? Probably his enemies had carried him hither, although how {{they could do it}} without being seen was a question.|$|E
60|$|Robinson, when {{he heard}} this, was much struck by the old man's {{enduring}} courage. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been able to preserve this sum from the young woman's hands, pressed {{as he had been}} by her and by Brisket? Of this Robinson said nothing, but he did venture to allude {{to the fact that the}} money must, in fact, belong to the firm.|$|E
6000|$|And so I caught myself {{standing}} idly {{and studying}} him. I cannot say how greatly {{the man had}} come to interest me. Who was he? What was he? <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> happened to be? All powers seemed his, all potentialities—why, then, was he {{no more than the}} obscure master of a seal-hunting schooner with a reputation for frightful brutality amongst the men who hunted seals? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{man being}} dead, Mr. Talbot saw no {{objection}} to telling her <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never loved any other, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been false to that love.|$|R
40|$|I love {{music therapy}} more today than I ever have,” says Jim Borling, {{who has been}} a music {{therapist}} for over 30 years and teaching music therapy for 28 years at Radford University.   <b>How</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> kept his passion for music therapy for so long?  I’ve never had the chance to ask him that question – until now...|$|R
60|$|The policeman, with {{becoming}} humility, related <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{taken the}} charge; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; {{and how that}} was all he knew about it.|$|R
6000|$|No {{one would}} {{for an instant}} accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting to play with polo-balls. He carried out the {{battered}} thing into the veranda; and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks, a patter of small feet, and the thud-thud-thud of the ball rolling along the ground. Evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his treasure. But <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> managed to see that polo-ball? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come to {{disappear}} from among us? It was easily explained. HE had not {{grown used to}} being a world-famous person, and {{had been forced to}} break away from the lionising that was robbing him of all privacy and repose. So he grew a beard, put on coloured glasses, disguised himself a little in other ways, then took a fictitious name, and went off to wander about the earth in peace.|$|E
60|$|But I wander from M'Guire. From this dread glance {{into the}} past and future, his {{thoughts}} returned at a bound upon the present. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> wandered there? and how long--O heavens! how long had he been about it? He pulled out his watch; and found that but three minutes had elapsed. It seemed too bright a thing to be believed. He glanced at the church clock; and sure enough, it marked an hour four minutes {{in advance of the}} watch.|$|E
60|$|While {{he spoke}} {{he thought of}} that hot madness which had driven him in pursuit of Mildred. <b>He</b> remembered <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> chafed against it and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> felt the {{degradation}} of it.|$|R
50|$|When Academy members {{complained about}} the anachronisms in the letters, Vrain-Lucas had to forge more letters to explain away his earlier mistakes. Debate {{continued}} on to 1868 {{and the next year}} he was arrested for forgery. In the following trial Chasles <b>had</b> to testify <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been duped, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> purchased large numbers of other forged letters and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> paid total of 140,000-150,000 francs for them.|$|R
6000|$|Then, the {{old days}} before the second {{marriage}} rose up in his remembrance. He thought <b>how</b> jealous <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been of the boy, <b>how</b> jealous <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been of the girl, <b>how</b> artfully <b>he</b> <b>had</b> kept intruders at a distance, and drawn a circle round his dupe that none but himself should cross; and then <b>he</b> thought, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done all this to be flying now, like a scared thief, from only the poor dupe? ...|$|R
