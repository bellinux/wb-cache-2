5|$|A {{preliminary}} Raw brand feud {{was between}} Shawn Michaels and Edge. Their feud started at Taboo Tuesday 2004 when Michaels was voted over Edge to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. At New Year's Revolution 2005, Edge lost {{a shot at}} the title in an Elimination Chamber with Michaels as special referee. In the Elimination Chamber, Michaels superkicked Edge, followed by a lionsault from Chris Jericho, with Jericho making the cover. Believing it was Michael's <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> he was not crowned champion, Edge speared Michaels and the two men were booked into a match at Royal Rumble.|$|E
5|$|During the Silurian period (444–419 Ma) the {{continent}} of Laurentia gradually collided with Baltica, joining Scotland to the area that would become England and Europe. Sea levels rose as the Ordovician ice sheets melted, and tectonic movements created major faults which assembled the outline of Scotland from previously scattered fragments. These faults are the Highland Boundary Fault, separating the Lowlands from the Highlands, the Great Glen <b>Fault</b> <b>that</b> divides the North-west Highlands from the Grampians, the Southern Uplands Fault and the Iapetus Suture, which runs from the Solway Firth to Lindisfarne and which marks {{the close of the}} Iapetus Ocean and the joining of northern and southern Britain.|$|E

5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2000, a love {{triangle}} storyline began featuring McMahon, Triple H and Kurt Angle. The storyline {{continued at}} Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him. McMahon later became Angle's manager {{and was in}} his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at No Mercy. The alliance was short lived, however, as after The Rock performed his Rock Bottom maneuver on McMahon at No Mercy, Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time. On the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw, McMahon lost the WWF's Women's Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E

5|$|Tensional forces {{forming the}} Basin and Range physiogeographic {{province}} {{to the west}} about 20 to 25million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults that bound the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on {{the east and the}} Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane fault zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping normal <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> stretches at least 155miles (250km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this fault is about 3,600ft (1,098m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E
5|$|Following {{criticism}} {{over the}} sensitivity of their tyre compounds, tyre supplier Pirelli announced changes to their tyre allocation for the Spanish Grand Prix, making pit strategy {{the focal point of}} the Grand Prix. Pirelli would later diagnose the problems with the tyre compounds as originating from developing them on a testing chassis that was two years out-of-date at the time. Lewis Hamilton took his third pole of the season, edging out Williams driver Pastor Maldonado by half a second, while Maldonado's team-mate Bruno Senna was eliminated early when he spun. Hamilton was later excluded from the qualifying results after his car did not have enough fuel to return to the pits for scrutineering, promoting Maldonado to pole position and moving Hamilton to the back of the grid. Fernando Alonso took the lead of the race at the first corner, but Maldonado reclaimed it during the second round of pit stops, when his team forced Ferrari to pit early while Alonso was held up by the Marussia of Charles Pic. Maldonado maintained a lead of seven seconds over Alonso, but a mistake by his crew during the third pit stop cost him time and left him vulnerable to the Ferrari driver in the final stint of the race. Meanwhile, third-placed Kimi Räikkönen moved to an ambitious strategy that would see him attempt to force Maldonado and Alonso to race beyond the life expectancy of their tyres, allowing him to swoop in at the last minute to steal first place. Räikkönen's strategy failed as Maldonado withstood pressure from Alonso for fifteen laps, winning the race by three seconds and becoming the first Venezuelan driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. It was Williams's first win in one hundred and thirty Grand Prix starts; their previous race win was Juan Pablo Montoya's victory at the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton recovered from twenty-fourth on the grid to finish eighth, while Sebastian Vettel overcame a drive-through penalty and an unscheduled stop for a technical <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> forced his team to replace his front wing to make a late move on Nico Rosberg for sixth place that would preserve his championship lead.|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{describe}} <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> {{can occur in}} reversible circuit as compared to <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> can occur in classical irreversible circuits. Because there are many approaches from classical irreversible circuits that are being adapted to reversible circuits, {{it is necessary to}} analyze what <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> exists in irreversible circuits can appear in reversible circuit as well. Thus we focus on comparing <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> can appear in classical circuit technology with <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> can appear in reversible and quantum circuit technology. The comparison is done {{from the point of view}} of information reversible and information irreversible circuit technologies. We show that the impact of reversible computing and quantum technology strongly modifies the <b>fault</b> types <b>that</b> can appear and thus the <b>fault</b> models <b>that</b> should be considered. Unlike in the classical non-reversible transistor based circuits, in reversible circuits it is necessary to specify what type of implementation technology is used as different technologies can be affected by different faults. Moreover the level of faults and their analysis must be revised to precisely capture the effects and properties of quantum gates and quantum circuits that share several similarities with reversible circuits. By not doing so the available testing approaches adapted from classical circuits would not be able to properly detect relevant faults. In addition, if the classical faults are directly applied without revision and modifications, the presented testing procedure would be testing for such <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> cannot physically occur in the given implementation of reversible circuits. The observation and analysis of these various faults presented in this chapter clearly demonstrates what faults can occur and what faults cannot occur in various reversible technologies. Consequently the results from this chapter can be used to design more precise tests for reversible logic circuits. Moreover the clearly described differences between faults occurring in reversible and irreversible circuits means that new algorithms for fault detection should be implemented specifically for particular reversible technologies...|$|R

5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Inspection helps {{software}} managers {{by eliminating}} faults in early phases of Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Capture-recapture {{is a technique}} which provides an estimates of faults remaining in a software artifact. This helps managers {{to make a decision}} whether a re-inspection is required or not. At a higher level, software requirements document consists of general faults, faults of omission and faults of comission. A common belief is <b>that</b> the <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> are visible in the artifact are easier to detect by the inspectors. The nature of <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> could be detected by inspectors has not been empirically studied. Using the inspection data from varying number of students, we analyzed the category (general or omission or comission) of <b>faults</b> <b>that</b> are easier to detect by the inspectors.
