40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the academic literature by examining two issues in relation to corporate Internet disclosure. First, we make a detailed content analysis of the <b>investor</b> <b>relation</b> section on the Web sites of US companies to gain insight into the type and amount of information provided to investors on corporate Web sites and to establish {{a measure of the}} Internet disclosure level. We find that companies are not exploiting the full potential of this disclosure medium. In a second study, we examine the relation between the cost of equity capital and the disclosure level of information in the <b>investor</b> <b>relation</b> section of corporate Web sites. We regress the cost of equity capital, obtained from a comprehensive discounted cash flow model, on the disclosure measure from the content analysis study {{to examine the relationship between}} these two variables. For a cross-sectional sample of 141 non-financial US companies, we find a negative and highly significant association between the cost of equity capital and level of Internet <b>investor</b> <b>relation</b> disclosure. The results remain significant after controlling for potentially influential variables such as different risk characteristics and firm size. The results indicate thus that Internet disclosure is useful to investors...|$|R

40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Using {{a unique}} {{database}} on insider trading in Belgium, we investigate whether high-quality corporate communication, as proxied by disclosure scores of professional financial analysts, reduces {{the profitability of}} insider trading. Research Findings/Insights: We find a significant negative association between corporate communication quality and insider trading profitability. Closer inspection of the different communication channels shows {{that the quality of}} press releases and <b>investor</b> <b>relation</b> activities is more relevant in explaining insiders’ abnormal returns than the quality of annual reports and corporate websites. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides evidence that high-quality communication contributes to reducing insider trading profitability and information asymmetry. In addition, the quality of voluntary disclosure channels like press releases and <b>investor</b> <b>relation</b> activities seems to be relatively more effective in reducing information asymmetry than mandatory annual reports. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings demonstrate concrete benefits of high-quality communication. In particular, outside investors benefit from better communication as it creates more of a level playing field between investors. Also, companies benefit from better communication as it reduces information asymmetry, which in turn results in a lower cost of capital. ...|$|R

The study is based on a survey of sample of 155 companies having completed mergers and acquisitions deals announced during January 2003 to December 2008. We document a positive relationship between corporate governance score and short-term abnormal returns by constructing broad corporate governance Index (CGI) for Indian public listed companies. We use a broad, multifactor corporate governance score, which is based on the responses to objective survey questions supplemented with interviews of senior management, directors, CFOs, board members, company secretaries, compliance officers, and <b>investor</b> <b>relation</b> officers. The questionnaire is designed on the basis of major standard qualities relevant to measure the corporate governance.

40|$|Abstract: The {{scope of}} this project is to {{investigate}} the relationship between efficiency and performance in the integrated oil & gas industry (majors). We propose the estimation of regression models to explain the relative performances of selected companies {{in terms of their}} relative efficiencies. We expect to find out that, against intuition, in this industry more efficiency weakly leads to better performance, while its relative size and investment strategy would play a much bigger part; a possible reason is the large differences in the profitability of upstream projects. The access to highly profitable projects in the upstream is expected to be an important performance determinant. The proposed method is to build the efficiency measure through data envelopment analysis (DEA), for it provides a non-parametric technique for measuring the relative efficiency between several decision-making units. Data for this study was obtained from the past 5 fiscal years (2003 - 07) files submitted to the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additional data was obtained from the <b>investor's</b> <b>relation</b> section of each company's website. 2 1...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{communication}} is challenged by new communication possibilities {{due to the}} rapid development of new media, as they are established by information and communications technology. Traditional corporate communication departments interact with different target groups using different media trying to generate all news on their own in order to influence opinions and to set their agenda. With the upcoming of new media {{this is no longer}} feasible: New media are interactive and enable the creation of (virtual) communities. Corporate communication has to adapt from traditional target-group- to a new community-paradigm. In new media corporate information is available on many sites and though a lot of services not necessarily influenced by the corporates themselves. Corporate communication should try to integrate those information providers in their communication concept and use them as third party endorsers. In this article we discuss why corporate communication should adopt the community paradigm and depict how this could be done. We will develop a financial community model for corporate communication.
