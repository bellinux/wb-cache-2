The oceanic <b>identation</b> {{just north of}} Alaska's Seward Peninsula is named Kotzebue Sound, {{in honor of the}} Count's brother, explorer Otto von Kotzebue.

This happens because the boundary lines are not sharp and {{by the fact that}} the human vision needs to training and is so liable to sick and fatigue. To minimize this important factor of the measure process, the observer’s capability and interpretation, this works presents a methodology to automatic measure the hardness <b>identation,</b> by using Computer Vision techniques. The main focus is the development of methods to extract the features of <b>identation</b> measurement. With this methodology theuser's skill has no influence in the final hardness result. It’s developed four methods to obtain the measurement of the identation’s dimension for each hardness test. Also the best methodology is chosen with the aid of game theory elements...|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} to establish {{for the first}} time the identity and prevalence of coccidian parasites of New Zealand cats and dogs and to determine the effect of various factors on the activation of Isospora felis and Isospora rivolta sporozoites. The associations between these protozoa and such organisms as Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Besnoitia and other related genera are examined and the literature concerning their life cycles, nomenclature and general biology reviewed. Examination of faecal samples from 508 cats and 481 dogs from North Island localities revealed that 155 (30. 5 %) and 307 (63. 8 %) respectively, contained coccidia. The majority of infected samples were found to contain a single coccidian but in total four valid coccidians from cats and four from dogs, as well as several pseudoparasitic coccidia, were recorded and described. The identities and prevalences of these valid coccidians were: (a) Cats : Isospora felis (17. 5 %) Isospora rivolta (2. 2. %) Toxoplasma gondii (0. 98 %) Sarcocystis sp. (16. 9 %) (b) Dogs : Isospora canis (4. 0 %) Isospora ohioensis (9. 2 %) Hammondia heydorni (2. 7 %) Sarcocystis sp. (58. 8 %) The sex of the host had no significant effect on the prevalence of infection. The effect of other factors, such as season, host age and host origin, however, was found to vary from coccidian to coccidian and appeared to be explicable in terms of differences in routes of transmission, host immunity and intermediate host specificity. Levels of sporocyst shedding in cats and dogs naturally infected with Sarcocystis sp. tended to be low with the majority excreting 200 sporocysts per gram of faeces or less. The specific identities of such sporocysts are unknown but at least some from cats were demonstrated, by mouse infection, to be those of S. muris. Attempts to induce similar Sarcocystis infection in mice, using isolates of I. felis recovered from the faeces of naturally infected cats were unsuccessful. After completion of the main survey, a further coccidian showing similarities to Besnoitia wallacci was recovered from the faeces of one of five feral cats. The feeding of sporulated oocysts of this coccidian to mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs resulted in the formation of typical Besnoitia cysts in all hosts except the last. Studies on the activation of I. felis and I. rivolta sporozoites revealed that, although some differences were apparent between the two, both were capable of activation over a wide range of conditions. Activation of both species was observed to take place in trypsin and bile between temperatures of 21 ° and 43 °C (the range tested) and to occur rapidly at 39 °C. While the presence of bile appeared to be essential for this process that of trypsin did not. In general, neither the concentration of bile (above 5 %) nor the type of bile was found to have any marked effect on the level of activation attained while hydrogen ion concentration (pH range 5. 0 to 10. 0) also appeared to have little influence. Unlike many species of coccidia which have been studied, pretreatment of oocysts before exposure to trypsin and bile was found not to be an essential prerequisite for the activation of I. felis and I. rivolta. However, higher levels of activation were attained when pretreatment was used than when it was not although for I. rivolta at least, the level of activation appeared to be less dependent on pretreatment for oocysts stored in sulphuric acid than for those stored in potassium dichromate. The process of activation and excystation of both species was observed to be essentially similar to that described for other species of coccidia which also lack either sporocyst stieda bodies or oocyst micropyles. Sporozoites escaped following the collapse of the sporocyst wall and were observed to complete excystation through <b>identations</b> and fractures at one or both ends of the oocyst...|$|R

One interesting tool to probe the mechanical properties of living cells and other complex systems is the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Rheological properties of the sample are obtained usually from the force-indentation (F-δ) measurements and by fitting with the Sneddon's modification of the Hertz model. This model describes the relationship between the force applied by a stiff cone, a purely elastic indentation in a flat and soft sample and the Young's modulus E. AFM uses a flexible cantilever with a pyramidal tip (or sphere) at the end that will locally indent the viscoelastic material. Another approach is to superpose low-amplitude sinusoidal oscillations to an initial <b>identation</b> δ 0 (polyacrylamide gel or cells).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the ultrastructural modifications that cockroach campaniform sensilla undergo at three major {{stages in the}} molting cycle and finds that the sensilla are physiological functional at all developmental stages leading to ecdysis. Late stage animals {{on the verge of}} ecdysis have two completely separate cuticles. The campaniform sensillum sends a 220 -mum extension of the sensory process through a hole in its cap in the new (inner) cuticle across a fluid-filled molting space to its functional insertion in the cap in the old (outer) cuticle. Mechanical stimulation of the old cap excites the sensillum. The ultrastructural geometry of late stage sensilla, coupled with the observation they are physiolgically functional, supports the hypotheses (a) that sensory transduction occurs {{at the tip of the}} sensory process, and (b) that cap <b>identation</b> causes the cap cuticle to pinch the tip of the sensory process, thereby stimulating the sensillum...|$|E

40|$|The {{resistance}} of material to crack propagation {{is defined as}} fracture toughness (K) and is one measure of the strain energy absorbing ability of brittle materials. An <b>identation</b> technique {{was used to compare}} the apparent fracture toughness (K) and hardness of six dental ceramic materials to a control soda-lime-silica glass. The materials studied included Vita VMK 68 body porcelain, Optec HSP body porcelain, Dicor, IPS- Empress castable ceramics, Vitadur N core porcelain and In-Ceram core porcelain. Alumina reinforced materials (In-Ceram core) resulted in the highest fracture toughness values followed by Vitadur N core porcelain. IPS-Empress and Optec HSP materials showed moderate but statistically significant (P 0. 0001) greater values compared to conventional feldspathic porcelain Vita VMK 68 and a control soda-lime-silica glass. These differences in K were attributed to differences in the nature of crack microstructure interaction. The hardness of Dicor castable ceramic was significantly lower than all materials tested including soda-lime-silica glass suggesting a lack of direct correlation between those two properties.

40|$|Segmented {{indentor}}s {{were used}} to conduct <b>identation</b> tests using urea model ice. Each segment of an indentor was supported on three load cells to enable measurement of force generated in that segment {{as a result of}} interaction with ice. Tests were conducted using 3, 5 or 7 segments. The range of ice thickness was between 40 and 81 mm, and the rate of indentation was between 2 and 400 mm s super minus super 1. The results are presented as time-history plots of forces across each segment as well as the whole width of an indentor. The main result of these tests is that the effective pressure measured during tests at low indentation rate was higher than that at high indentation rate. The force-time plots indicate that there was simultaneous failure of ice on all segments at low indentation rates and that there was nonsimultaneous failure of ice at high rates of indentation. This behavior is attributed to brittle, flaking failure at high indentation rates. Spectral analysis of force data indicates that most of the power is contained at frequencies of less than 5 Hz. The peaks in the ice force records fit a Weibull probability distribution. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The unopened eye {{maintains}} a relatively stable spherical contour {{due to the}} expansile influence of the intraocular pressure. When the eye is opened this expansile pressure is lost and some degree of collapse of the scleral shell ensues. In eyes with a relatively flaccid sclera an anterior segment incision may induce significant reduction in {{the volume of the}} posterior segment of the globe. During intracapsular cataract extraction on such eyes, scleral collapse can cause anterior displacement of the lens and iris when the eye is opened and vitreous loss as soon as the lens is extracted. Scleral collapse tends to occur during intraocular surgery on previously aphakic eyes. In this situation it may become difficult to achieve a vitreous-free anterior sement by open sky vitrectomy. Metallic scleral supporters prevent inward collapse of that portion of the sclera to which they are attached. They do not prevent downward collapse of the posterior sclera shell. Upward traction is required to prevent the downward component of scleral collapse. A system for controlled suspension of the globe during intraocular surgery has been devised and used in a variety of surgical procedures. The apparatus is simple and it does help to minimize downward scleral collapse. It does not prevent scleral <b>identation</b> or distortion by external forces and cannot substitute for inadequate anesthesia and akinesia or faulty surgical technique...|$|E

The composite plates were 8 -ply (+ 45, 0,- 45, 90) s laminates supported in a clamped-clamped/free-free configuration with varying amounts of in-plane load, N(sub x), applied. Specimens were impacted at energies of 3. 4, 4. 5, and 6 Joules (2. 5, 3. 3, and 4. 4 ft-lb). The amount of damage induced into the specimen was evaluated using instrumented impact techniques, x-ray inspection, and cross-sectional photomicroscopy. Some static <b>identation</b> tests were performed to examine if the impact events utilized {{in this study were}} of a quasi-static nature and also to gain insight into the shape of the deflected surface at various impact load combinations. Load-displacement curves from these tests were compared to those of the impact tests, as was damage determined from x-ray inspection. The finite element technique was used to model the impact event and determine the stress field within the laminae. Results showed that for a given impact energy level, more damage was induced into the specimen as the external in-plane load, N(sub x), was increased. The majority of damage observed consisted of back face splitting of the matrix parallel to the fibers in that ply, associated with delaminations emanating from these splits.

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with the testing of short cracks for the fracture characterization of a coarse grained alumina. In the literature, the clear R-curve behavior of the examined alumina has been confirmed, that is, the crack resistance increases with increasing crack length. To investigate the crack initiation and crack growth, the indentation method was used. With indentation cracks and complementary crack opening tests, it was possible to achieve a consistent fracture mechanics result. At room temperature a constant crack resistance of K_R#approx# 4 MPam" 1 "/" 2 was measured in air and K_R#approx# 5. 5 MPam" 1 "/" 2 in vacuum. At 1000 C in air a crack resistance of K_R#approx# 3. 3 MPam" 1 "/" 2 was determined. The results are in qualitative agreement with the reduction of crack resistance due to environmental effects (for example, humidity) and thermally activated crack growth. It was interesting that only constant crack resistance values for controlled, stable crack extension of the indentation cracks were measured for the alumina, in spite of the known R-curve behavior. This result clearly contradicts the published literature, both for the indentation cracks and for the long cracks. It must, however, be regarded as correct because of the accurate analysis of the internal stresses, which are responsible for the propagation of the <b>identation</b> cracks. An attempt was made to investigate the observed difference in crack resistance of indentation cracks and long cracks using crack opening tests. It was indeed found that the ratio of crack opening to crack length was significantly higher for indentation cracks than for long cracks. Obviously the toughening mechanisms that are the basis for R-curve behavior are almost saturated in the case of indentation cracks. In addition, crack propagation experiments with indentation cracks are required in order to confirm generally these considerations for ceramics that show R-curve behavior. (orig.)
