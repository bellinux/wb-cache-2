25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, {{the shorter}} smallsword became an {{essential}} <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> in European {{countries and the}} New World, though in some places such as the Scottish Highlands large swords as the basket-hilted broadsword were preferred, and most wealthy men and military officers carried one slung from a belt. Both the smallsword and the rapier remained popular dueling swords well into the 18th century.|$|E

Ancient Egyptian soldiers commonly wore scarab beetles into battle as the beetles were considered to have supernatural powers of protection against enemies.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the views}} of the critics, La Tosca proved to be phenomenally successful. It {{ultimately}} had 3000 performances in France alone, played in theatres all over the world for thirty years, and netted Sardou 500,000 francs. Sarah Bernhardt's costumes brought Empire silhouette dresses back into style, and the long walking stick she carried in Act 1 became a new <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory.</b> Both a leopard in a famous New York menagerie and an American race horse were named in honour of the play's heroine, as were numerous dishes, several of them created by the French chef, Auguste Escoffier, a devotee of Bernhardt.|$|E
25|$|Doc Martens {{were dark}} shoes or boots with air-cushioned soles that were worn by both sexes in the 1980s. They were an {{essential}} <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> for the skinhead and punk subcultures in the United Kingdom. Sometimes Doc Martens were paired with miniskirts or full, Laura Ashley- style dresses. They were an {{important feature of}} the post-punk 1980s Gothic look which featured long, back-combed hair, pale skin, dark eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick, black nail varnish, spiked bracelets and dog-collars, black clothing (often made of gabardine), and leather or velvet trimmed in lace or fishnet material. Corsets were often worn by girls. British bands that inspired the gothic trend include The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Cult. This trend would return in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|A tattoo {{is a form}} of body {{modification}} where {{a design}} is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Brought to Europe from Polynesia in the early 19th century through naval routes, it was originally largely restricted to naval use, and was a male-only domain. By the later 20th century its use was more widespread and extended to female users. By the end of the 20th many stigmas of the tattoo culture had gone and it moved into the realm of being a <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> for both men and women.|$|E

25|$|Kỳ {{was well}} known for his flamboyant, {{colorful}} conduct and dress during his younger days. His trademark <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> before he faded from public view in the 1970s was a silk scarf, which he wore with his black flight suit. He often raised eyebrows {{when he was the}} military prime minister by arriving at events to meet civilians with his wife in matching black flight suits, boots, blue caps, and silk scarves. He rarely was seen without a cigarette. He was notorious for his love of gambling, women, and glamour, which made American officials wary of him. One official called him an “unguided missile.” When he was a young pilot, Kỳ once landed a helicopter in the road in front of a girlfriend's house in order to impress her, causing the locals to panic and earning the ire of his commander for misusing military equipment. On one occasion, Kỳ is said to have pulled a handgun on a journalist whose questions annoyed him. Many in the South Vietnamese public service, military, and the general public hated his tempestuous and impetuous style and regarded him as a “cowboy.” and a “hooligan.” At his only public campaign appearance during the 1967 presidential election, the large crowd repeatedly heckled him loudly, calling him a “cowboy leader” and “hooligan” and as a result he did not make any more appearances at rallies.|$|E
500|$|Robinson and Jekyll {{were part}} of the Arts and Crafts Movement, a broader {{movement}} in art, architecture, and crafts during the late 19th century which advocated a return to the informal planting style derived as much from the Romantic tradition as from the actual English cottage garden. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1888 began a movement toward an idealised natural country garden style. The garden designs of Robinson and Jekyll were often associated with Arts and Crafts style houses. Both were influenced by William Morris, {{one of the leaders of}} the Arts and Crafts Movement—Robinson quoted Morris's views condemning carpet bedding; Jekyll shared Morris's mystical view of nature and drew on the floral designs in his textiles for her gardening style. When Morris built his Red House in Kent, it influenced new ideas in architecture and gardening—the [...] "old-fashioned" [...] garden suddenly became a <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> among the British artistic middle class, and the cottage garden esthetic began to emigrate to America.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the disco}} era, men engaged in {{elaborate}} grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, both activities {{that would have}} been considered [...] "feminine" [...] according to the gender stereotypes of the era. Women dancers wore glitter makeup, sequins or gold lamé clothing that would shimmer under the lights. Bold colours were popular for both genders. Platform shoes and boots for both genders and high heels for women were popular footwear. Necklaces and medallions were a common <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory.</b> Less commonly, some disco dancers wore outlandish costumes, dressed in drag, covered their bodies with gold or silver paint, or wore very skimpy outfits leaving them nearly nude; these uncommon get-ups {{were more likely to be}} seen at invitation-only New York City loft parties and disco clubs.|$|E

2500|$|In 1914 the Board of Trustees of the Youngstown YMCA {{adopted a}} {{permanent}} policy of conducting {{a summer camp}} for boys. [...] The campsite in 1914 was established at Cannon's Mills on Little Beaver River. [...] Land for the camp was donated by John H. Fitch {{in addition to a}} sum of money sufficient to operate the camp for a five-year period. [...] Thirty-two campers were enrolled for the first year, and the camp continued to operate at that site for the summers of 1915, 1916 and 1917. [...] During these first years, a common <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> for campers was a forked stick; these had to be carried for protection due to the abundance of rattlesnakes and copperheads in the area. [...] Fortunately, this reptilian problem was rectified through the relocation of the camp grounds.|$|E
2500|$|Mods also treated scooters as a <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory.</b> Italian scooters were {{preferred}} due {{to their}} clean-lined, curving shapes and gleaming chrome, with sale driven by close associations between dealerships and clubs, such as the Ace of Herts. For young mods, Italian scooters were the [...] "embodiment of continental style {{and a way to}} escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing". Mods customised their scooters by painting them in [...] "two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [...] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights". Some mods added four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. They often put their names on the small windscreen. They sometimes took their engine side panels and front bumpers to electroplating shops to get them covered in highly reflective chrome.|$|E
2500|$|The provocative {{lyrics of}} the [...] "Physical" [...] title track {{prompted}} two Utah radio stations {{to ban the}} single from their playlists. (In 2010, Billboard magazine ranked this as the most popular single ever about sex.) To counter its overtly suggestive tone, Newton-John filmed an exercise-themed video that turned the song into an aerobics anthem and made headbands a <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> outside the gym. She pioneered the nascent music video industry by recording a video album for Physical featuring videos of all the album's tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime-time special, Let's Get Physical, becoming a Top 10 Nielsen hit. The success of Physical led to an international tour {{and the release of}} her second hits collection, the double platinum Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (No. 16 Pop), which yielded two more Top 40 singles: [...] "Heart Attack" [...] (No. 3 Pop) and [...] "Tied Up" [...] (No. 38 Pop). The tour was filmed for her Olivia in Concert television special which premiered on HBO in January 1983. The special was subsequently released to video earning Newton-John another Grammy nomination.|$|E

2500|$|The opera glove {{has enjoyed}} varying {{popularity}} in the decades since World War I, being most prevalent as a <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> in the 1940s through the early 1960s (long gloves were an important accessory of Christian Dior's [...] "New Look" [...] designs), but {{continues to this day}} to be popular with women who want to add a particularly elegant touch to their formal outfits, and have enjoyed minor revivals in fashion design on several occasions in recent years (they were very prominent, for example, in haute couture collections for the fall/winter 2007 season). Opera gloves continue to be popular accessories for bridal, prom, debutante, and quinceañera gowns and at very formal ballroom dances (to this day, for example, it is mandatory for female participants at the Vienna Opera Ball to wear white opera gloves) and are often worn by entertainers such as can-can dancers and burlesque performers (particularly to perform a gown-and-glove dance). In popular culture, probably the two best-known images incorporating opera gloves are those of Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946) and Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). (Actress Audrey Hepburn was also known for glove-wearing on- and off-screen, but the style of glove she popularized is a type of coat-sleeve-length or three-quarters-length glove, rather than true opera-length.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Women's fashion {{during the}} Empire {{was set to}} a large degree by the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais and her {{favorite}} designer, Hippolyte Leroy, who was inspired by the Roman statues of the Louvre and the frescoes of Pompeii. Fashions were also guided by a new magazine, the Journal des Dames et des Modes, with illustrations by the leading artists of the day. The antique Roman style, introduced during the Revolution, continued to be popular but was modified because Napoleon disliked immodesty in women's clothing; low necklines and bare arms were banned. The waist of the Empire gowns was very high, almost under the arms, with a long pleated skirt down to the feet. Corsets were abandoned, and the preferred fabric was mousseline. The main <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> for women was the shawl, inspired by the Orient, made of cashmere or silk, covering the arms and shoulders. Napoleon's military campaigns also influenced fashion; after the Egyptian campaign, women began to wear turbans; after the Spanish campaign, tunics with high shoulders; and after the campaigns in Prussia and Poland, Polish furs and a long coat called a pelisse. They also wore jackets inspired by military uniforms, with epaulettes. In cold weather women wore a redingote, from the English word [...] "riding coat", borrowed from men's fashion, or, after 1808, a witchoura, a fur coat with a hood.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{film critic}} Pauline Kael, [...] "Brando {{represented}} {{a reaction against}} the post-war mania for security. As a protagonist, the Brando of the early fifties had no code, only his instincts. He was a development from the gangster leader and the outlaw. He was antisocial because he knew society was crap; {{he was a hero}} to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap... Brando represented a contemporary version of the free American... Brando is still the most exciting American actor on the screen." [...] Sociologist Dr. Suzanne Mcdonald-Walker states: [...] "Marlon Brando, sporting leather jacket, jeans, and moody glare, became a cultural icon summing up 'the road' in all its maverick glory." [...] His portrayal of the gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One has become an iconic image, used both as a symbol of rebelliousness and a <b>fashion</b> <b>accessory</b> that includes a Perfecto style motorcycle jacket, a tilted cap, jeans and sunglasses. Johnny's haircut inspired a craze for sideburns, followed by James Dean and Elvis Presley, among others. Dean copied Brando's acting style extensively and Presley used Brando's image as a model for his role in Jailhouse Rock. The [...] "I coulda been a contender" [...] scene from On the Waterfront, according to the author of Brooklyn Boomer, Martin H. Levinson, is [...] "one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history, and the line itself has become part of America's cultural lexicon." [...] Brando's powerful [...] "Wild One" [...] image was still, as of 2011, being marketed by the makers of his Triumph Thunderbird motorcycle, in a range of clothing inspired by his character from the film and licensed by Brando's estate.|$|E
