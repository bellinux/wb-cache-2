5000|$|The Ars Theurgia Goetia mostly {{derives from}} Trithemius's Steganographia, though the seals and {{order for the}} spirits are {{different}} due to corrupted transmission via manuscript. [...] Rituals not found in Steganographia were added, in some ways conflicting with similar rituals found in the Ars Goetia and Ars Paulina. Most of the spirits summoned are tied to points on a compass, four Emperors tied to the cardinal points (Carnesiel in the East, Amenadiel in the West, Demoriel in the North and Caspiel in the South), sixteen Dukes tied to cardinal points, <b>inter-cardinal</b> <b>points,</b> additional directions between those. There are an additional eleven Wandering Princes, totaling thirty one spirit leaders who each rule several to a few dozen spirits.|$|E
