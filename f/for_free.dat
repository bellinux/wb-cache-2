50|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} in combinatorial group theory, a normal form <b>for</b> a <b>free</b> group over {{a set of}} generators or <b>for</b> a <b>free</b> product of groups is a representation of an element by a simpler element, the element being either in the free group or free products of group. In case of free group these simpler elements are reduced words {{and in the case}} of free product of groups these are reduced sequences. The precise definitions of these are given below. As it turns out, <b>for</b> a <b>free</b> group and <b>for</b> the <b>free</b> product of groups, there exists a unique normal form i.e each element is representable by a simpler element and this representation is unique. This is the Normal Form Theorem <b>for</b> the <b>free</b> groups and <b>for</b> the <b>free</b> product of groups. The proof here of the Normal Form Theorem follows the idea of Artin and van der Waerden.|$|R
