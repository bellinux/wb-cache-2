These parasite species showed aggregated dispersion, except for C. striatuli, which had a uniform dispersion. The component community of parasites showed a low Brillouin diversity (0. 67 ± 0. 27), low species richness (3. 5 ± 0. 8) and low evenness (0. 43 ± 0. 17), and it was characterized by the presence of species with high prevalence and abundance.

Detection for malicious applications in smartphone has become a research hotspot. There are many studies that were mainly based on <b>host</b> <b>mode.</b> Although this kind of approach has the advantage of an effective collection of client features, it can interfere with the original environment for detection and only applies to certain versions of phones. In this paper, we combine network traffic analysis with data mining to identify malicious network behavior. We improve Apriori algorithm to extract network traffic features from network data, and overall exposes malware functionalities through operational behavioral triggers. Then, it adopts a density-based local outlier factor (LOF) clustering algorithm to form a detection model. ADMDM model can effectively detect an anomaly, and it has good results in unknown anomaly detection. The proposed model can be used for daily smartphone security checking and evaluation. Moreover, ADMDM enriches techniques for dynamic smartphone behavior analysis.|$|E

Up until now, the biggest factor that hampers wide proliferation of robots is locomotion and maneuverability.

To overcome this, we are proposing a stair climbing robot that looks a lot like the human leg and can adjust itself according to the height of the step. But, we are currently developing a unit to carry payload of about 4 Kg. The automatic adjustment in the robot according to the height of the stair is done by connecting an Android device that has an application programmed in OpenCV with an Arduino in <b>Host</b> <b>mode.</b> The Android Device uses it camera to calculate the height of the stair and sends it to the Arduino for further calculation.

This is confirmed by the numerical calculations at finite temperatures for the spin-Hall conductivity and the single-particle excitation spectrum; the spin Hall conductivity is almost quantized, σ^xy_spin∼ 2 (e/ 2 π), predicting gapless edge modes carrying the spin current, while the helical edge modes in the single-particle spectrum are gapped out with respecting symmetry. It is clarified how the TEMI state evolves from the ordinary spin Hall insulating state with increasing the Hubbard interaction at a given temperature and then undergoes a phase transition to a trivial Mott insulating state.

40|$|The Universal Serial Bus (USB) {{connection}} {{has become}} the de-facto standard for both charging and data transfers for smart phone devices including Google’s Android and Apple’s iPhone. To further enhance their functionality, smart phones are equipped with programmable USB hardware and open source operating systems that empower them to alter the default behavior of the end-to-end USB communications. Unfortunately, these new capabilities coupled with the inherent trust that users place on the USB physical connectivity {{and the lack of}} any protection mechanisms render USB a insecure link, prone to exploitation. To demonstrate this new avenue of exploitation, we introduce novel attack strategies that exploit the functional capabilities of the USB physical link. In addition, we detail how a sophisticated adversary who has under his control one of the connected devices can subvert the other. This includes attacks where a compromised smart phone poses as a Human Interface Device (HID) and sends keystrokes in order to control the victim host. Moreover, we explain how to boot a smart phone device into USB <b>host</b> <b>mode</b> and take over another phone using a specially crafted cable. Finally, we point out the underlying reasons behind USB exploits and propose potential defense mechanisms that would limit or even prevent such USB borne attacks. 1...|$|E
40|$|Silicon {{nanowires}} (SiNWs) {{attached to}} a wafer substrate are converted to inversely tapered silicon nanocones (SiNCs). After excitation with visible light, individual SiNCs show a 200 -fold enhanced integral band-to-band luminescence as compared to a straight SiNW reference. Furthermore, the reverse taper is responsible for multifold emission peaks {{in addition to the}} relatively broad nearinfrared (NIR) luminescence spectrum. A thorough numerical mode analysis reveals that unlike a SiNW the inverted SiNC sustains a multitude of leaky whispering gallery modes. The modes are unique to this geometry and they are characterized by a relatively high quality factor (Q = 1300) and a low mode volume (0. 2 < (λ/n_eff) ^ 3 < 4). In addition they show a vertical out coupling of the optically excited NIR luminescence with a numerical aperture as low as 0. 22. Estimated Purcell factors F_p ∝ Q/V_m of these modes can explain the enhanced luminescence in individual emission peaks as compared to the SiNW reference. Investigating the relation between the SiNC geometry and the mode formation leads to simple design rules that permit to control the number and wavelength of the <b>hosted</b> <b>modes</b> and therefore the luminescent emission peaks...|$|R

However, to date no three-component bosons of phonon has been reported. Here, through first-principles calculations, we have reported that the phonon spectra of the WC-type TiS, ZrSe, and HfTe commonly host the unique triply degenerate nodal points (TDNPs) and single two-component Weyl points (WPs) in THz frequency. Quasiparticle excitations near TDNPs of phonons are three-component bosons, beyond the conventional and known classifications of Dirac, Weyl and doubly-Weyl phonons. Moreover, {{we have found that}} both TiS and ZrSe have five pairs of type-I Weyl phonons and a pair of type-II Weyl phonons, whereas HfTe only has four pairs of type-I Weyl phonons.
