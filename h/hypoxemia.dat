5|$|Often, DVT {{begins in}} the valves of veins. The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen {{concentrations}} in the blood (<b>hypoxemia)</b> of a valve sinus. <b>Hypoxemia,</b> which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. <b>Hypoxemia</b> also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is known}} to cause {{respiratory}} depression. In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of <b>hypoxemia</b> or apnea becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. <b>Hypoxemia</b> (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. <b>Hypoxemia</b> (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen {{administration}} to treat <b>hypoxemia,</b> if present.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, flushing, venous insufficiency, {{increased}} defibrillator threshold, edema, and/or {{cardiac arrest}} – {{some of which}} may be due to <b>hypoxemia</b> secondary to respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hypoxemia</b> and {{acidosis}} {{caused by}} asphyxia in drowning affect various organs. There can be {{central nervous system}} damage, cardiac arhythmias, pulmonary injury, reperfusion injury, and multiple-organ secondary injury with prolonged tissue hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary hypertension* is high {{pressure}} in the pulmonary artery. In dogs it {{can be caused by}} heartworm disease, pulmonary thromboembolism, or chronic <b>hypoxemia</b> (low oxygen). It can result in right-sided heart disease (cor pulmonale). Signs include difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{complications}} {{occur in}} up to 50% of patients. Severe lung injury and <b>hypoxemia</b> result in high mortality. Most cases of severe lung injury are due to ARDS, with or without sepsis. Pulmonary haemorrhage, pleural effusions, atelectasis, and intrapulmonary shunts also contribute to respiratory difficulty.|$|E
25|$|At {{very high}} altitude, , maximum SaO2 falls below 90% as the {{arterial}} PO2 falls below 60mmHg. Extreme <b>hypoxemia</b> may occur during exercise, during sleep, {{and in the}} presence of high altitude pulmonary edema or other acute lung conditions. Severe altitude illness occurs most commonly in this range.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{approach}} to evaluation begins by {{assessment of the}} airway, breathing, and circulation followed by a medical history and physical examination. Signs that represent significant severity include hypotension, <b>hypoxemia,</b> tracheal deviation, altered mental status, unstable dysrhythmia, stridor, intercostal indrawing, cyanosis, tripod positioning, pronounced use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes) and absent breath sounds.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{associated}} complaints with utilization of nitric oxide in neonatal patients. Some of them include dose errors {{associated with the}} delivery system, headaches associated with environmental exposure of nitric oxide in hospital staff, hypotension associated with acute withdrawal of the drug, <b>hypoxemia</b> associated with acute withdrawal of the drug, and pulmonary edema in patients with CREST syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Acute chest {{syndrome}} (ACS) {{is defined}} by {{at least two of}} the following signs or symptoms: chest pain, fever, pulmonary infiltrate or focal abnormality, respiratory symptoms, or <b>hypoxemia.</b> It is the second-most common complication and it accounts for about 25% of deaths in patients with SCD, majority of cases present with vaso-occlusive crises then they develop ACS. Nevertheless, about 80% of patients have vaso-occlusive crises during ACS.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, ongoing {{direct use}} of nitric oxide use is only {{approved}} for neonates. In the adult ICU setting, inhaled ·NO can improve <b>hypoxemia</b> in acute lung injury, {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome, and severe pulmonary hypertension, although the effects are short-lived {{and there are no}} studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes. It is used on an individualized basis in ICUs as an adjunct to other definitive therapies for reversible causes of hypoxemic respiratory distress.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin {{deficiency}} can {{be caused}} either by a decreased amount of hemoglobin molecules, as in anemia, or by decreased ability of each molecule to bind oxygen at the same partial pressure of oxygen. Hemoglobinopathies (genetic defects resulting in abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule) may cause both. In any case, hemoglobin deficiency decreases blood oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin deficiency is, in general, strictly distinguished from <b>hypoxemia,</b> defined as decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood, although both are causes of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen supply to tissues).|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{metabolic}} and homeostatic changes which result from untreated pain, including an increased requirement for oxygen, accompanied by a reduction in the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs. This combination can lead to inadequate oxygen supply, resulting in potential <b>hypoxemia.</b> In addition, a rise in stomach acidity accompanies the stress reaction precipitated by pain, and there is a risk of aspirating this into the lungs, further endangering lung integrity and tissue oxygenation. In cases of acute, persistent pain, the metabolism becomes predominantly catabolic, causing reduced efficiency of the immune system and a breakdown of proteins caused by the action of the stress hormones. In combination, healing of damaged or infected tissue may be impaired, and morbidity and mortality increased.|$|E
25|$|Cases {{of severe}} {{overdose}} {{have been reported}} and symptoms displayed may include prolonged deep coma or deep cyclic coma, apnea, respiratory depression, <b>hypoxemia,</b> hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary aspiration, {{with the possibility of}} death. Severe consequences are rare following overdose of benzodiazepines alone but the severity of overdose is increased significantly if benzodiazepines are taken in overdose in combination with other medications. Significant toxicity may result following recreation drug misuse in conjunction with other CNS depressants such as opioids or ethanol. The duration of symptoms following overdose is usually between 12 and 36 hours in the majority of cases. The majority of drug-related deaths involve misuse of heroin or other opioids in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant drugs. In most cases of fatal overdose it is likely that lack of opioid tolerance combined with the depressant effects of benzodiazepines is the cause of death.|$|E
25|$|Acute lung injury (ALI), {{also called}} non-cardiogenic {{pulmonary}} edema, {{is characterized by}} the abrupt onset of significant <b>hypoxemia</b> and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of cardiac failure. The core pathology is disruption of the capillary-endothelial interface: this actually refers to two separate barriers – the endothelium and the basement membrane of the alveolus. In the acute phase of ALI, there is increased permeability of this barrier and protein rich fluid leaks out of the capillaries. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells – Type 1 pneumocytes represent 90% of the cell surface area, and are easily damaged. Type 2 pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, which is important as these cells produce surfactant, transport ions and proliferate and differentiate into Type 1 cells. The damage to the endothelium and the alveolar epithelium results in the creation of an open interface between the lung and the blood, facilitating the spread of micro-organisms from the lung systemically, stoking up a systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, the injury to epithelial cells handicaps the lung’s ability to pump fluid out of airspaces. Fluid filled airspaces, loss of surfactant, microvascular thrombosis and disorganized repair (which leads to fibrosis) reduces resting lung volumes (decreased compliance), increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right to left shunt and the work of breathing. In addition, lymphatic drainage of lung units appears to be curtailed—stunned by the acute injury—which contributes to the build-up of extravascular fluid. Some patients rapidly recover from ALI and have no permanent sequelae. Prolonged inflammation and destruction of pneumocytes leads to fibroblastic proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, tracheal remodeling and lung fibrosis. This fibrosing alveolitis may become apparent as early as five days after the initial injury. Subsequent recovery may be characterized by reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to further lung injuries. Extensive microvascular thrombosis may lead to pulmonary hypertension, myocardial dysfunction and systemic hypotension.|$|E
500|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} the combination of obesity (body mass index above 30kg/m2), <b>hypoxemia</b> (falling oxygen levels in blood) during sleep, and hypercapnia (increased blood carbon dioxide levels) during the day, resulting from hypoventilation (excessively slow or shallow breathing). The disease has been known since the 1950s, initially as [...] "Pickwickian syndrome" [...] in reference to a Dickensian character but currently under a more descriptive name.|$|E
500|$|Symptoms of DPB include chronic {{sinusitis}} (inflamed paranasal sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields {{large amounts of}} sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include [...] (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and <b>hypoxemia</b> (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of {{the walls of the}} bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or [...] "right heart failure").|$|E
500|$|Normally, {{the ratio}} of {{ventilation}} to perfusion is about one-to-one; the volume of air entering the alveoli (ventilation) is about {{equal to that of}} blood in the capillaries around them (perfusion). [...] This ratio is reduced in pulmonary contusion; fluid-filled alveoli cannot fill with air, oxygen does not fully saturate the hemoglobin, and the blood leaves the lung without being fully oxygenated. Insufficient inflation of the lungs, which can result from inadequate mechanical ventilation or an associated injury such as flail chest, can also contribute to the ventilation/perfusion mismatch. As the mismatch between ventilation and perfusion grows, blood oxygen saturation is reduced. [...] Pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, in which blood vessels near the hypoxic alveoli constrict (narrow their diameter) in response to the lowered oxygen levels, can occur in pulmonary contusion. [...] The vascular resistance increases in the contused part of the lung, leading to a decrease in the amount of blood that flows into it, [...] directing blood to better-ventilated areas. Although reducing blood flow to the unventilated alveoli is a way to compensate for the fact that blood passing unventilated alveoli is not oxygenated, the oxygenation of the blood remains lower than normal. [...] If it is severe enough, the <b>hypoxemia</b> resulting from fluid in the alveoli cannot be corrected just by giving supplemental oxygen; this problem is the cause of {{a large portion of the}} fatalities that result from trauma.|$|E
500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DPB requires {{analysis of the}} lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT. [...] Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tree-in-bud" [...] pattern. [...] <b>Hypoxemia,</b> another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.|$|E

2500|$|Drowning {{experts have}} {{recognized}} that the end result pathophysiology of <b>hypoxemia,</b> acidemia, and eventual death is the same whether water entered the lung or not. As this distinction does not change management or prognosis, but causes significant confusion due to alternate definitions and misunderstandings, it is generally established that pathophysiological discussions of [...] "dry" [...] versus [...] "wet" [...] drowning are not relevant to drowning care.|$|E
2500|$|Forensic {{diagnosis}} of drowning {{is considered one}} of the most difficult in forensic medicine. External examination and autopsy findings are often non-specific, and the available laboratory tests are often inconclusive or controversial. [...] The purpose of investigation is generally to distinguish whether the death was due to immersion, or whether the body was immersed post mortem. The mechanism in acute drowning is <b>hypoxemia</b> and irreversible cerebral anoxia due to submersion in liquid.|$|E
2500|$|Erythropoietin (EPO), {{also known}} as hematopoietin or hemopoietin, is a {{glycoprotein}} cytokine secreted by the kidney in response to cellular hypoxia; it stimulates red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) in the bone marrow. Low levels of EPO (around 10 mU/ml) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover. Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO (up to 10,000 mU/ml) include any anemia, and [...] <b>hypoxemia</b> due to chronic lung disease.|$|E
2500|$|When using 100% O2 (Fi 1.00), {{the degree}} of {{shunting}} is estimated by subtracting the measured Pa (from an arterial blood gas) from 700 mmHg.

A shunt of more than 25% should prompt {{a search for the}} cause of this <b>hypoxemia,</b> such as mainstem intubation or pneumothorax, and should be treated accordingly.

Other such causes of a shunt include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{mechanism}} is unknown, it is proposed that {{a blow to}} the abdomen may raise the pressure within the abdomen so high that the diaphragm bursts. [...] Blunt trauma creates a large pressure gradient between the abdominal and thoracic cavities; this gradient, in addition to causing the rupture, can also cause abdominal contents to herniate into the thoracic cavity. Abdominal contents in the pleural space interfere with breathing and cardiac activity. They can interfere with the return of blood to the heart and prevent the heart from filling effectively, reducing cardiac output. If ventilation of the lung {{on the side of the}} tear is severely inhibited, <b>hypoxemia</b> (low blood oxygen) results.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebral {{hypoperfusion}} is {{the reduction}} of blood flow to {{all parts of the}} brain. The reduction could be to a particular part of the brain depending on the cause. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding. <b>Hypoxemia</b> (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially vulnerable [...] "watershed" [...] areas - border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A watershed stroke refers to the condition when the blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the decline in lung function observed in chronic bronchitis may be slowed with smoking cessation. Chronic bronchitis is treated symptomatically and may be treated in a nonpharmacologic manner or with pharmacologic therapeutic agents. Typical nonpharmacologic approaches to the management of COPD including bronchitis may include: pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. Inflammation and edema of the respiratory epithelium may be reduced with inhaled corticosteroids. Wheezing and shortness of breath can be treated by reducing bronchospasm (reversible narrowing of smaller bronchi due to constriction of the smooth muscle) [...] with bronchodilators such as inhaled long acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (e.g., salmeterol) and inhaled anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide or tiotropium bromide. Mucolytics may have a small therapeutic effect on acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Supplemental oxygen is used to treat <b>hypoxemia</b> (too little oxygen in the blood) and {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality in chronic bronchitis patients. Oxygen supplementation can result in decreased respiratory drive, leading to increased blood levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and subsequent respiratory acidosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypoxemia</b> {{is present}} in nearly all {{patients}} with FES, often to a PaO2 of well below 60 mmHg. Arterial <b>hypoxemia</b> in these patients {{has been attributed to}} ventilation-perfusion inequality and intrapulmonary shunting. Acute cor pulmonale is manifested by respiratory distress, <b>hypoxemia,</b> hypotension and elevated central venous pressure.|$|E

5000|$|Chronic <b>hypoxemia</b> {{leads to}} delay {{in all aspects}} of CNS maturation. With {{worsening}} fetal <b>hypoxemia,</b> there is decline in fetal activity. [...] With further <b>hypoxemia,</b> fetal breathing ceases. Gross body movements and tone decrease further. [...] Fetal heart rate decreases due to spontaneous deceleration due to direct depression of cardiac contractility. This leads to intrauterine fetal death.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that an arterial blood gas measurement which shows that the partial pressure of oxygen is lower than normal constitutes <b>hypoxemia,</b> there is less agreement concerning whether the oxygen content of blood is relevant in determining <b>hypoxemia.</b> This definition would include oxygen carried by hemoglobin. The oxygen content of blood is thus sometimes viewed {{as a measure of}} tissue delivery rather than <b>hypoxemia.</b>|$|E
