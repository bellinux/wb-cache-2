40|$|In the {{measurement}} and instrumentation fields, kinematic couplings {{have been widely}} used to create precise and repeatable interfaces on a variety of devices. However, these devices have been limited to low load and clean environments such as in semiconductor manufacturing facilities. While traditional factory environments present less ideal conditions for the implementation of kinematic couplings, the benefits of more repeatable, deterministic interfaces is becoming more necessary as tolerances for products continue to become more stringent. In this thesis, general exact constraint and kinematic coupling design theory is discussed with specific application for use in industrial environments. Factors such as installation and cleanliness are discussed along with traditional design parameters such as Hertzian contact stress and preload. To test out the application of kinematic couplings to detrimental environments, two separate case studies were performed. The first case study consists of a small scale metrology device used to calibrate the home position of the ABB 6400 R robot. In this application, a low-load coupling is designed for a less than ideal environment. The second case study applies kinematic coupling theory to the medium scale, high load wrist interface on the same robot. In the latter, two forms of couplings were compared, including the classic ball and <b>groove</b> <b>coupling</b> as a baseline and the three pin coupling as a new, cheap solution. Testing of prototypes of each concept shows potential for inclusion of this technology in future robot models. by Patrick Willoughby. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The human SNM 1 A and SNM 1 B/Apollo {{proteins}} {{are members}} of an extended family of eukaryotic nuclease containing a motif related to the prokaryotic metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) fold. SNM 1 A is a key exonuclease during replication-dependent and transcription-coupled interstrand crosslink repair, while SNM 1 B/Apollo is required for maintaining telomeric overhangs. Here, we report the crystal structures of SNM 1 A and SNM 1 B at 2. 16 Å. While both proteins contain a typical MBL-β-CASP domain, a region of positive charge surrounds the active site of SNM 1 A, which is absent in SNM 1 B and explains the greater apparent processivity of SNM 1 A. The structures of both proteins also reveal a putative, wide DNA-binding groove. Extensive mutagenesis of this <b>groove,</b> <b>coupled</b> with detailed biochemical analysis, identified residues that did not impact on SNM 1 A catalytic activity, but drastically reduced its processivity. Moreover, we identified a key role for this groove for efficient digestion past DNA interstrand crosslinks, facilitating the key DNA repair reaction catalysed by SNM 1 A. Together, the architecture and dimensions of this <b>groove,</b> <b>coupled</b> to the surrounding region of high positive charge, explain the remarkable ability of SNM 1 A to accommodate and efficiently digest highly distorted DNA substrates, such as those containing DNA lesions...|$|R
50|$|A grooved fitting, {{also known}} as a <b>grooved</b> <b>coupling,</b> has four elements: <b>grooved</b> pipe, gasket, <b>coupling</b> housing, and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by {{cold-forming}} (or machining) a groove {{at the end of a}} pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Grooved</b> <b>coupling</b> {{pipe joining}} systems uses a roll {{grooving}} technique to join pipes and pipe joining components. A groove {{is placed on}} the end of two pipes to prepare the pipes engagement with the coupling housing and gasket. The gasket creates a pressure responsive seal on the outside diameter of the pipe, unlike standard compression joints, where pressure acts to separate the seal. The gasket sealing is enhanced as the coupling housing is tightened onto the pipe end. [...] "The economics of the grooved method derive from simplified assembly that involves three basic concepts: a pressure responsive gasket that creates a leak-tight seal; couplings that hold the pipe together; and fasteners that secure the couplings.|$|R

Unfortunately, optoelectronics lacks an obvious platform for monolithic integration. One of the practical solutions is the hybrid integration, through heteroepitaxial growth, of compound semiconductor optoelectronic components with silicon technology. This thesis is devoted to developing high-performance GaAs-based quantum dot lasers directly grown on silicon substrates and their monolithic integration with waveguides and electroabsorption modulators. The investigation of 1. 5 μm siliconbased high-Q random photonic crystal microcavity light emitters utilizing PbSe colloidal quantum dots has also been conducted. High-performance quantum dot lasers directly-grown on silicon substrates have been achieved in this study. The performance of III-V-based lasers on silicon can be degraded by the inherent high-density propagating dislocations. To enhance device performance, a novel quantum dot dislocation filter has been developed. The best lasers exhibit relatively low threshold current density (Jth = 900 A/cm 2), large small-signal modulation bandwidth of 5. 5 GHz, and a high characteristic temperature (T 0 = 278 K). The monolithic {{integration of}} InGaAs QD lasers with waveguides and quantum well(QW) electroabsorption modulators has been achieved through molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth and regrowth.

40|$|Based on the {{waveguide}} mode (WGM) method, coupling {{interaction of}} electromagnetic wave in a groove doublet configuration is studied. The formulation obtained by WGM method {{for a single}} groove [Prog. Electromagn. Res. 18, 1 – 17 (1998) ] is extended to two grooves.

Six load cells measure the normal forces at the contact points of a three <b>groove</b> kinematic <b>coupling.</b> Three toggle clamps {{are used to}} preload the machine, {{so that it does}} not come apart. The device was designed, analyzed, built and tested. The error will mainly depend on frictional forces, load cells error and the toggle clamps. Frictional forces affect hysteresis, absorption and settlement of the coupling. Different solutions have been designed and tested to reduce friction. First, we tried direct contact between three stainless-steel rods and the stainless-steel load cells. The results were fully distorted due to the high friction of hard steel. We also tried three stainless-steels rods with flexures to contact the steel button cells. The results were much better and more repeatable, but absorption was not good enough. Finally, we tried using Teflon. Teflon is stuck to a steel plate that touches the contact points, leaving Teflon free of high stresses and allowing it to reduce friction between the contacts. The outcome was acceptable. In this case, hysteresis will be reasonably low, absorption is moderate and settlement-based problems are small for small preloads. Fortunately, settlement ability will be improved thanks to vibrations. Future investigations shall look towards low friction solutions, since the sturdiest and most user-friendly design will be the one that minimizes friction during the settlement process. by Jaime Moreu Gamazo.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A bulk-flow model for determination of the leakage and dynamic force characteristics of angled injection Lomakin bearings is presented. Zeroth- and first-order equations describe the equilibrium flow for a centered bearing and the perturbed flow for small amplitude rotor motions about the equilibrium position, respectively. The computational analysis accounts for the flow interaction between the injection orifices, the feed circumferential groove and the film lands through adequate Bernoulli-type relationships at the interfaces. The influence of the holes and the groove is considered with a one control-volume model in the <b>groove</b> and <b>coupled</b> with an existing bulk-flow program for annular pressure seals. Flow turbulence is accounted for with turbulent shear stress parameters and Moody's friction factors. The zeroth- and first-order flow equations are solved numerically using a robust computational method. Comparisons between predictions and experimental results for a tangential-against-rotation injection Lomakin bearing configuration show that the current bulk-flow model predicts well the leakage and the direct stiffness and damping force coefficients. Trends for the cross-coupled stiffness coefficient with respect to the rotor speed and the supply pressure are correct, but quantitative agreement remains poor despite the introduction of an additional groove-film land parameter in an effort to improve the determination of the important circumferential velocity at the film land entrance. A parameter investigation evidences the effects of the groove geometry on the Lomakin bearing leakage and dynamic force coefficients. The orifice injection angle in the groove does not have a sensible influence on the leakage and the direct rotordynamic coefficients, yet it is the main design parameter considering the Lomakin bearing stability characteristics, through the determination of the cross-coupled stiffness coefficient. This confirms the promising stabilizing effect of the tangential-against-rotation injection configuration. Besides the impact of the orifice injection angle, the analysis shows that, given the operating conditions and the film lands geometry, the static and dynamic force characteristics of the Lomakin bearing depend on two typical groove numbers defined from the groove geometry parameters. The analysis also shows that the film land clearance and length have a larger impact on the Lomakin bearing performance than its groove depth and length...|$|R
40|$|Venom {{systems have}} evolved on {{multiple}} occasions across the animal kingdom, {{and they can}} act as key adaptations to protect animals from predators [1]. Consequently, venomous animals serve as models for {{a rich source of}} mimicry types, as non-venomous species benefit from reductions in predation risk by mimicking the coloration, body shape, and/or movement of toxic counterparts [2 – 5]. The frequent evolution of such deceitful imitations provides notable examples of phenotypic convergence and are often invoked as classic exemplars of evolution by natural selection. Here, we investigate the evolution of fangs, venom, and mimetic relationships in reef fishes from the tribe Nemophini (fangblennies). Comparative morphological analyses reveal that enlarged canine teeth (fangs) originated {{at the base of the}} Nemophini radiation and have enabled a micropredatory feeding strategy in non-venomous Plagiotremus spp. Subsequently, the evolution of deep anterior <b>grooves</b> and their <b>coupling</b> to venom secretory tissue provide Meiacanthus spp. with toxic venom that they effectively employ for defense. We find that fangblenny venom contains a number of toxic components that have been independently recruited into other animal venoms, some of which cause toxicity via interactions with opioid receptors, and result in a multifunctional biochemical phenotype that exerts potent hypotensive effects. The evolution of fangblenny venom has seemingly led to phenotypic convergence via the formation of a diverse array of mimetic relationships that provide protective (Batesian mimicry) and predatory (aggressive mimicry) benefits to other fishes [2, 6].

40|$|Terahertz waveguides are {{the focus}} of {{considerable}} research interest due to their potential for sensing, imaging and communications applications. Two of the most promising designs are the metal wire waveguide and the parallel-plate waveguide. The metal wire waveguide exhibits excellent low loss and low dispersion characteristics. However, the radiation is only weakly coupled to the wire and the beam extends a great distance from the waveguide, which can lead to high bending loss. In my research I show that this large beam extent also gives a high degree of flexibility in the geometry required to couple radiation into the waveguide or between waveguide sections. I also show that the traditional formalism of bending loss is incomplete, and that there is an optimum radius of curvature to reduce loss. The relationship between the beam extent and the radius of the wire presents the possibility of a tapered waveguide to confine the radiation as it propagates. I here present experimental data and simulations results to verify this subwavelength confinement at the tip of a tapered metal wire waveguide, which is of great interest for near-field imaging applications. The parallel-plate waveguide is another design frequently employed due to its low loss and low dispersion characteristics. Resonant structures may also be easily incorporated into the waveguide for sensing and filtering applications. One such structure is a single rectangular groove, which serves as a notch filter with a very narrow linewidth when the transverse-electric (TE) mode of the waveguide is excited, though its physical origin is poorly understood. In this work I present a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the rectangular resonant cavity in a TE-mode parallel-plate waveguide, particularly with respect to its potential as a microfluidic refractive index sensor.
