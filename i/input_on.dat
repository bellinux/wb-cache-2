5|$|Python's {{development}} is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process. The PEP {{process is the}} primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community <b>input</b> <b>on</b> an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's Benevolent Dictator For Life.|$|E

40|$|Limited by {{the tiny}} {{structure}} of axons, {{the effects of}} these axonal hyperpolarizing <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> neuronal activity have not been directly elucidated. Here, we imitated these processes by simultaneously recording the activities of the somas and proximal axons of cortical pyramidal neurons. We found that spikes and subthreshold potentials propagate between somas and axons with high fidelity. Furthermore, inhibitory <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> axons have opposite effects on neuronal activity according to their temporal integration with upstream signals. Concurrent with somatic depolarization, inhibitory <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> axons decrease neuronal excitability and impede spike generation. In addition, following action potentials, inhibitory <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> an axon increase neuronal spike capacity and improve spike precision. These results indicate that inhibitory <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> proximal axons have dual regulatory functions in neuronal activity (suppression or facilitation) according to neuronal network patterns...|$|R

5|$|All five {{songs on}} the {{extended}} play (EP) were written and produced by Chana and Chan. The pair worked on Manos Arriba for roughly two years and recorded it in Chan's recording studio in the garage of his home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. They initially created the material {{as a way to}} secure a record deal, but later decided to release it independently. Chana later said that the decision allowed her to have more creative <b>input</b> <b>on</b> her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E
5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's <b>input</b> <b>on</b> who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E

Philips insisted that the development studios utilize all aspects of the CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the War Office and the Office of Works held discussions on how to manage the castle. In 1908, Portland was placed onto what was known as the Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would {{continue}} to use and manage the historic property, but with <b>input</b> <b>on</b> repairs from the Office of Works. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Portland Harbour became an important naval base and the castle was used an ordnance store. The castle became a military residence again in the interwar years, and during the Second World War it was used for accommodation and offices by British and US soldiers, with part of the castle used once again for storing ordnance. A concrete pillbox, since demolished, was constructed alongside the castle early on in the war.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we show several results about {{monotone}} planar circuits. We show that monotone planar circuits of bounded width, {{with access to}} negated input variables, compute exactly the functions in non-uniform AC 0. This provides a striking contrast to the non-planar case, where exactly NC 1 is computed. We show that the circuit value problem for monotone planar circuits, with <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> the outer face only, can be solved in LOGDCFL ` SC, improving a LOGCFL upper bound due to Dymond and Cook. We show that for monotone planar circuits, with <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> the outer face only, excessive depth compared to width is useless; any function computed by a monotone planar circuit of width w with <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> the outer face can be computed by a monotone planar circuit of width O(w) and depth w O(1). Finally, we show that monotone planar read-once circuits, with <b>inputs</b> <b>on</b> the outer face only, can be efficiently learned using membership queries. 1 Introduction In this paper, we prove a number of [...] ...|$|R

If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E

5|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party {{included}} the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little <b>input</b> <b>on</b> legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered the front-runner for the presidential nomination in 1880.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control <b>input</b> <b>on</b> bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public <b>input</b> <b>on</b> the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E
