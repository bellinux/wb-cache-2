This example {{consists of an}} IEC 60320 C14 <b>inlet</b> <b>connector</b> and fuse holder. The fuse is protected by a sliding plastic cover, which requires the power lead to be removed {{before it can be}} opened.|$|E
50|$|Power entry modules {{are also}} {{available}} rated as water resistant at IP65, with seal protection at the panel opening, around the fuse holders when provided, and between the <b>inlet</b> housing and <b>connector</b> pins.|$|R

50|$|Selection of a coupler {{depends in}} part on the IEC {{appliance}} classes. The shape and dimensions of appliance <b>inlets</b> and <b>connectors</b> are coordinated so that a connector with lower current rating, temperature rating, or polarization cannot be inserted into an appliance inlet that requires higher ratings. (i.e. a Protection Class II connector cannot mate with a Class I inlet which requires an earth); whereas connecting a Class I to a Class II appliance inlet is possible because it creates no safety hazard.|$|R
50|$|Power entry modules {{frequently}} allow {{connections to}} the equipment circuitry using quick connect tab terminals, also known as blade connectors. An AC <b>inlet</b> <b>connector</b> allows use of a separate, detachable AC line cord that has the type of wall plug favored by the locality. IEC 60320 AC inlet connectors typically used can handle either 120 or 250 volts.|$|E
5000|$|SAE J1772 (IEC Type 1) is a North American {{standard}} for electrical connectors for electric vehicles {{maintained by the}} SAE International and has the formal title [...] "SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler". It covers the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle <b>inlet</b> and mating <b>connector.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{optical fibers}} are key {{components}} for the high-capacity telecommunications networks. The characteristics of physical contact optical connectors deteriorate when the fiber <b>connector</b> <b>inlet</b> face is contaminated or physically damaged, causing fatal failure or the performance degradation, In this work, we study {{the temperature and}} power-loss behavior for contaminated and physically damaged optical connectors, under high optical power regime. The {{results indicate that the}} connector lifetime when subjected to high propagation powers, depends essentially on its cleanness rather than the surface degradation resulting from the plugging/unplugging operations.

40|$|Blood-contacting {{devices have}} contributed to {{improving}} the treatment of patients. However, thrombus formation at the interface between a connector and tube is still a potential source of thrombus-related complications that induce stroke or myocardial infarction. We aimed to develop a non-blood-contacting real-time method for visualizing thrombus formation, and to experimentally investigate the time-dependent phenomenon of thrombus formation at the interface between a connector and a tube in a medical device. An optical coherence tomography device with a center wavelength of 1330 nm was used to visualize thrombus formation during porcine blood circulation for 50 min in a closed 50 -mL circulation system isolated from ambient air. The thrombus formation sites at the interface between a tube and connector were visualized. The area of the thrombus formation at the interface between the <b>inlet</b> of the <b>connector</b> and the tube {{was found to be}} 0. 012 ± 0. 011 mm 2. Conversely, at the interface between the outlet of the connector and the tube, the area was found to be 0. 637 ± 0. 306 mm 2. Thus, significantly larger amounts of thrombus were formed at the outlet interface (p < 0. 01). The thrombus formation area at the outlet interface increased over time. Conversely, the area of thrombus formation showed repeated increasing and decreasing behavior at the inlet interface. Flow visualization with particle image velocimetry showed the presence of a flow separated area in the minimal flow phase at the inlet interface and a large recirculating slow flow region at the outlet interface in the minimal flow phase. These data suggested that the recirculating stagnant flow region contributed to thrombus growth. The method presented here was effective in quantitatively assessing time-dependent phenomena of thrombus formation at the connector-tube interface. The method may contribute to the assessment of thrombogenicity of a novel design of connector...|$|R
