5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second <b>element</b> and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated <b>element</b> must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity <b>element</b> (an <b>element</b> which, when combined with another <b>element</b> using the operation, results in the original <b>element,</b> such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every <b>element</b> there must be an inverse <b>element.</b>|$|E
5|$|If an {{interval}} {{of the real}} numbers is partitioned into two non-empty parts L, R, such that every <b>element</b> of L is (strictly) less than every <b>element</b> of R, then either L contains a largest <b>element</b> or R contains a smallest <b>element,</b> but not both.|$|E
5|$|So far, no {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} synthesize any <b>element</b> {{that could be the}} next group 3 element; if lutetium and lawrencium are considered to be group 3 elements, then the next <b>element</b> in the group should be <b>element</b> 153, unpenttrium (Upt). However, after <b>element</b> 120, filling electronic configurations stops obeying Aufbau principle. According to the principle, unpenttrium should have an electronic configuration of 8s25g186f147d1 and filling the 5g-subshell should be stopped at <b>element</b> 138. However, the 7d-orbitals are calculated to start being filled on <b>element</b> 137, while the 5g-subshell closes only at <b>element</b> 144, after filling of 7d-subshell begins. Therefore, it is hard to calculate which <b>element</b> should be the next group 3 <b>element.</b> Calculations suggest that unpentpentium (Upp, <b>element</b> 155) could also be the next group 3 <b>element.</b> If lanthanum and actinium are considered group 3 elements, then <b>element</b> 121, unbiunium (Ubu), should be the fifth group 3 <b>element.</b> The <b>element</b> is calculated have electronic configuration of 8s28p1/21, which is not associated with transition metals, without having a partially filled d-subshell. No experiments have been performed to create unpenttrium, unbiunium or any <b>element</b> that could be considered the next group 3 element; however, unbiunium is the <b>element</b> with the lowest atomic number that has not been tried to be created and thus has chances to be, while unpenttrium, unpentpentium or any other <b>element</b> considered if preceded by lawrencium is very unlikely to be created due to drip instabilities that imply that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium.|$|E

5|$|After a {{new term}} of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name seaborgium for <b>element</b> 106 and changed the name of <b>element</b> 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the recognition by the 1993 report that the <b>element</b> had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name flerovium was later used for <b>element</b> 114.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (<b>element</b> 108), only copernicium (<b>element</b> 112), nihonium (<b>element</b> 113), and flerovium (<b>element</b> 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (<b>element</b> 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (<b>element</b> 113), moscovium (<b>element</b> 115), and oganesson (<b>element</b> 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E

5|$|Although {{very small}} amounts of {{berkelium}} were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr.. They used the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (<b>element</b> 95) and curium (<b>element</b> 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and californium (<b>element</b> 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.|$|E
5|$|Americium is a {{synthetic}} chemical <b>element</b> with symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a transuranic {{member of the}} actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide <b>element</b> europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>element</b> {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch.

Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an <b>element</b> of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E

5|$|Astatine is a {{radioactive}} chemical <b>element</b> with symbol At and {{atomic number}} 85.

5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, {{germanium}} was discovered comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the <b>element</b> ekasilicon. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new <b>element</b> along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new <b>element</b> somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the <b>element</b> after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of <b>element</b> 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is <b>element</b> 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to <b>element</b> 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly <b>element</b> 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
