40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the Turkish consumer descriptive panel ratings for yoghurts with different added fruit, fruit syrup and herbal paste comparing to plain yoghurt. Two yoghurts were added two kinds of fruits: honey pumpkin (Cucurbita mocshata) and date plum (Diospyros lotus L.). One of the yoghurt was added pekmez (concentrated grape juice) and another was added a paste, made of herbs and sugar. Fourty two (n= 42) university students tasted and rated on a five-point hedonic scale their degree of liking for five samples of yoghurt varying in added ingredients. Subjects were asked to complete a questioner about consumption of yoghurt in their daily life. Degree of liking differed significantly among samples and the samples best liked were those flavoured with pekmez (grape syrup) and honey pumpkin (Cucurbita mocshata).

This study examined the differences in the sweetness of the strawberry <b>flavoured</b> <b>yoghurt</b> with the addition of sucrose, stevia and equal portions of sucrose and stevia; each combination was used at three different concentrations (3, 4. 5 and 6 % / 100 g yoghurt). Stevia was diluted in a concentration which, according to the literature, matches the sweetness profile of sucrose. Viscosity of the yoghurts was determined by the rheometer, and sensory profiling of the products was evaluated by a panel using the ranking test and weighted factors methods. The level of sweetness of all yoghurt samples (using sucrose, stevia and mixture of sucrose and stevia) was judged by a test panel, and products were rated in the terms of degree of sweetness as sucrose > sucrose + stevia > stevia. The recommended level by panelists of any type or combination of sweeteners for strawberry yoghurt was 4. 5 g sweetner/ 100 g. The apparent viscosity was lower in sucrose yoghurts compared to products made with stevia or stevia + sucrose which was also reflected in the sensory scores...|$|E

Sensory evaluation was conducted {{in order to determine}} the acceptability of the samples. The pH and percent lactic acid ranged from 4. 4 - 4. 7 and 0. 9 - 1. 08 %, respectively on the first day of storage while the values were 4. 1 - 4. 3 and 1. 44 - 1. 71 %, respectively on the eighth day of storage at 6 °C. Soluble solids of yoghurt samples ranged from 18. 4 - 27. 9 % on the first day and were between 18. 4 - 25. 4 % on the eight day of storage. The average percent syneresis of flavoured and fruit soy-yoghurts were 42. 03 and 46. 3 %, respectively. The values increased with increasing storage days.

40|$|Abstract: Yoghurt {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{fermented}} dairy products widely consumed all over the world. In majority of the countries, the increase in the per capita annual consumption of yoghurt has been attributed to both the ever-increasing availability of fruit or <b>flavoured</b> <b>yoghurt</b> and to the diversity of presentations of the product. This study was conducted to develop a value added set type fruit yoghurt with the acceptable combination of milk and ripened jack fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lain). Various levels of jack fruit chunks (3 - 5 mm) viz. 3, 5, and 7 percentages (w/v) were used in the preparation of fruit yoghurt. On the basis of various sensory attributes, yoghurt containing 5 % jack fruit chunks was selected as optimum. Selected yoghurt sample from sensory panel and control (Plain yoghurt) were analysed for proximate composition, E. coli count, shelf life and sensory attributes such as appearance, aroma, colour, fruit distribution, mouth feel, texture, taste, overall acceptability. The means for total solids, fat, protein and fibre percentage of the control samples were 19. 73 ± 0. 12, 4. 00 ± 0. 06, 3. 30 ± 0. 02 and 0 respectively whereas for the 5 % jack fruit chunks added yoghurt samples the means were 21. 98 ± 0. 05, 4. 11 ± 0. 03, 3. 31 ± 0. 01 and 0. 04 ± 0. 01, respectively.

40|$|The {{glycaemic}} index (GI) is a measurement used to classify foods {{according to their}} potential for raising blood glucose levels. The GI of a foodstuff is generally measured by determining the increment in blood glucose concentration after the consumption of a test meal over a set {{period of time and}} comparing it with an isoglucosidic control meal (normally white bread or glucose) and expressed as a percentage within a group of individuals (in vivo). Rapid analysis methods (in vitro) are being developed and evaluated worldwide, and in many cases the values obtained have correlated well with the GI values determined by in vivo methods. The criticism against rapid analysis methods is that the methods do not provide numerical GI values. Proposed labelling legislation in South Africa recommends that suppliers should only indicate if the product has a high, intermediate or low GI. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate existing rapid assessment methods for the prediction of GI, and develop such a method for South Africa to be used by food producers as a screening tool during product development in line with the newly proposed national labelling requirements. The preliminary studies on the developed rapid assessment method indicated good repeatability (CV 0. 78 %), reproducibility and precision (CV 3. 5 %). Further comparative trials indicated that the in vitro method accurately predicts the GI category of Almera potatoes (Solanum Tuberosum L. cultivar Almera) and Gero fat free litchi and raspberry <b>flavoured</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> in line with results found from in vivo analysis.

40|$|Although {{several studies}} {{have been carried out}} on the {{nutritional}} composition of buffalo milk, information about other products, except Mozzarella, are still scarce. The aim of this paper was the evaluation of chemical-physical parameters and the nutritional composition of buffalo yoghurt marketed in Italy. The investigation pointed out that buffalo yoghurt marketed in Italy is characterized by a homogeneous composition, with the exception of fat and apparent viscosity, which values were characterized by a high variability. This is probably attributable to the variability of the milk used in the production process, due to both breed and lactation period of buffalo as well as to variations in yoghurt manufacturing. The little differences noticed among the samples for the other parameters are probably due to the use of different strains of streptococci and lactobacilli in each manufacturing company. The sensory analysis evinced a good appreciation of the examined products. The analysis of volatile compounds allowed to distinguish 4 main groups of molecules: aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and acids. The volatiles present in higher quantity were 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone and acetaldehyde, which are mainly responsible for the typical <b>flavour</b> of <b>yoghurts...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} {{study showed that}} addition of β-cyclodextrin to goat milk made a difference to its flavour, but in an undescribed way. Cyclodextrins (CDs, comprising α- β- and γ-CD) {{may be able to}} bind the free branched chain fatty acids in goat milk responsible for the largely undesirable ‘goaty’ flavour. The primary aim was to test the effect of CDs on this flavour in goat milk and its products with a view to marketing goat milk products with reduced flavour intensity. A secondary aim was to test the effect of β-CD on skatole flavour, a characteristic flavour of milk from pasturefed ruminants. Study design and methods: The present study evaluates addition of mainly β-CD to goat milk, cow milk and their products to reduce undesirable flavours. The methods applied were mainly ranking and hedonic assessment in sensory experiments. The tests done were with CDs added to buffers and milks, some of which were flavour-enhanced with 4 -methyloctanoic acid as a representative goaty fatty acid, or with skatole. Goat milk yoghurts were also tested. Free fatty acid concentrations, which may be affected by CD binding, were measured after separating cream and skim milk. The methods applied were standard dairy procedures: titration of free fatty acids in milk fat and the copper-salt method for measuring fatty acids in skim milk. A fungal lipase was added to milks to accelerate fat hydrolysis (lipolysis). This was done to increase the concentration of free fatty acids for several experimental purposes. Some minor experiments studies were also done, for example the comparative effect of lipases on goat milk and cow milk, and the lipolytic activity at different temperatures over different times. Results: The results of skatole experiments were inconclusive. The odour of 4 -methyloctanoic acid was reduced in acidic buffers by addition of α- and β-CD, particularly the former. Alpha and β-CD were both effective in goaty flavour reduction in goat milk. γ-CD was not effective. In all this work differences were statistically significant to varying levels. Goaty flavour was reduced by addition of β-CD to goat milk yoghurt, but only when added before fermentation (P < 0. 001), not after (P = 0. 09). The liking scores for goat milk yoghurts for both plain and <b>flavoured</b> <b>yoghurts</b> increased with β-CD treatment (both P < 0. 001 for 59 panellists). The chemistry experiments revealed a reduction of free fatty acid concentration in the fat phase when β-CD treatment was added to full cream cow milk. However, analysis of skim milk did not show a corresponding increase in concentration. Further experiments are required to reveal the fate of the ‘missing’ fatty acids. Conclusion: Overall it was shown that under certain conditions, CDs were effective in reducing goaty flavour in milk and yoghurts. Whereas CDs are approved for addition to foods in many countries – including the bellwether U. S. A. – formal approval by Food Standards Australia New Zealand has not yet been finalized. When it is, the way should be clear to market a range of more consumer-acceptable goat milk products in New Zealand as a primary market.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of repeated midmorning consumption of novel-flavoured low- and high-energy yoghurt drinks on subsequent energy intake at lunch in 69 adults under actual use conditions. Subjects consumed 200 ml of low- and high-energy yoghurt drinks (67 and 273 kcal/ 200 ml, respectively), with 20 exposures to each drink on alternate days. Analyses focused on the development of compensation for the differences in energy content of the beverages, due to learned satiety. Results revealed incomplete energy compensation for the beverages, both at first exposure and also after 20 exposures. Relative to the no-yoghurt condition, energy intake compensation (mean±S. E. M.) averaged 39 ± 36 or the low-energy yoghurt and 17 ± 9 or the high-energy version, with no evidence of any change in compensation with repeated exposures. When the <b>flavours</b> of the <b>yoghurt</b> drinks were covertly switched after 20 exposures, subjects increased their energy intake after the high-energy yoghurt drink containing the flavour that was previously coupled with the low-energy yoghurt drink. Vice versa, however, when subjects switched to the low-energy yoghurt drink containing the high-energy flavour, subjects ignored the flavour cue and ate the same lunch size regardless of the energy in the yoghurt drink.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} the {{development}} of new technologies based on modern analytical techniques for analysis of volatiles in wines. Due to the exponential growth of the wine industry and consumer demands for an enjoyable, safe-to-consume, and high quality product, the need for arose for methodologies aiding the understanding of wine better arose. Chemical analysis is a valuable way of studying the composition of wine in depth. Very sophisticated instrumentation is available nowadays but almost always the sample needs to be cleaned up or concentrated before such analysis. This study investigates the use of stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) as such a technique. It is shown that SBSE combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is extremely suited for a wide number of analyses and {{during the course of the}} study the technique was applied for troublesome analytical challenges in various beverages and foodstuffs. The study focuses on the development of a screening technique for volatiles in wine using SBSE and the application of the data to various chemometrical techniques for classification purposes.

40|$|Traditionally, yoghurt is {{produced}} in a hydrated form and, thus, possesses a limited shelf-life even when refrigerated. Consumption {{within a short time}} of production is advisable, particularly if advantage is to be taken of the putative benefits associated with the ingestion of live yoghurt cultures. The production of an instant yoghurt powder would, thus, provide benefits of shelf-life extension and convenience of preparation and storage. However, the drying of such products is difficult due to low pH, which causes stickiness in drier chambers and makes powder recovery difficult. Furthermore, key flavour components formed by fermentation such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl which contribute to the unique <b>flavour</b> of natural <b>yoghurt</b> are sensitive to heat and easily lost during spray-drying. Hence, a major challenge of this project was to investigate the processing technologies and conditions necessary for the minimisation of flavour losses during the spray-drying of acidified/fermented milk bases, to monitor the effects on drier performance such as powder adhesion to drier walls, and to develop functional forms of the spray-dried ingredients. The main aims of the project were to: - improve yoghurt powder spray-drying efficiency through optimisation of concentrate solids, - investigate the effect of spray-drying conditions on flavour losses of sensitive products such as dehydrated yoghurt and fermented creams,- apply technological approaches for the reduction of flavour losses: a) ingredient formulation, b) modification of fermentation conditions, - investigate the production of agglomerated forms of spray-dried yoghurt powders, - study factors affecting the physical properties such as rheological characteristics and powder bulk density, and - adapt technology to ensure greater viability of culture cell numbers {{at the end of the}} drying process.

40|$|The Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) {{method was}} {{originally}} developed to extract volatile and semivolatile compounds from wastewater samples but {{has since been}} applied to flavour compounds in foods and beverages. Research using the HS-SPME in related areas such as cheese and skim milk powder {{has been carried out}} but, to date, no work has been done on <b>yoghurt</b> <b>flavours.</b> The main objective {{of this study was to}} devise a methodology for the Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) technique to investigate and quantify six flavour analytes in natural, set yoghurts made from recombined milk. The relevant literature was reviewed and from it, a research proposal for this work on yoghurts was drawn. The first step in analysing and quantifying the yoghurt volatiles was to set up a working methodology for the HS-SPME method. The 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre was chosen along with 20 minutes being the optimum fibre adsorption time. General equipment, materials and methods used throughout this thesis are also detailed. The external standard (ES) method was used to calibrate the GC and quantify the analyte concentrations in this study. The internal standard (IS) method was not used as a quantitative tool in this study. Once the HS-SPME methodology had been set up for the analysis of yoghurts, the classical Static Headspace (SH) method was compared with the HS-SPME method for extraction efficiency. The results suggested that the two methods were complementary in that the SH method extracted the more volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, acetone and 2 -butanone) whereas, the HS-SPME method extracted the semi- to non-volatile compounds (ethanol, diacetyl and acetoin) more readily. However, the HS-SPME was found to be the more sensitive and effective method of the two techniques tested. The next step in the thesis was to investigate the presence of the six analytes in milk and cultured yoghurt. The effects of the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation on the volatile concentrations were also examined. The results suggested that the six analytes were inherently present in milks but at low concentrations. No conclusive effects were found for the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation. However, it was evident that fermentation of the milks using bacterial starter cultures resulted in a large increase in some of the volatiles being investigated. Following this, the effects of fat levels, storage time and storage temperature on the six volatiles in yoghurts were examined. The results indicated that significant fat level effects were only seen for diacetyl and acetoin, while temperature effects were only observed for ethanol. In both trials, only general trends for the analytes concentrations were drawn because the data varied from day to day. The results suggested that most of the compounds decreased with time except for diacetyl, which seemed to increase. The final part of this study looked at applying the devised HS-SPME methodology to a series of commercial yoghurts as a preliminary trial, with a view to investigating a potential application for the HS-SPME method. Fourteen commercial yoghurts were analysed and the six analytes quantified. The data obtained was analysed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which divided the yoghurts into groups based on their analyte concentrations. From these groupings, eight yoghurts were selected and fresh samples were analysed using HS-SPME and PCA. This was carried out parallel with an untrained consumer panel, which had to distinguish differences between the yoghurts in a series of triangle tests by smelling the headspace on opening the yoghurt containers. The conclusions drawn were that, unlike the HS-SPME method with PCA, the average consumer could not differentiate the yoghurts based on smell alone. PCA also showed that the HS-SPME results obtained were fairly reproducible. In conclusion, the HS-SPME method was shown to be a useful analytical technique, which can be used to analyse and quantify flavour compounds in natural, set yoghurts. This area of investigation has a lot of scope, with the results from this study providing a basis or starting point for further investigations in this area. Future studies may lead to potential applications for the HS-SPME method, one of which may be quality control where correlation of sensory data with HS-SPME analytical data is required...|$|R

A qualidade e estabilidade do iogurte foi avaliada a cada 3 semanas, atraves de analises microbiologicas (contagem total, bacterias lacticas e bolores e leveduras), fisico-quimicas (pH e acidez titulavel, sedimentacao e sinerese, viscosidade aparente, tamanho de particulas e cor), e sensoriais (testes de aceitacao, com avaliacao de aparencia, sabor, viscosidade e impressao global e testes de intencao de compra, por 30 provadores nao treinados). O fim da vida-deprateleira foi determinado quando um dos atributos sensoriais atingiu media 5, 0. Foi utilizado um delineamento do tipo split-split-plot com 2 blocos, resultando em 4 amostras para cada bloco. A intensidade do tratamento termico influenciou a contagem total e de bacterias lacticas, sendo que, com o tratamento mais brando, o produto apresentou entre 100 - 200 UFC/ml e, com o tratamento mais intenso a contagem foi < 1 UFC/ml. A temperatura de estocagem nao influenciou a estabilidade microbiologica dos produtos, que mantiveram as contagens iniciais durante as 21 semanas de analise. Nao houve crescimento de bolores e leveduras. A estabilidade fisica do produto nao foi afetada pela intensidade do tratamento termico e condicoes de estocagem. O unico parametro afetado foi a viscosidade, que foi menor a temperatura ambiente (35 cp x 25 cp). Nao houve mudancas no pH (~ 4, 0), acidez titulavel (~ 1, 1 % de acido lactico), sedimentacao (2 - 3 %), sinerese (inexistente) e tamanho de particulas (£ 3, 5 mm) devido a intensidade do tratamento termico, temperatura de estocagem e tempo de armazenamento.

Pectin (0, 45 % of Grindstedê Pectin AMD 382, from Danisco Brasil) was added with sugar (2 %), Carmim colorant and strawberry <b>flavouring.</b> The <b>yoghurt</b> was treated in a tubular heatexchanger followed by asseptic homogenization (15 MPa e 5 MPa), and bottled in a laminar flow, in 500 mL PEAD bottles with aluminium seal, previously treated with 5 kGy of gamma irradiation. The quality and stability of the fermented milks were evaluated every 3 weeks, by microbiological analyses (standard plate count, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts and moulds); physico-chemical analyses (pH and titratable acidity, sedimentation and syneresis, apparent viscosity, particle size, and color); and acceptability and buying intention tests. The end of shelf-life was determined by reaching mean value 5, 0 for any sensory attribute. A split-split-plot design was applied and the results were evaluated by ANOVA. Heat treatment intensity influenced standard plate counts and lactic acid bacteria, whereas the less intensely treated products counts resulted in 100 - 200 UFC/mL, against < 1 UFC/ml for the more intensely treated products. Storage temperature did not affect microbiological stability of the fermented milks, which maintained the same counts during the 21 weeks. No growth of moulds and yeasts was detected during the whole period, in all samples, independently of the storage temperature. Heat treatment intensity and storage condition didn?t affect the physical stability of the samples, since no physical changes occurred during all the storage time. The only parameter affected was the viscosity, which was lower in ambient condition (25 cp x 35 cp). There were no changes in pH (4. 0), acidity (1. 1 % lactic acid), sedimentation (2 - 3 %), syneresis (none) and particle size (£ 3. 5 mm) due to the heat treatment intensity and storage temperature and time. The 3 variables influenced the flavor evaluation and, consequently, global impression and buying intention. Fermented milks treated less intensely (72 °C/ 15 s) had higher mean values during the whole period of evaluation. Mean values for flavor increased after the 3 rd week of refrigerated storage (6. 2 to 7. 1), due to disappearance of an off-flavor originated from heat treatment. Storage temperature influenced the shelf-life determination. At ambient temperature, shelf-life was 3 months and a half for fermented milk treated at 72 °C/ 15 s; fermented milks treated at 110 oC/ 4 s had a shelf-life of 2 months. After 5 months, fermented milks kept under refrigeration showed sensory mean values higher than 6. 5, far away from the end of shelf-lif...|$|R
