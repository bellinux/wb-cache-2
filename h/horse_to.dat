5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others argue for the Sarmatians.

5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare.

However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> move faster and pull more weight.|$|E
