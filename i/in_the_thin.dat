5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of}} the Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} a 12 -year-old {{plantation}} of Pinus radiata D. Don characterised seasonal changes in standing crops of fine (< l m m diam.) and small roots (1 - 2 mm diam.) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> and control treatments. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, standing crops of these roots were estimated from soil core samples {{for a second}} year {{to determine if the}} seasonal periodicity observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first year could be considered a general pattern. Results from Year 2 generally confirmed those from Year 1. With the exception of differences in late-winter/early-spring, standing crops of live fine roots indicated similar seasonal changes by treatment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2 years. Comparing the effect of treatment, we found no summer peak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment for either year. The over-all standing crop of live fine roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment was 35 % of the control. The seasonal periodicity of dead fine roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control was similar for both years, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment, we found large differences by year. The over-all standing crop of dead fine roots was only 8 % lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment. Standing crops of small live roots did not change seasonally. The over-all standing crop of small live roots was lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment but increased from Year 1 to Year 2. This increase may indicate an expansion of the networking system to which fine roots are attached. No similar expansion, however, was detected for fine roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment...|$|R

Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E

40|$|Biogeochemistry of Northern ForestsTree {{composition}} of two forestry plots was studied in a northern hardwood forest in Michigan from 1934 - 1980. One plot had been selectively thinned from 1934 • 1954; the other plot was unmanipulated (control). Sugar maple was <b>the</b> leading dominant <b>in</b> both plots. Basswood was second most dominant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> plot and beech was second most dominant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control plot. As sugar maple increased in importance, beech and ironwood decreased in importance. Sugar maple may limit beech and ironwood due to more successful competition for resources. Basswood decreased in importance after conclusion of cutting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> plot which may relate successful growth of basswood to canopy holes left after cutting. Both plots decreased in diversity from 1934 - 1980. Big-toothed aspen, white birch, red oak and possibly basswood are only present as large trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canopy {{and are expected}} to leave the forest as these large trees die (no successful reproduction due to shading out of seedlings). Density decreased as basal area increased for the control plot. Density and basal area decreased due to cutting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> plot (1934 - 1954); density increased from 1954 - 1980 to approximately 3 / 4 of the original density before cutting <b>in</b> 1934.

25|$|Other {{studies have}} {{suggested}} the potential for life to survive using deliquescing salts. These, similarly to the lichens, use the humidity of the atmosphere.

25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those {{who do not want}} them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|E
25|$|A team of Hungarian {{scientists}} {{proposes that}} the geysers' most visible features, dark dune spots and spider channels, may be colonies of photosynthetic Martian microorganisms, which over-winter beneath the ice cap, {{and as the}} sunlight returns to the pole during early spring, light penetrates the ice, the microorganisms photosynthesize and heat their immediate surroundings. A pocket of liquid water, which would normally evaporate instantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> Martian atmosphere, is trapped around them by the overlying ice. As this ice layer thins, the microorganisms show through grey. When the layer has completely melted, the microorganisms rapidly desiccate and turn black, surrounded by a grey aureole. The Hungarian scientists believe that even a complex sublimation process is insufficient to explain the formation and evolution of the dark dune spots in space and time. Since their discovery, fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke promoted these formations as deserving of study from an astrobiological perspective.|$|E
