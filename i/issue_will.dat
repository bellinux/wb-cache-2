5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} storylines, Josh {{tries to}} end a deadlock on {{the appointment of a}} 6th Circuit federal court judge. His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put the issue on the agenda and Hayden agrees. When Josh goes to suggest this to Leo he is told that the <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> have to wait for one of the Supreme Court justices has died. Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack. C.J., meanwhile, tries to make things right with resurfaced college boyfriend Ben, whom she has been forced to ignore due to her workload. Based on Ben's reaction {{at the end of their}} very brief conversation, C.J. regrets her approach and fears that she may have caused things with Ben to end before they could even begin. Upon voicing this concern to Toby he advices her to go to Ben and fix it. Ryan Pierce, the intern working for Josh, (uncharacteristically) fails to show up for work. Josh had failed to even notice until Donna voices her concern as she tries, unsuccessfully, to get a hold of Ryan.|$|E

25|$|Certain animals, {{including}} {{bats and}} cetaceans, {{have the ability}} to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Canadian Mint and the International Olympic Committee {{have reached}} an {{agreement}} on Olympic Gold and Silver Maple Leaf coins.

25|$|The {{extent to}} which the intermittency of solar-generated {{electricity}} is an <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> depend on {{the degree to which the}} generation profile of solar corresponds to demand. For example, solar thermal power plants such as Nevada Solar One are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. Thermal energy storage systems like the small Spanish Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption. The improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity, and extends the total time the system generates power.|$|E

25|$|Large {{data sets}} may {{constitute}} a computational bottleneck for model-based methods. It was, for example, {{pointed out that}} in some ABC-based analyses, part of the data have to be omitted. A number of authors have argued that large data sets are not a practical limitation, although the severity of this issue depends strongly {{on the characteristics of}} the models. Several aspects of a modeling problem can contribute to the computational complexity, such as the sample size, number of observed variables or features, time or spatial resolution, etc. However, with increasing computing power, this <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> potentially be less important.|$|E
25|$|The {{first issue}} of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic was marketed by IDW by {{creating}} nineteen unique cover variants. Six of the covers, drawn by Price, feature each of the main cast, and form a continuous six-panel work. IDW will publish a boxed set of these covers separately. The other covers are unique to specific comic stores and Internet retailers such as Midtown Comics and Lone Star Comics, and are available as pre-order bonuses for purchasers. The second <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> also have several, but fewer, store-specific variants. Subsequent comics, including those in the micro-series, have typically had between two and four additional vendor-specific variants.|$|E
25|$|Neptune, the {{farthest}} planet from Earth, {{has increased in}} brightness since 1980. Neptune's brightness is statistically correlated with its stratospheric temperature. Hammel and Lockwood hypothesize that the change in brightness includes a solar variation component {{as well as a}} seasonal component, though they did not find a statistically significant correlation with solar variation. They propose that the resolution of this <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> be clarified by brightness observations in the next few years: forcing by a change in sub-solar latitude should be reflected in a flattening and decline of brightness, while solar forcing should be reflected in a flattening and then resumed rise of brightness.|$|E

25|$|If one adopts the {{classical}} {{point of view}} on categories, that there is a set of morphisms from one object to another (not just a class), then one has to give an additional argument to prove this. If, for example, the abelian category A is small, i.e. has only a set of objects, then this <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> be no problem. Also, if A is a Grothendieck abelian category, then the derived category D(A) is equivalent to a full subcategory of the homotopy category K(A), and hence has only a set of morphisms from one object to another. Grothendieck abelian categories include the category of modules over a ring, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and many other examples.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of Canaan was first {{announced in the}} November issue of Newtype magazine that 428: Shibuya Scramble would have an anime adaptation.

Comp Ace magazine had announced on a flyer that its July <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> serialize Canaans manga adaptation. Canaan is also scheduled to have a movie adaptation in October, in where all of its 13 episodes are compiled into one show. Canaan was released on Region 2 DVDs and in Blu-Rays on October 21, 2009, with the DVD being sold for ¥6,090 and the Blu-Ray for ¥7,140. As of 2012, there is no word about the Canaan OVAs.|$|E
25|$|New journals, {{which are}} indexed {{from their first}} {{published}} <b>issue,</b> <b>will</b> receive an impact factor {{after two years of}} indexing; in this case, the citations to the year prior to Volume1, and the number of articles published in the year prior to Volume1, are known zero values. Journals that are indexed starting with a volume other than the first volume will not get an impact factor until they have been indexed for three years. Occasionally, Journal Citation Reports assigns an impact factor to new journals with less than two years of indexing, based on partial citation data. The calculation always uses two complete and known years of item counts, but for new titles one of the known counts is zero. Annuals and other irregular publications sometimes publish no items in a particular year, affecting the count. The impact factor relates to a specific time period; it is possible to calculate it for any desired period, and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) also includes a five-year impact factor. The JCR shows rankings of journals by impact factor, if desired by discipline, such as organic chemistry or psychiatry.|$|E

500|$|In France, satirical {{magazine}} Charlie Hebdo {{was taken}} to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.

These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate {{about the role of}} government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful. Critics said the cartoon controversy was a sign that attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as respect, tolerance and offence have backfired on the West. Michael Neumann wrote, [...] "Western piety has left the West without a leg to stand on in this dispute. It is no good trumpeting rights of free expression, because these rights are now supposed to have nebulous but severe limitations."
