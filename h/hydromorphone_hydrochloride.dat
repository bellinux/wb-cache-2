The patient had previously been ambulatory and fully cognizantof her surroundings until one week prior to presentation when she began to exhibit progressively worsening confusion. As hermental status began to change, the patient developed new onsetpain over her lumbar spine, supra-pubic area, bilateral flanks, hips, and knees. The pain was refractory to an epidural injectioninto her lumbar spine performed at the patient’s local hospital. Other complaints included a recent onset urinary retention, weakness of the left lower extremity, a left facial Bell’s palsy, and difficulty walking. On admission, the patient was taking gabapentin, citalopram, aspirin, enoxaparin, nystatin, lopressor,docusate, lorazepam, and methylprednisone.

30|$|Despite being {{designed}} to modulate drug release, dose dumping from MR dosage forms containing opioid drugs {{has become an}} area of particular concern for regulators. In 2005, Palladone XL™ (<b>hydromorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride),</b> was withdrawn from the market due to a clinical finding that concomitant ingestion of ethanol (alcohol) resulted in a blood levels 6 times higher than those who ingested Palladone XL™ with water (FDA 2005 a). Alcohol causes a disruption in the drug release mechanism leading to the entire dose being released at once due to ingestion of ethanol (Johnson et al. 2007). Thus, alcohol induced dose dumping (AIDD) {{can be defined as}} the rapid unintended release of a large amount of drug from a MR dosage form resulting from an accidental misuse or from intentional abuse of alcohol with the drug. Co-consumption with alcohol can complicate matters because it may influence the absorption, metabolism and excretion of drugs (Makin & Williams 2000; Weathermon & Crabb 1999).|$|E
40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Intravenous patient-controlled {{analgesia}} (IV PCA) meperidine hydrochloride {{can be used}} with a reasonable margin of safety. DESIGN: A retrospective review was performed of 355 medical records of patients receiving IV PCA meperidine treatment. Four groups of patients were defined, based on daily meperidine dose and {{the presence or absence of}} central nervous system excitation adverse effects. Use of more than 600 mg/d of meperidine hydrochloride was considered a high dose. SETTING: University tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Postoperative patients from general, orthopedic, neurosurgical, gynecological, and urologic procedures receiving IV PCA. INTERVENTIONS: If patients were judged to have consumed significant amounts of meperidine, the analgesic regimen was modified to (1) discontinue meperidine therapy, (2) substitute <b>hydromorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> or (3) decrease the use of meperidine by adding oral methadone hydrochloride or transdermal fentanyl citrate to the regimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients who received less than 10 mg/kg per day of IV PCA meperidine hydrochloride therapy were unlikely to experience central nervous system excitatory adverse effects and maintain adequate analgesia. RESULTS: The mean meperidine hydrochloride consumption for those patients classified as high dose, asymptomatic was 13. 3 mg/kg per day (95...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To provide {{guidelines}} for the institution and maintenance of a continuous subcutaneous narcotic infusion program for cancer patients with chronic pain through {{an analysis of the}} narcotic requirements and treatment outcomes of patients who underwent such therapy and a comparison of the costs of two commonly used infusion systems. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care facilities and patients' homes. PATIENTS: Of 481 patients seen in consultation for cancer pain between July 1987 and April 1990, 60 (12 %) met the eligibility criteria (i. e., standard medical management had failed, and they had adequate supervision at home). INTERVENTION: Continuous subcutaneous infusion with <b>hydromorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or morphine started on an inpatient basis and continued at home whenever possible. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient selectivity, narcotic dosing requirements, discharge rate, patient preference for analgesic regimen, side effects, complications and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The mean initial maintenance infusion dose after dose titration was almost three times higher than the dose required before infusion (hydromorphone or equivalent 6. 2 v. 2. 1 mg/h). Eighteen patients died, and the remaining 42 were discharged home for a mean of 94. 4 (standard deviation 128. 3) days (extremes 12 and 741 days). The mean maximum infusion rate was 24. 1 mg/h (extremes 0. 5 and 180 mg/h). All but one of the patients preferred the infusion system to their previous oral analgesic regimen. Despite major dose escalations nausea and vomiting were well controlled in all cases. Twelve patients (20 %) experienced serious systemic toxic effects or complications; six became encephalopathic, which necessitated dose reduction, five had a subcutaneous infection necessitating antibiotic treatment, and one had respiratory depression. The programmable computerized infusion pump was found to be more cost-effective than the disposable infusion device after a break-even point of 8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous subcutaneous infusion of opioid drugs {{with the use of a}} portable programmable pump is safe and effective in selected patients who have failed to respond to standard medical treatment of their cancer pain. Dose titration may require rapid dose escalation, but this is usually well tolerated. For most communities embarking on such a program a programmable infusion system will be more cost-effective than a disposable system...|$|E
