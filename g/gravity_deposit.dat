More than 900 m of good quality images were acquired through an interval from the Palaeocene Ekofisk Formation to the Eocene Grid Formation in a well from {{the centre of the}} South Viking Graben, Norwegian sector. The information that was obtained from these images is illustrated and discussed in terms of lithology, sedimentary structures, stratigraphy and petrophysics. The information on this deep marine, mainly <b>gravity</b> <b>deposit</b> succession, is considerably enhanced using image interpretation. Lithological information i cludes an improved net-to-gross ratio and an understanding of lithological heterogeneities. Sedimentary structure information i cludes the geometrical and lithological characterization f slumped intervals and a detailed description of evolving <b>gravity</b> <b>deposit</b> sequences. In terms of stratigraphy, illustrative images are shown of the Balder, Lista nd Sele Formations. Some of the key surfaces of the Palaeogene interval, used for correlation and sequence stratigraphy, are shown in detail, especially the surface {{at the base of the}} Balder Formation and the boundary between the Lista and Sele Formations.

They are the main carriers of oil and gas, {{and a great deal}} of natural gas has been found there in the past five years. Based on lithofacies and reservoir differences, natural gas exploration domains of eastern Tarim Basin can be classified into five types: Ordovician platform limestone; Ordovician platform dolomite; Cambrian platform margin mound shoal; Cambrian slope gravity flow deposits, and; Sinian dolomite. Carbonate reservoir characteristics of all the types were synthetically analyzed through observation on drilling core and thin sections, porosity and permeability measurement, and logging data of over 10 drilling wells. We find distribution of part of good fracture and cave reservoir in carbonate platform limestone of Ordovician. In the Ordovician, platform facies dolomite is better than limestone, and in the Cambrian, platform margin mound shoal dolomite has large stacking thickness. Good quality and significantly thick carbonate <b>gravity</b> <b>deposit</b> flow can be found in the Cambrian slope, and effective reservoir has also been found in Sinian dolomite.

40|$|The {{compositional}} {{variation of}} Pleistocene carbonate gravity deposits from the Exuma Sound Basin, Bahamas, was determined. Two types of <b>gravity</b> <b>deposit</b> {{were present in}} the cores of ODP Leg 101, Site 632 A, i. e., calciturbidites and calcidebrites. In analogy with earlier studies, the compositional variations in the calciturbidites could be linked to different sources on the carbonate margin, i. e., platform interior, platform edge, and platform slope. Calciturbidites deposited during interglacial, sea-level highstands show a dominance of non-skeletal grains, largely derived from the platform interior, while calciturbidites of glacial, sea-level lowstands, show a dominance of skeletal platform-edge to platform-slope-derived grains. Thus, the calciturbidite composition can be used to reconstruct the position of absolute sea level. In addition, the mud content of the calciturbidites increased after Marine Isotope Stage 11. In contrast, the composition of the calcidebrites remained unaltered through time and showed a clear dominance of platform-edge-derived sediments during varying sea-level positions. The Bahamian carbonate platform is located in a tectonically stable passive-margin setting and the gravity-flow deposits were laid down in an environment exclusively controlled by eustatic sea-level fluctuations. This study shows that all types of gravity-induced carbonate deposits, calciturbidites, and calcidebrites, were deposited in response to global eustatic sea-level variations. The sediment composition could be linked directly to sediment input from specific facies realms along the carbonate platform margin. Hence, sediment composition analysis is a strong tool that may be used to discriminate between gravity-induced deposition triggered by eustatic sea-level changes and that related to tectonic events, when analyzing resedimentation processes in sedimentary basins.

40|$|The {{compositional}} {{variation of}} Pleistocene carbonate <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> from the Exuma Sound Basin, Bahamas, and of Turonian-Conacian deposits from the Southern Provence Basin (France) was determined. The Bahamian carbonate platform {{is located in}} a tectonically stable passive margin setting and the <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> were deposited in an environment controlled by eustatic sea-level fluctuations. In contrast, the Southern Provence Basin sediments were deposited in a tectonic active regime. Two types of <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> were present in the cores of ODP Leg 101, Site 632 A, i. e. calciturbidites and calcidebrites. In analogy with earlier studies (. Haak and Schlager, 1989), the compositional variations in the calciturbidites could be linked to different sources on the carbonate margin, i. e. platform interior, platform edge, platform slope. Interglacial (sea-level highstands) calciturbidites show a dominance of non-skeletal grains derived from the platform interior, while glacial (sea-level lowstands) calciturbidites show a dominance of skeletal platform edge to platform slope derived grains. Hence, the calciturbidite composition can be used to reconstruct the position in relative sea level. In contrast, the composition of the calcidebrites remained unaltered through time and showed a clear dominance of platform edge derived sediments. In addition, it was shown that the calcidebrites were deposited during regressions. In the Southern Provence Basin (SPB), the <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> were deposited during episodes of sea-level rise coinciding with a series of earthquakes associated {{with the opening of the}} SPB. The SPB-megabreccias show a mix of sediment grains derived from the platform interior, the platform edge and the upper slope. Thus, in contrast to the Exuma Sound calcidebrites with their platform margin domain specific composition, the SPB-megabreccias have a composition that could not be assigned to a single domain on the platform margin and comprise a total mix of platform margin domains. In conclusion, this study shows that the composition of calciturbidites, calcidebrites and megabreccias can be used to determine which processes, eustatic variations or tectonic events, triggered the redeposition of these <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits...</b>|$|R

The facies identified in the Hales Limestone are: (1 a) clast- and matrix-supported conglomerate-breccia beds, (1 b) packstone-grainstone beds, (2) alternating thin, planar calcisiltstone and carbonate mudstone beds, (3) wavy, rippled, and cross-bedded calcisiltstone beds with carbonate mudstone, (4) thin, planar carbonate mudstone, and (5) slumped and folded beds of interbedded carbonate mudstone and calcisiltstone.

40|$|More than 2000 turbidite, debris-flow, and slump {{deposits}} recovered at Site 823 {{record the}} history of the Queensland Trough since the middle Miocene and provide new insights about turbidites, debris flow, and slump <b>deposits</b> (herein termed <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits).</b> Changes in the composition and nature of <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> through time can be related to tectonic movements, fluctuations in eustatic sea level, and sedimentological factors. The Queensland Trough is a long, relatively narrow, structural depression that formed as a result of Cretaceous to Tertiary rifting of the northeastern Australia continental margin. Thus, tectonics established the geometry of this marginal basin, and its steep slopes set the stage for repeated slope failures. Seismic data indicate that renewed faulting, subsidence, and associated tectonic tilting occurred during the early late Miocene (continuing into the early Pliocene), resulting in unstable slopes that were prone to slope failures and to generation of <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits.</b> Tectonic subsidence, together with a second-order eustatic highstand, resulted in platform drowning during the late Miocene. The composition of turbidites reflects their origin and provides insights about the nature of sedimentation on adjacent shelf areas. During relative highstands and times of platform drowning, planktonic foraminifers were reworked from slopes and/or drowned shelves and were redeposited in turbidites. During relative lowstands, quartz and other terrigenous sediment was shed into the basin. Quartzose turbidites and clay-rich hemipelagic muds also can record increased supply of terrigenous sediment from mainland Australia. Limestone fragments were eroded from carbonate platforms until the drowned platforms were buried under hemipelagic sediments following the late Miocene drowning event. Bioclastic grains and neritic foraminifers were reworked from neritic shelves during relative lowstands. During the late Pliocene (2. 6 Ma), the increased abundance of bioclasts and quartz in turbidites signaled the shallowing and rejuvenation of the northeastern Australia continental shelf. However, a one-for-one relationship cannot be recognized between eustatic sea-level fluctuations and any single sedimentologic parameter. Perhaps, tectonism and sedimentological factors along the Queensland Trough played an equally important role in generating <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits.</b> Turbidites and other <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> (such as those at Site 823) do not necessarily represent submarine fan deposits, particularly if they are composed of hemipelagic sediments reworked from drowned platforms and slopes. When shelves are drowned and terrigenous sediment is not directly supplied by nearby rivers/point sources, muddy terrigenous sediments blanket the entire slope and basin, rather than forming localized fans. Slope failures affect the entire slope, rather than localized submarine canyons. Slopes may become destabilized as a result of tectonic activity, inherent sediment weaknesses, and/or during relative sea-level lowstands. For this reason, sediment deposits in this setting reflect tectonic and eustatic events that caused slope instabilities, rather than migration of different submarine fan facies...|$|R

The deformed province occurs where the deformed prism developed. This prism is characterised by structural highs and associated small-scale ridges and scarps. In this province, the Magdalena Turbidite System is constructional because sediment coming from the Colombian hinterland (via the Magdalena River and from coastal erosion) and sediment remobilised from the walls of the structural highs are transported trough canyons and gullies, and emplaced as <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> into the deformed prism. In the undeformed province, by contrast, the Magdalena Turbidite System displays an architecture model similar to a passive continental margin, and is characterised by large-scale mass-flow deposits, leveed channel complexes, scars of stumps, and sediment waves. This province is presently erosive because the existing leveed channels are partially or totally destroyed and cannibalised by mass-flow deposits, cut by small-scale scars of slumps, and their morphology is subdued or modified by the formation of a sediment wave field.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the interactions between meltwaters and sedimentary material {{at the base of}} an alpine glacier which are indicated by intra- and interseasonal variations of discharge, solute and sediment outflow from the terminus. During the 1989 and 1990 ablation seasons, discharge, suspended sediment concentration and dissolved solids draining from Maxwell Glacier, St. Elias Mountains, Yukon Territory, were obtained at hourly intervals. The discharge time series of Maxwell Creek reveals that flow varies at a period of one to two weeks, at a diurnal level and over one to three hours. Over all three time scales, electrical conductivity is inversely proportional to discharge suggesting that during high during high diurnal flows, outwash water is derived primarily from surface melt while at low nocturnal discharge, water originates from subglacial and englacial stores. In spring, when supraglacial meltwater begins to access the subglacial drainage system the basal water pressure is raised. Large areas previously hydraulically isolated are integrated releasing stored basal sediment. During periods of increasing discharge in the early summer hydroglacial events resulting from gradual expansion and/or isolation of subglacial cavities, temporary blockage of subglacial conduits or from input from adjacent <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> occur. As flow increases, conduit diameters increase and water gradually spreads out over the glacier bed as a diffuse network of linked cavities. Throughout the ablation season, different areas of the sole are integrated with flow. Towards the end of the ablation season, meltwater supply declines resulting in the reduction of flow in subglacial passageway and reduced sediment and solute supply.

The Agadir Basin represents a deepwater depocentre and conduit for turbidity currents sourced from the Agadir Canyon and Western Canary Islands. A previous basin stratigraphy is re-analysed and extended to cover the last 600 ka. This stratigraphy is validated by using down-core geophysics and chemostratigraphy. ITRAX mudcap geochemistry has been used to assess turbidite provenance. Siliciclastic turbidites in this record have been shown to occur predominantly at transitions from glacial to interglacial periods. The latest landslides identified from the Western Canary Islands, the El Golfo and Icod landslides, have been proposed to be multistage. This is based on the presence of multiple fining-upwards sequences, known as subunits, within the associated sediment <b>gravity</b> flow <b>deposits.</b> Grain-size data, core petrophysics, bulk geochemistry and volcanic glass geochemistry has shown that the subunits within the Icod deposit originate from a multistage collapse.

40|$|The Middle to Upper Jurassic in the Viking Graben {{area was}} {{deposited}} during an overall transgression. Tectonics, eustasy, sediment supply and sediment source area control facies distribution. The Lower Toarcian {{to the base}} of the Cretaceous consists of seven major regressive-transgressive facies cycles. These regressive-transgressive (R-T) facies cycles are called second order and dominate facies distribution. Two maximum flooding surfaces bound a facies cycle which contains an unconformity internally. The first three cycles occur during a minor rift phase (Rift Phase 1) and the second four during a major rift phase (Rift Phase 2). The regressive phase of the second order cycles appears to correspond to periods of high fault displacement; however, the eustatic effect on these cycles is unclear. Each second order facies cycle is associated with a change in depocenters. Most major seismic discontinuities are tectonic in origin. Shelfal areas and local highs are often eroded during a second order regression and the deposition is shifted to the basin center. During transgression, deposition is more widespread; shallow marine sandstones often develop on the margins of the graben. The paleobathymetric profile created by regional and local tectonics dictates facies types. Maps and seismic profiles of Rift Phase 1 indicate that the relatively simple tectonics led to uniform sediment and facies distribution. During Rift Phase 2, the development of numerous sub-basins creates heterogeneous facies distribution. Fault escarpments prevent progradation into the graben; sediments accumulated on the edge of fault escarpments fail and are redeposited as <b>gravity</b> <b>deposits</b> at the base of the escarpment. The seven second order cycles are subdivided into fourteen minor facies cycles that are called third order cycles. These cycles can be bound by either unconformities forming sequences or maximum flooding surfaces forming regressive-transgressive facies cycles. The cause of third order facies cycles is unclear. Third order cycles are more sensitive to sediment supply. Source area dictates sediment types. Uplift and erosion of Paleozoic and Triassic sandstones yield sand-rich sediments, while erosion of Caledonian schist yields shale-rich sediments...|$|R
40|$|In the Neoproterozoic snowball Earth hypothesis, {{shutdown}} of the planetâs hydrological {{system has been}} attributed to a global ice cover during one or more extreme glaciations. In the central Flinders Ranges, South Australia, the Yudnamutana Subgroup of Sturtian age includes diamictite, sandstone, and siltstone units of glaciomarine origin as much as 5000 m thick, and is overlain by postglacial transgressive siltstone and shale of the Tindelpina Shale Member, Tapley Hill Formation. In the central Flinders Ranges, the Yudnamutana Subgroup consists of (1) the Pualco Tillite (<b>gravity</b> resedimented glacial <b>deposits),</b> (2) the Holowilena Ironstone (glacioturbidites), (3) poorly stratified pebbly diamictite of the Warcowie Dolomite Member, lowermost Wilyerpa Formation (<b>gravity</b> resedimented glacial <b>deposits),</b> succeeded by (4) siltstones and sandstones with abundant hummocky cross-stratification (HCS: storm deposits), and (5) a lonestone-bearing succession with cobble-sized clasts in the upper Wilyerpa Formation (ice-rafted debris interpreted to record a glacial re-advance) in which HCS is absent. Because the action of oscillating waves is required to produce HCS on the seafl oor, its presence indicates an interval of significant meltback prior to glacial re-advance. Given that the HCS occurs ~ 2 km beneath the Tindelpina Shale Member, it signifies a major ice-free interval during the Sturtian glaciation.

Three lithofacies, contourites, turbidites and debrites are defined based on sedimentological and mineralogical results. The most useful criteria for distinguishing between these two deposits are: i) the grain size vertical trend and sedimentary structures; ii) the modal frequency distribution, and iii) the sediment composition. Interpretation of sediment provenance of the different lithofacies reflects modes of long- and short-distance transport. Most of the terrigenous sediment of contourites {{is coming from the}} distant Guadalquivir drainage basin whereas those terrigenous sediment of turbidites and debrites are sourced by the vicinity fluvial drainage basins, Guadiana and Tinto-Odiel and biogenous components indicating shallow marine depositional environmentsPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in seafloor imaging and mapping techniques greatly improved our capability of identifying marine geohazards affecting continental margins. Geomorphic features {{can be detected}} in great detail by high-resolution multibeam imaging and regarded as geohazard indicators; the most common include slide scars and deposits, canyon headscarps and steep erosional flanks, fault-related seafloor unevenness, mud volcanoes, pockmarks, <b>gravity</b> flow <b>deposits,</b> erosional scours and bedforms indicating sediment mobility at diverse temporal/spatial scale. These processes are widespread on Italian continental margins and are potential indicators of geohazard for human settlements and infrastructures in the offshore and coastal zones. The national Project MaGIC (Marine Geohazards along the Italian Coasts) aims at documenting potential geohazards based on the acquisition of high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and on the production of maps of the geohazard-related geomorphic features {{for most of the}} Italian continental margins. With reference to this issue, we discuss some of the most frequent problems dealing with reconnaissance, interpretation and cartographic representation of geohazard-related geomorphic features at a regional scale...|$|R
40|$|Sediment cores from lakes Kormovoye and Oshkoty in the glaciated {{region of}} the Pechora Lowland, {{northern}} Russia, reveal sediment <b>gravity</b> flow <b>deposits</b> overlain by lacustrine mud and gyttja. The sediments were deposited mainly during melting of buried glacier ice beneath the lakes. In Lake Kormovoye, differential melting of dead ice caused the lake bottom to subside at different places at different times, resulting in sedimentation and erosion occurring only some few metres apart and at shifting locations, as further melting caused inversion of the lake bottom. Basal radiocarbon dates from the two lakes, ranging between 13 and 9 ka, match with basal dates from other lakes in the Pechora Lowland as well as melting of ice-wedges. This indicates that buried glacier ice has survived for ca. 80 000 years from the last glaciation of this area at 90 ka until about 13 ka when a warmer climate caused melting of permafrost and buried glacier ice, forming numerous lakes and a fresh-looking glacial landscape...|$|R

40|$|The {{near-field}} stratigraphic {{record of}} the Early Silurian glaciations is well documented in the literature. Data from far-field areas are, however, sparse. One of the best far-field stratigraphic records of these Llandovery glaciations is exposed on Anticosti Island in eastern Canada. Eight shallow-water paleotropical facies are present close to the mid-Telychian JupiterâChicotte formational boundary along the south-central coast of Anticosti Island. These can be grouped into three facies associations that include, from bottom to top: a carbonate facies association (FA- 1), a mixed siliciclastic and carbonate facies association (FA- 2) and an encrinitic facies association (FA- 3). These mid- to outer-ramp strata represent deposition mostly from episodic, high-energy storm events as evidenced by their sharp bases, hummocky cross-stratification, large wave ripples, gutter casts and wave-enhanced sediment <b>gravity</b> flow <b>deposits.</b> Superimposed on a long-term regressive trend, one main transgressiveâregressive (TR) sequence and four meter-scale TR cycles are evident, indicating a multi-order stratigraphic framework developed {{under the influence of}} glacio-eustasy.
