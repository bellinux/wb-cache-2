5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays {{they are}} a rare sight in Japanese cities, and only 30-35 {{professional}} chindon'ya (puro no chindon'ya) still exist, mostly in and around Tokyo, with another 30 amateur and hobby chindon'ya (shirōto chindon'ya) performing at festivals. In recent years, however, {{there seems to be}} a very small increase again, as they can draw on their historic roots to evoke nostalgia. The social status of the performers has also improved. Thus, while far away from their golden days, chindon'ya hold a small niche in the advertising business in Japan. In Osaka, for example, Chindon Tsūshinsha (ちんどん通信社) performs for clothing stores, politicians, beauty salons, and restaurants, in addition to stage performances on weddings, company parties, and other events. They expand their traditional roles even further and even provide a sort of religious services based on old folk rituals, even though they are not in any way priests. They have also performed outside Japan. Another group Adachi in Fukuoka was formed five years ago and is still <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> business, including new attractions as for example playing the saxophone while riding the unicycle, or displaying juggling, and balloon modelling performances.|$|E

In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song.

500|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound tyre as {{the harder}} [...] "prime" [...] tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound as the softer [...] "option" [...] compound, {{as opposed to}} the previous year where the company brought the hard compound as the prime and medium compound as the option. Sauber's Head of Track Engineering, Giampaolo Dall'Ara, praised the updated choice, summing up that it will challenge teams to make time in the corners in addition to going for pure top speed, putting on a better show for the fans. However, Pirelli had received criticism from several drivers and commentators following tyre failures on Nico Rosberg's and Sebastian Vettel's cars at the Belgian Grand Prix. Prior to the Italian Grand Prix, Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone called for the drivers to keep their concerns to themselves, saying: [...] "We’re not going to let them [...] go.

500|$|His {{best chance}} at winning a race {{occurred}} at the [...] where, in the wet conditions, Webber ran in 2nd place, setting the 3rd fastest lap of the race after the two McLarens. Towards {{the end of the}} race, Webber was running 2nd behind Lewis Hamilton, with no further pit stops to make, when Sebastian Vettel, driver for sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso, ran into the back of him when Hamilton suddenly reduced his speed in poor visibility and heavy rain under a safety car, taking both cars out of the race. He had been lapping faster than Hamilton due to damage on the McLaren's sidepod from contact with Robert Kubica. Out of the current Formula One drivers, until his win at the 2009 German Grand Prix, Webber has had the second highest number of starts without a win, and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "unluckiest man in modern Formula One", a title that was reinforced in Japan as Webber started the race suffering from food poisoning and vomited inside his helmet during the first safety car period. When questioned by ITV's Louise Goodman about the race ending collision Webber commented: [...] "Well it's kids, isn't it. Kids with not enough experience, <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job then they fuck it all up," [...] Webber was particularly critical of Hamilton's driving that led to the accident, describing his antics as [...] "shit".

500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg halted {{production}} of the show after the third season had been completed {{to focus on the}} making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which was set for release in 2004: [...] "I don't want to try and do a movie and the series at the same time.

I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory. He said that Engel [...] "truly was the most influential artistic person in [...] life."

She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and nicking his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a clue that a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so embarrassed for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy".

The group performed the song backed by a troupe of dancers and wore matching black trousers, gold and blue tops with military jackets with ammunition belts. Little Mix's mentor during their time on The X Factor, Tulisa Contostavlos, praised the performance: [...] "You're professional, you're all on point and confident now."

500|$|Zack's role in Crisis Core has {{received}} a mainly positive reaction. IGN's Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack's relationships with the other main characters. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack's story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it [...] "the heart of the game." [...] Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot labelled Zack a [...] "likable and complex hero," [...] arguing that he [...] "transcends the usual spiky-haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues." [...] GameSpy's Gerald Villoria described Zack as [...] "King of the Nice Guys," [...] noting that even though {{he can be a}} [...] "pretty hate-worthy character if you're the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline," [...] players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an [...] "endearing main character" [...] by Game Revolution who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, RPGamer viewed him to have the [...] "full, soulful carriage of a Final Fantasy hero" [...] due to his personal conflicts, despite his [...] "artfully teased hair and devil-may-care grin." [...] Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found Zack's physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud's, he added that [...] "this fan service doesn't put a foot wrong until he reaches into his [...] pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks." [...] He also praised Zack's English voice actor for <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job, noting [...] "his character's maturing and developing over the 15-hour storyline." [...] IGN AU's Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez's work as [...] "pretty likeable." [...] GamesRadar's AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword and the way he gives it to Cloud is the [...] "ultimate payoff" [...] of Crisis Core, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song [...] "Why" [...] for Crisis Core, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack's fate [...] "to the hearts of many people." [...] IGN UK's Dave McCarthy noted how Zack's role in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game.|$|E
