Two sets of blends were prepared by mixing an <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil with both refined and mild deodorized olive oils in increasing amounts. The obtained data highlighted that the triacylglycerol oligopolymers were absent or present in traces in the <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil, while their mean amount was equal to 0. 04 g/ 100 g and 0. 72 g/ 100 g in mild deodorized and refined olive oils, respectively.

The Factorial Discriminant Analysis of the data showed that the HPSEC analysis could reveal the presence of refined/mild deodorized oils in <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oils.

40|$|Background: Antioxidants are potent {{reducing}} agents which {{inhibit the}} oxidative process by neutralising or preventing {{the formation of}} reactive oxygen species. To better understand the beneficial effects of antioxidant compounds in the chosen oils {{it is important to}} investigate whether these bioactive compounds differ in <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> or refined types and how heating influences its level. Objectives: To measure the antioxidant content of oils before and after reaching the smoking point. To measure the total polyphenol content of oils before and after reaching the smoking point. To identify the smoking points of oils. Methods: The antioxidant capacity of different oils is determined using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method. The total phenolic content is determined using the Folin–Ciocalteau colourimetric method. The smoking point of each oil is measured by sugar thermometer. Results: Mean antioxidant and polyphenol levels of all oils after reaching the smoking point were higher than before heating. Antioxidant level was higher before heating only for <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil. The total polyphenolic content was higher before heating for <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil, <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> coconut oil and coconut oil. Rapeseed oil showed the highest antioxidant level of all oils both before and after cooking what indicates a strong thermal stability. <b>Extra</b> <b>virgin</b> coconut oil showed the lowest antioxidant level of all oils both before and after cooking. <b>Extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil showed the highest polyphenolic content of all oils before and after cooking. The highest smoking point had rapeseed oil and the lowest the <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> rapeseed oil. Conclusion: Significant differences in antioxidant and polyphenolic contents were found between oils before and after reaching the smoking point. A strong positive correlation was found between FRAP values and total phenolic content, p <. 0005. The mean total antioxidant and polyphenol levels were higher after heating the samples. This suggests that health benefits from antioxidants can be obtained even after reaching smoking point. Key Words: antioxidants, polyphenols, smoking point, oils, FRAP, Folin–Ciocalteau method...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the classification of olive oils that are mainly distributed in Korea via imports. The fatty acid contents, degree of color, pigments, anti-oxidants, and sterol contents are analyzed on {{the different types of}} olive oil as follows: 10 kinds of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil, 5 kinds of pure olive oil, and 5 kinds of refined olive-pomace oil. As a result of fatty acid analysis, the majority of oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), and minority of linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and stearic acid (C 18 : 0) were detected without any significant differences between the grades of olive oils. The UV spectrum is related to the ΔK, and it {{is a part of the}} analysis factor for the purity and degree of degradation of the oil. <b>Extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil had ΔK of almost 0, pure olive oil had 0. 07 ~ 0. 12, and refined olive-pomace oil had 0. 1 ~ 0. 13. These differed from <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> oil, and the pure or pomace oil ΔK had a confirmed distinct difference. The color degrees of chlorophyll with a low L * value and (－) a * (green) and carotenoid with (+) b * (yellow) were confirmed to have correlation between <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> and other olive oils. To compare chlorophyll and carotenoid as natural pigment in olive oils, 417 nm and the ratio of the absorbance at 480 nm (417 / 480) was calculated at 1. 62 of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin,</b> 1. 85 of pure olive oil, and 3. 32 of refined olive-pomace oil. Therefore, it will be possible to distinguish when the <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> or pure olive oil are mixed with olive-pomace oil. The total amount of tocopherol, an anti-oxidant, were 19. 06 in <b>extra</b> <b>virgin,</b> 10. 91 in pure olive oil, and 27. 88 in refined olive-pomace oil.

40|$|<b>Extra</b> <b>virgin</b> {{olive oil}} {{shelf-life}} could {{be defined as}} the length of time under normal storage conditions within which no off-flavours or defects are developed and quality parameters such as peroxide value and specific absorbance are retained within accepted limits for this commercial category. Prediction of shelf-life is a desirable goal in the food industry. Even when <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil shelf-life should {{be one of the most}} important quality markers for <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil, it is not recognised as a legal parameter in most regulations and standards around the world. The proposed empirical formula to be evaluated in the present study is based on common quality tests with known and predictable result changes over time and influenced by different aspects of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil with a meaningful influence over its shelf-life. The basic quality tests considered in the formula are Rancimat® or induction time (IND); 1, 2 -diacylglycerols (DAGs); pyropheophytin a (PPP); and free fatty acids (FFA). This paper reports research into the actual shelf-life of commercially packaged <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oils versus the predicted shelf-life of those oils determined by analysing the expected deterioration curves for the three basic quality tests detailed above. Based on the proposed model, shelf-life is predicted by choosing the lowest predicted shelf-life of any of those three tests...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to evaluate the quality of taralli {{as a function of}} the type of oil used in their dough formulation. To this end, 4 types of oil (<b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil, olive oil, olive-pomace oil, and refined palm oil) were utilized to prepare taralli to investigate on the lipid fraction degradation and evaluate the taralli acceptability by consumers. The data obtained pointed out that taralli manufactured with <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil were significantly more appreciated than those made with refined oils due to their visual appearance and odor. Moreover, with respect to the other kinds of oil, the use of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil led to significantly lower values (P < 0. 05) of specific absorption at 232 and 270 nm (K(232) and K(270), respectively) and of triacylglycerol oligopolymers. It also proved to present a much lower content in oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols than olive-pomace oil and refined palm oil, respectively.
