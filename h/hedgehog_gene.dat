These screens, which led to them winning the Nobel Prize in 1995 along with developmental geneticist Edward B. Lewis, identified genes that control the segmentation pattern of the Drosophila embryos. The hh loss of function mutant phenotype causes the embryos to be covered with denticles, small pointy projections resembling the spines of a hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|Lancelets, {{which are}} {{primitive}} chordates, possess only one homologue of Drosophila Hh (figure 7). Vertebrates, {{on the other}} hand, have several hedgehog ligands that fall within three subgroups – desert, Indian and sonic, each represented by a single mammalian gene. This is probably {{a consequence of the}} two genome duplications that occurred early in the vertebrate evolutionary history. Two such events would have produced four homologous genes, one of which must have been lost. Desert hedgehogs are the most closely related to Drosophila Hh. Additional gene duplications occurred within some species such as the zebrafish Danio rerio, which has an additional tiggywinkle <b>hedgehog</b> <b>gene</b> in the sonic group. Various vertebrate lineages have adapted hedgehogs to unique developmental processes. For example, a homologue of the X.laevis banded hedgehog is involved in regeneration of the salamander limb.|$|E

Here, we report the spatial and temporal regulation of Xchh which is expressed in endoderm cells differentiating to digestive organs. Xchh expression in endoderm was inhibited by ectopic expression of the dominant-negative activin receptor, tAR. Moreover, a maternally inherited transcription factor VegT and its downstream regulators activated Xchh expression. These indicates that Xchh is regulated by the factor involved in the cascade originated from VegT via activin/nodal signals.

25|$|Of the hh homologues, SHH {{has been}} found to have the most {{critical}} roles in development, acting as a morphogen involved in patterning many systems, including the limb and midline structures in the brain, spinal cord, the thalamus by the zona limitans intrathalamica the lungs, and the teeth. Mutations in the human sonic <b>hedgehog</b> <b>gene,</b> SHH, cause holoprosencephaly type 3 HPE3 {{as a result of the}} loss of the ventral midline. Sonic hedgehog is secreted at the zone of polarizing activity, which is located on the posterior side of a limb bud in an embryo. The sonic hedgehog transcription pathway has also been linked to the formation of specific kinds of cancerous tumors, including the embryonic cerebellar tumor, and medulloblastoma, as well as the progression of Prostate Cancer tumours. For SHH to be expressed in the developing embryo limbs, a morphogen called fibroblast growth factors must be secreted from the apical ectodermal ridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{hedgehog}} protein {{appears to}} have evolved in two sections, the N-terminal domain (hedge) and the C-terminal domain (hog), that only later were spliced together into a single transcriptional unit. The Hog domain contains a sequence called Hint (Hedgehog INTein), which is similar in sequence and function to bacterial and fungal inteins. The Hog domain is present in many eukaryotic branches, i.e. red algae, mosses, dinoflagellates, jakobids, and other single cell eurkaryotes. Choanoflagellates contain a gene named hoglet that also encodes the hedgehog C-terminal domain Hog domain. However, Choanoflagellates and lower eukaryotes do not contain any regions similar to the hedge domain, suggesting that hog evolved first. Poriferans have both hedge-like proteins (termed hedgling) and hog-like proteins, but they exist as two completely separate transcriptional units. Cnidarians contain the hedgling and hog genes, but also have a complete <b>hedgehog</b> <b>gene,</b> indicating that hedge and hog were spliced into hedgehog after the last common ancestor of poriferans and cnidarians. Bilaterians do not contain hedgling genes, suggesting that these were lost by deletion before this branch split from the other metazoans. However, Hog domain-containing genes without a Hedge domain are present in several bilaterian branches. They are found in lophotrochozoa and nematodes. While Enoplea nematodes also have a bona-fide Hedgehog, the branch leading to C. elegans has lost hedgehog, but has dramatically expanded the Hog genes.|$|E

Here we present the cloning and characterization of a hedgehog homologue from Xenopus laevis {{similar to the}} sonic class of vertebrate <b>hedgehog</b> <b>genes.</b> We isolated Xenopus hedgehog (Xhh) from a subtractive hybridization screen designed to identify genes induced by thyroid hormone during metamorphosis of the X. laevis gastrointestinal tract. In the intestine, Xhh mRNA expression was up-regulated at the climax of metamorphosis (stage 62) when intestinal epithelium underwent morphogenesis. Treatment of pre-metamorphic tadpoles with exogenous thyroid hormone (TH) resulted in a similar pattern of Xhh induction. Furthermore, TH induction was resistant to inhibitors of protein synthesis suggesting that Xhh is a direct thyroid hormone response gene. The expression and TH regulation of Xhh {{was not limited to}} the intestine, but was also observed in the limb and a mixture of pancreas and stomach. Throughout development, Xhh mRNA was present at varying levels with the earliest expression being detected at neurula stage. The highest levels of Xhh were observed between stages 33 and 40 shortly before tadpole feeding begins. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis of Xhh expression in pre-hatching, stage 32 tadpoles demonstrated staining in the notochord and floor plate similar to that observed for other vertebrate <b>hedgehog</b> <b>genes.</b> Together, these data suggest a putative role for Xhh in organ development during both amphibian embryogenesis and metamorphosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>hedgehog</b> (hh) <b>genes</b> encode {{secreted}} signaling {{proteins that}} have important developmental functions in vertebrates and invertebrates. In Drosophila, expression of hh coordinates retinal development by propagating {{a wave of}} photoreceptor differentiation across the eye primordium. Here we report that two vertebrate hh <b>genes,</b> sonic <b>hedgehog</b> (shh) and tiggy-winkle hedgehog (twhh), may perform similar functions in the developing zebrafish. Both shh and twhh are expressed in the embryonic zebrafish retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), initially in a discrete ventral patch which then expands outward in advance of an expanding wave of photoreceptor recruitment in the subjacent neural retina. A gene encoding a receptor for the hedgehog protein, ptc- 2, is expressed by retinal neuroepithelial cells. Injection of a cocktail of antisense (αshh/αtwhh) oligonucleotides reduces expression of both hh genes in the RPE and slows or arrests the progression of rod and cone photoreceptor differentiation. Zebrafish strains known to have mutations in Hh signaling pathway genes similarly exhibit retardation of photoreceptor differentiation.

After his short time there, he accepted a faculty position at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Beachy began focusing on the Drosophila <b>hedgehog</b> <b>gene,</b> for which he’s known for, in 1990. The gene’s name originated because fly embryos look spikey if the <b>hedgehog</b> <b>gene</b> is faulty or mutated. The hedgehog gene’s main function is to create protein signals in specific cells. These signals, in turn, allow {{for the formation of}} embryonic tissues. They do this by instructing neighboring cells to become a certain type of differentiated cell or to simply divide. In other words, this gene is responsible {{for the development of the}} appendages and body segments in Drosophila or fruit flies. Humans and other invertebrates have hedgehog genes that behave slightly different than the same gene in the fruit fly. In vertebrates, the <b>hedgehog</b> <b>gene</b> codes for the fingers and toes on the limbs. It also functions in organizing the brain and the spinal cord.

40|$|<b>Hedgehog</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been}} implicated in {{inductive}} signaling during development {{in a variety of}} organisms. A key element of the hedgehog signaling system is encoded by the gene patched. In Drosophila <b>hedgehog</b> regulates <b>gene</b> expression by antagonizing the action of patched. In addition, patched is itself a transcriptional target of hedgehog signaling. We have isolated a chicken patched homolog and find it to be strongly expressed adjacent to all tissues where members of the hedgehog family are expressed. As in Drosophila, ectopic expression of Sonic hedgehog leads to ectopic induction of chicken Patched. Based on this regulatory conservation, vertebrate Patched is likely to be directly downstream of Sonic hedgehog signaling. An important role of Sonic hedgehog is the regulation of anterior/posterior pattern in the developing limb bud. Since Patched is directly downstream of the hedgehog signal, the extent of high level Patched expression provides a measure of the distance that Sonic hedgehog diffuses and directly acts. On this basis, we find that Sonic hedgehog directly acts as a signal over only the posterior third of the limb bud. During limb patterning, secondary signals are secreted in both the mesoderm (e. g. Bone Morphogenetic Protein- 2) and apical ectodermal ridge (e. g. Fibroblast Growth Factor- 4) in response to Sonic hedgehog. Thus knowing which is the direct target tissue is essential for unraveling the molecular patterning of the limb. The expression of Patched provides a strong indication that the mesoderm and not the ectoderm is the direct target of Sonic hedgehog signaling in the limb bud. Finally we demonstrate that induction of Patched requires Sonic hedgehog but, unlike Bone Morphogenetic Protein- 2 and Hox genes, does not require Fibroblast Growth Factor as a co-inducer. It is therefore a more direct target of Sonic hedgehog than previously reported patterning genes...|$|R

Three mammalian <b>hedgehog</b> <b>genes,</b> sonic <b>hedgehog</b> (Shh), indian hedgehog (Ihh), and desert hedgehog (Dhh) have been identified.
