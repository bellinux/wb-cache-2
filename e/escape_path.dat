When King Narathihapate refused, Emperor Kublai Khan himself sent another mission in 1273, again demanding tribute. It too was rejected. In 1275, the emperor ordered the Yunnan government to secure the borderlands in order to block an <b>escape</b> <b>path</b> for the Song, and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested. Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the Mongol Army in 1277–78. After a brief lull, Kublai Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia, demanding tribute from Pagan, the Khmer Empire, Đại Việt and Champa. When the Burmese king again refused, the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma. Two dry season campaigns (1283–85) later, the Mongols had occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin, forcing the Burmese king to flee to Lower Burma. The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of Zhengmian.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} under the logit dynamics, {{positive}} feedback among agents (also called bandwagon property) induces evolutionary paths along which agents repeat the same actions consecutively so as to minimize the payoff loss incurred by the feedback effects. In particular, for <b>paths</b> <b>escaping</b> the domain of attraction of a given equilibrium-called a convention-positive feedback implies that along the minimum cost <b>escaping</b> <b>paths,</b> agents always switch first from the status quo convention strategy before switching from other strategies. In addition, the relative strengths of positive feedback effects imply that the same transitions occur repeatedly in the cost minimizing <b>escape</b> <b>paths.</b> By combining these two effects, we show that in an escaping transition from one convention to another, the least unlikely <b>escape</b> <b>paths</b> from the status quo convention consist of only the repeated identical mistakes of agents. Using our results on the exit problem, we then characterize the stochastically stable states under the logit choice rule for a class of non-potential games with an arbitrary number of strategies...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{industry}} {{is one of}} a country’s base supports. It is one of powers which make the economy of China developing fast. But at the same time, Coal {{industry is}} such a kind of industry in which many people hurt or die. Recently, many coal mines established coal mine rescue system. They improved the results in rescue by using information technology. The GIS (Geographic Information System) technology was widely applied. But this kind technology was limited to display and query maps. Its really powerful analysis function wasn’t used efficiently. There are flood, fire, gas disaster and etc in coal exploitation. Once the disaster happens, available <b>escaping</b> <b>paths</b> should be found immediately. Currently the administrators can accomplish this mission by using GIS function in coal mine rescue system, but in the rescue action, the time is very important. If GIS analysis function is used to find <b>escaping</b> <b>paths</b> automatically, the result of rescue action should be better. In coal mine, the laneways are used in transporting and ventilating. When the mine disaster happens, these laneway are <b>escaping</b> <b>paths</b> for the workers. So the <b>escaping</b> <b>paths</b> should be found in the laneways. To analyze the interlaced laneways by GIS method, a special model need to be built. It is a solution that constructing a network model which consists of junctions and edges by abstracting the laneways. So the problem of finding a <b>escaping</b> <b>paths</b> is converted to the path analysis of network. First, draw the network according to mine construction map strictly and build the correct topology relationship between them. Then add attributes to the network data, for example, the elevation of the junctions, the name of the laneways or the direction of the airflow. Being different from normal spatial data, network data has characters of connectivity and direction. Before network analysis, these characters should be set correctly. But these characters vary from the type and extent o...|$|R

25|$|African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) packs {{have been}} known to split into several smaller groups while in pursuit; one group initiates the chase, while the other travels ahead of the prey's <b>escape</b> <b>path.</b> The group of chase {{initiators}} coordinate their chase to lead the prey towards the location of the second group, where the prey's <b>escape</b> <b>path</b> will be effectively cut off. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops) have been shown exhibiting similar behaviors of pursuit role specialization. One group within the dolphin pod, known as the drivers, give chase to the fish - forcing the fish into a tight circle formation, while the other group of the pod, the barriers, approach the fish from the opposite direction. This two-pronged attack leaves the fish with only the option of jumping out of the water to escape the dolphins. However, the fish are completely vulnerable in the air; it is at this point when the dolphins leap out and catch the fish. In lion (Panthera leo) pack hunting, each member of the hunting group is assigned a position, from left wing to right wing, in order to better obtain prey. Such specializations in roles within the group are thought to increase sophistication in technique; lion wing members are faster, and will drive prey toward the center where the larger, stronger, killing members of the pride will take down the prey. Many observations of group pursuers note an optimal hunting size in which certain currencies (mass of prey killed or number of prey killed) are maximized with respect to costs (kilometers covered or injuries sustained). Groups size is often dependent on aspects of the environment: number of prey, prey density, number of competitors, seasonal changes, etc.|$|E

40|$|The <b>escape</b> <b>paths</b> prey animals take {{following}} a predatory attack {{appear to be}} highly unpredictable - a property that {{has been described as}} ‘protean behaviour’. Here we present a method of quantifying the <b>escape</b> <b>paths</b> of individual animals using a path complexity approach. When individual fish (Pseudomugil signifer) were attacked, we found that a fish's movement path rapidly increased in complexity following the attack. This path complexity remained elevated (indicating a more unpredictable path) for a sustained period (at least 10 seconds) after the attack. The complexity of the path was context dependent; paths were more complex when attacks were made closer to the fish, suggesting that these responses are tailored to the perceived level of threat. We separated out the components of speed and turning rate changes to determine which of these components contributed to the overall increase in path complexity {{following a}}n attack. We found that both speed and turning rate measures contributed similarly to an individual's path complexity in absolute terms. Overall, our work highlights the context dependent escape responses that animals use to avoid predators and also provides a method for quantifying the <b>escape</b> <b>paths</b> of animals...|$|R

2500|$|The Painted {{redstart}} (Myioborus pictus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} well documented flush pursuers. When flies, prey for redstarts, are alerted of the presence of predators, they respond by fleeing. Redstarts take advantage of this anti-predator response by spreading and orienting their easily noticeable wings and tails, alerting the flies, but only when they are in a position where the flies' <b>escape</b> <b>path</b> intersects with the redstart's central field of vision. When prey's path are in this field of vision, the redstart's prey capture rate is at it maximum. Once the flies begin to flee, the redstart begins to chase. It has been proposed that redstarts exploit two aspects of the visual sensitivity of their prey: sensitivity to the location of the stimulus in the prey's visual field and sensitivity to the direction of stimulus environment. The effectiveness of this pursuit can also be explained by [...] "rare enemy effect", an evolutionary consequence of multi-species predator-prey interactions.|$|E
