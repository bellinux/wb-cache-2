Because they are relatively safe and easy to use, they are often used in the mining industry. There are many different types of water gel explosives for use in different situations. One type, a small diameter slurry explosive, can be used specifically for blasting in coal undercut, midcut, and <b>depillaring</b> areas. They are preferable to nitroglycerin-based explosives like dynamite because they produce less noxious fumes. Detagel, which is very high in strength, is a specific example of a small diameter water gel explosive that is used for mining activities.|$|E

It is always preferred to investigate the <b>depillaring</b> problem in a three-dimensional simulated model because <b>depillaring</b> is, basically a three-dimensional problem. But many items, the broken and jig-jag nature of the <b>depillaring</b> face becomes too complex to correctly simulated even in a three dimensional model.

30|$|About 3000 {{million tonnes}} of coal is {{locked up in}} {{standing}} pillars (Dixit and Mishra 2010) under varying geo-mining conditions, which is prime target of the mining industry {{to meet the demand}} of coal production. Present pillar extraction (<b>depillaring)</b> practices of the country have, predominantly, adopted intermediate mechanisation along with few fully mechanised <b>depillaring</b> faces. Most of these faces are operating at shallow cover. But the existing technoeconomical conditions of the industry are attracting a fully mechanised <b>depillaring</b> system for deep seated coal pillars, which is likely to grow in near future (Singh et al. 2011 a). In Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL), about 60 % of coal is locked up in standing pillars formed by Bord and Pillar method (Internal Reports on BG method in the SCCL). About 50 % of coal reserves in India are in seams thicker than 4.5  m, which come under the category of thick seams, the exploitation of which is consistently posing challenges to the mining engineers. Extraction of thick seams by conventional hand section method is neither productive nor effective from the conservation point of view (heavy loss of coal by conventional hand-section method). The percentage of extraction by hand section mining in thick seams is as low as 25 – 30 %.|$|E
30|$|Selection of a {{suitable}} mining method for extraction of a thick coal seam with optimal recovery and safety {{is an extremely}} delicate process. In fact, single lift working of full thickness of a thick coal seam has always a verge over the multi-slice working due to favorable economics and high production and productivity. Blasting Gallery (BG) method is suitable for extraction of virgin thick seams as well as developed pillars in thick seams in single lift. The method was very successful resulting in 85 % of extraction with high productivity. But, this method experienced strata control problems during final extraction. The presence of strong and massive overlying roof strata caused high values of the mining induced stress over the pillars facing the goaf line during the <b>depillaring.</b> High values of mining-induced stresses in and around a <b>depillaring</b> face of thick coal seam generally create a threat of pillar overriding.|$|E
30|$|However, {{there is}} a lack of a {{reliable}} norm to estimate mining induced stresses, in and around a <b>depillaring</b> face, which makes it difficult to assess the safety factor. An underground pillar extraction process experiences complex nature of strata equilibrium dynamics and, therefore, an estimation of mining induced stress can be done either through field monitoring using instruments like stress meter or by simulation study.|$|E

A very {{common practice in}} underground is to make an estimation of rock load from the strata and its distribution over the underground mine workings is of prime importance [14, 17, 18].

Rock load in development galleries and junctions are usually calculated from CMRI- RMR while rock load for <b>depillaring</b> working (slices and goaf edges) is calculated {{on the basis of}} NGIQ[2, 3, 4].

40|$|The {{estimation}} of vertical stress and its distribution over the underground mine workings is of prime importance. In this project work their estimation is {{been done with}} the help of numerical modeling by simulating the workings. Study and analysis of the stress distribution around development and <b>depillaring</b> workings in coal mines and vertical stress estimation is done. The working has been modelled by writing a program code in FLAC 5. 0. The modelling is done in stages involving driving of galleries (development) to form three pillars and then the extraction of these pillars (<b>depillaring)</b> by slicing, then complete extraction to form ribs further followed by the judicious rob and burst of rib. The model is run in each of these stages to get the vertical stress distribution. From the analysis of stress distribution through numerical model (FLAC 5. 0) for a depth cover of 95. 5 m following maximum vertical stress was observed as Maximum vertical stress over the pillar during development is about 3 MPa, Maximum vertical stress over the stook during development is about 4 Mpa and Maximum vertical stress over the rib during development is about 7 Mpa. The outcome of the results show that the ultimate vertical stress increases considerably with increase in the depth cover and get concentrated over the area of excavation with high stress concentration over the pillars, stooks and ribs above the normal stress under the given depth cover. ...|$|E

The model is developed using ANSYS 8.0 for two dimensional plane strain analysis of the panel. The two dimensional, linear elastic and isotropic finite element method is selected to investigate the stress distributions around the pillar in plane strain condition.

30|$|In general, {{tributary}} area method {{is used to}} estimate the value of mining induced stress around a symmetrical excavation with low percentage of extraction. The scope of the {{tributary area}} method ends with high percentage of extraction and roof strata failure. Once the strata breaks and acquires a new state of equilibrium, an assessment of mining induced stress over coal pillars around the excavation becomes a challenging task. In fact, failure of overlying roof strata is mainly governed by the geology and strength of the strata. Due to further dimensional increase of the opening, mining induced stress is created by the immediate roof strata cantilevering over the goaf area and their magnitudes depend, mainly, on the length and thickness of the roof strata that overhang inside the goaf area. In past, a number of attempts (Sellers 1997; Majumder and Chakrabarty 1991) utilizing, both, simulation (Jaiswal et al. 2004; Mathur 1992) and field observations (Maleki 1992; Gale 1998) were made {{to understand the nature}} and amount of mining induced stress variation in and around an underground excavation due to coal mining. Jayanthu et al. (2004) found that the maximum vertical stress over rib and stook decreases with increase in working height during <b>depillaring.</b> Field investigations (Singh et al. 1996) showed that the nature of development of mining induced stress over pillar/stook at different stages of <b>depillaring,</b> for a nearly flat coal seam, is influenced by different parameters like depth of cover, characteristics of overlying strata, distance from face line, extraction height and goaf treatment.|$|E

Variables of the parametric studies for stress analysis are: seam thickness {{in the range of}} 5 – 11 m at an interval of 2 m and depth cover of 150 m to 900 m at an interval of 150 m. The maximum on pillar was found to be 35 MPa at 900 m depth in 5 m thick seam and the minimum was 5 MPa at 150 m depth. The maximum stress on stooks and ribs was found to be 70 MPa and 10 MPa in 5 m, 7 m at 900 m and 450 m depth respectively. From model it was found that thickness of the seam does not have any effect on the stress behaviour of the pillars after development work. Parametric studies through the numerical models indicated decreased vertical stress over the stooks with increasing height of the extraction at the depth covers in the range of 150 - 900 m. Though the stress coming was less, the stooks were getting yielded very soon due to increase in height of the stook and increase in height to width ratio...|$|E

A field study at different mechanised <b>depillaring</b> (MD) operations in Indian coalfields (with depth ranging from 60 to 377 m and caveability Index variation from 2300 to 10500) found mixed performances of adopted sizes of the ribs/snooks.

30|$|Globally, {{three primary}} mining methods were {{developed}} for the underground coal mining: longwall, room and pillar, and panel and pillar. Under room and pillar mining, if <b>depillaring</b> is not employed, the extraction ratio is typically < 50  % and little surface subsidence occurs (Peng 1992). Therefore, backfilling is not required and conducted at all unless some special conditions are met, e.g., when mitigating surface subsidence triggered by abandoned workings (Siriwardane et al. 2003). In such situations, the backfill method is relatively special, usually using the method of pumped slurry injection into the gob (PSIB) from surface boreholes (Lokhande et al. 2005). For example, in the USA, PSIB was first successfully conducted for abandoned room-and-pillar structures beneath built-up areas in Wyoming in the 1970 s and it has been shown to perform well in controlling the development of sinkholes (Colaizzi et al. 1981), followed by field tests in West Virginia in 1998 (Siriwardane et al. 2003). In addition to this objective, research has covered backfilling under room and pillar mining {{for the purpose of}} obtaining a high recovery rate (Donovan and Karfakis 2004), especially when mining under surface structures or rivers (Gandhe et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Bord and Pillar mining is {{the oldest}} and most popular mining method to extract coal from underground. It is simple, easy to operate and {{reasonably}} safe. The pillars form the natural support to the overburden roof and transfer the load to floor. In the process {{a large portion of the}} coal remain blocked for long period till <b>depillaring</b> is carried out. The underground coal mines in India predominantly follow the Bord and Pillar method of extraction. The stability of the roof and floor depends on the stability of the pillar. The pillar stability depends on its strength, nature of coal, presence of discontinuity, method of extraction, etc. In India DGMS guidelines govern the design of pillars whereas in other parts of world the pillar design is based on strength calculation of coal and other factors. Some of the approaches are given by Bieniawski, CIMFR, Obert – Duvall, Jaiswal – Shrivastava etc. In this investigation an attempt has been made to investigate the current pillar design practice in one major coal belt of India vis-à-vis other approaches. The investigation was considered in terms of extraction percentage and safety factor for each design approaches. Pillar dimension has been optimised to determine the extraction ratio of a stable safety factor. 35 m square pillar was found to be stable with more than 2 % enhanced recovery at a depth of 270 m in comparison to the existing practice...|$|E
40|$|Rockbolting {{telltales}} are now {{an internationally}} established means of providing preemptive warnings of roof falls. The dual height telltale, providing an immediate visible measurement distinguishing between movement {{above and below}} the rockbolted height, is the most widespread version. The dual height telltale was first developed by British Coal in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s as rockbolting was introduced to replace steel arch support and the success of this support system in deep coal mines has been widely ascribed to the use of this safety device. Since its adoption, many permutations and improvements on the basic design have been developed and applied worldwide to suit different mining circumstances; for instance, triple height telltales are commonly used where a combination of roofbolts and longer tendons are installed at the face of the heading. The choice of appropriate movement action levels is vital for safety. Experience has also shown that systematic management of the application of the telltale warning system is required to ensure that appropriate action (usually the installation of additional support) is taken in time when action levels are exceeded. In Australia, this is exemplified in the TARP approach. Another major development has been an intrinsically safe remote reading dual height telltale system which allows up to 100 electronic telltales to be connected with a twin core cable and read, using either a portable readout, {{from the end of the}} roadway, or a surface PC via a telephone cable connection. In the latter configuration, a real time display of roof condition is obtained whilst retaining the immediate visual indication underground. A recent development is the “Autowarning” telltale. This provides a warning of impending goafing in <b>depillaring</b> operations via high visibility, flashing LEDs.

The opencast is only profitable {{up to a certain}} depth; below that underground mining is the only profitable alternative. So more effective underground mining methods are required to be searched for and presented. When two seams are above one another, the workings in one tend to affect the working in another. In India coal seams that are near to one another such that the parting thickness between them is below 9 m are called contiguous. Coal mine regulation number 104 of Coal Mine Regulations, 1957 apply to such seams. The objective of this project was to evaluate the effect of parting thickness and depth cover of coal seams on stress distribution over pillars, stooks and ribs at different stages of <b>depillaring,</b> through numerical modelling using FLAC 2 D software. Contagious seams can be extracted in three possible ways, viz, First extraction in the upper seam then followed by the lower seam, first extraction in the lower seam then followed by extraction in upper seam or simultaneous extraction of both the seams. In India such seams are extracted preferably by caving or stowing. For such seams when extracted the pillars of one seam shall be vertically above or bellow the pillars of other seam. In the example taken under consideration in this project, the two seams contiguous to one another were generated. Their depth cover (from 150 m to 750 m) and parting thickness (from 3 m to 9 m) were varied and the stress distribution over pillars, stooks, ribs and parting were evaluated.
