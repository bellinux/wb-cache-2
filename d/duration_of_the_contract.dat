5|$|In 1990, Hungry Jack's renewed its {{franchise}} agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation, which allowed Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee. One {{of the terms}} and conditions of the renewed agreement required Hungry Jack's to open a minimum number of new locations each year for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996, Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the Hungry Jack's locations to Burger King, which Cowin declined. Burger King Corporation accused Hungry Jack's of violating {{the conditions of the}} renewed {{franchise agreement}} by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation, in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. In addition, BK sought to limit HJ's ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{collective}} {{food service}} sector {{is composed of}} companies responsible for meal supply to defined clients such as industrial companies, hospitals, public and private organisations. This paper presents <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a study <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> between a food service company and its contractors are negotiated, designed and managed. The analytical framework applied is based on transaction cost and contract theories, and outsourcing. During contract negotiation and design, the company makes great efforts ex ante to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> does not “congeal the relationship”. The results show that uncertainty regarding the economic environment is <b>the</b> main cause <b>of</b> renegotiation. Opportunism is specifically constrained by additional clauses. <b>The</b> average <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> is eight years, which indicates a high level <b>of</b> stability in <b>the</b> relationships <b>contracted.</b> These findings demonstrate <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ex ante costs when drafting contracts, which in effect minimise the ex post costs...|$|R

Early contributions go back to <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Tinbergen and Koopmans in the 1930 s.
