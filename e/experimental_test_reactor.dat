40|$|The {{decreasing}} {{availability of}} energy and concern about climate change necessitate the development of novel sustainable energy sources. Fusion energy is such a source. Although it will take several decades to develop it into routinely operated power sources, the ultimate potential of fusion energy is very high and badly needed. A major step forward {{in the development of}} fusion energy is the decision to construct the <b>experimental</b> <b>test</b> <b>reactor</b> ITER. ITER will stimulate research in many areas of science. This article serves as an introduction to some of those areas. In particular, we discuss research opportunities in the context of plasma-surface interactions. The fusion plasma, with a typical temperature of 10 keV, has to be brought into contact with a physical wall in order to remove the helium produced and drain the excess energy in the fusion plasma. The fusion plasma is far too hot to be brought into direct contact with a physical wall. It would degrade the wall and the debris from the wall would extinguish the plasma. Therefore, schemes are developed to cool down the plasma locally before it impacts on a physical surface. The resulting plasma-surface interaction in ITER is facing several challenges including surface erosion, material redeposition and tritium retention. In this article we introduce how the plasma-surface interaction relevant for ITER can be studied in small scale experiments. The various requirements for such experiments are introduced and examples of present and future experiments will be given. The emphasis in this article will be on the experimental studies of plasma-surface interactions...|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{control of}} the magnetic boundary of a thermonuclear plasma {{is an important issue}} in magnetic confinement research. The development of methods for the active control of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and correction of error fields is mandatory in view of fusion <b>reactors</b> or <b>experimental</b> <b>test</b> <b>reactors</b> under design. Recently, a very effective control scheme, named clean mode control (CMC), has been proposed in a reversed field pinch experiment (RFX-mod). The CMC is based on the real-time correction (cleaning), under simplifying hypothesis, of the sideband harmonics in the magnetic field produced by the discrete local active coils. In this paper, we focus on the problem of carefully computing the penetration of sidebands through a realistic load assembly, but still with a simplified cylindrical geometry, to allow for a detailed comparison with the crude CMC algorithm without the additional complication of the coupling between the poloidal harmonics due to the toroidal geometry...|$|R
40|$|Disruptions {{represent}} one of {{the main}} concerns for Tokamak operation, especially in view of fusion <b>reactors,</b> or <b>experimental</b> <b>test</b> <b>reactors,</b> due to the electro-mechanical loads induced by halo and eddy currents. The development of a predictive tool which allows to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of the halo current forces is of paramount importance in order to ensure robust vessel and in-vessel component design. With this aim, two numerical codes (CARIDDI, CAFE) have been developed, which allow to calculate the halo current path (resistive distribution) in the conducting structures surrounding the plasma. The former is based on an integral formulation for the eddy currents problem particularized to the static case; the latter implements a pair of 3 D FEM complementary formulations for the solution of the steady-state current conduction problem. Two representative test cases (ITER symmetric and asymmetric VDEs) have been selected to cross check the results of the proposed approaches...|$|R
50|$|The Nuclear {{industry}} (as {{distinct from}} the uranium industry) in Canada dates back to 1942 when a joint British-Canadian laboratory {{was set up in}} Montreal, Quebec, under the administration of the National Research Council of Canada, to develop a design for a heavy-water nuclear reactor. This reactor was called National Research Experimental and would be the most powerful research reactor in the world when completed. In the meantime, in 1944, approval was given to proceed with the construction of the smaller ZEEP (Zero Energy <b>Experimental</b> Pile) <b>test</b> <b>reactor</b> at Chalk River, Ontario and on September 5, 1945 at 3:45 p.m., the 10 Watt ZEEP successfully achieved the first self-sustained nuclear reaction outside the United States.

40|$|In the 2009 {{version of}} the ASME BPV Code, a set of new design fatigue curves were {{proposed}} to cover the various steels of the code. These changes occurred {{in the wake of}} publications [1] showing that the mean air curve used to build the former ASME fatigue curve did not always represent accurately laboratory results. The starting point for the methodology to build the design curve is the mean air curve obtained through laboratory testing: coefficients are then applied to the mean air curve in order {{to bridge the gap between}} <b>experimental</b> <b>testing</b> and <b>reactor</b> conditions. These coefficients on the number of cycles and on the strain amplitude are equal to 12 and 2 respectively in the 2009 ASME BPV code, using the mean air curve proposal from NUREG/CR- 6909 [1]. Internationally, with the same mean air curve, other proposals have emerged and especially in France [2]-[3] where a consensus seems to be reached on the reduction of the coefficient on strain amplitude. This paper provides statistical analyses of the experimental data obtained in France at high-cycle for austenitic stainless steels. It enables to bring arguments for the selection of a coefficient on strain amplitude in the French RCC-M code, where less scatter on the data is witnessed due to fewer material grades...|$|R

40|$|Beryllium, due to {{its unique}} {{combination}} of structural, chemical, atomic number, and neutron absorption cross section characteristics, has been used successfully as a neutron reflector for three generations of nuclear <b>test</b> <b>reactors</b> at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), the largest <b>test</b> <b>reactor</b> in the world, has utilized five successive beryllium neutron reflectors and is scheduled for continued operation with a sixth beryllium reflector. A high radiation environment in a <b>test</b> <b>reactor</b> produces radiation damage and other changes in beryllium.

Beryllium, intimately mixed with high-energy alpha radiation emitters has been successfully used to produce neutron sources.

In order to assess the character of the sludge and understand the digestion process the carbohydrate, fat, and protein content were also measured in the inputs and in the <b>test</b> <b>reactor.</b> It was found that all of the odorous compounds measured were affected by stage of digestion and temperature more than by HRT.
