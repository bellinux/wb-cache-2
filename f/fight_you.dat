Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E

500|$|Toriyama {{personally}} dislikes {{the idea}} of naming fighting techniques, joking that in a real <b>fight</b> <b>you</b> would be killed before you could yell their names, but Torishima felt it would be best. Toriyama proceeded to create names for all the techniques, except for the series' signature [...] which his wife came up with when he was indecisive about {{what it should be}} called. He even selected them specifically for each character, saying someone like Vegeta would use English names, and using kanji for the more sophisticated like Piccolo.|$|E
500|$|Jewel Summoner {{received}} mixed reviews. Its gameplay format, {{especially the}} premise of monster collecting, elicited frequent comparisons to Pokémon, a long-running Nintendo series of games. The gameplay itself was considered generic and unoriginal. IGN stated [...] "All too often the same battles happen again and again", and Game Informers reviewer said the battle system [...] "is as boring a turn-based snoozefest as I’ve seen in years". GameZone called Jewel Summoner [...] "prototypical" [...] and said the game [...] "does not stray {{too far from the}} formula. You <b>fight,</b> <b>you</b> level, you unlock new skills." [...] The process of improving monsters was described by GameSpot as too long and needlessly complicated, and IGN declared [...] "for the most part it's not even worth it." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Harry Mendryk, Boys' Ranch {{comprises}} {{two distinct}} groups. [...] "The first three issues featured work by Kirby (with one exception), had three stories per issue, {{and the stories}} were longer. For the final issues there is much less use of Kirby, only two stories per issue, and shorter stories. Actually each final issue had a single story, but broken into two chapters." [...] The first three issues average around thirty story pages; the last three issues average about twenty. [...] The last three feature special [...] "theme" [...] stories, the US Cavalry Army, the Pony Express, the Great Train Robbery. At {{least one of the}} themes was inspired by John Ford films; issue #4 was thought to show an influence from Ford's 'Cavalry Trilogy'. Besides Simon and Kirby, Mort Meskin, Marvin Stein, and Charles Nicholas [...] are credited as contributors in the latter issues, with Meskin given pencil and inks credits on [...] "I'll <b>fight</b> <b>you</b> for Lucy!" [...] and inks over Kirby pencils on [...] "The Bugle Blows at Bloody Knife." ...|$|E
500|$|At Corfu {{the prisoners}} were {{confined}} but the wounded were still not provided with treatment: Thompson was only {{able to have the}} musket ball removed from his arm when Mulberry was smuggled aboard Généreux in Corfu harbour without Lejoille's knowledge or permission. The British officers were eventually paroled and returned to Britain, although the carpenter Thomas Jarrat was detained because he refused to supply Lejoille with the specifications of Leanders masts. Most of the ship's regular seamen were held prisoner at Corfu. They were subsequently encouraged to join the French Navy, Lejoille attempting to enlist them on Généreux when a Russian squadron blockaded the port. Lejoille's demands were met with a response from a maintopman named George Bannister, who called out [...] "No, you damned French rascal, give us back our little ship, and we'll <b>fight</b> <b>you</b> again until we sink". Généreux subsequently escaped from Corfu and anchored off Brindisi, where Lejoille was killed by artillery fire from the Neapolitan castle overlooking the town. The ship was captured in a battle in February 1800 by a squadron under Nelson, off Malta. Leander was captured by a Russian force that seized Corfu in March 1799 and was returned to the Royal Navy by Tsar Paul, along with the sailors held on the island.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending on what kind of <b>fight</b> <b>you</b> want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E

2500|$|On July 8, 2011, ESPN {{reported}} that Pacquiao {{was willing to}} agree to random drug testing—but not by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).
