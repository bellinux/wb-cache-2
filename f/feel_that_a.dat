We {{who believe in the}} study of nature <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

With the amount of space in this area, residents <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> sports ground is needed. Sport is very popular in Discovery Bay with a number of sport teams. Recently, there was a protest in the plaza to let Hong Kong Resorts know that everybody wants a sports ground. The government refuses to provide any assistance or land.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the monarchy}} {{became the focus}} of acute {{criticism}} from part of the left and right of the Spanish political spectrum, and by regional separatists. As many as 22% of Spanish citizens <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> republic would be the better form of government for Spain, while separatists and independence supporters in the Basque Country and Catalonia routinely protest the monarchy as the living symbol of a united Spain. Part of the left criticize the institution of monarchy as anachronistic, while the far right criticize King Juan Carlos personally because he has given his royal assent and tacit approval to what they perceive to be a liberal agenda in Spain and a secularism of Spanish life.|$|E

500|$|Before Departures premiered, a manga {{adaptation}} by Akira Sasō was serialized {{in twelve}} instalments in the bi-weekly Big Comic Superior, from February to August 2008. [...] Sasō {{agreed to take}} on the adaptation as he was impressed by the script. [...] He had the opportunity to view the film before beginning the adaptation, and came to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> too-literal adaptation would not be appropriate. He made changes to the settings and physical appearances of the characters, and increased the focus on the role of music in the story. Later in 2008 the serial was compiled in a 280-page volume released by Shogakukan.|$|E

500|$|In February 1843 the Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission was published. It was a {{parliamentary}} report exposing {{the effects of}} the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production {{until the end of the}} year. In March he wrote to Dr. Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the Second Report, about his change in plans: [...] "you will certainly <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea".|$|E

[...] Lieberstein said the script drew less attention to long-standing story arcs, which new viewers would not understand. Lieberstein said, [...] "It almost had an air of a pilot in a way, where we had to reintroduce everything. We wanted it to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front." [...] The Office creator Greg Daniels said he felt the episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces. Daniels said, [...] "I looked at all the shows that followed the Super Bowl in years past and I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> comedy would be a good choice in the current climate. People want to laugh so we're trying our best to supply some laughs." [...] Actor Rainn Wilson said of the episode, [...] "It's a great opportunity for people to revisit the world of The Office and hopefully get into our style of comedy." ...|$|E

Others have proposed a Marshall Plan for Africa to help that continent, and US Vice President Al Gore suggested a Global Marshall Plan. [...] "Marshall Plan" [...] has become a metaphor for any very large scale government program that is designed to solve a specific social problem. It is usually used when calling for federal spending to correct a perceived failure of the private sector.|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, reports {{surfaced}} that Interplay {{had shut}} down Black Isle Studios, although Interplay itself made no formal statement. On December 16, IGN reported that Black Isle Studios had definitely been closed, and now existed {{only as a}} brand under the Interplay label. They reported that when Black Isle's director had quit, the studio was placed under the management of Digital Mayhem, but with the agreement that Interplay would adopt a more hands-off approach. By this stage, Black Isle had already begun work on Dark Alliance III. However, the title was cancelled after Interplay failed to retain the license to use the Dungeons & Dragons label from Wizards of the Coast, so Black Isle shifted focus to Fallout 3. They handed in a 95% complete demo, including all game functionality. The next day, however, Interplay, who were several million dollars in debt, with just over $1 million in the bank, began to fire people from Digital Mayhem. Two weeks later, all but {{two members of the}} Fallout team were fired. This effectively meant Black Isle Studios no longer existed as anything other than a brand. Apparently, staff were told by Interplay that [...] "we will continue to produce titles. If we <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> title is worth of [...] the Black Isle Studios' name then it will be released under that brand." ...|$|E
