5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> the two releases.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in {{the second}} wave on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was to capture Bayeux and a nearby ridge, thus cutting the N13 highway between Caen and Bayeux to make it {{difficult}} for the Germans to move in reinforcements. The second wave on King, the 151st Infantry Brigade, was tasked with capturing the Caen road and railway, along with setting up positions on high <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> the Aure and Seulles rivers. Other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, The New Saints {{moved into}} Park Hall permanently. In 2010, The New Saints applied for {{funding for a}} new stand however it was refused by Welsh Grounds Improvement and the team risked losing their licence {{to compete in the}} Welsh Premier League. As a result, The New Saints applied to play their home matches at Deva Stadium in Chester and move away from Park Hall. Following the move from the Recreation <b>Ground,</b> <b>between</b> November 2012 and July 2015, The New Saints were unbeaten at Park Hall in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward {{to reinforce the}} 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was {{not strong enough to}} break through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to form their own defensive position in the <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> No.2 and No.3 Posts.|$|E
5|$|Odense {{is one of}} Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the vicinity}} show proof of settlement for over 4,000 years {{since at least the}} Stone Age. The earliest community was centred on the higher <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> the Odense River to the south and Naesbyhoved Lake (now dry) to the north. Nonnebakken, one of Denmark's former Viking ring fortresses, lay to the south of the river. Today, Odense's Møntergården Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area. The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks to defend it against invaders coming in from the coast.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 1944, the 6th Airborne Division {{landed in}} Normandy. Their {{mission was to}} secure the left flank of the {{invasion}} zone, by occupying and dominating the high <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> the River Orne and the River Dives. Despite the parachute troops being widely scattered, they managed to complete all of their objectives. After six days of counter-attacks by German armour and infantry, the division's position was secure {{by the end of}} the Battle of Breville on 12 June. Thereafter, they suffered only artillery bombardments.|$|E
5|$|The Coalition forces {{launched}} attack after {{attack on}} the villages which were stubbornly defended by the French. Meanwhile, Austrian cavalry charges were highly effective in the open <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> the settlements. After bitter fighting in which Oberwinden and Racour changed hands repeatedly, the two villages and Neerwinden were recaptured by Clerfayt's troops. An Austrian cavalry charge pressed back the French even farther. Dumouriez attempted one more all-out attack with his right but it failed. The French cavalry covered the retreat of the infantry, with Chartres and Valence maintaining a position along the Little Gete.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{mechanics of}} the original game remain the same. The player controls an empire {{with the goal of}} conquering as much territory as possible and eliminating rival factions, which are controlled by the computer, or AI. The main campaign is split between two gameplay modes: a turn-based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire, and a real-time battle map for fighting battles on the <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> two or more armies. The two game modes are linked, with success or failure in one game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is based}} upon Cochrane's {{doctoral}} thesis, which was completed at the London School of Economics, and builds upon subjects he had discussed in previous publications, including his first book. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals, edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner. Critics {{from a variety of}} backgrounds responded positively to the book, focussing on how Cochrane had found a middle <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> traditional animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught in the killing <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{classes were}} all pre-chosen by BR, but the various regions {{were free to}} choose, within certain parameters, which specific locomotives were to be represented. Tasked with supplying a suitable Coronation, the London Midland Region (LMR) selected No. 46236 City of Bradford. Regions were also free to choose their drivers. To drive the engine throughout, the LMR chose driver Byford from Camden shed who was seen to be sufficiently experienced. City of Bradford was then tested on its home <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> London Euston and Carlisle, on the Eastern Region (ER) between London Kings Cross and Leeds, on the Western Region (WR) between London Paddington and Plymouth, then finally on the Southern Region (SR) between London Waterloo and Exeter.|$|E

When the club reached the 1994 Scottish Cup Final, manager Ivan Golac dismissed talk of the hoodoo, even though opponents Rangers were strong favourites to complete a domestic treble in the 1993–94 season. United broke the supposed hoodoo and won the Scottish Cup {{for the first time}} when Craig Brewster's goal gave them a 1–0 win.|$|E
5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman {{taught his}} {{students}} lessons on morality using {{examples from the}} lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.|$|E
5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} accommodated {{in the corner}} of the <b>ground</b> <b>between</b> the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E
