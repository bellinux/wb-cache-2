500|$|At San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Marvel's Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada debuted {{the first}} trailer for Legion at his [...] "Cup O'Joe" [...] panel. Response to the trailer was positive, {{particularly}} its unique tone and visuals. Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge described the trailer as eclectic, while Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called it manic. Kelly West at Cinema Blend called the trailer [...] "all kinds of weird... {{in a good}} way", and positively compared it to a mix of Fight Club, Mr. Robot, and The Matrix. At New York Comic-Con later that year, the series held its own panel. Hawley, Loeb, Donner, and the series' main cast members were present to promote the series and screen {{the first half of}} the pilot episode. In response to the footage, Deadline.com's Dominic Patten said [...] "we know three things for sure about Legion, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great,</b> has top notch pacing and a killer choice of music." [...] Nick Romano, recapping the panel for Entertainment Weekly, called the footage [...] "just as chaotic as the mind of David Haller" [...] and [...] "almost Kubrickian in nature". [...] "Based on what was screened," [...] Romano added, [...] "Legion already seems to have an erratic, hallucinatory tone and style that we’ve never seen before from a superhero TV series." ...|$|E

5000|$|In addition, {{prominent}} in both The Sanctuary Recording Studio and on The Defamation of Strickland Banks is Eric Appapoulay’s upright piano. Ben Drew explained that “Because of how old it is, {{and some things}} are slightly out of tune, {{it reminded me of}} those old hip-hop records where the sampled piano does sound a little but gritty,” “That’s why I loved it. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and it’s got a proper resonance.” ...|$|E
50|$|Top Gear also {{reviewed}} {{the car and}} gave it 7/10 and added <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> all around.|$|R
50|$|Jim {{had a nice}} {{drawing and}} put small extra touches within the tattoo which made <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>great.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first series}} was odd, {{it was very}} extravagant. It cost a million pounds for the six {{programmes}} ... which {{was a lot of}} money to spend ... <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>great,</b> but <b>it</b> wasn't as consistently funny as we would have liked.|$|R
5000|$|It's been a mad dash, but we've made {{it across}} the finish line and Mischief Night is finished. I could not be more pleased with how it all came together. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and sounds great. The score by Anastasia Devana is {{powerful}} and evocative, Richard Vialet's photography is beautiful, and the entire cast gave it everything they had. I think we've made a film which not only will please genre fans, but also a more general audience. Richard Schenkman ...|$|E
5000|$|The game {{received}} mostly negative reviews. IGN {{gave it a}} 4.3 out of 10 writing [...] "While it's {{prettier than}} most budget titles, it also suffers from the vacancy that so often comes with nice looking people, dogs, or mechanical monsters. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> standing still, but give it a complicated task and it all goes to pieces". GameSpot wrote [...] "Even at the low retail cost of $19.99, Robot Arena isn't worth it. You'd end up getting more entertainment if you randomly chose two movies at an over-priced movie theater".|$|E
50|$|After quite {{a lengthy}} stint of detective work, {{we managed to}} track down the {{original}} digital master tape of the Brixton live show. And <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great!</b> So we asked Catherine Marks and John Catlin at Alan Moulder’s studio to mix the audio afresh from the 2″ master tapes of the gig. Catherine had worked under Alan’s watchful eye on the Roxy LA mixes and so we were really happy that she could find time to mix and edit the Brixton audio. Needless to say, it sounds truly wonderful and we’re really pleased to now finally have a Ride release on DVD.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the success}} of Murder Files, {{we wanted to make}} a game that appealed to our biggest fans who love crime drama. We wanted to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>great</b> as well as have an {{intriguing}} mystery to solve and designed it as a mobile game from the outset. The Trace is a really stylish murder mystery that I hope pleases all our fans Relentless Software CEO Andrew Eades ...|$|R
5000|$|Jerry {{takes his}} mother's fur coat and his jacket to be dry cleaned. George {{is going to}} hire a secretary; he says he'll pass over {{attractive}} women so he can concentrate on his work. He hires Ada (Vicki Lewis), a very efficient secretary. Kramer {{is in need of}} moisturizer with ultraviolet light absorber. Elaine buys a dress on sale at Barneys because <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> in their mirrors, but later <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> awful. She thinks they are using [...] "skinny mirrors" [...] which make people look thinner. She wants to return the dress.|$|R
50|$|Also on 2 April 2011, {{historian}} William J. Hamblin {{called into}} question the Jesus image on the tablet, stating <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> a <b>great</b> deal like images of Helios also found on ancient coins.|$|R
5000|$|On release, Famitsu {{magazine}} {{scored the}} Dreamcast {{version of the}} game a 30 out of 40. IGN called it [...] "a bordering-on-cheesy, yet outstanding action-RPG". They praised the 3D combat system, comparing it to SpikeOut and Shenmue, as well as [...] "the meticulous attention to detail" [...] in [...] "around five large neighborhoods, each with plenty of houses, universities, and restaurants" [...] {{as well as a}} video arcade with minigames. They also praised the animation and [...] "brilliantly rendered graphics", concluding that [...] "the gameplay is tightly focused, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great,</b> and definitely has a soul".|$|E
50|$|Cedric Bixler-Zavala {{stated in}} an interview:The Volta {{is taken from}} a Federico Fellini book about his films, what he characterizes as a {{changing}} of scene, or a turnaround; a new scene to him is called Volta. Y'know, changing {{of time and the}} changeover. And Mars, we're just fascinated by science fiction so and it's something that ultimately looked as in anything I write, its meaning is always up to the listener. As the way we write songs and words, if <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> on paper then to us it's like painting, so if it looks good meaning the second then people usually have a better interpretation than we ever would.|$|E
5000|$|Destructoid's Maurice Tan {{scored the}} iOS remake 8 out of 10. He criticized {{the lack of}} a tutorial, but {{concluded}} that [...] "Death Rally is {{a lot of fun to}} play, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great,</b> runs smooth, and it's very addictive." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Death Rally left me smiling. Gaining new cars, equipping upgraded weapons, and blasting rivals is certainly fun and this is the best such mayhem has looked on the App Store." [...] Pocket Gamer's Tracy Erickson scored it 7 out of 10, criticizing the lack of customisable controls and the design of some of the tracks; [...] "Death Rally provides plenty of cool weapons and rides, yet the absence of ... tighter track designs prevent it from being truly killer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{that the}} way?" [...] replied Rollo. [...] "I {{thought they were}} cast away at sea. I am sure <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> a <b>great</b> deal safer here than it does {{out in the middle}} of the ocean." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Who smashing {{all their}} equipment. I mean, {{they did it}} so well. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> so <b>great.</b> <b>It</b> was like, 'Wow, that is {{beautiful}}.' We went on. We played our little music. And it seemed so lame to me, at the time. And Hendrix was also beautiful and incredible and sounded <b>great</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>great.</b> I loved both acts. I sat there gape-jawed. They were wonderful." [...] - Jerry Garcia ...|$|R

5000|$|In June-July 2012, Schramm portrayed Falstaff in William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor at The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. [...] "This is {{my first}} time doing Merry Wives. I'm having a great time. The {{director}} (Stephen Rayne) is absolutely stellar. He's intelligent and experienced and really knows the era. We've set the play {{at the end of}} the first World War, sort of in the Downton Abbey era. It works very well as a time period for the play. And <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great.</b> We're meticulously putting it together. This play really demands a lot from everybody. There's so much to try and do. But we're all pulling together," [...] said Schramm in a 2012 interview. Schramm also revealed that it was his first time at the Shakespeare Theatre.|$|E
5000|$|Bart is taunted {{by school}} bullies Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney, {{because he does}} not have a 10-speed bike like they do. In order to get Homer to buy him a 10-speed bike, Bart gets the bike he already has run over by Dr. Hibbert's Mercedes-Benz G500. Homer buys the 10-speed bike for Bart, but refuses to pay the small {{assembly}} fee and builds it himself. Bart is happy since <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and works perfectly at first, but it falls apart when he moons the bullies. Homer, wanting Bart to be proud of him, tries to build a battle robot for the [...] "Robot Rumble". He fails to construct one, but then decides to build a robot with himself in it; Bart names the robot [...] "Chief Knock-a Homer". Unaware of Homer's ruse, Bart enters the robot in the Rumble.|$|E
5000|$|Shakespearean {{actor and}} writer of Shakespeare on Toast Ben Crystal opined that the comic was [...] "beautifully drawn", elaborating that it [...] "reminds me of Hellboy, {{particularly}} the ghosts and witches. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great,</b> {{has a good}} pace, and is exciting to read." [...] Crystal offers room for improvement, [...] "The language {{is a bit of}} a tricky one. For the most part, it works well. There’s an error here and there... but those aside, I think it falters when the writer tries to attempt a mock-Shakespearean style." [...] George Gene Gustine of The New York Times called the series [...] "gripping, violent and dark fun, even if you’re not fully versed in Shakespearean lore", while Fangoria called it [...] "a highly enjoyable adventure," [...] saying that [...] "McCreery and Del Col skillfully juggle a Who’s Who assortment of characters, and Belanger places them in stylishly imagined backdrops on every page".|$|E
5000|$|The spider {{figure in}} the {{conclusion}} of the series was hand-constructed by Mixon and his art department team. Wallace recalled of the spider: We labored long and hard designing a spider that was very beefy and muscular, almost reptilian in appearance. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> in the drawings, and I even recall a little clay model Bart did, which sealed the deal and won my enthusiastic approval. Bart and team went back to Hollywood to work the whole thing up full-size, and shooting started. When the SVFX team returned to Vancouver and unpacked the full-size spider, what I expected to see was the big version of that original model, the beefy, reptilian thing that was scary on sight. What they assembled on set was very, very different. Not chunky at all, very lean and mean." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rider {{has always}} {{maintained}} a low-key and professional style in fronting major sporting events, {{in a similar}} way to his predecessors and colleagues Harry Carpenter and Des Lynam, but in marked contrast to presenters who some feel try to steal the event's spotlight. On his style, he was quoted as saying [...] "not that bothered about the environment that should surround a presenter {{at the beginning of a}} programme, of the [...] "if we get you in this location <b>it</b> will <b>look</b> as though you are close to the action" [...] sort of thing. That is meaningless for an audience, it is just a macho thing for a production team. We used to have these discussions: wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>great</b> if you were standing by the 18th green as Nick Faldo putted out and you would say [...] "No, that would get in the way of everybody's enjoyment of the event".|$|R
6000|$|... "Every month; I see"--but {{his manner}} {{justified}} considerably her charge of vagueness. They {{had reached the}} stile and he leaned over <b>it,</b> <b>looking</b> at a <b>great</b> mild meadow and at the browsing beasts in the distance.|$|R
5000|$|... 148Apps wrote [...] "Mega Run {{is still}} a fantastic auto-runner though. The choice for set levels was an {{inspired}} one, {{and it will take}} plenty of time to play and master them all. The fact that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and has cloud saving is just the cherry on top." [...] TouchArcade said [...] "Mega Run is an engrossing, vibrant game that has a fantastic presentation, controls and art direction. At its core, the action is pretty standard, but the execution is near flawless. Give it a spin." [...] Gamezebo wrote [...] "Perhaps the only real frustration of Mega Run lies in the game's somewhat frequent crashes, which left me less than enchanted as I scrolled through the game's menus all over again. Menus which, oddly enough, are perhaps the only non-juicy things about the game, with commands awkwardly labelled, making navigation a sticking point." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing the Neo Geo home version, Major Mike of GamePro summarized, [...] "Savage Reign is one {{of those}} {{impressive}} fighting games that's likely to disappear soon after it surfaces. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and the sound is dynamite, but in the end it falls short because it lacks an identity to separate it from the multitude of fighting games already out there." [...] He reviewed the Neo Geo CD version with similar remarks, and noted that compared to the Neo Geo version [...] "the three-button simultaneous attacks are more difficult to execute because the buttons are stacked on top of each other." [...] Maximum gave the Neo Geo CD version four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "Let there be no doubt, everything from the coin-op has been packed into the CD version making it a very attractive break from the more conventional Fatal Fury/King of Fighters activities, but with all the fighting action you'd expect from an SNK title." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sammy nodded. [...] "I've seen Farmer Brown dig {{one over}} on the Green Meadows, but <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> like a <b>great</b> deal of work. I didn't suppose that anyone else could do it. Do you really mean that you can dig a canal, Paddy?" ...|$|R

[...] " [...] AppAdvice wrote [...] "This universal game is witty, entertaining, and engaging. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great,</b> has interesting dialog and offers challenging turn-based strategy gaming that will keep you playing for hours. [...] " [...] Gamezebo said [...] "One could say that not playing it would be criminal. And should you be accused of such a felony, I can only hope a lawyer as corrupt as Max McMann is serving as prosecutor." [...] Slidetoplay said [...] "Devil's Attorney is a hilarious spoof of courtroom dramas, with a roguish hero who wins every case by being unscrupulous. [...] " [...] 148apps said [...] "The artwork is very polished and the storyline is original and witty. There {{is a lot of}} funny banter between the attorneys {{at the beginning of each}} round and it's almost as if the developers hired a screenplay writer to write all the content. [...] " [...] Toucharcade said [...] "Like Capcom's courtroom drama, Devil's Attorney is an addictive puzzler whose courtroom metaphor for battle makes for one of the most unique and absorbing games you'll find on mobile or any other platform.

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a mediocre review and stated that, [...] "Despite the film's {{claims to be}} based on fact, I didn't believe it for a moment. I did, however, enjoy it at various moments. Brosnan disappears so {{completely}} into the leading role that he hardly seems present in the movie, and the film's portrait of Victorian India is a triumph (the production was designed by the British master of period atmosphere, Tony Adams). <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> even at its most incredible." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times also thought negatively of the film, stating [...] "The tinniness of Michael Hirst's screenplay (It's older than time and just as mysterious) hardly helps bring this material to life, any more than Mr. Brosnan's unconvincing and (despite several episodes in which he proves himself capable of violent killing) rather passive performance." [...] Maslin then went on to say that, [...] "In its own way, The Deceivers is oddly old-fashioned." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it [...] "an adventure epic with a pretty measly sense of adventure." [...] He added, [...] "There are a few patches of exotic fun, like the opening murder scene, and there's a seductive campfire dance by a young boy that's creepy enough to send chills (though perhaps inadvertently). But for the most part all we react to is the squandering of a good idea." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{story behind}} Kirants is extraordinary. This church, unlike most monasteries built in Armenia, is {{constructed}} mostly of brick and mortar. [...] "Kir" [...] {{is the word}} for mortar. [...] "-ants" [...] brings meaning that the previous word has [...] "passed" [...] the level, or is not level or uneven. The village had a one very rich man who had one very beautiful daughter. A master craftsman and mason {{had fallen in love}} with the daughter and she with him. However, he came from a very poor family and he knew that he would have a difficult time convincing her father to allow him to have her hand in marriage. He tried non the less and the rich man said he would give his blessing if he the craftsmen well known for his talents would build him a church in the village. The craftsman agreed and built the beautiful church. He was on the top of the [...] "drum or dome" [...] and near completion of the church when the rich man came to see how things were coming along. The Craftsman asked the rich man [...] "how does the church look?" [...] the rich man responded by saying <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> but [...] "kiren antsa" [...] or the line of the brick and mortar looks uneven. From this statement the craftsman, who was so excited that the church would be finished and he could marry his love, realized that the rich man had no intention to grant his daughters hand in marriage and jumps from the [...] "drum or dome" [...] taking his own life.|$|E
60|$|There was a faint flush on {{his pale}} cheeks {{and his eyes}} were {{flashing}} brightly, as he looked at us standing close together. It might have been the result of his recent conversation, of course; but, coupled with his frowning brow and quick, suspicious glance, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> a <b>great</b> deal more like a sudden fit of anger at seeing us engaged in what appeared like a confidential talk. But there was no trace of it in his tone when he addressed us.|$|R
50|$|Pandaguan, the {{youngest}} son, was very clever and invented a trap to catch fish. The very {{first thing he}} caught was a huge shark. When he brought it to land, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> so <b>great</b> and fierce that {{he thought it was}} surely a god, and he at once ordered his people to worship it. Soon all gathered around and began to sing and pray to the shark. Suddenly the sky and sea opened, and the gods came out and ordered Pandaguan to throw the shark back into the sea and to worship none, but them.|$|R
6000|$|As for {{the spare}} room, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> a <b>great</b> deal too {{comfortable}} for an incubus from foreign parts.

I was looking at a torn place in one of them, and determined to leave it unrepaired, when I felt an arm slipped round my waist from behind. A voice, so close that it tickled my neck, said: [...] "Dear girl, what friends we shall be!" [...] I turned round, and confronted Miss Jillgall.|$|R
