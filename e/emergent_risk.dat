40|$|Failing {{to elicit}} {{requirements}} {{is as much}} of a risk in the traditional, negative sense as successfully defining requirements is a positive step towards successful systems development. The discipline of risk management has long since {{had to deal with the}} spectre of <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> and its inherent lack of predictability. Just as risk management considers how any number of vulnerabilities in a system may be exploited by accident or by malicious intent that preys upon exposure to otherwise independent factors, so successful requirements elicitation is beholden to the ability to recognise the need for, and define, derived requirements. In this paper we suggest that risk assessment and requirements elicitation are two manifestations of the same activity: creating trustworthy software. We propose the research and development of a methodology where the two disciplines converge...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -year post-trial {{monitoring}} {{of patients with}} newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes randomised in the "United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study" (UKPDS) demonstrated a continued reduction in microvascular risk (- 24 %, p = 0. 001) and <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> reductions for myocardial infarction (- 15 %, p = 0. 01) and death from any cause (- 13 %, p = 0. 007), despite an early loss of glycaemic differences ("legacy effect"). A continued benefit after metformin therapy was evident during the ten-year post-trial follow-up among overweight patients (- 33 %, p = 0. 005 for myocardial infarction and - 27 %, p = 0. 002 for death from any cause). In contrast, the benefits of previously improved blood pressure control were not sustained when between-groups differences in blood pressure were lost during follow-up, except for a reduced risk for peripheral vascular disease. These observations are strong arguments in favour of an early optimisation of blood glucose control and of a sustained control of blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Accidents are {{a systems}} {{phenomenon}} and multiple methods {{are available to}} enable retrospective analysis of accidents through this lens. However, the same cannot {{be said for the}} methods available for forecasting risk and accidents. This paper describes a new systems-based risk assessment method, the NETworked hazard analysis and risk management system (NET-HARMS), that was designed to support practitioners in identifying (1) risks across overall work systems, and (2) <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> that are created when risks across the system interact with one another. An overview of NET-HARMS is provided and demonstrated through a case study application. An initial test of the method is provided by comparing case study outcomes (i. e. predicted risks) with accident data (i. e. actual risks) from the domain in question. Findings show that NET-HARMS is capable of forecasting systemic and <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> and that it could identify almost all risks that featured in the accidents in the comparison data-set...|$|R

Considering the {{escalating}} rate of suicidal behaviour in adolescents, not much {{is known about}} the risk and protective factors that mediate non-fatal suicidal behaviour among this group. This study has focused on exploring the subjective worlds of Indian adolescents who have engaged in non-fatal suicidal behaviour in order to identify such factors, which are crucial in the designing of effective intervention programmes. The sample consisted of 10 adolescent patients who were admitted to R. K. Khan Hospital in Chatsworth, Durban after non-fatal suicide attempts. The <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> and protective factors were conceptualised according to Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) Social Ecology Theory, which facilitated an understanding of the multiple levels of risk and protective factors that mediate NFSB in adolescents. The results of this study highlight the collective influences of individual, familial, cultural and societal factors on adolescents’ decisions to engage in non-fatal suicidal behaviour. A number of clear priorities for prevention programmes emerged from the results of this study. As such, recommendations were made to facilitate prevention and intervention programmes at a site, familial, peer and community level...|$|E
40|$|Many {{contractors}} {{are of the}} opinion that adding contingency funds to the tender price of a project may lead to loss of the tender. This research is a trial {{to put an end to}} this incorrect opinion. A more mature attitude to risk would recognize that contingency exists to be spent in order to avoid or minimize threats and to exploit or maximize opportunities. This research proposes an approach for determination and monitoring of Cost Contingency Reserve (CCR) for a project. Control of CCR is interfaced with Earned Value Management. Application to a real project is carried out. Post-mitigation simulations show that value of CCR is 2. 88 % of project cost but there is a potential saving due to opportunities. The project is monitored after eight months from its assumed start date with one assumed <b>emergent</b> <b>risk.</b> The final results are as follows: CCR is enough to cover project current and residual threats and the contractor has a considerable amount of money that will be transferred to his margin at project closure assuming the project will not be exposed to additional emergent risks. A contractor can balance project upside risks and its downsides to increase his chance to win tender of the project...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{correction}} of cardiovascular risk factors is {{a mainstay of}} the treatment of patients that have developed or might develop cardiovascular disease. In addition to classical risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and sedentary life, epidemiological research has {{identified a number of}} additional conditions that are associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. In fact, a substantial percentage of patients who develop cardiovascular events do not have any of the classical risk factors. Over the past thirty years, effective intervention in the treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes has reduced remarkably cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the incidence of coronary artery disease and stroke remains unacceptably high and cardiovascular diseases are still {{the leading cause of death}} in the Western world. New cardiovascular risk factors are likely to give substantial contribution to this scenario and it could be easily anticipated that this contribution will become more evident in the upcoming years. This is why physicians who operate in the field of cardiovascular medicine and deal with problems related to cardiovascular prevention should be aware of these <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> factors, evaluate them accurately in their patients, and treat them appropriately.

Decision makers involved with projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline in North America, the Belo Monte Dam in Brazil, and the Bujagali Dam in Uganda {{have been forced to}} substantially change their plans as a result of opposition. This study looks at such emergent dynamics to provide a quantitative assessment of risks associated with social sustainability in infrastructure development. An interactional model is proposed to analyze <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> in a complex system of systems and it is applied to <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> in infrastructure development. The analysis is based on the game-theoretic equilibria for an interaction between two actors, namely, the developer and the opposition.

40|$|Construction work {{in oil and}} gas {{projects}} is both challenging and hazardous. The occupational hazards are often associated with fatigue and stress, and an accident is one possible outcome. The purpose of the two-part {{study was to identify}} the new and emergent risks within the top 10 ranked risks and to evaluate their contribution to accidents. Three hundred and twenty stakeholders, from four oil and gas construction projects in mainland China participated in the survey questionnaire. Fifteen workers, who have experienced actual fatigue-related accidents, were also interviewed. All of the stakeholders unanimously ranked fatigue as the most critical risk perceived to cause accidents with emotional disturbance, the <b>emergent</b> <b>risk.</b> This {{is the first time that}} fatigue has been identified as the leading accident risk in the construction industry. It was further reported as a trigger risk to a bundle of other synergetic risks. The new discovery confirms the need to consider fatigue as a complex multidimensional phenomenon and the lynchpin to reducing accidents. These findings have created new responses to the problem of accident causation and alternative views to accident mitigation. The discoveries will open new opportunities for future research in the areas of fatigue and stress risk management in construction.

40|$|Background: Metabolic Syndrome (MS) {{is defined}} as a set of {{cardiovascular}} risk factors related to visceral obesity and insulin resistance that lead to an increase in general mortality, especially cardiovascular. The inflammatory markers are considered <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> factors and can be potentially used in the clinical stratification of cardiovascular diseases, establishing prognostic values. Objective: This study aims at evaluating which components of the MS present an increase of IL- 6 and hs-CRP, identifying the marker that better expresses the degree of inflammation and which isolate component presents a higher degree of interference on the studied inflammatory markers, in order to identify other important risk factors when determining arterial inflammation. Methods: A total of 87 hypertensive, diabetic and dyslipidemic patients were selected, aged 26 to 85 years, who met the necessary criteria for the positive diagnosis of MS. The patients were assessed through 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and underwent hs-CRP and IL- 6 measurements, among other metabolic variables. Results: The patients that presented CRP> 0. 3 mg/dL showed a significant correlation (P 102 / 88 cm in 83. 7 %, glycemia> 110 mg/dL in 88 % and BMI> 30 kg/m 2 in 60. 5 % of the studied individuals.

40|$|Background: Vascular {{calcification}} (VC), {{in which}} vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo a phenotypic transformation into osteoblast-like cells, {{is one of}} the <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for the accelerated atherosclerosis process characteristic of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Phosphate is an important regulator of VC. Methods: The expression of different smooth muscle cell or osteogenesis markers in response to high concentrations of phosphate or exogenous bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2) was examined by qRT-PCR and western blotting in rat VSMCs. Osteocalcin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay. Differentiation and calcification of VSMCs were examined by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and Alizarin staining. Short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of β-catenin was performed to examine the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in VSMC calcification and osteoblastic differentiation induced by high phosphate or BMP- 2. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay and immunofluorescence imaging. Results: BMP- 2 serum levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in controls. High phosphate concentrations and BMP- 2 induced VSMC apoptosis and upregulated the expression of β-catenin, Msx 2, Runx 2 and the phosphate cotransporter Pit 1, whereas a BMP- 2 neutralization antibody reversed these effects. Knockdown of β-catenin abolished the effect of high phosphate and BMP- 2 on VSMC apoptosis and calcification. Conclusions: BMP- 2 plays a crucial role in calcium deposition in VSMCs and VC in CKD patients via a mechanism involving the Wnt/β-catenin pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} {{trend of}} construction projects is increasing, not only technologically but on several other fronts, {{such as the}} institutional diversity of the actors and the coupling of their interactions. As {{a result of this}} increase in complexity, projects frequently face the dynamics attributed to emerging actors, coalitions, contextual properties, or synergies. Reflecting this trend within the project governance framework provides {{a better understanding of the}} <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> that arise in the form of conflicts, project renegotiations, extreme modifications, or write-offs from projects. The aim of this study is to propose interactional analysis (IA) as a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) methodology to analyse and govern the <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> associated with the interactions in a system of systems (SoS), such as complex construction projects. Therefore, interactions are framed as the coupling of actors, and their associated emergent dynamics are quantified based on the equilibria of the interaction. Risk mitigation policies are then developed and analysed based on the associated interactional elements and mathematical functions. Policymakers can apply the methodology to develop policies and gauge their effectiveness in governance of the emergent dynamics within interactional contexts to overcome the challenges associated with infrastructure development...|$|R

Diets and dietary patterns are a major environmental factor that we are exposed to several times a day. People can learn how to control this behavior in order to promote healthy living and aging, and to prevent diet-related diseases. To date, the traditional Mediterranean diet has been the only well-studied pattern. Stroke incidence, a number of classical risk factors including lipid profile and glycaemia, <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> factors such as the length of telomeres, and emotional eating behavior can be affected by genetic predisposition. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet could exert beneficial effects on these risk factors.

In the present work, we review the results of nutritional genomics explaining the role of the Mediterranean diet in human cardiovascular disease.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{becoming}} a teacher integrates and distils past and social experiences, and episodes in life that result in a cumulative history. This history can shape the identity of student, teacher and preservice teacher to ultimately {{become part of the}} broader context of education. Increasingly, we see students entering the teaching profession from diverse backgrounds that include a cross-section of vocational, cultural and international contexts and circumstances. This is largely representative of today’s mobilized  communities that have been shaped and defined by a globalized marketplace. In this article I discuss issues of identity of preservice teachers in light of trending  globalization, and the increasing imperative for teachers to be reflexive practitioners. Using Ulrich Beck’s theory of reflexive modernization provides a framework that can link these  preservice teacher identities with globalization, modernization and <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> societies. In identifying risk societies as a deterioration of previously valued  social norms, Beck suggests that individuals and risk societies are enmeshed together. Ironically, these evolving societies must still provide for the needs of its individuals, who, in turn exercise increasing choice in their future. Maintaining identity in these uncertain environments can collide with overall wellbeing.   For the preservice teacher an erosion of identity can exaggerate feelings of disempowerment and discomfort. Overcoming this is largely dependent on the preservice teacher’s efficacy, reflexive practices, and a capacity to continue...|$|E

Method: Between May 2000 and October 2002, 18, 607 admissions were administered the computerized version of the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument Version 2 (MAYSI- 2) 24 to 48 hours after their arrival at detention centers throughout Pennsylvania. Results: Approximately 70 % of the males and 81 % of the females scored above the clinical cutoff {{on at least one}} of the following five MAYSI- 2 scales: Alcohol/Drug Use, Angry-Irritable, Depressed-Anxious, Somatic Complaints, and/or Suicide Ideation. Girls were more likely than boys to exhibit internalizing as well as exter-nalizing problems. Mental health problems were most prevalent among white youths and least prevalent among African American youths. When youths repeated the screen upon subsequent visits to detention, their scores generally re-mained stable. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the MAYSI- 2 is a promising triage tool for <b>emergent</b> <b>risk.</b> The use of such a screen may reduce bias in allocation of treatment resources and improves our understanding of the nature of mental health problems in delinquent populations.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> and {{resilience}} strategies being adopted by non-profit housing associations faced with uncertainties as a result of public funding austerity and the implications of welfare reform. Design/methodology/approach – The study draws on an evidence review of the impacts of welfare reform on social housing conducted for the Scottish Government and on analysis of annual reports, circulars and other grey literature, including risk registers produced by a range of housing providers in Scotland. Findings – In some associations, exposure to new risks is generating fresh thinking about effectiveness and performance measurement, and is also stimulating the development of new strategies and activities aimed at creating a more resilient business model. Practical implications – Managers of non-profit housing providers need to focus on both risk and resilience if they are to successfully combine conventional business accountability with their obligations to tenants and the local communities their organisations serve. Social implications – Housing associations are a key gatekeeper protecting and supporting vulnerable tenants and disadvantaged communities from the impacts of austerity and welfare reform. It is essential that as organisations they effectively manage risk and develop resilient principles that allow them to continue as ongoing concerns into the long term. Originality/value – The paper asks challenging questions about the link between the purpose or mission of an organisation and its conceptualisation of risk, arguing that resilience is a vital consideration alongside risk for non-profit organisations with a social mission...|$|E
40|$|Household air {{pollution}} {{is a leading}} cause of disability-adjusted life years in Southeast Asia and the third leading cause of disability-adjusted life years globally. There are at least sixty sources of household {{air pollution}}, and these vary from country to country. Indoor tobacco smoking, construction material used in building houses, fuel used for cooking, heating and lighting, use of incense and various forms of mosquito repellents, use of pesticides and chemicals used for cleaning at home, and use of artificial fragrances are some of the various sources that contribute to household air pollution. Household air pollution affects all stages of life with multi-systemic health effects, and its effects are evident right from pre-conception to old age. In utero exposure to household air pollutants has been shown to have health effects which resonate over the entire lifetime. Exposures to indoor air pollutants in early childhood also tend to have repercussions throughout life. The respiratory system bears the maximum brunt, but effects on the cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and nervous system are largely underplayed. Household air pollutants have also been implicated in the development of various types of cancers. Identifying household air pollutants and their health implications helps us prepare for various health-related issues. However, the real challenge is adopting changes to reduce the health effects of household air pollution and designing innovative interventions to minimize the risk of further exposure.

Processed animal products (PAPs) have been re-authorized as novel high quality protein ingredients in 2013. These PAPs may harbor undesirable substances such as pharmaceuticals and metabolites {{which are not}} previously associated with salmon farming, but might cause a potential risk for feed and food safety. To control these contaminants, an analytical strategy based on a generic extraction followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) using quadrupole time-of-flight mass analyzer (QTOF MS) was applied for wide scope screening. Quality control samples, consisting of PAP commodities spiked at 0. 02, 0. 1 and 0. 2 mg/kg with 150 analytes, were injected in every sample batch to verify the overall method performance. The methodology was applied to 19 commercially available PAP samples from six different types of matrices from the EU animal rendering industry.

Surveillance functionalities are embedded {{in the design of}} these technologies to allow constant monitoring, preparedness and prevention. Yet surveillance-orientated security technologies, such as smart CCTVs or Deep Packet Inspection, bring along with their implementation other risks, such as risks of privacy infringement, discrimination, misuse, abuse, or errors, which have often triggered public outrage and resistance.

40|$|Accidents are {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} to be a systems phenomenon. As {{part of a}} proactive approach to safety management, organisations use risk assessment methods to identify the hazards and associated risks {{that may lead to}} accidents. Although there is an extensive body of literature on the need for a systems thinking approach in accident analysis, little has been said regarding the theoretical underpinnings of risk assessment methods. The aim of this paper was to systematically review the risk assessment methods presented in the literature and evaluate {{the extent to which they}} are underpinned by a systems thinking approach. A total of 342 methods spanning a range of safety-critical domains were evaluated using Rasmussen’s tenets of accident causation. A key finding is that the majority of existing risk assessment methods are not consistent with Rasmussen’s model of accident causation (arguably the most popular model in safety science circles). Instead, the majority of risk assessment methods focus on risks at the so called sharp-end and largely view accidents as emerging from a linear, or chain-of-events process. This overlooks <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> at other levels of the system, including supervisory, managerial, regulatory and government levels. The findings therefore suggest that the majority of existing risk assessment methods may be inadequate for identifying hazards and analysing risks within complex sociotechnical systems. The implications for risk assessment practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{cities are}} being redefined daily based on social, {{political}} and environmental factors. This creates substantial challenges {{for those that}} attempt to develop resilience strategies for cities. Resilience planning requires a set of assumptions often based on data; however, the dynamic nature of our growing urban environments has impeded our ability to rely on these suppositions. To account for the unpredictable {{ebb and flow of}} changes in our cities we have become heavily dependent on data modeling and analytics. The ability to collect and store data from a variety of systems in a cloud infrastructure has enabled the potential for resilience planning to be based on historical scenarios and societal context – prioritizing risks and issues based on multiple factors. As our infrastructure becomes “smarter” with the ability to capture more data and make decisions through machine learning algorithms, resilience plans may become less in touch with the citizens for whom the resilience strategies exist. Thusly, an <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> to the inhabitants of cities is the imbalance of qualitative versus quantitative feedback that is leveraged to develop and improve a city's resilience strategy. Cities are living organisms that cannot be purely defined through machine data. A modern way to establish policies and plans for major urban centers is to leverage machine data collected through various “smart” technology programs. Such data-aggregation mechanisms feed into analytics tools that often fail to account for historical context or citizens’ perspectives. Without leveraging this information, a resilience plan cannot be complete as it will not address the city as a system, but only a component thereof. This paper proposes a new model for developing a city's comprehensive resilience strategy that integrates machine data, historical context and societal effects. The risk of not pursuing a three-pronged model would be that future resilience strategies would lack a human-centric approach...|$|E
40|$|Understanding complex social-ecological systems, and anticipating {{how they}} may respond to rapid change, {{requires}} {{an approach that}} incorporates environmental, social, economic, and policy factors, usually {{in a context of}} fragmented data availability. We employed fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) to integrate these factors in the assessment of future wildfire risk in the Chiquitania region, Bolivia. In this region, dealing with wildfires is becoming increasingly challenging because of reinforcing feedbacks between multiple drivers. We conducted semistructured interviews and constructed different FCMs in focus groups to understand the regional dynamics of wildfire from diverse perspectives. We used FCM modelling to evaluate possible adaptation scenarios in the context of future drier climatic conditions. Scenarios also considered possible failure to respond in time to the <b>emergent</b> <b>risk.</b> This approach proved of great potential to support decision making for risk management. It helped identify key forcing variables and generate insights into potential risks and trade-offs of different strategies. The "Hands-off" scenario resulted in amplified impacts driven by intensifying trends, affecting particularly the agricultural production under drought conditions. The "Fire management" scenario, which adopted a bottom-up approach to improve controlled burning, showed less trade-offs between wildfire risk reduction and production compared with the "Fire suppression" scenario. Findings highlighted the importance of considering strategies that involve all actors who use fire, and the need to nest these strategies for a more systemic approach to manage wildfire risk. The FCM model {{could be used as a}} decision-support tool and serve as a "boundary object" to facilitate collaboration and integration of different perceptions of fire in the region. This approach also has the potential to inform decisions in other dynamic frontier landscapes around the world that are facing increased risk of large wildfires...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: During the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), {{patients}} with {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus who received intensive glucose therapy had a lower risk of microvascular complications than did those receiving conventional dietary therapy. We conducted post-trial monitoring to determine whether this improved glucose control persisted and whether such therapy had a long-term effect on macrovascular outcomes. METHODS: Of 5102 {{patients with}} newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 4209 {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either conventional therapy (dietary restriction) or intensive therapy (either sulfonylurea or insulin or, in overweight patients, metformin) for glucose control. In post-trial monitoring, 3277 patients were asked to attend annual UKPDS clinics for 5 years, but no attempts were made to maintain their previously assigned therapies. Annual questionnaires were used to follow patients who were unable to attend the clinics, and all patients in years 6 to 10 were assessed through questionnaires. We examined seven prespecified aggregate clinical outcomes from the UKPDS on an intention-to-treat basis, according to previous randomization categories. RESULTS: Between-group differences in glycated hemoglobin levels were lost after the first year. In the sulfonylurea-insulin group, relative reductions in risk persisted at 10 years for any diabetes-related end point (9 %, P= 0. 04) and microvascular disease (24 %, P= 0. 001), and risk reductions for myocardial infarction (15 %, P= 0. 01) and death from any cause (13 %, P= 0. 007) emerged over time, as more events occurred. In the metformin group, significant risk reductions persisted for any diabetes-related end point (21 %, P= 0. 01), myocardial infarction (33 %, P= 0. 005), and death from any cause (27 %, P= 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Despite an early loss of glycemic differences, a continued reduction in microvascular risk and <b>emergent</b> <b>risk</b> reductions for myocardial infarction and death from any cause were observed during 10 years of post-trial follow-up. A continued benefit after metformin therapy was evident among overweight patients. (UKPDS 80; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN 75451837. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>emergent</b> security <b>risk</b> that information warfare poses to critical infrastructure systems, particularly as governments are increasingly concerned with protecting these assets against attack or disruption. Initially it outlines critical infrastructure {{systems and the}} notion of information warfare. It then discusses the potential implications and examining the concerns and vulnerabilities such cyber attacks would pose, utilising exemplar online attack occurrences. It then {{examines the}} current Australian situation before suggesting some considerations to mitigate the potential risk that information warfare poses to critical infrastructure systems, and by association: government, industry and the wider community. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{in health}} {{information}} exchange (HIE), {{defined as the}} use of information technology to support the electronic transfer of clinical information across health care organizations, continues to grow among those pursuing greater patient safety and health care accessibility and efficiency. In this paper, we present the results of a longitudinal multiple-case study of two large-scale HIE implementation projects carried out in real time over 3 -year and 2 -year periods in Québec, Canada. Data were primarily collected through semi-structured interviews (nÂ =Â  52) with key informants, namely implementation team members and targeted users. These were supplemented with non-participants observation of team meetings and by the analysis of organizational documents. The cross-case comparison was particularly relevant given that project circumstances led to contrasting outcomes: while one project failed, the other was a success. A risk management analysis was performed taking a process view in order to capture the complexity of project implementations as evolving phenomena that are affected by interdependent pre-existing and <b>emergent</b> <b>risks</b> that tend to change over time. The longitudinal case analysis clearly demonstrates that the risk factors were closely intertwined. Systematic ripple effects from one risk factor to another were observed. This risk interdependence evolved dynamically over time, with a snowball effect that rendered a change of path progressively more difficult as time passed. The results of the cross-case analysis demonstrate a direct relationship between the quality of an implementation strategy and project outcomes.

40|$|In {{the last}} five years, the US has {{experienced}} {{a significant number of}} unprecedented events, many of which will have long-term impact on its business environment. Given this fact and the rapid pace of change in the world today, there is a new imperative for understanding and managing these complex dynamics and associated <b>emergent</b> <b>risks.</b> This dissertation, therefore, focused on analyzing {{the current state of the}} US business environment; the analysis creates a basis for further examination of the various aspects of the studied problems. The author undertook a comprehensive environmental scan, using a broad set of information resources, in order to look at its present status and the factors affecting it as well as the perceived level of risk. During this process, the author also attempted to verify whether the current method of PEST analysis is still a relevant and useful tool given today's complex, intertwined and quickly evolving global business environment. The first chapter is devoted to the theoretical background of information seeking and environmental analysis as well as classifying international business risks. Chapter two takes a broad look at the US macro economy, including the following areas: Political, Legal, Economic, Socio-Cultural and Technological. Chapter three is a business application, and the bulk of its content is devoted to the specifics of the current US business environment; the perceived risks affecting it are also investigated. Final conclusions are drawn based on the research conducted...|$|R
