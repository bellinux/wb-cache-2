Based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density, partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E

5|$|The adult russet sparrow <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> seed-eater, {{eating the}} seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, {{such as those of}} the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E
5|$|On the Rochester end, NY33 {{primarily}} {{serves as}} a paralleling local route to Interstate490 (I-490), of less importance to the area's traffic patterns. Between the two cities, it <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> rural two-lane highway. The largest location on this stretch is the Genesee County city of Batavia, where NY33 reconnects to NY5 and crosses NY63 and NY98, two regionally important north–south highways. NY33 overlaps with all three routes {{at one point or}} another as it traverses Batavia. A southerly alternate route, designated NY33A, leaves NY33 northeast of Batavia in Bergen and rejoins its parent in Rochester.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> dipole, with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.|$|E

5|$|The line {{starts at}} an {{interlocking}} north of Jay Street–MetroTech, where Culver Line trains can access the IND Sixth Avenue Line or IND Eighth Avenue Line, south to Church Avenue in Kensington, the line <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> four-track subway, though it rises {{to cross over}} the Gowanus Canal on the only above-ground structure on the original Independent Subway System. In Kensington, a ramp allows the line to rise onto a three-track elevated structure built by the City for operation by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company {{as part of the}} Dual Contracts. When this ramp was opened in 1954, the older route from Kensington northwest to Sunset Park remained as the Culver Shuttle until it was closed in 1975. The final portion of the line in Coney Island is on the lower level of a double-decked elevated structure, with the BMT Brighton Line above.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is centred on the Storkyrkan church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged {{over the following}} centuries. In 1468–1496, {{during the reign of}} Sten Sture the Elder, its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building. The building in the painting depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present in the painting, which seem to confirm that the 17th century copy was faithful to the original. The church still exists, although the present exterior <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> later Baroque design.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{breeding}} male <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> deep shade of chestnut in colour with black colouration on the face, wings, and tail. The breeding male {{is not easily}} confused with any other birds except the chestnut weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of {{the breeding}} plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones {{on the cutting edge of}} the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E

5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|As a place name, Trafford is an Anglo-French {{version of}} Stratford, {{deriving}} from the Old English words stræt (a street, more specifically a Roman road) and ford (a river crossing). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since 1974, but the area it covers {{has a long}} history. Neolithic arrowheads have been discovered in Altrincham and Sale, and {{there is evidence of}} Bronze Age habitation in Timperley. Fragments of Roman pottery have been found in Urmston, and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman road between the legionary fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum) crosses Trafford, passing through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The settlements in Trafford have been based largely around agriculture, although Altrincham was founded as a market town in the mid 13th century. Although the Industrial Revolution affected Trafford, the area did not experience the same rate of growth as the rest of Greater Manchester. A 100% increase in population in the Trafford area between 1841 and 1861 was a direct result of an influx due to the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, which allowed residents to more easily commute from Trafford into Manchester. The area developed its own centres of industry in Broadheath (founded in 1885) and Trafford Park (founded in 1897). They have since declined, although Trafford Park still employs 40–50,000 people. Today, Trafford <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> commuter area. The borough was formed on 1April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as one of the ten metropolitan districts of Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E

5|$|Moscovium is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons. Moscovium would be quite a reactive metal, with a standard reduction potential of −1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E
