5000|$|After {{nationalisation}} in 1948 the GEML formed {{part of the}} Eastern Region of British Railways. The British Railways 1955 Modernisation Plan {{called for}} overhead line systems in Great Britain to be standardised at 25 kV AC. However, due to low clearances under bridges the route was electrified at 6.25 kV AC. The section between Liverpool Street and [...] was completed in November 1960. Extensive testing showed that smaller <b>electrical</b> <b>clearances</b> could be tolerated for the 25 kV system than originally thought necessary. As a result, it was now possible to increase the voltage without having to either raise bridges or lower the tracks along the route to obtain larger clearances. The route between Liverpool Street and Southend Victoria was converted to 25 kV AC between 1976 and 1980. Electrification was extended to Colchester in the late 1950s and finally to [...] by 1986.|$|R
40|$|Disasters to {{transmission}} lines due to wet snow events motivate researchers {{to carry out}} advanced dynamic analysis {{in order to understand}} and predict the line transient response to complex dynamic loads. The interest of numerical modeling of the effects of snow shedding phenomena is to check whether the amplitude of the induced motion is within the design limits of <b>electrical</b> <b>clearances</b> with the ground or with other conductors. This paper aims to develop a numerical model to consider wet snow adhesion on transmission line cables, and consequently, to predict snow shedding from cables due to dynamic effects. The finite element analysis software ADINA is used to simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of a snow-covered cable to the application of periodic loads and subsequent effects of snow shedding. Comparison of model results and small scale experimental simulations is used to validate the model. The model predicts cable rebound height following the application of different periodic loads as well as different snow shedding scenarios. It is found that for highest adhesion, snow sheds only at high excitation frequencies, whereas the inverse occurs for low adhesion. Cohesion force between the snow particles is greater than its adhesion strength to the cable. For large snow thickness, it is rather difficult to obtain snow shedding comparing to the small thickness...|$|R
40|$|There {{are no good}} {{arguments}} {{to apply for a}} derogatory "IT" (Isolé/Terre) earthing scheme for the Preshower, and thus, an appropriate earthing of on-detector active parts is discussed. Complication comes from the absence of a strong DC link between the modules' grounds and the structure, and the safety tying must be obstructed. Fortunately, the bias system is the only Low Voltage supplying system, the other powering is Extra-Low Voltage. The bias supplies have a (very) limited maximum current, and the proposed obstructed tying can even deal with the most extreme type of insulation fault. (Initial <b>electrical</b> safety <b>clearance</b> was based upon elements from this Note. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} various design {{aspects of}} a 280 MW Power System for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), a 50 km long electrons-positrons accelerator, under feasibility evaluation. The key requirements are a very high accelerator availability and constant power flow from the utility grid, considering the pulsed power nature of CLIC. Firstly, the possible power network and cabling layouts are discussed along with potential difficulties on <b>electrical</b> fault <b>clearance.</b> Following, the use of active front-end converters is examined {{as a means to}} control the power flow and power quality seen by the 400 kV grid. In particular a modular multilevel converter preliminary configuration is described and the compromises related to energy storage and voltage level are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{considerable}} {{extension of}} Italy’s electricity supply network creates {{a great number}} of intersections between overhead power lines and other features such as roads, railway lines, ropeways, canals and rivers. In Italy, the law rules on the installation of overhead lines 1 also deal with such cases (termed “crossings”) and, depending upon the rated voltage, define a number of mandatory installation criteria, <b>electrical</b> <b>clearances,</b> mechanical checks and calculations (for the conductors, insulator strings and towers) in order to achieve adequate reliability relative to specific environmental (and especially conservative) situations. With reference to some overhead power line crossings over ropeways, this report presents calculations of current magnitudes in potential short circuits resulting from the accidental fall or lowering of an electric conductor on a wire rope and the experimental procedures followed in order to recreate some short circuit occurrences and verify the subsequent damage to wire rope. This study has been promoted and financed by the Autonomous Province of Trent and the Autonomous Region of Valle d’Aosta, and performed by the University of Padua (Department of Electrical Engineering), which has developed it through the following phases: 1. Hypotheses of possible occurrences 2. Computation of magnitudes and durations of possible short circuit currents 3. Evaluation of fundamental and meaningful parameters to be employed in electrical tests 4. Coordination of electrical tests (tests with strong currents injected into different types of wire ropes carried out by SVEPPI 2 Laboratory) and checks for damage in the form of visual inspection and tensile tests on the wire ropes (performed by LA. T. I. F 3 Technological Laboratory). Even if the hypothesized occurrences have a very low probability (considering the conservative requirements of the abovementioned Rules for the installation of overhead lines), {{the results of the study}} are meaningful since they draw attention to unsuspected phenomena with effects that are undetectable by visual inspection but highly detrimental to ropeway safety...|$|R
40|$|The great {{extension}} of the electric transmission network entails {{a great number of}} intersections of overhead lines with other works e. g. streets, railway lines, ropeways, canals and rivers. In Italy, the law rules for installation of overhead lines regard also such cases (termed as "crossings") and compel (depending upon the rated voltage) a sum of installation criteria, <b>electrical</b> <b>clearances,</b> calculations of mechanical checks (for the conductors, the insulator strings and the towers) in order to achieve a suitable reliability in relation to detailed environmental situations particularly conservative. This paper, with relation to the "overpassings" of some electric overhead lines upon ropeways, reports the computations of the current magnitudes of a possible short circuit due to the accidental falling or lowering of an electric conductor upon a wire rope and with the experimental procedures performed in order to both re-create the short circuit occurrences and verify the subsequent damages on wire rope. This study has been promoted and financed by the Autonomous Province of Trento and the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, and entrusted to the University of Padova (Department of Electrical Engineering) which has developed it through the following phases: 1. 	Hypotheses of possible occurrences; 2. 	Calculation of magnitudes and durations of possible short circuit currents; 3. 	Evaluation of fundamental and meaningful parameters to adopt in the electrical tests; 4. 	Coordination of electrical tests (tests with strong currents injected into different types of wire ropes, carried out by SVEPPI Laboratory) and of the damage checks by means of sight inspections and tensile tests on the wire ropes (carried out by LA.

40|$|Skid steer loaders {{are useful}} but {{dangerous}} pieces of equipment. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) found {{a number of}} fatalities associated with skid steer loader use, most often attributable to: • Working or standing under a raised loader bucket • Leaning out of the operator’s compartment {{into the path of}} the moving lift arms • Improper entering or exiting • Rollovers To reduce the potential for the above types of accidents, the following safety features are critical: liftarm supports, interlocked controls, seat belts, rollover protective structures (ROPS), and side screens. Equipment that lacks the above operable safety features is not appropriate for use by UNL employees. General Safety • Operators should be trained by a knowledgeable person prior to operating a skid steer loader. This should include reading/understanding the owner’s manual, operational safety, and demonstration of safe operation under anticipated conditions (e. g., terrain, load, etc.). • Never by-pass or disable the safety devices. • Before operating, clear the work area of by-standers and acquaint yourself with surrounding hazards (e. g., <b>electrical</b> lines, low <b>clearance,</b> uneven terrain, ramp edges, etc.). • Consult EHS to determine if hearing protective devices are warranted while operating the equipment...|$|R
