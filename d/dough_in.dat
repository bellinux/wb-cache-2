5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce <b>dough</b> <b>in</b> only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
5|$|Bourekas are savory {{pastries}} {{brought to}} Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They {{are made of}} a flaky <b>dough</b> <b>in</b> a variety of shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, spinach, potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, {{as well as being}} prepared by home cooks. They are often served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E

40|$|The {{replacement}} of gluten <b>in</b> <b>dough</b> products poses a major challenge. Preparing zein <b>doughs</b> <b>in</b> dilute acetic acid and lactic acid, such as produced during sourdough fermentation, was investigated. Increasing acid concentrations (0. 7, 1. 3 and 5. 4 % [v/v]) increased zein extensibility {{and reduced the}} stress and related parameters. Preparation of zein-maize starch/- rice <b>doughs</b> <b>in</b> dilute organic acids improved dough properties {{to the extent that}} the doughs could hold air and be inflated into a bubble by Alveography. Further, they exhibited similar Stability (P), Distensibility and deformation energy (W) to wheat flour dough. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed an ordered linear fibril network in zein and zein-rice flour <b>doughs</b> prepared <b>in</b> the dilute acids, which became uniform with increasing acid concentration. SDS-PAGE showed that the acids did not hydrolyse or polymerise the zein. FTIR indicated that the acidic conditions slightly increased the proportion of α-helical conformation <b>in</b> the zein <b>doughs,</b> possibly as a result of deamination. This conformational change may be responsible for the considerably improved zein dough properties. Zein <b>doughs</b> prepared <b>in</b> dilute organic acids show potential as a gluten replacement in gluten-free formulations. [URL]...|$|R

25|$|A {{biscuit cutter}} {{a tool to}} cut out a biscuit from bread <b>dough</b> <b>in</b> a {{particular}} shape before they are put into an oven to bake. On May 11, 1875, Alexander P. Ashbourne filed the first patent for the biscuit cutter that consisted of a board to roll the biscuits out on and hinged to a metal plate with various biscuit cutter shapes mounted to it. It was later issued on November 30, 1875.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} types and shapes of dies to form various shapes of pasta. Generally, pastas are categorized into two large groups: long pasta (like spaghetti, fettuccine, linguine and etc.) and short pasta (like elbow-shaped macaroni, penne, shells and etc.). Circular dies with rotating blades underneath them {{are used for}} short products, where long rectangular dies form the long products. The dies are made of Teflon-coated bronze. The extruder pushes the dough through the dies and blades or trimmers cut the <b>dough</b> <b>in</b> the desired length.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{recipe for}} Gibanica included traditionally homemade phyllo dough and cow's milk cheese. Homemade cheese can be feta or sirene. The pie is usually made as [...] "Gužvara" [...] (Crumpled pie), so the phyllo <b>dough</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle is}} crumpled and filled. Besides cheese, the fill contains eggs, milk, kaymak, lard, salt and water. Also, stuffing may include spinach, meat, nettle, potato and onion. In order to speed up preparation, phyllo dough from a store can be used and sunflower oil or olive oil can be used instead of lard.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} as long as Sarah lived, a cloud (signifying the Divine Presence) hung over her tent. When she died, the cloud disappeared. But when Rebekah came, it returned. As long as Sarah lived, her doors were wide open. At her death that liberality ceased. But when Rebekah came, that openhandedness returned. As long as Sarah lived, there was a blessing on her dough, and the lamp used to burn from the evening of the Sabbath until the evening of the {{following}} Sabbath. When she died, these ceased. But when Rebekah came, they returned.
