500|$|In late July 1843 Balzac {{visited her}} in St. Petersburg, {{the first time}} they had seen one another in eight years. He was struck by Hańska's {{resilient}} beauty, but his condition had deteriorated over the years. Biographers agree that she was much less physically attracted to him at this time. Still they renewed their vows of love and planned to marry as soon as she won her lawsuit. In early October he returned to Paris. Soon afterwards, she wrote a story based on her own experience writing to Balzac for the first time. Unhappy with it, she threw it into the fire, but the French author begged her to rewrite it so he could adapt it. He assured her that she would [...] "know something of the joys of authorship when you see <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> elegant and delightful writing I have preserved". Her story became Modeste Mignon, Balzac's 1844 novel about a young woman who writes to her favorite poet.|$|E

[...] He also said in a radio {{interview}} [...] "If it's not in the Constitution, I won't smile". He later explained [...] "I don't consider politicians who smile to be worth {{a heck of a}} lot... all things considered, it doesn't make a dime's worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork". Barr said in 2010 [...] "I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact {{is that this is a}} corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own". Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about [...] "cult hairstyles", saying [...] "I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me".|$|E

40|$|Do {{you want}} to get {{involved}} in reforming foreign and second language education? What does it takes to foster the quality of language learning? What would be your role as a student, teacher, or administrator in such a change? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> modification <b>of</b> <b>your</b> understanding about the professional field is needed in order to ensure your success as a learner and/or educator? In light of the New Visions in Action initiative, teachers, researchers, administrators, and policy makers from North America and Europe discuss ways of connecting (trans-) national reform and individual classroom practice. Through their work, they demonstrate the many advantages of international collaboration for reaching national agendas and personal goals at the same time. Since the specific approach of this publication calls for an active reader, you will take the first step toward personal involvement in redefining how we teach and learn languages by picking up this book...|$|R
40|$|Scholars and {{scientists}} do research {{to create new}} knowledge so that other scholars {{and scientists}} {{can use it to}} create still more new knowledge and to apply it to improving people’s lives. They are paid to do research, but not to report their research: that they do for free, because it is not royalty-revenue from their research papers but their “research impact ” that pays their salaries, funds their further research, earns them prestige and prizes, etc. “Research impact ” means <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a contribution <b>your</b> research makes to further research: do other researchers read, use, cite, and apply your findings? The more they do, the higher your research impact. One way to measure this is by counting how many researchers use and cite your work in their own research papers. Well, it should b e obvious that since research papers are rather like advertisements – they bring rewards the more they are read and used – and since researchers give them away, then any barriers that deny access to potential users of this 1 give-away research are a bad thing – for research, researchers, and the society that fund...|$|R

40|$|As {{you read}} this {{sentence}} you will experimentally demonstrate the general gas law at least once by breathing in and out. As you expand the volume in your lungs, the pressure drops and air comes in; as you decrease the lung volume the pressure rises and air goes out. Pressure (p) and volume (V) are related; at constant temperature, pV = const. This relation, called Boyle 2 ̆ 7 s law, was well established before the atomic theory of matter was accepted. In this module you will learn <b>how</b> to apply <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> knowledge <b>of</b> Newton 2 ̆ 7 s laws, kinetic energy, momentum, and elastic collisions to molecular motion. The {{fact that you can}} derive the macroscopic general gas law from Newtonian mechanics applied to molecules should give you further insight into the remarkable simplification Newton wrought in our understanding of matter. You will show that his laws hold equally well for masses 1027 times smaller and dimensions 1010 times smaller than the blocks and inclined planes we have discussed in previous modules. Newton 2 ̆ 7 s laws work from planetary physics to microphysics, an astronomical range! To be sure, we have overstated the case {{in order to make a}} point. The behavior of an ideal gas is just that, idealized, and real gases only approximately behave this way. At the molecular level the fundamental 2 ̆ 2 graininess 2 ̆ 2 or quantization of momentum and energy as well as matter becomes important so that kinetic theory is also an idealization of nature...|$|R

6000|$|... "Think, by all means," [...] he continued. [...] "Remember that I was {{introduced}} to you, even, {{as one of the}} youngest millionaires. Forgive me if I seem egotistical, but I have a fancy to put things plainly. There is a glamour about wealth. I came to you with that glamour about my name.

6000|$|... "Don't, mamma," [...] Blanche said, with a French shrug of her shoulders; {{and then}} she fell into a rhapsody about the book, about the snatches of poetry {{interspersed}} in it about the two heroines, Leonora and Neaera; about the two heroes, Walter Lorraine and his rival the young Duke--"and what good company you introduce us to," [...] said the young lady archly [...] "quel ton! <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life have you passed at court, and are you a prime minister's son, Mr. Arthur?" ...|$|E

I don't think that in your day you properly understood <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> work {{was due to the}} shifts of what you called the weather. It meant the need of all kinds of special clothes and houses and shelters, a wilderness of work. How dreadful it must have been in your day--wind and storms, great wet masses--what did you call them?--clouds--flying through the air, the ocean full of salt, was it not?--tossed and torn by the wind, snow thrown all over everything, hail, rain--how awful!" ...|$|E

However, I can understand your wanting to accomplish the adventure without my aid; but we must think now what had best be said and done. As the lady belongs to the court, there {{is sure to be}} a fine pother about the matter, and you and all who were there will be examined touching your share of the adventure, and how you came to be upon the spot.

Yes; {{but it is}} not so obvious <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> workmen's time you waste {{annually}} in making them cut glass, after it has got hard, when you ought to make them mould it while it is soft. It is not so obvious how much expense you waste in cutting diamonds and rubies, which are the hardest things you can find, into shapes that mean nothing, when the same men might be cutting sandstone and freestone into shapes that meant something. It is not so obvious how much of the artists' time in Italy you waste, by forcing them to make wretched little pictures for you out of crumbs of stone glued together at enormous cost, when the tenth of the time would make good and noble pictures for you out of water-colour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! noble Damian," [...] said Eveline, [...] "break not {{my heart}} by blaming {{yourself}} for an imprudence which is altogether my own. Thy succour was ever near when I intimated the least want of it; and it imbitters my own misfortune {{to know that}} my rashness has been the cause of your disaster. Answer me, gentle kinsman, and give me to hope that the wounds you have suffered are such as may be cured.-- Alas! <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> blood have I seen spilled, and what a fate is mine, that I should ever bring distress on all for whom I would most willingly sacrifice my own happiness!--But do not let us imbitter the moments given us in mercy, by fruitless repinings-- Try what you can to stop thine ebbing blood, which is so dear to England--to Eveline--and to thine uncle." ...|$|E

6000|$|Well, that is {{the first}} way, then, in which you will employ your intellect well; and the simple {{observance}} of this plain rule of political economy will effect a noble revolution in your architecture, such as you cannot at present so much as conceive. Then the second way in which we are to guard against waste is by setting our men to the easiest, and therefore the quickest, work which will answer the purpose. Marble, for instance, lasts quite as long as granite, and is much softer to work; therefore, when you get hold of a good sculptor, give him marble to carve--not granite. That, you say, is obvious enough. Yes; but it is not so obvious <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> workmen's time you waste annually in making them cut glass, after it has got hard, when you ought to make them mould it while it is soft.

I could go on giving you almost numberless instances of this great commercial mistake; but I should only weary and confuse you. I therefore commend also this head of our subject to your own meditation, and proceed to the last I named--the last I shall task your patience with to-night.
