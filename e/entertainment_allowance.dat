Five years later, the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) recruited Bossard, stationing him at the Embassy in Bonn, West Germany. In Bonn, Bossard had the duty of interviewing scientists, engineers, and technicians, who had left the Soviet Union. MI6 provided Bossard with a large <b>entertainment</b> <b>allowance,</b> which he used to take his interviewees to strip clubs and brothels. At this time, he also took up heavy drinking.|$|E
5000|$|From the 17th century, {{the local}} {{government}} of Leyton was increasingly controlled by the parish vestry, {{particularly with regard to}} the administration of the Poor Laws and levying of the parish rates. Initially only meeting once a year at Easter to elect and appoint parish officers, a second meeting each year was necessary by 1681, a third meeting from 1698 and monthly from 1759. Although the main Easter meeting was held in the parish church [...] room, other meetings were held in pubs or coffee houses, the committee members being entitled to a generous <b>entertainment</b> <b>allowance</b> of 40 shillings twice a year, although this was halved in 1723. Originally the meetings were presided over by the lord of the manor of Ruckholt, until 1695 when the Vicar of Leyton took on that role. A parish clerk is first mentioned in 1623.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Bossard {{returned}} to London {{to work at}} the Ministry of Aviation. Though he no longer possessed his <b>entertainment</b> <b>allowance,</b> Bossard maintained his habits. Soviet agents concluded that he had access to secret documents on guided missiles, had financial issues, and possessed multiple weaknesses of character. Soon after his return to London, Bossard was approached by a man who called himself Gordon. After a few nights in a local bar, Gordon revealed that he was a Soviet agent working at the Embassy and offered Bossard a £250 advance for his agreement to deliver documents to Soviet agents. Bossard was given nine dead drops around the city. He was instructed to listen to Radio Moscow at 7:45 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. on the first Tuesday and Wednesday of each month. One of five popular Russian songs would be played and Bossard was to proceed differently according to which one was broadcast—The Volga Boat Song, for instance, indicated that an operation was to be abandoned. Bossard routinely took classified documents, mostly involving missile systems and radars, from his office, photographed them in his hotel room during his lunch break, using equipment he left in a briefcase in the left luggage office at London Waterloo station, and returned the documents the next day. For every packet of photographs delivered, he received £2,000. Bossard later told authorities that he had received £5,000 in total.|$|E

5000|$|The Parliament of Singapore is {{required}} to provide a civil list {{for the maintenance of}} the President, and it does so by way of the Civil List and Pension Act. For the current fiscal year, the sum under Class I of the list, which includes the President's personal pay ($4,267,500, known by the British term the [...] "privy purse"), an <b>entertainment</b> <b>allowance</b> ($73,000) and an allowance for an Acting President ($4,500), is $4,279,300. The salaries for the President's personal staff (Class II) amount to $4,532,400. Speaking in Parliament on 10 March 2011, the Minister for Finance Tharman Shanmugaratnam explained that the increases in these sums were to cater for the salaries of an additional staff officer to support the work of the Council of Presidential Advisers, and a butler manager; and to meet higher variable staff salary payments due to the nation's strong economic growth. The allowance for the Istana's household expenses (Class III) is $2,068,300. In addition to being used for ceremonies and celebrations, this allowance is used to cover the maintenance of the Istana, vehicles, utilities and other supplies. Class IV expenses for [...] "special services" [...] are $659,300. In previous years, this sum was used to cover various expenses such as the cost of replacing state cars and installing a new document repository. Overall, the current civil list of $11,605,000 represents an increase of about 12% from the sum for the past fiscal year of $10,354,700.|$|E
60|$|The vintner, {{who was a}} very hearty old {{fellow and}} a worthy man, had no {{thoughts}} of going to bed himself, for he had received several threatening warnings from the rioters, and had indeed gone out that evening to try and gather from the conversation of the mob whether his house {{was to be the}} next attacked. He sat all night in an easy-chair in the same room--dozing a little now and then--and received from time to time the reports of John Grueby and two or three other trustworthy persons in his employ, who went out into the streets as scouts; and for whose <b>entertainment</b> an ample <b>allowance</b> of good cheer (which the old vintner, despite his anxiety, now and then attacked himself) was set forth in an adjoining chamber.|$|R

S.Published: October 11, 1935Just {{for a change}} the Little Acme Theatre on Union Square is running a home-made Yiddish talking and singing film instead of an importation from the Soviet Union.Carrying the rather imposing name [...] "Shir Hashirim" [...] (Song of Songs) and done by popular East Side actors, headed by Samuel Goldenberg (who has appeared in English shows on Broadway), the picture belongs to the highly sentimental mixture of tragedy and comedy which still has an appeal for some seekers of <b>entertainment.</b> With due <b>allowance</b> for circumstances, it must be admitted that Mr. Goldenberg is effective as the middle-aged composer striving to resist the charms of a designing young female (Merele Gruber) who furnishes the inspiration for his new opera [...] "Shir Hashirim." [...] Dora Weissman is competent as his faithful, forgiving wife. The younger actors lend efficient support. The honors for intended humor go to Messrs. Dubinsky and Wendorff as the twin grandfathers.[...] [...] the spoken dialogue is accompanied by English titles.SHIR HASHIRIM, a dialogue film in Yiddish, with Samuel Goldenberg, Dora Weissman, Max Kletter, Merele Gruber, Seymour Rechtzeit, Yudel Dubinsky and Ruben Wendorff; music by Joseph Rumshinsky; directed and produced by Henry Lynn.|$|R
