2500|$|In mid-1992 then CMLL booker Antonio Peña {{decided to}} break away from the {{promotion}} and form his own promotion called Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, wanting to produce his own style of wrestling shows that differed from the very conservative way CMLL ran things. Among the people that left CMLL to join AAA were the Reyes brothers, who took the Mexican National Trios title with them, this was made possible by the fact that CMLL did not outright own the championship but were given the rights to book the championship by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission who actually owned all of the Mexican National wrestling championship. The Commission allowed Peña's promotion {{to take control of the}} titles after its creation in 1992. On April 29, 1992, Universo 2000 defeated Máscara Sagrada to win the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship; which, like the Trios title, had been brought to AAA from CMLL. Universo 2000 held the title for four months, losing it to Lizmark on September 18, 1992. Los Hermanos Dinamita held the trios championship until July 1993, when Los Infernales (<b>El</b> Satánico, Pirata <b>Morgan</b> and MS-1) defeated them. Los Hermanos Dinamita regained the championship in late 1993 or very early 1994 by defeating Los Infernales. In early 1994 Los Hermanos Dinamita began a feud with the Rudo (bad guy) trio Los Payasos, a trio of masked [...] "evil clowns" [...] (Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) who underneath the clown costumes were very accomplished wrestlers. The two trios met in a match at Triplemanía II-A on April 24, 1994, where Los Payasos won the Trios title from Los Hermanos Dinamita. A few weeks later, at Triplemanía II-C Los Hermanos Dinamita gained a measure of revenge when they defeated Los Payasos in a Steel Cage Match. One of Universo 2000's last matches in AAA took place at Triplemanía III-C where Los Hermanos Dinamita teamed up with Jerry Estrada and Fishman to defeat Konnan, La Parka, Máscara Sagrada, Latin Lover and Perro Aguayo.|$|R
50|$|Throughout 2009 Los Oficiales {{has been}} {{involved}} in several feuds, especially a very bloody feud with Los Traumas (Trauma I and Trauma II) and Negro Navarro (their father). As well as the father son team of Pirata <b>Morgan,</b> <b>El</b> Hijo de Pirata Morgan and Barba Roja, who have all unsuccessfully challenged Los Oficiales for the Trios title. Los Oficiales continued to defend the IWRG Trios title through 2009 and into 2010 where they as of April 21, 2010 are still the champions, having made at least 9 successful defenses of the title, more than any previous title holder. Their success has also seen them named as the best version of Los Oficiales by far. On March 3, 2011, Los Oficiales lost the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship to Joe Líder, Silver King and Último Gladiador, ending their reign at 886 days. On July 17 the group was joined by Oficial Spartan. On October 9, after costing Los Oficiales a match via disqualification, 911 and Fierro turned on Spartans and kicked him out of the group. Los Oficiales then began feuding with Spartans and the debuting Oficial Rayan, who named their new group Los Oficiales Elite. On December 22, Oficial AK-47 teamed with Trauma I to face Oficial 911 and Trauma II in a Relevos Suicidas match and after losing the match, AK-47 and Trauma I were forced to face each other in a Mask vs. Mask match. Eventually, Trauma I won the match via disqualification, forcing AK-47 to unmask himself. On November 1 at Castillo del Terror, another Oficial, Fierro, lost his mask in a twelve-man steel cage match. On February 7, 2013, Los Oficiales lost the Distrito Federal Trios Championship to El Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Pirata Morgan and Pirata Morgan, Jr. On December 19, Oficial 911 was also forced to unmask, when he and Mosco X-Fly were defeated by Golden Magic and El Hijo de Pirata Morgan in a three-way tag team Lucha de Apuestas. On June 15, 2014, 911 and AK-47 defeated Apolo Estrada, Jr. and El Hijo del Diablo to win the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship.|$|R
5000|$|Following Triplemanía XVI and the Alas de Oro tournament Super Fly became {{involved}} in a long running storyline between AAA loyalists and La Legión Extranjera after turning down an offer to join La Legión. The storyline saw Super Fly team less with his Real Fuerza Aérea team mates and more with the [...] "AAA Loyalist" [...] group such as La Parka, Chessman and Cibernético. At the 2008 Antonio Peña Memorial Show Super Fly along with La Parka, Octagón and Latin Lover represented AAA in a Doma de la Muerte Steel cage elimination match. The team lost to the La Legión team of Electroshock, Konnan, Rellik and Kenzo Suzuki in a match where the possession of the (in storyline terms) urn with founder Antonio Peña's ashes. Following that match Super Fly began focusing mainly on Electroshock instead of the entire La Legion, facing him in a cage match at the 2008 Guerra de Titanes event, the match also included Pirata <b>Morgan,</b> <b>El</b> Brazo, Brazo de Plata and El Elegido. Neither Super Fly nor Electroshock {{were involved in the}} finish that saw El Brazo lose the match. At the 2009 Rey de Reyes Electroshock eliminated Super Fly in the opening round, effectively ending the storyline between the two. After the storyline with Electroshock ended Super Fly returned to teaming regularly with the other members of Real Fuerza Aérea. Signs of dissension between Super Fly and {{the other members of the}} group began to show when Laredo Kid defeated Super Fly in the first round of the AAA Cruiserweight Championship. At Triplemania XVII Super Fly, Laredo Kid and Aero Star lost to Los Psycho Circus (Psycho Clown, Killer Clown and Zombie Clown), during the match Super Fly appeared to be injured by Los Psycho Circus but later on in the night appeared to be fine, leading to further signs that not all was well in Real Fuerza Aérea. Over the summer Super Fly lashed out against his team mates after losing matches, but never fully turned Rudo ("bad guy" [...] or heel) on his team mates. In late 2009 Super Fly and the other members of Real Fuerza Aérea, especially Laredo Kid seemingly settled their issues amicably ending the storyline for the moment.|$|R

On December 28, 1986 he lost the title to a wrestler called [...] "Judas [...] ". In 1988 he changed his ring persona, creating the [...] "Ángel Azteca" [...] (Aztec Angel) character {{that he would be}} most known as for the remainder of his career as he began working full-time for Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; Later they would change names to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL)). Ángel Azteca was teamed up with fellow Tecnico (a good guy character or Face) Atlantis to form a very successful tag team. Together they won the Mexican National Tag Team Championship on March 6, 1988 from the team of Los Infernales (Masakre and MS-1). Over the next 811 days Azteca and Atlantis defended the tag team titles against such teams as Hombre Bala and Pirata <b>Morgan,</b> <b>El</b> Dandy and El Texano and Pierroth, Jr. and Ulisses. On February 26, 1989 Ángel Azteca became a double champion when he defeated Bestia Salvaje for the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. Two months later Azteca vacated the Mexican National Welterweight Championship when he defeated Emilio Charles, Jr. to win the NWA World Middleweight Championship, moving up to the Middleweight division. Azteca would make several successful defenses against the former champion as well as El Hijo del Gladiador. On May 25, 1990 Atlantis and Ángel Azteca were finally beaten for the Mexican Tag title by Pierroth, Jr. and Bestia Salvaje. A couple of months later El Dandy won the NWA World Middleweight Championship from Ángel Azteca. the loss of the Tag Team titles was used as the storyline motivation for Ángel Azteca turning Rudo (villain or Heel after attacking his partner. The feud between the two continued off and on until Ángel Azteca's death in 2007, while the two remained close friends backstage. On March 9, 1991 Ángel Azteca and Volador teamed up to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship from Pierroth, Jr. and Bestia Salvaje, holding them for two months before dropping them to Los Destructores (Tony Arce and Vulcano). In 1992 Ángel Azteca left CMLL and joined a large number of ex-CMLL employees in the newly created Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) promotion. In AAA Ángel Azteca teamed up with El Hijo del Santo and Super Muñeco to win the Mexican National Trios Championship from Los Payasos (Coco Amarillo, Coco Azul and Coco Rojo). The trio held the championship for 124 days before losing it back to Los Payasos. After losing the Trios title Ángel Azteca briefly worked for AAA as [...] "Charro de Jalisco", but left AAA not long after.|$|R
