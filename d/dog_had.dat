5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> {{been given}} a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been adequately anaesthetized. They said the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was}} no smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave. Such a <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E

50|$|Dog surfing {{involves}} {{dogs that}} {{are trained to}} surf on surfboards or bodyboards, either alone or with a human on the board. Some <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> been trained to ride a skimboard on the shore (after the board is initially skimmed by a human) and to windsurf with a human, and bodysurfing <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> also been documented in surfing media. Additionally, some <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> been trained to ride on paddleboards with people.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dogs</b> <b>had</b> a major {{religious}} and symbolic {{significance to the}} Aztec peoples of central Mexico. Several ancient burial sites for <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> been discovered in Mexico. Xolotl, an Aztec god of death, was depicted as a dog-headed monster.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
25|$|During the Renaissance {{dogs were}} seen as objects of {{possession}} and thus collars were fitted with padlocks where only {{the owner of the}} <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> the key.|$|E
25|$|The BBC News website {{featured}} a story claiming that a <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> {{been sentenced to}} death by stoning by an Israeli court. It later transpired that the story was untrue. The story had been sourced from AFP and had originated from Israel's Maariv newspaper as a hoax story.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} that the illness may not be noticed until the <b>dog</b> <b>has</b> symptoms of ketosis or ketoacidosis. When newly diagnosed, about 40% of <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> elevated ketone levels; some are in diabetic ketoacidosis when first treated for diabetes.|$|R

25|$|At one time, the breed's {{ancestors}} {{were believed to}} have been among the most popular dogs in Switzerland.

25|$|K9 was {{the brainchild}} of writers Bob Baker and Dave Martin. Its purpose was to have a {{character}} that could narrate while the miniaturised clones of the Doctor and Leela were inside the Doctor's body during the events of The Invisible Enemy. Martin's own <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> also been recently run over by a car, and K9 was a car-proof tribute to it.|$|E

25|$|Hachikō died on March 8, 1935 {{at the age}} of 11 {{based on}} his date of birth. He was found on a street in Shibuya. In March 2011, {{scientists}} finally settled the cause of death of Hachikō: the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> both terminal cancer and a filaria infection. There were also four yakitori skewers in Hachikō's stomach, but the skewers did not damage his stomach or cause his death.|$|E
25|$|The miniseries {{opens with}} a prologue set in 1991. Young Annie Wheaton (played as a child by Kristen Fischer, and later as a {{teenager}} by Kimberly J. Brown) is drawing {{a picture of a}} house as her parents and older sister, Rachel (Melanie Lynskey), argue outside her room. As she draws lines down over the house in her picture, rocks fall through the roof of an identical house belonging to an elderly couple down the street whose <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> bitten Annie, severely damaging the building.|$|E
25|$|About 220 mammals {{are found}} in the Horn of Africa. Among {{threatened}} species of the region, there are several antelopes such as the beira, the dibatag, the silver dikdik and the Speke's gazelle. Other remarkable species include the Somali wild ass, the desert warthog, the hamadryas baboon, the Somali pygmy gerbil, the ammodile, and the Speke's pectinator. The Grevy's zebra is the unique wild equid of the region. There are predators such as spotted hyena, striped hyena and African leopard. The endangered painted hunting <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> populations in the Horn of Africa, but pressures from human exploitation of habitat along with warfare have reduced or extirpated this canid in this region.|$|E
50|$|Wolves {{are said}} to attack domesticated canines out of the {{sentiment}} that the <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> betrayed their own species by living with and depending on humans for their survival.

25|$|The first combat {{action by}} the 9th Parachute Battalion, was in Operation Tonga, part of the Normandy landings. The battalion's primary {{objective}} was the Merville Gun Battery, which {{was in a position}} to threaten the British landings at Sword Beach. Although seriously understrength after a disastrous parachute drop, the battalion silenced the battery but was reduced in strength to 65 men. The battalion then attacked Le Plein capturing the Chateau St Côme. Being too weak to attempt their last objective the battalions dug in around le Plein. One of the battalion's casualties on 6 June was Paratroop dog Glen. The <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been parachuted into Normandy with his handler and both were killed during the day's fighting. They are buried together in the Ranville War Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|I {{was often}} {{asked if he}} had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy {{capacity}} to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.|$|E
25|$|The loyal dog, {{that could}} not wake up his owner but still kept trying to save his life, soaked himself in a nearby stream and {{extinguished}} the fire near Kim. The dog repeated this behavior until he saved Kim's life, but died of burns. Kim woke up after a while and {{found that there was}} a fire and that his dog was burnt to death near him, but that the grassland on and around which he slept was still wet, safe from the fire. Kim realized what his <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> done for him, cried bitterly, buried his dog in a nearby sunny place, and stuck his walking staff in front of the grave instead of a tombstone. The story states that the wooden staff became a very large tree after several years, resulting {{in the name of the}} story (the Tree of a Dog). There still stands a huge tree in Osu-Myun to this day, aged about a thousand years.|$|E
