2500|$|Director Capra {{met with}} Wilson Markle about having Colorization, Inc., colorize It's a Wonderful Life {{based on an}} {{enthusiastic}} response to the colorization of Topper from actor Cary Grant. The company's art director Brian Holmes prepared 10 minutes of colorized footage from It's a Wonderful Life for Capra to view, which resulted in Capra signing a contract with Colorization, Inc., and his [...] "enthusiastic agree to pay half the $260,000 cost of colorizing the movie and to share any profits" [...] and giving [...] "preliminary approval to making similar color versions of two of his other black-and-white films, Meet John Doe (1941) and Lady for a Day (1933)". However, the film {{was believed to be}} in the public domain at the time, and as a result Markle and Holmes responded by returning Capra's initial investment, eliminating his <b>financial</b> <b>participation,</b> and refusing outright to allow the director to exercise artistic control over the colorization of his films, leading Capra to join in the campaign against the process.|$|E

I first present a new measure of the evolution of <b>financial</b> market <b>participation,</b> by relating participation to the extensive margins of money demand, and quantify the influence of wealth on participation decisions. I then relate the increase in participation to the period of "missing money" and to the subsequent higher interest rate elasticity of monetary aggregates. The paper indicates that time series estimations of money demand relationships are inherently flawed and tend to inappropriately suggest instability.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the determinants of <b>financial</b> market <b>participation.</b> <b>Financial</b> market <b>participation</b> will be reasearched in a very broad context including stock market participation, savings, loans and credit, credit card usage/ownership, and insurance coverage. The drivers tested in this thesis include risk tolerance, optimism, expectations, safety net expectations, sensation seeking tendency, social capital, sociability and political preference. Furthermore, I research the impact of open-mindedness which has not priorly been investigated in this context. DATA The data used is from a comprehensive survey, the RISC Monitor 2009, conducted by TNS Finland during the first quarter of 2009. The final sample size is within the range of 3, 400 to 5, 000 respondents. RESULTS Various attitude and expectations-related determinants are found to have an impact on <b>financial</b> market <b>participation.</b> Especially interesting are the positive impact of social capital, risk tolerance and right-wing political orientation on stock market participation. On the other hand, a big contribution is the result indicating that positive safety net expectations lead to decreased stock ownership. There is no indication of sensation seeking, optimism or sociability having any influence on participation. Safety net expectations have a negative impact on savings while right-wing political orientation has a slight positive influence. Positive expectations are however found to have a positive impact on housing loans. Optimism and sensation seeking both have a positive effect on all types of loans. Risk tolerance and sensation seeking are found to lead to increased usage or ownership of credit cards while positive safety net expectations have a slight negative effect, contrary to what was hypothesized. Insurance coverage is decreased with risk tolerance and positive safety net expectations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} that accounting for heterogeneity in <b>financial</b> market <b>participation</b> {{is important for}} evaluating the empirical performance of the Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (C-CAPM). Using the U. S. Consumer Expenditure Survey as a common testing ground, I re-assess three well-known characterizations of the “equity premium puzzle”: (i) the inconsistency of the representative agent’s IMRS with Hansen and Jagannathan bounds; (ii) Mehra and Prescott’s calibration of a large representative agent’s risk aversion; (iii) Hansen and Singleton’s large structural estimates of the preference parameters based on aggregate data. In all three cases, the estimates of risk aversion conditional upon <b>financial</b> market <b>participation</b> are not as far from reasonable values as the corresponding unconditional ones. The differences suggest {{that part of the}} “equity premium puzzle” can be accounted for by the use of a “representative agent” assumption rather than a more appropriate “representative stockholding agent” assumption...|$|R

40|$|In general, {{corporations}} are not isolated actors {{in an economic}} war of all against all but members of corporate networks of global reach. Although the literature on globalization emphasizes the increasing economic power of these networks and postulates {{the formation of a}} transnational capitalist class, there is still a lack of empirical findings. The article starts with a review of theoretical perspectives (resource dependence, social capital, coordination of markets, financial hegemony, class hegemony, inner circle, and transnational capitalist class) which focuses on the functions and structures of corporate interlocks at the national and the transnational level. The subsequent section offers an outline of empirical studies concerning transnational corporate networks. These analyses of corporate ties (interlocking directorates, <b>financial</b> <b>participations</b> and policy group affiliations) suggest the emergence of transnational economic elites whose members, however, have not lost their national identity. In the final section, the theoretical perspectives will be assessed and some prospects are sketched out. Finally, it will be argued that the disintegration of the world society, which is considerably driven by rent-seeking corporate networks, can only be restrained if a potential global regulatory agency will be anchored in a post-Washington consensus...|$|R
