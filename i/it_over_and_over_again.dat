5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E

The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. Upon the announcement of Nickelodeon signing the new show The Mighty B! on December 12, 2006, it renewed SpongeBob SquarePants for a sixth season with 26 episodes in order, surpassing the 100-episode mark. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon, said [...] "One {{of the great things about}} animation is that you can play <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> and kids will still watch it [...] With live action they won't." [...] On March 3, 2008, the season premiered with the episode [...] "Krabby Road". It was written by Luke Brookshier, Nate Cash and Eric Shaw, while Alan Smart served as animation director.|$|E
500|$|... "Someday" [...] was {{recorded}} and mixed by Bob Cadway at The Power Station in New York City. In addition {{to be written}} by Carey and Margulies, they also arranged the song with Chris Toland. In addition to producing the track, Wake also carried out additional arrangement with Rich Tancredi. The drum programming was performed by Wake and Joe Franco, while Cadway played the guitars and Tancredi the keyboards. Carey performed all of her own background vocals. Carey later revealed that [...] "Someday" [...] {{was one of her}} favorite songs on the demo and that she would [...] "listen to <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> on the subway after the studio sessions". However, Carey later expressed her disapproval of some of the new elements added during the production of Mariah Carey, such as the replacement of the horns on the demo in favor of an electric guitar.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} was {{fraught with}} tension between band members, as McCartney annoyed others by insisting on a perfect performance. The track {{was the first}} Lennon was invited to work on following his car accident, but he hated it and declined to do so. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, Lennon said it was [...] "more of Paul's granny music" [...] and left the session. He {{spent the next two}} weeks with Ono and did not return to the studio until the backing track for [...] "Come Together" [...] was laid down on 21 July. Harrison was also tired of the song, adding [...] "we had to play <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> until Paul liked it. It was a real drag". Starr was more sympathetic to the song. [...] "It was granny music", he admitted, [...] "but we needed stuff like that on our album so other people would listen to it". Starr played the anvil sound in the chorus. This track also makes use of Harrison's Moog Synthesizer, played by McCartney.|$|E
2500|$|The Ku Klux Klan moved {{north into}} the Prairies in 1926, and was {{especially}} strong among British residents of Saskatchewan. It built on ethnic prejudices, but had few major successes.

After playing the exact same level for the 30th time, this can get frustrating." [...] However, he concluded, [...] "the non-frustrating times in MDK 2 are simply tons of fun. The game is genuinely funny, has great voices and a terrific comic book flair." ...|$|E

2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E
