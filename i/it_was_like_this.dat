2500|$|Searching for the Young Soul Rebels {{has been}} reissued with bonus tracks three times. [...] First, in 1996, the eleven tracks plus seven tracks from [...] singles that Dexys had {{released}} on EMI were issued {{as part of}} an 18-song collection entitled It Was Like This; however, the two sides of Dexys' first single ("Dance Stance" [...] b/w [...] "I'm Just Looking") were included in the original, Bernie Rhodes-produced versions (with Bobby Ward on drums), not the re-recorded Wingfield-produced versions on the album. Then, a remastered edition of the album was released in 2000 for its 20th Anniversary, including two additional tracks: the music videos for [...] "Geno" [...] and [...] "There, There, My Dear". [...] Most recently, a deluxe 30th Anniversary Special Edition was released in 2010 including a bonus disc of outtakes and demos, which includes all of the bonus tracks issued with <b>It</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This</b> (tracks 3–8 and 19 on the bonus disk) as well as additional BBC live and demo recordings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, yes. The jolly old hotel. I'm {{coming to}} that. Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> A chappie {{on the boat}} told {{me that this was}} the best place to stop at in New York--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-bye,' {{she said}} simply. 'You'll come on Sunday. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> a {{beautiful}} day, Dick. Why can't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> always?' ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, I am the {{sleeping}} volcano, and one morning, monsieur, I have suffered the eruption. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I shall tell you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Goodbye," [...] {{she said}} simply. [...] "You'll come on Sunday. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> a {{beautiful}} day, Dick. Why can't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> always?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking of girls," [...] said Marlowe with enthusiasm. [...] "I've {{just seen}} {{the only one}} in the world that really amounts to anything. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I was shoving my way through the mob on the dock, when suddenly...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{the sailor}} said apologetically, [...] "you see <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Mr. Julian {{is a young}} gentleman as loves {{a bit of a}} spree, and he has been out many a night with some of us to see a cargo run." ...|$|E
60|$|White {{looked about}} him helplessly. He missed his headpiece, the {{instigator}} of the plot. 'Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> my lady,' he began, turning to Lady Georgina, and wriggling to gain time. 'You see, his lordship and Mr. Higginson----' he twirled his thumbs {{and tried to}} invent something plausible.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{be in the}} air {{again is}} glorious," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "I should not mind how long the journey lasted if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> How far do we travel in carriages?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Said Ibn Al-Musayyib stated: [...] "I {{attended}} {{the funeral of}} Zaid bin Thabit. After he had been buried, ibn Abbas said, 'O you people! Whoever wishes to know how knowledge leaves us should know that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> that knowledge leaves. I swear by Allah that {{a great deal of}} knowledge has just left us today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{worst of}} the story is," [...] said he, [...] "that I show myself up as such a confounded fool. Of course it may work out all right, and I don't see that I could have done otherwise; but if I have lost my crib and get nothing in {{exchange}} I shall feel what a soft Johnnie I have been. I'm {{not very good at}} telling a story, Dr. Watson, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> with me: ...|$|R
60|$|DORA. [continuing] I'll tell you: but dont you worry: hes all right. I {{came out}} myself this morning: {{there was such}} a crowd! and a band! they thought I was a suffragette: only fancy! You see <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Holy Joe got talking about how he'd been a {{champion}} sprinter at college.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was rotten luck. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> We were {{altering}} {{our team}} after the Sussex match, {{to bring in}} Ballard, Keene, and Willis. They couldn't get down to Brighton, as the 'Varsity had a match, {{but there was nothing}} on for them in {{the last half of the}} week, so they'd promised to roll up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She’ll {{just have}} to have her own way till we get to Llanelly," [...] said the indignant skipper, [...] "and then I’ll send her home by train and ship another cook. I knew she’d got a temper, but I didn’t know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> She’s the last woman that sets foot on my ship—that’s all she’s done for her sex." ...|$|E
60|$|All fits of {{pleasure}} are balanced by an equal degree of pain or languor; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> spending <b>this</b> year {{part of the}} next year's revenue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Only once, {{for a few}} days, years ago. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> very {{beautiful}} in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, but this--" ...|$|R
50|$|The Posavina canton's {{position}} {{near the}} Sava river {{makes it a}} good place for agriculture because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a flat lowland and there are no mountains in the area. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> in the entire northern border with Croatia, {{with a great deal of}} farming and agriculture. The river Sava is a river who flows through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In Bosnia and Herzegovina it flows through the northern border and makes a natural border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.|$|R
60|$|DOOLITTLE. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> Governor. The girl took {{a boy in}} {{the taxi}} {{to give him a}} jaunt. Son of her landlady, he is. He hung about on the chance of her giving him another ride home. Well, she sent him back for her luggage when she heard you was willing for her to stop here. I met the boy at the corner of Long Acre and Endell Street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> sir," [...] said Psmith, [...] "Jackson {{happened}} {{to tell me}} that you and Mr. Downing seemed to think he had painted Mr. Downing's dog, and there seemed some danger of his being expelled, so I thought it wouldn't be an unsound scheme if I were to go and say I had done it. That was the whole thing. Of course, Dunster writing created a certain amount of confusion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I was a-doing {{of my hair}} in {{the kitchen}} with the curling-iron, when down comes Miss Julia. 'Oh, you are frizzing your hair!' she says. 'Yes, miss,' I says, 'have you any objection?' I says. 'Ma won't let you have a fringe,' she says. When I loses my temper, and I says, 'Well, Miss Himperence, you can go and tell your ma that she can find a servant as can do without a fringe.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, {{they are}} to be bought in the open market. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> Maude. The mine was a very good one, and paid {{handsome}} dividends. Then it had some misfortunes. First, there was no water, and then there was too much water, and the workings were flooded. So, of course, the price of the shares fell. Now they are getting the mine all right again, but the shares <b>are</b> still low. <b>It</b> certainly seems a very good chance to pick a few of them up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{spell of}} eternity <b>is</b> woven over <b>it,</b> surely," [...] murmured Uncle Blair. [...] "Winter may not touch it, or spring ever revisit <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> should <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 190. Forest-crypt: The crypt of {{a church}} is the basement, filled with arched pillars that sustain the building. The cavern of the brook, as the poet will have us imagine <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{subterranean}} crypt, where the pillars <b>are</b> <b>like</b> trees and the groined arches like interlacing branches, decorated with frost leaves. The poet {{seems to have had}} in mind throughout the description the interior of the Gothic cathedrals, as shown by the many suggestive terms used, [...] "groined," [...] "crypt," [...] "aisles," [...] "fretwork," [...] and [...] "carvings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you to think of it, Mr. Armstrong," [...] Hiram Powlett said, [...] "and it will be a fine thing for Ruth. Of course, she has been wrong, very wrong; but she must have {{suffered}} very much all these months. I told you I thought she had something on her mind, but I never thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Well, well, I shan't say anything to her. I never was good at scolding her when she was a child, and I think she has been severely punished for this already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your royaliness, and my lords and ladies, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> His royaliness comed {{in with a}} rug {{over his}} arm, and summat under it. And he lays it down on that there seat, and Thomas shows him into the droring-room. Then Benson says: 'Dinner'll be ready in five minutes; how tired I do feel! 'Then he takes the libbuty of sitting hisself down on his royaliness's rug, and he says, asking your pardon, 'I 've had about enough of service here. I 'm about tired, and I thinks of bettering myself. I wish I was at the king's court, and butler.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> sir, yer see. My daughter, she's a lidy as keeps 'erself TO 'erself, as the sayin' is, an' 'olds 'er 'ead up. She {{keeps up}} a proper pride, an' minds 'er 'ouse an' 'er little uns. She ain't no gadabaht. But she 'AVE a tongue, she 'ave"; the mother {{lowered her voice}} cautiously, lest the [...] "lidy" [...] should hear. [...] "I don't deny it that she 'AVE a tongue, at times, through myself 'avin' {{suffered}} from it. And when she DO go on, Lord bless you, why, there ain't no stoppin' of 'er." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> {{has never}} <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{exactly the same}} again.|$|R
5000|$|Boucher has a {{prominent}} {{scar on his}} right cheek. When asked how he received it, Boucher said [...] "it is not hockey-related. I did not tell anybody back home, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> little enigma. My kids do not even know." [...] Guy Boucher's scar is often compared to the [...] "Le Chiffre" [...] character's scar in Casino Royale and Boucher is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "James Bond villain". He was spoofed as such on-air by Jay Onrait of the Canadian TSN sports television channel.|$|R
5000|$|Barlow's second gig with Tull {{involved}} an unfortunate episode in Denver, Colorado {{when the local}} police tear-gassed the audience from helicopters, both outside and inside the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Believing {{that they would be}} arrested, the band made a run for it after the show in an unmarked station wagon where, hidden under a blanket {{on the floor in the}} back, Barrie was heard to ask Ian, [...] "Will <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> every night?" [...] Anderson replied, [...] "As a general rule, only on Tuesdays and Thursdays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have. I wish I could {{wash the}} gravel {{out of my}} hands somewhere. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> you know. Came on them {{suddenly}} round a corner. Horse shied at the bicycles. They were sitting by the roadside botanising flowers. I just had time to shout, 'Jessie Milton, we've been looking for you,' and then that confounded brute bolted. I didn't dare turn round. I had all my work to do to save myself being turned over, as it was--so long as I did, I mean. I just shouted, 'Return to your friends. All will be forgiven.' And off I came, clatter, clatter. Whether they heard--" ...|$|E
60|$|Agatha {{knew he did}} {{not think}} she was afraid; he had tactfully pretended to {{misunderstand}} her glance, and she fixed her eyes ahead. The shadows were deeper and the forest was indistinct, but it was not dark. Besides, the moon was getting bright and threw a glittering beam across the river. She could see for some distance and not far in front the water was furrowed and marked by lines of foam. The stream ran very fast and the throbbing swelled into a deep, sullen roar. There was a smell of burning, and now and then a trail of smoke drifted out from the bank, beyond which a red glow glimmered against the sky. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> she thought, on that other evening when her father returned from his last journey, but the melancholy she had felt had given way to a strange emotional excitement. Somehow she knew the pilgrimage she had made for his sake would end as she had hoped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Thompson and I, {{and some}} other chaps, started in a boat, with provisions, just {{prospecting}} about the islands. So we went in and out among the straits--horrid places, clear water full of sharks, and nothing but mangroves on every side. One of these sounds is just like another. Once I was coming home in a coasting steamer, and got them to set me down on a point that I believed was within half-a-mile of my place. Well, I was landed, and I began walking homewards, when I found I was on the wrong track, {{miles and miles of}} mangrove swamp, cut up with a dozen straits of salt water, lay between me and the station. The first stretch of water I came to, gad! I didn't like it. I kept prospecting for sharks very close before I swam it, with my clothes on my head. I was in awful luck all the way, though,--not one of them had a snap at me." ...|$|E
50|$|Bob Dylan singled {{this album}} out {{as one of}} his {{favorites}} by Odetta; indeed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> albums <b>like</b> <b>this</b> that inspired him to play folk music instead of rock 'n' roll.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, I <b>like</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing," [...] {{said one}} of the party, an Englishman, when the order was given to start. [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> uncommonly jolly." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{some ways}} September 11 {{was the true}} {{beginning}} of the 21st century andat this point <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still perhaps only our narrative. But {{the way we have}} responded to <b>it</b> <b>is</b> changing things for other people in the world, too. So <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now becoming part of their narratives and their narratives will have different versions of the cause and its effects of the event. So <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> seismic shock, one whose waves are still moving up the time line. At its epicentre is 9/11.
