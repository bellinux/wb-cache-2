5|$|Hinkley Point C {{nuclear power}} station is a project to {{construct}} a 3,200 MW two reactor {{nuclear power station}}. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point– already {{the site of the}} disused Hinkley Point A and the still operational Hinkley Point B power stations– was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted an application for <b>development</b> <b>consent</b> to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision.|$|E

5000|$|Periodically {{governments and}} {{businesses}} {{have raised the}} topic of an [...] "inland port" [...] whereby Parkes Regional Airport would be expanded considerably {{to serve as a}} starting point for domestic and international freight destined for areas in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. Environmental studies are complete, <b>development</b> <b>consents</b> are in place, contracts have been exchanged, some properties have changed hands and studies are continuing.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 6 May 2014 that the airport would close. This occurred on 15 May 2014 {{with the loss}} of 144 jobs. When closure {{was announced}}, campaign group 'Save Manston Airport' was formed by a local campaigner, along with other groups such as 'Supporters of Manston Airport', 'Manston Works' and 'Save Manston Airport Association' as well as the existing 'Why Not Manston' group. The groups petitioned the local council to issue a compulsory purchase order (CPO) to do so, in conjunction with a private indemnity partner. A US-based investment group, RiverOak, put forward a plan to re-open the airport, with an initial emphasis on cargo and aircraft recycling operations. [...] Riveroak however failed to supply Thanet District Council with the required information, and thus TDC declined to go forward with a CPO with Riveroak, as they felt that ample time had been given for Riveroak to supply the information required including financial status. Riveroak now plan to attempt the same using a <b>Development</b> <b>Consent</b> Order (DCO). The proposed development has been named Stone Hill Park.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997 John Taylor and Pam Taylor, {{the owners}} of 28 Jeffrey Street applied for <b>Development</b> <b>Consent</b> to North Sydney Council to add [...] "Juliette balconies", a roof deck and a glass roof to their Victorian terrace house. The terrace has a 2-storey {{appearance}} from the street, 3-stories from the rear which is below street level. Consent was refused by Council. This decision was appealed to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales. The original application had been in May 1997 and had led to five sets of plans being prepared. Objections raised included concerns related to the party wall, consent, noise, privacy, reduction in heritage integrity, light, and detrimental impact on the strong geometric shapes of the gable roofs on the terraces and their stepping down the hill. Evidence from Mrs. Worrall {{was that in the}} 1960s the area had been regarded as a slum, but the history of the area had been recognised. The Court heard evidence from neighbouring owners, architects and town planners including: ...|$|E

Written by John Whitehouse, {{one of the authors}} of the original legislation in 1979, it provides an in-depth analysis of the operations of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), with particular emphasis on environmental planning instruments, the processing of development applications and <b>development</b> <b>consents,</b> as well as environmental impact assessment and existing uses.

40|$|Raintanks are {{becoming}} real {{in the urban}} setting. Some people see them as radical; a few see raintanks as simply too hard, or revolution. The majority see raintanks as sensible resource management. Raintanks are one very effective method of avoiding the stormwater effects from impervious surfaces, particularly roof areas. Installing raintanks in the urban environment are now starting to occur, but not yet commonplace. This paper outlines the evolution of raintank policy and installations in North Shore City. It particularly highlights {{the need for a}} cooperative, integrated approach across Council, because such a policy involves substantial change management. The paper also examines the reaction to raintanks from regular contact with those in the development comunity, and whether reactions are objective, plus responses from detractors. Technical and non-technical issues, problems and similar matters encountered with <b>development</b> <b>consents</b> are also covered...|$|R
