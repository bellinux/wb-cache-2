Complementing previous studies, we {{examine the impact of}} high skill migration not only on the formation of human capital, but also consider migration's impact on knowledge capital in the sending countries. In line with previous studies we find that in the short- to medium-term high skill migration strictly reduces national innovative capital and hence increases the gap between East and West. However, these effects might be mitigated by factors such as reinforced education of workers, productive investment of remittances, return migration and increased knowledge transfer. Given that the emigration of highly skilled affects human capital differently than knowledge capital, addressing the adverse impacts of the most talented and <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> emigration efficiently, differentiated policies are required for human capital and knowledge capital.

Whereas the need for <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> has been climbing, the discrepancy between competencies of graduates and qualifications searched by employers continue to be a serious concern among various nations [1, 24]. The main issue addressed by the present study is: “Is science and technology (S&T) students and new graduates ’ development of core competencies influenced by their prior perception of importance of these competencies? And does the development of these core competencies guarantee their fitness for purpose in terms of entering into the workforce? ” Findings revealed that S&T students and new graduates ’ experience at the institution have developed all the seven core competencies under investigation in the present research and that the development of core competencies is not always influenced by prior perception of importance. With respect to the fitness for purpose, findings show that S&T students and new graduates perceived their preparedness for the workplace close to “more than adequate preparation for being an expert in my field of S&T”.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this paper are to survey Russian trainers to create a social portrait of the professional group and to identify features, which could be arranged as a foothold for transforming this group {{to a new level}} given the demands of the modern economy. This study integrates the use of quantitative and qualitative social research strategies to obtain, aggregate, and analyze data characterizing the professional group of trainers in the Russian vocational education and training (VET) system. The basic research was provided by questionnaires in all federal districts (as recognized by international law) of the Russian Federation. The quantitative poll of trainers was conducted by representative two-level sampling. A number of tables and charts provide a social portrait of the Russian trainer. The statistical data reveal the current level of trainers’ education as well as their length of service, distribution of vocations, and other significant features. The overall conclusion from these findings indicates that a typical representative of this professional group is a woman of average or slightly advanced age with a family, who has a VET or higher education, has served as a training officer for not less than 10 years, and who has either been recruited as a <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> or as a specialist. A typical representative feels the need to change something in the life and teaching of the young people that she knows. The research into trainers as a professional group was conducted first because of their uniformity, and secondly, their typicality as a pedagogical group. In many respects, the main characteristics of the social portrait are similar to characteristics of other professional groups in the Russian education system, such as secondary and post-secondary school teachers, and VET teachers. The study is based on one country. It is the first and only survey of its type in the Russian Federation.

First policies {{on the matter}} date from the 1960 s in Canada and the 1970 s in Australia while the USA selective migration programme {{dates back to the}} early 1950 s. However, competition among developed industrialised countries for highly skilled migrants has taken up new urgency in the last 15 years with the onset of the knowledge based economy and society. The UK was the first European country to develop an open high-skill migration policy in the late 1990 s already, but other EU countries like the Netherlands or Germany followed suit in the mid 2000 s. Five years after the adoption of the EU Blue Card scheme, developed to attract the best and brightest of the world to the European Union countries, data on the usage of the Blue Card scheme in selected member states show that the Directive has failed to achieve its objectives. Many critiques so far have focused on the low level of mobility that the Blue Card grants. When adopted by a member state, the Blue Card does not offer access to the EU labour market as a whole and is still related to rather cumbersome bureaucratic procedures if the <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> wants to take up a job in another EU country. Studies on Australia and the USA have shown that temporary migration visas addressing highly skilled migrants may create best opportunities for migrants and employers who sponsor them, Having high employment outcomes and good salaries, such migrants are usually enabled to move on to permanent settlement schemes smoothly. This Policy Brief focuses on the limitations that the Blue Card has with regard to the path that it offers to long term stay and settlement if the highly skilled migrant wishes, alongside the limited intra EU mobility rights that it grants. This Policy Brief suggests that the European Commission should launch a consultation with member states and relevant stakeholders with a view to making the Blue Card more attractive both for member states and for prospective high skill migrants from third countries...|$|E

40|$|Immigration {{policies}} have been for long developed {{at the national level}} by sovereign States, seeking to determine under what conditions they allowed the entry of foreigners into their territories and their stay. European integration has allowed other actors than national governments to intervene in the control of immigration particularly since the signature of the Amsterdam Treaty. The Europeanization of migration policies is highly relevant topic (Geddes, 2001, Guiraudon, 2000) but research often focused on immigration control and securitization (Guild, 2001). The aim of this research is to examine new discourse that has progressively emerged {{since the end of the}} 1990 s and that promotes a relative openness to labour immigration (Boswell, 2003). I examine the development of this discourse at the European level and its consequences in terms of policy change in order to answer the following question: why and how the European Commission has endorsed a discourse favourable to new immigration of workers in Europe after decades of doctrine of zero immigration and in despite of restrictive positions of the Member States? For this, I scrutinize the policy-making of a European labour immigration policy from the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty (1 st May 1999) until the adoption of the Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment also called Blue Card Directive (29 th May 2009). Methodologically, the research is based on the analysis of more than 400 documents from EU institutions mainly and on 37 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in the European policy-making and finally on several hours of observatory participation. Based on the theoretical framework of discursive institutionalism (Schmidt, 2008), the dissertation explains the policy process carried out by European actors, particularly the European Commission and Direction General Justice and Home Affairs. Using the concept of discourse defined as ideas and interactions, it examines the ideas about new labour migration in Europe. It highlights the European policy-making on labour migration and how European actors reached step by step an agreement on the so-called Blue Card Directive. The dissertation shows that the European Commission - whatever the ideas it promotes - seeks primarily to legitimize its activities and position itself as a supranational actor and strengthen the competencies under the Treaties. Migrant workers categories emerging from the policy process range from the new economic migrant to the emblematic <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> who is seen as the ideal migrant.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the “Female Complaints”: Medicine, Markets and Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health track. The public health campaign in favor of breastfeeding has been wide-spread, visible, and well-funded. Still, most women nurse well below the recommended period of time. In this paper, I want to isolate a number of the ideological factors that have been undermining the “breast is best” message. Much {{has been written about the}} paternalistic ideology accompanying what one theorist has called “medical motherhood”: a woman is rendered passive in the childbirth process and required to defer to the (generally male) physician for knowledge and advice about the natural functioning of her own body. Although this is an important part of the story, I want to argue that there are more fundamental factors at work, and I wish to explore in particular the rationalizing function of medical motherhood in the promotion of formula feeding. The rise of capitalism is famously accompanied by a reordering of experience to allow for a more efficient administration of our productive potential both spatially and temporally. Spatially we come to view ourselves in an increasingly individualized (alienated) manner, as isolated agents on the free market whose relations are mediated by market considerations. Temporally, we regulate our time so as to be able to maximize our productivity: our time is governed by the clock rather than the sun, and divided into quantitatively comparable units. There are numerous mechanisms by which these regulative functions have operated directly on our bodies, and I want to suggest that bottle-feeding is one such mechanism. Spatially, the intervention of medical technology in the parent child bond is dramatically enacted in certain rituals of separation – the baby is removed from the parents after birth and sent to a nursery, parents are urged to keep the baby in a separate sleeping room or at least separate bed, etc. These arrangements work to undermine lactation, which at any rate is replaced by bottles of formula. More basically perhaps, bottle-feeding clarifies or perhaps constitutes the distinction between infant and mother, creating a duality out of what has been called a “dyad”. The infant-mother bond is a supple one, and birth does not need to be experienced as an absolute sundering of two bodies – it points to ambiguities in our notion of individualized subjectivity, and systems of control might be predictably concerned to disambiguate the situation. Psychoanalysis has explored ways in which this is accomplished, but I believe bottle-feeding has a role in this regard, in separating the infant from the mother’s body. This separation is often described in the language of liberation: the mother is no longer “tied down” to the nursing regime, no longer “forced” to pay attention to her diet, is “free” to stay away from the infant for as long as she wishes, or to engage other people to feed the baby. This language of liberation allows bottle-feeding to be positioned as a boon to feminism and a way of furthering feminist goals. The bottle regime allows the mother’s breasts to be removed from the functional role of nursing and wholly reintegrated into the specular economy of adult sexuality. It also lends itself more readily to a sleeping arrangement where the baby is in its own room or at least its own cot. Breastfeeding is facilitated by (although it certainly does not necessitate) a co-sleeping arrangement that allows the nursing mother to doze off and wake up in response to the baby’s nursing needs without having to get out of bed. Separate sleeping also works to condition and reinforce a sense of separation between mother and baby and independence of mother from baby and vice versa. It also facilitates a stricter regulation of time. While the breastfed infant needs to be allowed to nurse continuously (at least for the first few weeks of life), formula need not be administered continuously. Formula is more difficult to digest than breast milk, and the signals for satiation are not as obvious to the infant. Therefore, it is up to the care-giver to determine when and how much they should eat, using some sort of schedule (every four hours is typical for a newborn). This enables the caregiver(s) to regulate the baby’s sleep patterns much more reliably than with a breastfed infant whose continuous feeding will make for erratic and broken sleep for the mother. It is important to see that these exigencies of control and regulation are still in effect in spite of more recent public health messages urging mothers to breastfeed if possible. Although women are urged to breastfeed, the practice does not fit naturally into an environment where separation and regulation are valued and even encouraged, perhaps couched in terms of (spuriously) feminist goals. The debate over nursing has been taken up inappropriately into feminism, I believe. “Market” feminism proposes its own solution to the dilemma of nursing at work: pumping. Increasingly, “lactation-friendly” business environments are promoted by such feminist groups as NOW as a way of both working and feeding breast milk to the baby. While advertising themselves as sensitive to the mother’s needs, the business is certainly sensitive to its own, as such accommodations are relatively inexpensive compared with either maternity leave or even replacing a <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker.</b> Corporate lactation programs are ways in which the corporate world stoops to conquer, expending a small amount of resources to offer a degraded solution within the system in order to forestall any more radical demands. This solution maintains the regulatory imperative of the bottle-feeding norm, only replacing the fluid that is on offer. The practice of breastfeeding poses a set of urgent challenges to an economic system and the notion of agency within an economic system predicated on imperatives of quantification, regulation and control. It entails a notion of time that is governed by biological rhythm and a supple conception of human relationship and identity. It reveals a set of contradictions within late capitalism that cannot be resolved by the false synthesis of corporate lactation programs...|$|E
