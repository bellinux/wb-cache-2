5|$|Defence {{spending}} {{had been}} heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, {{faced with a}} resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership (see German re-armament), <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> {{of the need for}} rearmament. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's historical bulwark, the English Channel, was no defence against air power.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Chrisye {{appeared}} in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (As Beautiful as the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> by Sys NS {{that it would be}} fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical.|$|E

5|$|Seltzer {{defended the}} Cleveland Press {{and his own}} {{personal}} involvement in the case in his 1956 memoir The Years Were Good. Seltzer argued that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> the Sheppard family {{was involved in a}} conspiracy to get away with murder and that he personally wrote the editorials, instead of passing them off to one of his employees, out of concern for the safety of his staff.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations {{to take advantage of the}} confusion that followed in order to disengage.|$|E
5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the progressives threatened the very {{foundation of the}} government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, {{one of the last}} links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E

5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} {{to act in the}} film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E
5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced,</b> as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the Chautauqua {{movement}} {{made its}} way to Gladstone. Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would be a boon to the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E

Brown's daughter Linda, a third grader, had to walk six blocks to her school bus stop to ride to Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school one mile (1.6km) away, while Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name Monkey Punch. His {{inspiration}} for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the Lupin III series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention {{was to keep the}} blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> by others not to do so.|$|E
5|$|Virdon {{returned}} to the Pirates as the hitting coach under Jim Leyland in 1986, Leyland's first season as a manager. He took the position only when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that he would not}} succeed Leyland should the Pirates fire him. Following a contract dispute, the Pirates replaced Virdon with Milt May before the 1987 season. Virdon remained with the Pirates as a minor league hitting instructor for the Pirates from 1987 through 1989. He worked as a spring training instructor for the Cardinals in 1990 and 1991, and then rejoined Leyland's coaching staff in Pittsburgh in 1992.|$|E

However, Colonel Owens, Dick's father, is opposed to his son's being accompanied by Tom as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> that the slave will escape and constitute a property loss. Instead he suggests that Dick take Tom's brother, Grandison.

5|$|After the assassination, Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavianus (Octavian). Along with Marcus Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and he committed suicide with his lover, Cleopatra. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire and later accepted the title of Augustus ("Exalted One"). <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that only a single strong ruler could restore order in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Hunt {{eventually}} chose Lazenby {{after seeing}} {{him in a}} Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement. Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered for, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel. Broccoli noticed Lazenby as a Bond-type man based on his physique and character elements, and offered him an audition. The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, {{and as a result}} he left the series after the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, Gas Powered Games {{had begun}} {{to search for a}} {{publisher}} for the game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers were interested in the game, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> by Ed Fries to partner with the newly established Microsoft Game Studios. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due {{to the size of the}} game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features. Dungeon Siege was released for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, and for MacOS on May 2, 2003 by Destineer.|$|E

5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described {{the execution of the}} Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{feud with}} Flair he was {{involved}} in angles with The Sandman and Triple H. He then lost to Triple H at Unforgiven 2007 in a no disqualification match where the no disqualification rule only applied to Carlito. In late 2007, Colón requested his release from the WWE as he was unhappy with the direction of his character. Following a meeting with Vince McMahon, however, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> to stay. On December 10, 2007, he was featured in a ladder match at the Raw 15th Anniversary against Jeff Hardy for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, which Hardy won. Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify for the money in the bank ladder match at Wrestlemania 24. He failed to win at the event. Carlito then formed a tag team with Santino Marella. The team was placed in several matches involving the World Tag Team Championship, twice being named the number one contenders; however, they lost the relevant championship matches.|$|E
5|$|However, a major rift {{of opinion}} {{existed between the}} Japanese {{government}} and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally {{under the control of}} the Central China Area Army led by SEA commander Matsui. Matsui made clear to his superiors even before he left for Shanghai that he wanted to march on Nanking. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanking would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in its war on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanking and both men chafed under the operation restriction line that had been imposed on them by the Army General Staff.|$|E
