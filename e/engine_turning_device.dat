50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>turning</b> {{machines}} {{manufactured in}} the traditional fashion with cast iron and heavy wood bases and precision scraped machined surfaces have been made up to ca 1967 (e.g. Neuweiler und Engelsberger).

50|$|Most {{helicopters}} have {{a single}} main rotor, but torque created as the <b>engine</b> <b>turns</b> the rotor causes {{the body of the}} helicopter to turn in the opposite direction to the rotor (by conservation of angular momentum). To eliminate this effect, some sort of anti-torque control must be used.|$|R
50|$|The most {{fundamental}} meaning {{is that of}} an overall gear ratio between engine and wheels, such that the car is over-geared, and cannot reach its potential top speed, i.e. the car could travel faster if it were in a lower gear, with the <b>engine</b> <b>turning</b> at higher RPM.|$|R

5000|$|Low gear (equivalent): When {{accelerating}} at low speeds {{in normal}} operation, the <b>engine</b> <b>turns</b> {{more rapidly than}} the wheels but does not develop sufficient torque. The extra engine speed is fed to MG1 acting as a generator. The output of MG1 is fed to MG2, acting as a motor and adding torque at the driveshaft.|$|R
