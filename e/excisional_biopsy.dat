25|$|If a melanocytic nevus is {{suspected}} of being a melanoma, {{it needs to be}} sampled or removed and sent for microscopic evaluation by a pathologist by a method called skin biopsy. One can do a complete excisional skin biopsy or a punch skin biopsy, depending on the size and location of the original nevus. Other reasons for removal may be cosmetic, or because a raised mole interferes with daily life (e.g. shaving). Removal can be by <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy</b> or by shaving. A shaved site leaves a red mark on the site which returns to the patient’s usual skin color in about two weeks. However, there might still be a risk of spread of the melanoma, so the methods of Melanoma diagnosis, including <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy,</b> are still recommended even in these instances. Additionally, moles can be removed by laser, surgery or electrocautery.|$|E

40|$|Biopsies {{are often}} {{essential}} {{in establishing a}} diagnosis in lesions suspected of being malignant melanoma. Many physicians question the safety of such biopsies. Data on this point have been conflicting both with respect to animal and human studies. A high degree of variability in both tumor and host limits adequately controlled melanoma biopsy experiments in man. This study was undertaken {{to determine the effect}} of incisional and <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> on the incidence of metastases. Fortner's melanotic melanoma # 1, a hamster tumor, was chosen for study because of morphologic and behavioral similarity to human melanoma. Incisional biopsies of this hamster melanoma tacked significant adverse effect on the incidence of metastases. <b>Excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> of these tumors resulted in significantly fewer metastases than incisional biopsies or no biopsies...|$|R
2500|$|First, a {{diagnosis}} must be made. If the lesion is a seborrheic keratosis, then shave excision, electrodesiccation or cryosurgery may be performed, usually leaving very {{little if any}} scarring. If the lesion is suspected to be a skin cancer, a skin biopsy must be done first, before considering removal. This is unless an <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy</b> is warranted. If the lesion is a melanocytic nevus, one has to decide if it is medically indicated or not ...|$|E
2500|$|Excisional skin biopsy is the {{management}} of choice. Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue. [...] To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the histopathologist to determine {{the thickness of the}} melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by Breslow's thickness (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5cm, 1.0cm, or 2cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and morbidity from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy</b> is {{essentially}} the same as incisional biopsy, except the entire lesion or tumor is included. This is the ideal method of diagnosis of small melanomas (when performed as an excision). Ideally, an entire melanoma should be submitted for diagnosis if it can be done safely and cosmetically. This <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy</b> is often done with a narrow surgical margin to make sure the deepest thickness of the melanoma is given before prognosis is decided. However, as many melanoma-in-situs are large and on the face, a physician will often chose to do multiple small punch biopsies before committing to a large excision for diagnostic purpose alone. Many prefer the small punch method for initial diagnostic value before resorting to the <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy.</b> An initial small punch biopsy of a melanoma might say [...] "severe cellular atypia, recommend wider excision". At this point, the clinician can be confident that an <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsy</b> can be performed without risking committing a [...] "false positive" [...] clinical diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The present {{pilot study}} evaluates the histopathological {{characteristics}} and suitability of CO 2 and diode lasers for performing <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> in the buccal mucosa with {{special emphasis on}} the extent of the thermal damage zone created. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 15 patients agreed to undergo surgical removal of their fibrous hyperplasias with a laser. These patients were randomly assigned to one diode or two CO 2 laser groups. The CO 2 laser was used in a continuous wave mode (cw) with a power of 5 W (Watts), and in a pulsed char-free mode (cf). Power settings for the diode laser were 5. 12 W in a pulsed mode. The thermal damage zone of the three lasers and intraoperative and postoperative complications were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The collateral thermal damage zone on the borders of the <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> was significantly smaller with the CO, laser for both settings tested compared to the diode laser regarding values in pm or histopathological index scores. The only intraoperative complication encountered was bleeding, which had to be controlled with electrocauterization. No postoperative complications occurred in any of the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The CO 2 laser seems to be appropriate for <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> of benign oral mucosal lesions. The CO 2 laser offers clear advantages in terms of smaller thermal damage zones over the diode laser. More study participants are needed to demonstrate potential differences between the two different CO 2 laser settings tested. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of liquid biopsy (which is not really a biopsy as they are blood tests that do not require a biopsy of tissue): {{circulating}} tumor cell assays or cell-free circulating tumor DNA tests. These methods provide a non-invasive alternative to repeat invasive biopsies to evaluate the mutations in cancer and plan individualized treatments. In addition, because cancer is a heterogeneous genetic disease, and <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> provide only a snapshot in time of some of the rapid, dynamic genetic changes occurring in tumors, liquid biopsies provide some advantages over tissue biopsy-based genomic testing. In addition, <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> are invasive, can’t be used repeatedly, and are ineffective in understanding the dynamics of tumor progression and metastasis. By detecting and quantifying genomic alterations in CTCs and cell-free DNA in blood, liquid biopsy can provide real-time information on the stage of tumor progression, treatment effectiveness, and cancer metastasis risk. This technological development could make it possible to diagnose and manage cancer from repeated blood tests rather than from a traditional biopsy.|$|R

40|$|Background – In oral pathology, laser devices {{can provide}} {{important}} advantages, {{especially in the}} treatment of certain lesions. However, there is controversy about the use of some wavelengths in the analysis of suspected dysplastic or neoplastic lesions, raising doubt about the laser's suitability for use in biopsy procedures. The present pilot study evaluates the pathomorphological characteristics and suitability of Er:YAG and diode lasers for performing <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> in the oral mucosa with special emphasis on the extent of the thermal damage zone created. Material and Methods – 10 patients were randomly assigned to one diode or one Er:YAG laser groups. The Er:YAG laser(2940 nm) was used in a pulsed wave mode 200 mJ/ 35 Hz with a power of 7 W. Power settings for the diode laser(810 nm) were 3 W in a pulsed mode. The thermal damage zone of the two lasers and intraoperative and postoperative complications were assessed and compared. All biopsy specimens were evaluated by optical microscopy by threeblinded pathologists. After establishing the pathomorphological diagnosis of the lesion assessed, the pathologists measured the maximal width of the peripheral thermal damage zone in the specimen in μm and classiﬁed it using appropriate index. Results – The peripheral thermal damage zone on the borders of the <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> was signiﬁcantly smaller with the Er:YAG laser compared to the diode laser regarding values in μm or pathomorphological index scores. No postoperative complications occurred in any of the two groups. Conclusions – The Er:YAG laser seems to be appropriate for <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> of benign oral mucosal lesions. The Er:YAG laser offers clear advantages in terms of smaller thermal damage zones over the diode laser. Although in some samples thermal damage was minimally visible, in all samples histological evaluation was clearly possible. The study demonstrated that the Er:YAG laser can be safely used in oral biopsy investigations while ensuring a successful histological evaluation, which is fundamental to correct clinical management...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this work was to {{determine}} the feasibility of obtaining representative expression array profiles from clinical core biopsies. For this purpose we performed six 16 -gauge needle core biopsies and an excision biopsy on each of two different human xenografts, one from an Ewing’s sarcoma cell line and the second from neuroblastoma cell line grown in Beige-Scid mice. Three of the six core biopsies were processed separately and the remaining three were pooled and processed together. As the initial RNA material isolated from the core biopsies was not sufficient for microarray analysis, an amplification procedure using a modified Eberwine protocol was performed, and the amplified products applied onto a 6000 -feature human cDNA microarray. Comparisons of the array results from core biopsies (amplified RNA) and surgical specimens (non-amplified RNA) showed maintenance of the expression profile as assessed by hierarchical clustering. Gene expression profiles obtained from microarray analysis clearly differentiated the Ewing’s sarcoma from the neuroblastoma with both core and <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies</b> as starting material. Pooling the core biopsies did not improve the concordance with <b>excisional</b> <b>biopsies.</b> In conclusion, our results suggest that core biopsies {{can be used as a}} suitable and reliable material for the determination of tumor genetic profiles...|$|R
