5|$|The <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause {{served as}} the basis for the {{decision}} in Bush v.

In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus violated the <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause.|$|E

5|$|On June 18, 1866, Congress {{adopted the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which {{guaranteed}} citizenship and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> {{under the laws}} regardless of race, {{and sent it to}} the states for ratification. After a bitter struggle that included attempted rescissions of ratification by two states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.|$|E
50|$|A major racial {{issue in}} this case is the concern {{surrounding}} pretext stops. It is believed by profiling a potential suspect gets rid of the need for wrongdoing, violating the <b>Equal</b> <b>Protections</b> Clause. In 1999, United States v.

5|$|After {{judicial}} {{enforcement of}} the Fifteenth Amendment ended grandfather clauses, white primaries, and other discriminatory tactics, Southern black voter registration gradually increased, rising from five percent in 1940 to twenty-eight percent in 1960. Although the Fifteenth Amendment was never interpreted to prohibit poll taxes, in 1962 the Twenty-fourth Amendment was adopted banning poll taxes in federal elections, and in 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966) that state poll taxes violate the Fourteenth Amendment's <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause.|$|E
5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> of the law, {{though not the}} right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|E

5|$|<b>Equal</b> <b>protection</b> {{may have}} seemed inapt to the litigants or to the Court for a case of sex {{discrimination}} in 1942, or it {{may have seemed}} inapt for a case of cross-group challenge. The Sixth Amendment was not again invoked by the Supreme Court against jury discrimination for thirty years; the Sixth Amendment did not (yet) apply to state juries, and in federal cases the Court seemed to prefer its supervisory power over lower federal courts.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Reed v.

50|$|In the Katzenbach v. Morgan case, {{decided in}} 1966, the Supreme Court {{concluded}} that Congress can forbid {{practices that are}} not themselves unconstitutional, if the law is aimed at preventing or remedying constitutional violations. On that basis, the Court upheld a provision of the Voting Rights Act that prevented states from using English language literacy tests as qualifications for voting. The Court decided that the law was a valid exercise of Congress's enforcement power under the <b>Equal</b> <b>Protections</b> Clause of Fourteenth Amendment, because it was aimed at remedying state-sponsored discrimination, despite an earlier court finding that a literacy test was not {{in and of itself}} a violation of the 14th Amendment.|$|R
5000|$|Tanzimat was an Ottoman {{reform process}} that sought <b>equal</b> <b>protections</b> {{under the law}} in Ottoman lands for all people; however, it did not address matters of {{religious}} freedom. A particular incident in 1843 with an Armenian Ottoman subject sparked an incident in August which gained international entanglements and then a Greek national in November, {{both of whom were}} put to death - the process of which became the Edict in March 1844. Reverend Edward Bickersteth referred to these developments in 1844 when he summarized diplomatic notes presented to the British Parliament noting [...] "The correspondence occupied a considerable part of the year—from Aug. 27, 1843, to April 19, 1844." ...|$|R
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution {{was adopted}} on July 9, 1868, {{as one of}} the Reconstruction Amendments. The {{amendment}} addresses citizenship rights and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> of the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly {{established}} the state's first sales tax at two percent in 1962. The {{revenues from the}} tax led {{to a host of}} new projects across the state. The General Assembly also passed the Indiana Civil Rights bill in 1963, granting <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed. Among them was one that authorized the General Assembly to meet annually instead of biennially.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) {{that affirmative action}} {{in the form of}} racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E

5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted {{in such a way}} that it does very little.|$|E
5|$|This dictum, which {{established}} that corporations enjoyed personhood under the <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts. It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, {{though it was}} challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth Amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.|$|E
5|$|While a {{defendant}} {{is entitled to}} a fair cross section in the venire, the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E

An unprecedented fundraising campaign, second only to that of Barack Obama, generated over $ 74 million. Proponents associated “traditional” heterosexual marriage with the well-being of children, tradition, and the moral content of earlychildhood family education. Their opponents countered that marriage confers dignity, <b>equal</b> <b>protections,</b> and full citizenship rights upon gays, and is a core part of the equality movement. As an institution that is legally and culturally associated with the private spheres of love and family, the debate over government definitions of marriage restages its emphatically public, state-centered parameters...|$|R
50|$|On January 23, 1967, in a nine to zero {{unanimous}} decision, the Supreme Court {{state the}} case of Whitus v. Georgia should be reversed and the law in question, being the 14th Amendment concerning <b>equal</b> <b>protections,</b> should be upheld and seen as constitutional. From the opinion of Justice Clark, the decision was overturned because {{the circumstances surrounding the}} case supported the claims of the petitioners. The claims were claims of discrimination which the Court had realized and therefore reversed the judgement. The Court of Appeals held that African Americans were purposely being excluded from the grand juries and the petit juries. The ruling to reverse the judgment and prove discrimination was based on the finding that 45% of the population was African American yet no African American had ever actually served on a jury.|$|R
