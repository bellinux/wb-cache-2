40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a dispersion process for the production of both non-magnetic and magnetic alginate beads. A combination of three different emulsifiers and silicon oil as dispersion medium is used for bead production. For bead characterization the iron and calcium content as well as the mean bead size and size distribution are determined. Light, electron and scanning force microscopy are used to describe bead morphology and surface structure. SQUID magnetometer measurements are used to determine the magnetic behaviour of the solid beads. The beads stability within a chelating agent is established by the release of the incorporated magnetite relative to the concentration of the chelating agent. To stabilize the bead chemically towards those agents, three different methods are compared. A surface coat of polyethylenimine offers the best protection. The polyethylenimin coat enables the magnetic alginate beads to separate (magnetic separation) the azo dye Kongored from its solutions.

The dispersion of impedance data over the frequency range between 100 kHz and 25 mHz comprises an inductive part and two capacitive parts. As the <b>inductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the battery is attributed to the porous nature of the electrodes, only the capacitive components have been examined. The data obtained at several SOC values of the battery have been analyzed by a non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. The presence of two depressed semicircles in the capacitive region of the Nyquist plots necessitated {{the use of an}} electrical equivalent circuit containing constant phase elements instead of capacitances. The impedance parameters corresponding to the low-frequency semicircle have been found useful for predicting the SOC of the battery, mainly because the magnitude of these parameters and their variations are more significant than those of the high-frequency semicircle. The frequency maximum (f(max)) of the semicircle, the resistive component (Z') corresponding to f(max), the phase angle (phi) in the 5. 0 Hz- 0. 1 Hz frequency range, the equivalent series resistance (R-s) and the equivalent series capacitance (C-s) have been identified as suitable parameters for predicting the SOC values of the lithium-ion battery...|$|E
40|$|The {{lightning}} current waveform has a {{major influence}} on the dynamic performance of ground electrodes. While high lightning current intensity improves the dynamic grounding performance due to ionization of the soil, very fast fronted pulses might worsen the performance in case of <b>inductive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The previous analysis has often been based on quasistatic approximation that is not applicable to very fast fronted pulses. Previous Research focused on analyzing the impulse current dispersal regularity of different branches when injecting at one point. Comparing with the leakage current distribution of a single ground electrode, it is found that the leakage currents along the branches increase with the distance to the current feed point, and the more conductors near the injection point, the more uneven the leakage current distribution is. In this paper by simulation result we indicate that shielding effect should be taken into account when analyzing the impulse characteristics of grounding electrodes. Based on the simulation results, new empirical formulas applicable for slow and very fast fronted lightning current pulses are proposed. The effects of the ionization of the soil are disregarded; therefore, the new formulas are applicable for a conservative estimate of the upper bound of the impulse impedance of ground electrodes. In this paper we also analyze and compare by the MATLAB. We also provide dynamic behavior of ground electrodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{spread of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus and other infection through drug injecting and sexual risk behaviour raises important considerations for social policy. The aims of this thesis are broadly two-fold. First, to explore and understand more about the influences on drug injectors' risk behaviour and how these influences might operate inside and outside prison. Second, to consider the impact of policy on drug injectors' lives and subsequent risk behaviour. To examine these issues a qualitative approach was adopted. Four research methods were used: in-depth interviews, a vignette, small group discussions and diary field notes. Drug injectors were contacted {{in the community and}} a total of 24 drug injectors with prison experience participated. The empirical component of the research was underpinned by {{the development of a new}} theoretical framework towards conceptualising risk <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Inductive</b> and deductive qualitative data analysis categorised perceptions of risk into three broad themes revolving around risky situations, influences on and mechanisms of risk reduction, and responses to risk behaviour. Drug injectors' views and experiences on three policy topics - the role and operation of prison drug and injecting equipment markets, mandatory drug testing, and substitute drug prescribing - were explored. This thesis raises important implications for the ways drug injectors' risk behaviour is understood and how policy responses can be better informed. Ultimately, there is a need for policies to reduce drug-related harm amongst drug injectors, especially when they spend time inside prison. That this is missing from current policy agendas results in people putting themselves and others at risk of infection. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} partial {{inductance}} concept by replacing the magnetic interaction between open filaments i and j by that be-tween filament j and a (finite) closed loop, formed by connecting the endpoints of a filament pair (i-i 0). The secondary filament i 0 is constructed by radial projection of filament i onto a cylindri-cal shell around filament j. We show that, although individual partial inductance values are modified, the <b>inductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{of the full}} circuit is invariant. Mutual inductances of distant fila-ments are particularly reduced, because the far field of a conduc-tor loop falls off much faster {{than that of a}} single filament. There-fore, it is expected that subsequent removal of such transformed off-diagonal elements from the partial inductance matrix has less effect on the overall inductive properties, so our method provides a tool to enhance robustness under matrix sparsification. We call our method “virtual screening”, because the screening filaments fi 0 g are not physically present. Symmetry of the inductance ma-trix is preserved for orthogonal networks only. We also present an extension of our method to a more gen-eral class of shells. This allows a detailed comparison of the vir-tual screening method and the “potential shift-truncate method”, introduced with spherical equipotential shells [Krauter et al. ICCAD’ 95] and extended to ellipsoidal equipotential shells re-cently [Beattie et al. IEDM’ 98]. We find strong similarities, but also differences. An interesting result {{is the fact that the}} virtual screening method with tubular shells applied to orthogonal net-works can be interpreted as a generalization of the potential shift-truncate method to non-equipotential shells, which also implies that preservation of stability is guaranteed. Some numerical results, sustaining the ideas behind our method, conclude the paper. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{work is a}} {{study of}} the {{physical}} processes responsible for the electrical interaction of GaAs devices isolated by forming them on semi-insulating GaAs. Manifestations of their interaction are backgating effects where electrical potentials on adjacent devices cause variations in current in the device of interest. Low frequency oscillations under particular circuit conditions have been reported on many occasions and are believed to be due to device interaction. GaAs MESFETs have been formed on semi-insulating buffer layers prepared by MBE at high and low temperatures as well as by ion implantation into Cr. doped GaAs. The devices have been used to compare backgating phenomena. The same structures were used to explore charge flow between isolated MESFETs. In particular, extensive use of backgate admittance spectroscopy has been made to study low frequency ac currents flowing between adjacent isolated devices. DLTS has also been applied to explore the responses of charge traps within the devices. The measurements were made at temperatures in the range 200 K to 340 K. The admittance spectra showed both capacitive and <b>inductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> with relaxations and resonances at a few hundred hertz at room temperature. Under well defined conditions of bias, frequency and temperature some of the device structures also showed negative small signal resistance which appeared {{to be related to the}} inductive effect. An important feature of the work is a comprehensive theoretical model which explains these effects in a consistent manner. This is based on charge trapping within the semi-insulating material close to the interfaces with the contact electrodes. The model agrees well with the observations and is consistent with the trap data from the DLTS experiments. The capacitive and inductive behaviours can be explained by a single trapping process but the appearance of negative resistance requires sequential trapping of electrons on at least two occasions. All of the effects were seen in the ion implanted structures as well as in those prepared on the buffer layer formed at normal growth temperatures. They were however completely absent when low temperature growth was used. It is also significant that the latter structure showed a negligible backgating effect. Tentative explanations for these differences are offered.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the thesis work were: (1), to study the oxidation of methanol and formic acid on platinum electrodes by employing conventional and advanced electrochemical methods, and (2), to develop membrane electrode assemblies based on polybenzimidazole membranes {{that can be used}} in fuel cells up to 200 °C. D. c. voltammetry and a. c. voltammetry studies of methanol and formic acid on polycrystalline platinum in sulphuric acid electrolyte were performed to determine the mechanism and kinetics of the oxidation reactions. A combined potential step and fast cyclic voltammetry experiment was employed to investigate the time dependence primarily of methanol oxidation on platinum. Charge measurements clearly demonstrated the existence of a parallel path at low potentials and short times without formation of adsorbed CO. Furthermore, experimental results showed that only the serial path, via adsorbed CO, exists during continuous cycling, with the first step being diffusion controlled dissociative adsorption of methanol directly from the bulk electrolyte. The saturation charge of adsorbed CO derived from methanol was found to be significantly lower than CO derived from formic acid or dissolved CO. This was attributed to the site requirements of the dehydrogenation steps, and possibly different compositions of linear, bridged or multiply bonded CO. The coverage of adsorbed CO from formic acid decreased significantly at potentials just outside of the hydrogen region (0. 35 V vs. RHE), while it did not start to decrease significantly until about 0. 6 V vs. RHE for methanol. Adsorbed CO from dissolved CO rapidly oxidized at potentials above about 0. 75 V due to formation of platinum oxide. Data from a. c. voltammograms from 0. 5 Hz up to 30 kHz were assembled into electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and analyzed using equivalent circuits. The main advantages of collecting EIS spectra from a. c. voltammetry experiments are the ability to directly correlate the impedance spectra with features in the corresponding d. c. voltammograms, and the ability to investigate conditions with partially covered surfaces that are inaccessible in steady-state measurements. A variety of spectral types were observed, and for methanol these showed only a single adsorption relaxation aside from the double-layer/charge-transfer relaxation, though some structure in the phase of the latter relaxation hints at another process. The charge-transfer resistance showed Tafel behaviour for potentials in the rising part of the oxidation peak consistent with a one-electron process in the rate-determining step. The rate limiting step was proposed to be the electrochemical reaction between adsorbed CO and OH at the edge of islands of OH, with competition between OH and CO adsorption for the released reaction sites. Only a single adsorption relaxation in methanol oxidation was observed, implying that only one single coverage is required to describe the state of the surface and the kinetics. It was assumed that this single coverage is that of OH, and all the surface not covered with OH is covered with CO so that the coverage of CO is not an independent variable. <b>Inductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> and negative relaxation times in the methanol oxidation were attributed to nucleation and growth behaviour. Linear voltammetry reversal and sweep-hold experiments also indicated nucleation-growth-collision behaviour in distinct potential regions, both in the forward and reverse potential scan for methanol oxidation on platinum. In both methanol oxidation and formic acid oxidation, a negative differential resistance (NDR) was observed in the potential regions that possess a negative d. c. polarization slope, and was attributed to the formation of surface oxide which inhibited the oxidation of methanol or formic acid. EIS spectra for formic acid clearly showed the presence of an additional low frequency relaxation at potentials where we expect adsorbed dissociated water or platinum oxide to be present, implying that more than one single coverage is required to describe the state of the surface and the kinetics. Two potential regions with hidden negative differential resistance (HNDR) behaviour were identified in the positive-going sweep, one prior to platinum oxide formation, assumed to involve adsorbed dissociated water, and one just negative of the main oxidation peak, assumed to involve platinum oxide. Oscillatory behaviour was found in the formic acid oxidation on platinum by adding a large external resistance to the working electrode circuit, which means that there is no longer true potentiostatic control at the interface. By revealing the system time constants, impedance measurements can be used to assist in explaining the origin of the oscillations. In the case of formic acid, these measurements showed that the oscillations do not arise from the chemical mechanism alone, but that the potential plays an essential role. Preparation and optimization of gas-diffusion electrodes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells based on phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes was performed. This fuel cell allows for operating temperatures up to 200 °C with increased tolerance towards catalytic poisons, typical carbon monoxide. In this work we employed pure hydrogen and oxygen as the fuel cell feeds, and determined the optimum morphology of the support layer, and subsequently optimized the catalytic layer with respect to platinum content in the Pt/C catalyst and PBI loading. A smooth and compact support layer with small crevices and large islands was found to be beneficial with our spraying technique in respect to adhesion to the carbon backing and to the catalyst layer. We found that a high platinum content catalyst gave a significantly thinner catalyst layer (decreased porosity) on both anode and cathode with superior performance. The PBI loading was found to be crucial for the performance of the electrodes, and a relatively high loading gave the best performing electrodes.
