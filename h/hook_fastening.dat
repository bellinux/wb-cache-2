40|$|An {{allegation}} {{of sexual assault}} was made in which a bra was torn off by the assailant causing extensive damage; however, {{it was observed that}} the <b>hook</b> and eye <b>fastening</b> was still intact. It was felt that it was not possible for a garment to receive such damage without damage to the <b>hook</b> and eye <b>fastening,</b> thus indicating that the complainant caused the damage to the bra herself to support a false allegation. Reconstruction experiments were conducted in which the conditions of the allegation were simulated utilizing a range of similar bras. Following the infliction of damage, the hook and eye fastenings were examined. In eight of nine experiments, the <b>hook</b> and eye <b>fastening</b> were intact, despite the application of enough force to cause separation of the bra cups in five of the experiments. This shows that bras may suffer extensive damage without damage to the <b>hook</b> and eye <b>fastening...</b>|$|R
60|$|The Suckers, Catostomi Bostonienses and tuberculati, Common and Horned, {{perhaps on}} an average the largest of our fishes, {{may be seen in}} shoals of a hundred or more, {{stemming}} the current in the sun, on their mysterious migrations, and sometimes sucking in the bait which the fisherman suffers to float toward them. The former, which sometimes grow to a large size, are frequently caught by the hand in the brooks, or like the red chivin, are jerked out by a <b>hook</b> <b>fastened</b> firmly {{to the end of a}} stick, and placed under their jaws. They are hardly known to the mere angler, however, not often biting at his baits, though the spearer carries home many a mess in the spring. To our village eyes, these shoals have a foreign and imposing aspect, realizing the fertility of the seas.|$|R

5000|$|Plate-and-hook fastener. Instead of pins {{inserted}} horizontally {{into the}} bedpost, an eye plate (post plate) is {{installed on the}} bedpost. The hooks are installed on the rail, either as surface mount or recessed. Depending on the hardware, the bedpost may require a mortise {{in order to allow}} the <b>hooks</b> to <b>fasten</b> to the plate. This is also referred to as a keyhole fastener, especially if the connector is more of a [...] "plug" [...] than a [...] "hook".|$|R
500|$|The trick {{has since}} been often {{repeated}} and explained. The medium must have the semblance of key-board, made of some light material, concealed in his coat sleeve or about his person. This he attaches {{to the bottom of}} the accordion which he holds in his hand. Then when unobserved, while the learned professor is [...] "taking down his notes" [...] for the public press, he reverses the accordion, and attaching the false keyboard on the bottom by means of a small hook attached to it, fastens it to the side of the basket; having now the real keyboard in his hand he is able to produce musical sounds. Afterward the accordion floated about in the basket under the table, without the contact of Mr. Home's hand. This subsequent phenomenon was given to avoid immediate examination of the first by keeping Professor Crookes in suspense, and giving the medium time to reverse the instrument and conceal in his clothing the false key-board which had been on the bottom of the instrument. The accordion was suspended by means of a small <b>hook</b> <b>fastened</b> to dark thread, which would be invisible in the gas-light.|$|R

Sometimes a gold bead head is added for weight {{and stability in}} the water and a strand of pheasant feather is added for a tail.The bead head can be fastened near the eye of the hook. This pattern is commonly tied on size 10 - 16 nymph hooks. Traditional colouring is a brown body with orange or brown thread.|$|R

50|$|The turf log was {{fastened}} to the roof boards and underlying rafters with naturally grown wooden hooks, preferably from durable juniper. The <b>hooks</b> were <b>fastened</b> with wooden pegs and covered by additional sheets of birch bark. Turf logs are also {{known to have been}} held in place by rafters hewn from logs with one root branch left to form a bracket. This method made for extremely cumbersome maintenance. When the brackets disintegrated, one would have to tear up the whole roof to renew all the rafters. A more refined fastening device was the kolv, an elaborately shaped stick of wood, around 60 cm long, pegged to the roof and extended {{through a hole in the}} turf log. Its wider protruding head would hold the log in place.|$|R

40|$|Registers of the {{mercenary}} infantry give many {{information about}} types of weapon and its quality. In Warsaw archive we have rolls from 1471, 1477 and 1496 - 1500 {{with information about}} 7000 mercenaries. In rolls we meet different descriptions of quality of crossbows like: good, bed, new, old, used, repaired. We can clasify about 47 % of crossbows as bed, basing on the sources from 1471 and 1477, which contain all these terms. In 1496 we have 14 %, and in 1498 - 22 % bad or old crossbows. Registers give also information about different types of crossbows used by soldiers. They had crossbows with two kinds of bow - horn or steel. Only two from 597 mercenaries had this last type in 1496, similary in 1498, 9 from 725 crossbowmen possesed steel bows. Soldiers used three types of bend mechanism. The oldest one hed the bow-string stretched by <b>hook</b> <b>fastened</b> to soldier’s belt. This type is named kryg in Polish sources. Second kind of belt mechanism is goat’s foot called hewar in medieval Poland (from word „lewar” - lever). Drawing mechanism, which we know as cranequin or windelass appeared in sources as klyky (from Czech word klika - crank) {{and this is the}} third kind of mechanism. All these three different kinds of drawing mechanism could be used by soldiers of the one troop at the same time. Second typ of shooting weapon was bow. This kind of arms was unpopular among mercenaries in end of XV c. Only two soldiers used bows. First bow we meet in 1498 (it is 1 from 725 shooters). Second men with bow appeared in 1500 (rolls from this year mention 1 bowmen among 72 crossbowmen). Zadanie pt.

6000|$|In {{this same}} night, they {{lost sight of}} one of the caravels, and for three dark and stormy days gave it up for lost. At length, to their great relief, it rejoined the squadron, having lost its boat, and been obliged to cut its cable, in an attempt to anchor on a boisterous coast, and having since been driven to and fro by the storm. For one or two days, there was an {{interval}} of calm, and the tempest-tossed mariners had time to breathe. They looked upon this tranquillity, however, as deceitful, and, in their gloomy mood, beheld every thing with a doubtful and foreboding eye. Great numbers of sharks, so abundant and ravenous in these latitudes, were seen about the ships. This was construed into an evil omen; for among the superstitions of the seas, it is believed that these voracious fish can smell dead bodies at a distance; that they have a kind of presentiment of their prey; and keep about vessels which have sick persons on board, or which are in danger of being wrecked. Several of these fish they caught, using large <b>hooks</b> <b>fastened</b> to chains, and sometimes baited merely with a piece of colored cloth. From the maw of one they took out a living tortoise; from that of another the head of a shark, recently thrown from one of the ships; such is the indiscriminate voracity of these terrors of the ocean. Notwithstanding their superstitious fancies, the seamen were glad to use a part of these sharks for food, being very short of provisions. The length of the voyage had consumed the greater part of their sea-stores; the heat and humidity of the climate, and the leakage of the ships, had damaged the remainder, and their biscuit was so filled with worms, that, notwithstanding their hunger, they were obliged to eat it in the dark, lest their stomachs should revolt at its appearance.

60|$|What a {{good time}} our {{ancestors}} must have had was borne in upon me when, on one occasion, I appeared in character at a fancy dress ball. What I represented I am unable to say, and I don't particularly care. I only know it was something military. I also remember that the costume was two sizes too small {{for me in the}} chest, and thereabouts; and three sizes too large for me in the hat. I padded the hat, and dined {{in the middle of the}} day off a chop and half a glass of soda-water. I have gained prizes as a boy for mathematics, also for scripture history--not often, but I have done it. A literary critic, now dead, once praised a book of mine. I know there have been occasions when my conduct has won the approbation of good men; but never--never in my whole life, have I felt more proud, more satisfied with myself than on that evening when, the last <b>hook</b> <b>fastened,</b> I gazed at my full-length Self in the cheval glass. I was a dream. I say it who should not; but I am not the only one who said it. I was a glittering dream. The groundwork was red, trimmed with gold braid wherever there was room for gold braid; and where there was no more possible room for gold braid there hung gold cords, and tassels, and straps. Gold buttons and buckles fastened me, gold embroidered belts and sashes caressed me, white horse-hair plumes waved o'er me. I am not sure that everything was in its proper place, but I managed to get everything on somehow, and I looked well. It suited me. My success was a revelation to me of female human nature. Girls who had hitherto been cold and distant gathered round me, timidly solicitous of notice. Girls on whom I smiled lost their heads and gave themselves airs. Girls who were not introduced to me sulked and were rude to girls that had been. For one poor child, with whom I sat out two dances (at least she sat, while I stood gracefully beside her--I had been advised, by the costumier, NOT to sit), I was sorry. He was a worthy young fellow, the son of a cotton broker, and he would have made her a good husband, I feel sure. But he was foolish to come as a beer-bottle.|$|R

5000|$|Girdle {{books were}} a variant on {{other forms of}} medieval {{book-binding}} in which the leather or cloth continued loose beyond {{the edges of the}} hard cover. Especially for small personal books like the Book of Hours, the leather often extended sideways, which gave extra protection for the book when not in use - the loose edges could be wrapped round, and often buckles or laces enabled the book to be securely closed. In addition, when reading, the book could be held from outside the cover, so that the clean inside surface of the leather, rather than the thumbs of the reader, touched the pages. This stopped the pages acquiring the dirty patches in the lower margins that many medieval books have. These too are often shown in art, although it is noticeable that readers are often not making full use of the protective way of holding the book.The knot used for the handle was a Turk's head knot, so named for similar appearance to the turbans worn by medieval Muslims of the Turkish Empire. Sometimes the girdle book had a <b>hook</b> that <b>fastened</b> to the belt; [...] "a hinge connected the hook to the flap of the binding, allowing maximal movement of the book while it was still attached." ...|$|R
