5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E
500|$|I was {{surprised}} by how people reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] because when I did that song, to me, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> about how something made me feel a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E

On {{the lyric}} side of things, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know why that is. People quite often say, 'oh, you write these sad lyrics but you're not a sad person' - and I'm not... I don't think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side." ...|$|E
500|$|Celine Dion {{performed}} the song {{as part of}} her A New Day... concert at Caesars Palace. The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is the one I had the most kick out of in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing.</b> We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure." [...] Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version.|$|E
500|$|According to the drummer, Jackson, Redding wrote [...] "Respect", after a {{conversation}} they had {{during a break}} in the recording session, in which he told Redding: [...] "You're on the road all the time. All you can look for is a little respect when you come home." [...] An alternative story is told by Redding's friend and road manager, Earl [...] "Speedo" [...] Sims, who states that the song [...] "came from a group <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> with", and that even though Redding rewrote it, [...] "a lot of the lyric was still there"; Sims adds: [...] "He told me I would get a credit, but I never did". [...] Sims also states that he sang the backing chorus of [...] "Hey hey hey". The song used for the fifth track, [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long", had been previously recorded in mono with Booker T. Jones on piano and released as a single in April 1965, becoming a number-two hit on Billboards R chart; it was rerecorded in stereo for the album.|$|E
5000|$|He has stated: [...] "I love to take common sayings, pervert them, mutate them a little. So {{you think}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> one thing, {{but when you}} read it, it is different." ...|$|R

5000|$|Asked {{if there}} was {{anything}} about their videos they'd like to change, drummer Roger Taylor commented, [...] "The only part of a video <b>I</b> would change <b>is</b> the end of [...] "Is There Something I Should Know?" [...] where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> to the camera. I look very uncomfortable doing this and cringe every time I see it to this day." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Four Rusted Horses" [...] is a blues-inspired rock song, and was {{compared}} {{to the work of}} The Doors and Johnny Cash. Manson described its lyric as being [...] "almost a nursery rhyme. [...] everyone thinks that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> about the apocalypse, but it's more just about the four of us, my band, that managed to survive through all of this, and {{where do we go from}} here." [...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 interview, American {{recording}} artist Lady Gaga stated {{that she was}} inspired by Aguilera's version of the track, saying, [...] "When I was 15, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> 'I Turn to You' {{at the top of}} my lungs trying to hit all her notes. So she was an inspiration to me to have a wider vocal range." [...] Most recently, the song was used as a battle song between contestants Beth Spangler and Mia Pfirrman during the seventh season of the American singing competition The Voice.|$|E
5000|$|On March 11, 2009 Michael Wines of the New York Times {{mentioned}} professor Cui Weiping as saying: [...] "Its underlying tone is: I {{know you}} do not allow me to say certain things. See, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> completely cooperative, right?... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> a cute children’s song — <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a grass-mud horse!

5000|$|Denver {{explained}} this {{himself in the}} liner notes by {{saying that he had}} picked the numbers most requested in his concerts, but that [...] "I felt that some of these songs had grown a bit, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> better than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> four or five years ago, and that I would like to treat some of the songs a little differently than I had in the original recordings." ...|$|R

2500|$|Teachers and {{students}} alike at Moorland Road School noticed Bassey's strong voice, but gave the pre-teen little encouragement: [...] "...everyone {{told me to}} shut up. Even in the school choir the teacher kept telling me to back off till <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> in the corridor!" [...] A classmate recalled her singing the refrain [...] "Can't help lovin' that man of mine" [...] from Show Boat with such feeling that she made their teacher uncomfortable. After leaving Splott Secondary Modern School {{at the age of}} 14, Bassey found employment at the Curran Steels factory while singing in public houses and clubs in the evenings and on weekends.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he wrote}} [...] "This Town Ain't Big Enough For Both of Us", Ron could only play {{it in that}} key. It was so much work to {{transpose}} the song and one of us had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain't a [...] "rock" [...] voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about [...] "guts". It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.|$|E
2500|$|Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly took a major {{swipe at}} Scherzinger {{for her role}} as lead singer. Watson said, [...] "there are two kinds of girl groups: those {{anchored}} by a superstar (the Supremes, Destiny's Child), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts (Spice Girls, TLC). The Pussycat Dolls are neither – they're a brand, not a band. [...] 2005's multi-platinum PCD finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no Beyoncé." [...] Scherzinger has claimed that she was responsible for both lead and backing vocals on the group's songs, with hardly anything sung by the other members. She commented, [...] "...people don't even know the story. I was in the center because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing.</b> I was the one singing." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song is {{in praise}} of Corsica itself, with Fiori likening the island to a mother taking pity on all who come to her. The {{majority}} of the song is in French, however Fiori also tells the island [...] "tonight <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> in Corsican for you", which he then does, <b>singing</b> that it <b>is</b> {{as if the whole}} world were doing so. Fiori also recorded a German language version of the song, [...] "Mama Korsika".|$|R
2500|$|Combining {{these two}} things, shoegaze act My Bloody Valentine have {{influenced}} Parker's music with their contrasting combination of loud guitars and ethereal melodies. Parker has [...] "always {{been in love}} with the wall of sound as employed by My Bloody Valentine" [...] and he tries to capture that [...] "melancholy dreamy feel". Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing,</b> I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy. The instruments are quite sonically brutal, but the voice is really soft, and I think that kind of resonates with people. It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time." [...] Tame Impala live keyboardist Jay Waston has described Parker's music as containing [...] "shoegazey guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{met him at}} the Blackboard Café in Bakersfield, California, {{which was}} the place to go in '61. [...] He was already famous for not showing up or showing up drunk, and he showed up drunk. [...] I was onstage - I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> Marty Robbins' 'Devil Woman' - and he kicked the doors of the office open and said 'Who the fuck is that?' [...] It was one of the {{greatest}} compliments of my entire life when George Jones said I was his favorite country singer...In 1967, I released a ballad called [...] "I Threw Away The Rose" [...] and he was so impressed he actually jumped ship and left his tour, rented a Lear Jet and came to Amarillo, Texas. [...] He told me my low note changed his life. [...] He also folded my steel guitarist Fuzzy Owen in a rollaway bed and rolled him out on the street. [...] That was the pinnacle." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liner}} notes of Alexandria the Great she wrote:"My {{grandmother}} on my mother's side was a minister, my grandmother on my father's side was a minister, and my mother's sister {{is married to}} a Methodist minister so this influence is very strong. Everyone in my family sings." [...] In the mid 1960s while being interviewed for a piece in the jazz magazine Down Beat, she said that:"I tried actually to divorce myself from singing with religious overtones or aspects...Maybe it’s because I had this kind of background. The Gospelizing or use of so-called “soul” singing – that sort of thing – has become very large in the business. [...] I'm not a shouter and I'm not a Gospel singer. I wasn't a Gospel singer when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> in the church. I can't yell; I can't do this other thing. But I was effective... Anybody can sing spiritually without being labeled a Gospel singer." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the American Dad! episode [...] "Max Jets", 'My Love <b>Is</b> Pure' <b>is</b> <b>sung</b> by a gold-digging {{waitress}} named Gina. The song {{ends with}} her saying, [...] "Hands Across America, b***hes." ...|$|R

5000|$|She {{turned down}} Darryl Payne's song [...] "Over Like a Fat Rat" [...] {{and passed it}} to Fonda Rae because she wasn't fond {{of the concept of}} a song that is [...] "about a rat," [...] {{defending}} her position, [...] "Anything <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> has to make sense to me and tell a story." [...] Rae's version which turned into a minor club hit was appraised by Williams, [...] "and she did a fantastic job. The way they arranged it—it was amazing." ...|$|R
2500|$|Minor Threat's song [...] "Guilty of Being White" [...] {{led to some}} {{accusations of}} racism, but MacKaye has {{strongly}} denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words. He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School, whose student population was 70 percent black, inspired the song. There, many students bullied MacKaye and his friends. Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song, with the last iteration of the lyric [...] "Guilty of being white" [...] changed to [...] "Guilty of being right." [...] In an interview, MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics, saying, [...] "To me, {{at the time and}} now, it seemed clear it's an anti-racist song. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> to would ever have to actually ponder the lyrics or even consider them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams hired {{producer}} Keith Crouch and R group Somethin' for the People to {{work with}} Norwood, and within eight months the team crafted Brandy. A collection of street-oriented rhythm-and-blues with a hip hop edge, whose lyrical content embraced her youthful and innocent image in public, Norwood later summed up the songs on the album as young and vulnerable, stating, [...] "I didn’t really know a lot—all I {{wanted to do was}} basically sing. You can just tell that it’s a person singing from a genuine place, and also a place of basically no experience. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> about being attracted to the opposite sex, but I had no experience behind it." [...] Released in September 1994, the album peaked at number twenty on the U.S. Billboard 200. Critical reaction to Brandy was generally positive, with AllMusic writer Eddie Huffman declaring Brandy [...] "a lower-key Janet Jackson or a more stripped-down Mary J. Blige [...] with good songs and crisp production." [...] Anderson Jones of Entertainment Weekly asserted, [...] "Teen actress Norwood acts her age. A premature effort at best, that seems based on the philosophy 'If Aaliyah can do it, why can't I?'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} nearly {{complete}} {{in the fall}} of 1956, but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first. Robbins was involved with Bells Are Ringing, then Bernstein with Candide, and in January 1957 A Clearing in the Woods, Laurents' latest play, opened and quickly closed. When a backers' audition failed to raise any money for West Side Story late in the spring of 1957, only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals, producer Cheryl Crawford pulled out of the project. Every other producer had already turned down the show, deeming it too dark and depressing. Bernstein was despondent, but Sondheim convinced his friend Hal Prince, who was in Boston overseeing the out-of-town tryout of the new George Abbott musical New Girl in Town, to read the script. He liked it but decided to ask Abbott, his longtime mentor, for his opinion, and Abbott advised him to turn it down. Prince, aware that Abbott was the primary reason New Girl was in trouble, decided to ignore him, and he and his producing partner Robert Griffith flew to New York to hear the score. In his memoirs, Prince recalled, [...] "Sondheim and Bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music, and soon <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> along with them." ...|$|E

5000|$|Colbie {{spoke about}} the video in an interview:"It’s a really cool concept. Common and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> on the rooftop of this house, {{overlooking}} the beach in Venice California. Basically the music travels down throughout the town and though the beach. It hits everyone and they all start singing it, and these people in their bathing suits walking on the boardwalk or guys on skateboards, they all find the music and {{come up to me}} and Common on the rooftop and watch us perform for them." ...|$|R
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> with a certain volume in my voice. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>singing</b> the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|R
