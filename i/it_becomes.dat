5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
