For LFR, two core variants were modeled: with active core part 90 cm and 120 cm tall. Monte Carlo code {{was used for}} neutronics and <b>European</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Code</b> EAC- 2 for severe safety studies. It is shown that both 1500 MWth LFR and SFR start-up cores can transmute on average 70 kg of MAs annually in the homogeneous mode. In this case, 5 % of MAs were admixed to the core fuel. More than 110 kg of MAs can be burned per year when 10 % of MAs are additionally added to axial and radial blankets. LFR core designs show advantages over SFR cores regarding severe safety behavior due to higher thermal inertia, better natural circulation behavior and the higher boiling point of lead. JRC.

40|$|ONE ASPECT OF FAST REACTOR SAFETY ANALYSIS CONSISTS OF CALCULATING THE STRONGLY COUPLED SYSTEM OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE REACTIVITY BALANCE IN HYPOTHETICAL WHOLE-CORE ACCIDENTS: THESE PHENOMENA ARE NEUTRONICS, FUEL BEHAVIOUR AND HEAT TRANSFER TOGETHER WITH COOLANT THERMO-HYDRAULICS IN SINGLE- AND TWO-PHASE FLOW. TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS IN FUEL, COOLANT AND NEIGHBOURING STRUCTURES INDUCE, IN FACT,THERMAL REACTIVITY FEEDBACKS WHICH ARE ADDED UP AND PUT IN THE NEUTRONICS CALCULATION TO PREDICT THE NEUTRON FLUX AND THE SUBSEQUENT HEAT GENERATION IN THE REACTOR.

40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} SARNET (Severe Accident Research NETwork), in the EU 6 th Framework {{programme}} was {{to integrate}} in a sustainable manner the research capabilities of fifty-one European organisations from eighteen member states of the European Union (EU) plus the Joint Research Centres, with one Canadian company, to resolve important remaining uncertainties and safety issues concerning existing and future nuclear plant, especially water-cooled reactors, under hypothetical severe accident conditions. It emphasised integrating activities, spreading of excellence (including knowledge transfer) and jointly executed research, with the knowledge gained being encapsulated in the <b>European</b> severe <b>accident</b> modelling <b>code</b> ASTEC. This paper summarises the achievements over the whole project in the Source Term Topic, which dealt with potential radioactive release to the environment, covering release of fission products and structural materials from the core, their transport in the primary circuit, and their behaviour in the containment. The main technical areas covered, as emphasised by the earlier EURSAFE project, were the effect of oxidative conditions on fission product release and transport (especially the behaviour of the highly radiotoxic ruthenium under air ingress conditions), iodine volatility in the primary circuit, control rod aerosol release (Ag¿In¿Cd) that affects iodine transport, containment by-pass {{in the case of}} steam generator tube rupture, aerosol retention in containment cracks, aerosol remobilisation in the circuit, and iodine/ruthenium behaviour in the containment especially concerning the volatile fraction in the atmosphere. The studies also covered performance of new experiments, analysis of existing data, and formulation and improvement of theoretical models. Significant progress was made in each area. Looking to the future, the 7 th Framework successor project SARNET 2 covers the remaining issues concerning iodine and ruthenium, including practical application of the results.

40|$|In-flight Spatial Disorientation (SD) in pilots is {{a serious}} threat to {{aviation}} safety. Indeed, SD may play a much larger role in aviation accidents than the approximate 6 - 8 % reported by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) each year, because some <b>accidents</b> <b>coded</b> by the NTSB as aircraft control-not maintained (ACNM) may actually result from SD. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether SD is underestimated as a cause of fatal general aviation (GA) accidents in the NTSB database. Fatal GA airplane accidents occurring between January 1995 and December 1999 were reviewed from the NTSB aviation <b>accident</b> database. Cases <b>coded</b> as ACNM or SD as the probable cause were selected for review by a panel of aerospace medicine specialists. Using a rating scale, each rater was instructed to determine if SD was the probable cause of the accident. Agreement between the raters and agreement between the raters and the NTSB were evaluated by Kappa statistics. The raters agreed that 11 out of 20 (55 %) <b>accidents</b> <b>coded</b> by the NTSB as ACNM were probably caused by SD (p less than 0. 05). Agreement between the raters and the NTSB did not reach significance (p greater than 0. 05). The 95 % C.

Aerospace medicine specialists agreed that some cases coded by the NTSB as ACNM were probably caused by SD. Consequently, a larger number of accidents may be caused by the pilot succumbing to SD than indicated in the NTSB database. This new information should encourage regulating agencies to insure that pilots receive SD recognition training, enabling them to take appropriate corrective actions during flight. This could lead to new training standards, ultimately saving lives among GA airplane pilots...|$|R

The main object of the VRUITS project was to research how Intelligent Transport Systems can contribute to improve the safety, mobility and comfort of Vulnerable Road Users. The accident analysis performed in the VRUITS project focused on specific road user types for which statistics are available: pedestrians, cyclists and PTW riders, which include low speed scooters, mopeds and motorcyclists, are treated as separate groups. The VRUITS project started by identifying the most critical traffic scenarios for VRUs, through analysis of both <b>European</b> <b>accident</b> databases, such as CARE, and national databases [4].

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of pre-test calculations of the PHEBUS FPT 3 experiment. The test scenario with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions was provided by the Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire. For the analyses, three severe <b>accident</b> <b>codes</b> were used: ATHLET-CD, ICARE 2 and MELCOR, respectively. The calculations were focused on the main phenomena occurring in the bundle such as the thermal behaviour, the hydrogen production mainly due to cladding oxidation, the massive degradation of spent fuel and the release of fission products, control rod and structure materials. Using the pre-defined boundary and initial conditions, relatively small deviations between the code results were obtained, which demonstrates that the dominant processes occurring during a severe accident in the core of PWR reactors can be adequately simulated. By applying these codes to a large spectrum of integral tests as well as to plant analyses, one will obtain reliable results on the fuel bundle behaviour. However, the spread in the calculated oxidised boron carbide masses indicates that modelling efforts are still necessary in all the codes in this respect. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R
