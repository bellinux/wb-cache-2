The process development comprises nitriding of newly developed chromium containing martensitic steels at temperatures above A_ 3 with subsequent direct hardening for {{generation of the}} martensitic structure. The derivation of treatment parameters was assisted by a computer program for calculation of the nitrogen solubility {{as a function of}} temperature, pressure and alloy composition. For characterization of the nitriding efficiency, nitrogen concentration profiles were followed as a function of time of nitriding and described by diffusion kinetics.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Path {{dependent}} and time-dependent constitutive models and experience with their use for numerical simulation of field performance {{of concrete and}} rockfill dams are described in the paper. For the mechanical part of the solutions, a combined model using path dependent incrementaly-linear elasticity in the pre-peak regime and theory of plasticity in the peak regime is applied. Using proper switch functions and path dependent relations for calculating tangent values of the conventional deformational characteristics, the function of <b>double</b> <b>hardening</b> elastic-plastic models is approximated. For the time dependent part of the solutions, the theory of multiface viscoplasticity with two and three viscoplastic surfaces is applied. The two-surface model allowed simulating the observed viscoplastic flow of weak marly shale in foundation of a concrete dam displaying unusual behaviour. Viscoplastic flow with three surfaces was successfully applied for modelling long-term creep of rockfill. This model and its application for Sance Rockfill Dam are described in more detail. ...|$|E

The experimental program {{was conducted on}} both solid and hollow cylinder specimens, including isotropic, triaxial compression and torsional loading at various stress levels. The results are used {{in an attempt to}} numerically simulate the behaviour of the sand using Lade’s <b>Double</b> <b>Hardening</b> model and evaluate is predictive capabilities.

The numerical analysis has been based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and by using the finite element software ICFEP (Imperial College Finite Element Programme).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a new formulation of a well known <b>double</b> <b>hardening</b> model {{often referred to}} as the Hardening Soil model. As an alternative to the existing Hardening Soil model’s Mohr-Coulomb failure surface, the new formulation allows for the incorporation of smooth failure surfaces, such as the failure surface proposed by Matsuoka & Nakai or that proposed by Lade & Duncan. Although the incorporation of all other failure criteria that can be formulated as a function of the Lode angle is also possible, the examples presented at the end of this paper concentrate on the Hardening Soil model with Matsuoka-Nakai failure criterion. The Lode angle dependent formulation with Matsuoka-Nakai yield surface is validated in element tests and in an excavation example. A comparison between results obtained from the Hardening Soil model with the Mohr-Coulomb type yield surface and that with the Mastuoka-Nakai type yield surface reveals the failure criterion’s actual influence on material strength and stiffness when applied in the Hardening Soil Model in plane strain conditions. ...|$|E

It is primarily because of their growing mistrust of Osborn, with Namor's discoveries of the Sentry slaying the Atlantean terrorists but initially containing his rage [...] but later joining the Dark X-Men because of his romance with Emma Frost, who convinced him to join the Dark X-Men and psychically enters his mind, seeking to uncover the answers to some of her questions. Frost extended an invitation to Cloak and Dagger to join the true X-Men as they teleported to the newly created island base, Utopia. Both Frost and Namor's relationship with Osborn appear to be deeply strained at this point, with the former Green Goblin telling the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men to bring him Namor's head and Emma Frost's heart and that Summers sees them do it. Emma Frost and Namor both officially quit the Cabal, to be replaced with two new members, [...] "without the other remaining Cabal members having any say in the matter" [...] in Siege: The Cabal. However, an enraged and vengeful Osborn now unhesitantly strives to destroy Namor and his people as payback for his betrayal and joining the X-Men. Emma Frost promises to help him as he has helped her and her team, and the entire team of X-Men immediately work to investigate the Atlantean casualties, evacuate the survivors, and aid Namor against this mysterious new marine threat, the Marrina-Monster. Namor is forced to kill his former lover to stop her, but soon confronts Osborn over his controlling her to get revenge on Namor, vowing to kill him for his crimes. Though the actual confrontation is unseen, later Namor's name is seen crossed out on Osborn's List. Elsewhere, Namor and Reed Richards reach the tomb of Captain America, but discovers no dead body of their fallen comrade, to the shock of both men. Despite Doom's displeasure at Osborn's moving against Namor in Siege: The Cabal and his demanding Osborn stop his course of revenge (which led to the destruction of their own alliance), it is revealed that as [...] "every hero involved in the coming conflict desires vengeance on Doom for various reasons", Emma Frost and Namor, now both members in good standing of the X-Men, will also seek to make Doom pay for his treachery against them, in DoomWar, which indicates that for a variety of reasons, from Doom's capturing of the X-Man Storm to his deceptive attempt to convince Shuri that it was actually Namor who had assaulted her brother, has destroyed Doom's once-strong alliance with Namor. Furthermore, Doom has also claimed that he does not trust Namor, due to the two of them having clashed after they allied against common foes in the past, and should his alliance with Namor fail, with Namor turning on him, {{he would be willing to}} join forces with Attuma, an arch-enemy of Namor's, and one he believes could serve as a [...] "counter" [...] to Namor. At some point into the Dark Reign after the formation of the Cabal, though it is depicted that a large portion of Atlantean civilians still reside in the oceans under Namor's rule, Namor makes it clear that the Atlantean military is still residing in Latveria, when he proposes for an Atlantean mutant to move to Latveria with them, though no such military force was seen when Doom was assaulted by Morgan le Fay [...] or when the Asgardians moved into Latveria. However, Namor, after the events of Utopia, reveals to the X-Men upon Osborn's schemes causing hundreds if not thousands of his people to perish, that the Atlantean military force were far away, [...] "outside" [...] of Latveria, implying that though his alliance with Osborn has been destroyed, his alliance with Doctor Doom in some form still exists.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. Case hardening is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. Case hardened products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. Case hardening is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by case hardening. Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by case hardening did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the case hardened steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the case hardening process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum case hardening process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce case hardened steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of case hardening courses. A total of 11 case hardening courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of <b>double</b> and triple <b>hardening.</b> Before the case hardening the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the case hardened and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the case hardened samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the case hardening did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the case hardened target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|R

40|$|Negative skin {{friction}} {{is considered one}} of the problems in the design of piled foundations in soft soil. The negative {{skin friction}} induces an additional compressive force on the pile called the dragload as well as, an additional pile movement called the downdrag. Ignoring the effect of negative skin friction in the design of piles leads to structural, and serviceability problems. The dragload depends on various factors such as, pile characteristics (method of installation, material, and surface treatment), soil properties (shear strength and compressibility), pile–soil relative movement, and degree of consolidation. In this paper, an axisymmetric finite element model was used to simulate, and analyze the pile–soil interaction problem of negative skin friction. The soft soil was simulated by the <b>double</b> <b>hardening</b> soil model, and the pile was described by a linear elastic model. A field case study for two instrumented end bearing driven pipe precast concrete piles in Bangkok soft clay was back analyzed. The various approaches to model the pile element, and load configurations were analyzed, and compared. An extensive parametric study was carried out to investigate the effect of different factors on the dragload value, neutral plane location, slip length, and pile movement...|$|E

There is no evidence of any 'critical point' to indicate an epicuticular wax layer. Water is readily lost and taken up through the cuticle, the effect of the spiracles and of excretion being negligible. Despite great sensitivity to desiccation, there is nevertheless some degree of impermeability. The cuticle is in many ways similar to that of an insect: it is composed of a 'cuti-culin ' epicuticle, a 'tanned ' chitinous exocuticle, and a laminated endocuticle of two optically distinguishable layers. The outer endocuticle is strongly calcified. The cuticle is penetrated by pore canals and the ducts of dermal glands. The latter are concerned with the production of exo- and endocuticle, and the secretion of the poly-phenols which tan the protein of the exocuticle. The <b>double</b> <b>hardening</b> is probably a specialized condition of millipedes. Transpiration is almost quadrupled by extraction with hot, but not cold chloro-form, as the exocuticle is impregnated with lipoids which reduce permeability.

[...] University of Washington, 1996 This {{dissertation}} presents: (i) {{a simple}} but general soil model; and (ii) a general computational framework, enabling the development of efficient interactive software {{for the analysis of}} dynamic soil-structure interaction problems. With regard to the model, a general, non-associative, elasto-plastic soil model has been developed. An alternate volume change behavior of soils characterizing isotropic compression and extension with exponential and power laws respectively is proposed and included in the model. Distinct volumetric and distortional (shear) mechanisms are used based on <b>double</b> <b>hardening</b> concepts. An optimization scheme is used to estimate the model parameters using experimental results for a given soil. Essential features of sands such as path dependent dilatancy, hardening and softening, liquefaction, initial and induced anisotropy and that of clay are reproduced with unprecedented accuracy for a model of this simplicity. With regard to the computational framework, a general computational framework is presented based on object-oriented programming for the analysis of soil-structure interaction problems. Based on this framework, a prototype finite element program (SAND) has been developed implementing an iterative direct solution scheme, and a new kind of efficient interface element has been derived.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{application}} and validation of a <b>Double</b> <b>Hardening</b> Soil Model(DHSM). In this model, two hardening mechanism are comprised named volumetric hardening from a unified Critical state model for Clays and sands (CASM) by Yu (1998) and shear hardening from Hardening soil model (HSM). The basic equations and corresponding parameters are discussed. Some improvements and modifications of DHSM are introduced and the constitutive model is implemented in to Plaxis finite element code. In addition, a serial of tests on low plasticity clay performed by Gens (1982) have been carried out. Among them, drained tests including different consolidation rate and isotropic-anisotropic condition on the low plasticity clay are identified and applied by DHSM program. Variety of complex geomaterial behaviors are examined and studied based on both laboratory and numerical simulation results. Through the results, the model corresponds well with the drained test through real parameters especially during overconsolidated condition. The strain rate can be significantly decreased during hardening process which is more closed to the real behavior. Meanwhile, the enhanced model E-DHSM proved to be powerful in the “dry side” state which agrees well with the deviatoric stress. Finally, considering various consolidation condition, the framework of DHSM agrees well {{in a wide range}} of soil tests and geomaterial behavior. It proved to be powerful for implementation and application in soil behavior...|$|E
