5|$|M-56 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the southeastern part of the US state of Michigan. It existed from 1919 until 1957. The highway ran north from Monroe, where it connected with US Highway24 (US24, Telegraph Road), to <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> where it terminated at an intersection with US24/US25. Before a series of truncations in the 1950s, the highway continued along the Huron River to New Boston and Belleville. The trunkline was progressively scaled back to <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> before being decommissioned in 1957.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, M-56 was {{assigned}} to roadways that ran northeasterly from the Ohio state line to the Belleville area. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the southern section between the state line and Monroe was redesignated as a section of US25. In the 1940s, the northern end was rerouted north from New Boston to follow M-112 along the Willow Run Expressway (now I-94 {{and part of the}} Detroit Industrial Freeway) into Belleville north to US112. In late 1954 or early 1955, the northern end was changed again, this time truncating the highway to end at New Boston. The northern end was shortened again to terminate at US24/US25 in <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> in 1956. The remainder of the highway from Monroe to <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> was removed and decommissioned from the state highway system the next year, becoming county roads under the jurisdiction of Monroe and Wayne counties.|$|E

5|$|When it was {{decommissioned}} in 1957, M-56 {{started at}} an intersection with US24 (Telegraph Road) {{on the west}} side of Monroe. From there, the trunkline ran southeasterly along Elm Avenue to an intersection with US25 (Dixie Highway, now M-125) in downtown. M-56 also intersected US24A (now Interstate75) just outside town. The highway continued northeasterly past Sterling State Park and along Brest Bay in the communities of Detroit Beach and Woodland Beach. Turning inland near Stony Point, the trunkline followed Dixie Highway across the Swan Creek. North of the creek, Dixie Highway met US Turnpike, and M-56 followed Dixie Highway northward into South Rockwood. In that village, the trunkline turned northeasterly parallel to US24 to cross the Huron River. On the north side of the river, M-56 followed the southernmost end of Fort Street to Huron River Drive, turning northwesterly along the latter road. The highway ran through an intersection with US 24A and parallel to the river into <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock,</b> where it terminated at the intersection with US24/US25 (Telegraph Road, now just US24).|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy propane tank was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area. A grocery store, two apartment complexes, and a funeral home were destroyed as well.|$|E

Ford and Mazda remain strategic partners through exchanges of technological information and joint ventures, including an American joint venture plant in <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock,</b> Michigan called Auto Alliance. Ford sold the United Kingdom-based Jaguar and Land Rover companies and brands to Tata Motors of India in March 2008. In 2015, Ford sold its remaining 3% stake in Mazda.|$|E
25|$|Over {{its history}} Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine {{terminals}} located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock,</b> Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In {{each of the}} cities GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1910 the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek and rail car repair and maintenance was handled by GTW's Port Huron car shops. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction pointes. There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee Junction area in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad's rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail in 1976. On Chicago's south side GTW's Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into {{the city in the}} 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junctions Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975 GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as Railport. The facility is in Chicago's Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976 when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called GT MoTerm. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton's former hump classification yard in <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock,</b> which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several interlocking and crossing gate towers were also maintained by GTW through its history.|$|E

25|$|In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, {{the highway}} {{followed}} {{what is now}} M-129 from Sault Ste. Marie to Pickford and then west to follow a short portion of former U.S. Route 2, replaced by Mackinaw Trail. It crossed the Straits of Mackinac and then used what is now U.S. Route 23 and old U.S. Route 10 to Detroit. Currently it still exists in Michigan as {{the name of a}} secondary road from Saginaw southeast to the county line (as an alternate route to Flint), from southeast Flint to northwest Pontiac, and from <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> southwest to Monroe ending at the state line. A short section of the Dixie Highway in northwest lower Michigan running north from Eastport in Antrim County to the village of Norwood in Charlevoix County is named Old Dixie Highway—U.S. Route 31 parallels this road to the east. In Ohio, it was old U.S. Route 25 to Cincinnati, current U.S. Route 25 and U.S. Route 25W to Knoxville, and U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 27 to Chattanooga. The eastern division took a more direct route than the western between Chattanooga and Atlanta, following the modern U.S. Route 41 all the way, but it followed a more circuitous path south of Atlanta. Traffic left Atlanta to the east on U.S. Route 278, following U.S. Route 441, Georgia State Route 24, a short section of U.S. Route 301, and Georgia State Route 21 to Savannah. There, the route turned south along the coast via U.S. Route 17 to Jacksonville and U.S. Route 1 to Miami. It is today (2016) a major street in towns and cities along the Florida East Coast.|$|E

At this junction, NY348 turned northeast along Fiske Road, crossing over the Little Chazy River and nearby Bayington Brook. Bending further northeast through the town of Chazy, the route paralleled the Delaware and Hudson until reaching a crossing with the Adirondack Northway (I-87).|$|E
500|$|As one of {{a series}} of minor PC {{releases}} from the small publisher Softdisk, Keen Dreams did not receive much attention from contemporary reviewers or players, despite its connection to the Commander Keen series. Accordingly, it has since been marketed as the [...] "lost episode" [...] of the series. As it fell between the 1990 episodes 1–3 of the Vorticon trilogy, and the 1991 episodes 4–5 of Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Keen Dreams has also been informally referred to as [...] "Episode 3.5" [...] of the series. Keen Dreams was included with the other series games in the 1996 id Anthology compilation release, but as the game had not been published through Apogee, Keen Dreams was not included in the 1998 Apogee Commander Keen compilation release or the 2014 3D Realms Anthology release. In June 2013, however, developer Super Fighter Team licensed the game from <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> Software, the then-owners of Softdisk, and released a version for Android devices. The following September, an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign was started to attempt to buy the rights from <b>Flat</b> <b>Rock</b> for US$1500 in order to release the source code to the game and start publishing it on multiple platforms; while the campaign did not reach the goal, the creator Javier Chavez made up the difference, and the source code was released soon after. The game was then published on Steam through the Steam Greenlight program by Hard Disk Publishing for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux, with Steam achievements and multiple graphical options. According to Steam Spy, approximately 80,000 copies have been sold through Steam as of June 2016.|$|E
