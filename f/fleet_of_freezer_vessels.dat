Results show that the efficiency of industrial trawl fishery comes from multiple owner managed vessels, export oriented vessels and registered vessels that are mainly engaged in double rigger trawling. Results also indicate that <b>freezer</b> <b>vessels</b> with small storage capacity, using small gear are relatively less efficient. This study shows {{that there is no}} depletion or reduction in marine fish stock over the period and shrimp vessels are technically more efficient than fish vessels.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design a {{tropical}} solar freezer, which would be entirely self-sufficient. The requirement was to install solar freezer to developing countries with insufficient technical infrastructure. The construction <b>of</b> solar <b>freezer</b> is located near Lake Victoria, in a town called Kisumu, Kenya in Africa. The main idea was to create a simple look that matches the use of the building. My suggestion was to create two separate buildings. The first is a small object, serving as a gatehouse. The second object is a large U-shaped, in which there are all the necessary facilities for the operation <b>of</b> <b>freezer</b> and facilities for staff. The supporting system consists of cast-in-place reinforced concrete columns. Solar panels located on the roof <b>of</b> <b>freezers</b> protect the building from direct sunlight. Diagonal steel rods fitted on the east and west facades constitute a significant feature of the building...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{action would}} remove Gulf of Alaska (GOA) Pacific cod {{sideboard}} limits applicable to some freezer longliners if certain conditions are met during a limited period of time. The sideboard limits were originally {{created by the}} Crab Rationalization Program and were shared by participants using all gear types in the inshore or offshore groundfish sectors. In 2012, these sideboard limits were disaggregated to create limits based on gear type and operation type, {{as part of the}} GOA Pacific cod sector splits (Amendment 83 to the FMP for Gulf of Alaska Groundfish). Given the limited catch history <b>of</b> the sideboarded <b>freezer</b> longline <b>vessels</b> (i. e., using hook-and-line) during the 1996 through 2000 period, the modified sideboard limits eliminated participation in the GOA Pacific cod fisheries by these vessels.

40|$|The {{shelf-life}} {{quality of}} rabbit meat was investigated under different storage conditions. Samples were cleaned externally by skinning, scalding and singeing. Refrigeration and freezing were the preservation techniques employed, and the oxidative stability was determined using the thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) assay. Samples were analysed for pH and temperature change, and colour, odour and sliminess were evaluated sensorially. Results {{showed that the}} pH of refrigerated samples increased from 4 to 10 while that <b>of</b> <b>freezer</b> samples increased from 4 to 7. Temperature <b>of</b> <b>freezer</b> samples decreased from 0 ºC to – 9 ºC while that of refrigerated samples increased from 8 ºC to 23 ºC. Colour change, odour and sliminess were observed on refrigerated samples from the 9 th to 11 th day of storage whereas there was no odour and sliminess in freezer samples throughout {{the duration of the}} study, only slight colour change from pink to light pink was observed on the 13 th day <b>of</b> <b>freezer</b> storage. Microbial load per gram of sample was higher in skinned than in singed sample, whereas the scalded sample had negligible microbial load. TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reaction substances) for refrigerated samples were higher compared to freezer samples, thus refrigerated samples were susceptible to oxidative rancidity and the development of warm-over flavour during storage. The poas muscles of rabbit meat had higher microbial load than the biceps femoris, and freezing as a storage technique tends to improve the keeping quality of rabbit meat compared to refrigeration.

40|$|Technological Institute, {{manufactured}} {{and tested}} 50 ice cream freezers using hydrocarbon (HC) as refrigerant (propane – R 290) and 25 standard ice cream freezers using R 404 A as refrigerant. Both types <b>of</b> <b>freezers</b> {{use the same}} cabinet and the same components in the refrigeration system. The only {{difference between the two}} types <b>of</b> <b>freezers</b> is the refrigerant. These 75 freezers have been field tested in Australia; first during the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sydney and afterwards in service stations, shops and supermarkets in Sydney and Brisbane. During the field tests, each cabinet was fitted with two temperature data loggers to record the temperature inside and outside the cabinet, as well as a power meter to record energy consumption. This paper presents the results from the two field tests. Based on the two field tests, it can be concluded that the new HC freezers operate satisfactorily. Based on the measurements from the two field tests, it can furthermore be concluded that the new HC freezers use approximately 9 % less energy than the standard R 404 A freezers...|$|R
