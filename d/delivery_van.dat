5|$|Born in Swansea, Ford was {{the second}} child of Trevor and Daisy Ford. His father, Trevor Sr, had been a {{physical}} training instructor during the First World War before returning to South Wales {{to work as a}} <b>delivery</b> <b>van</b> driver and later at a local cinema, eventually being promoted to manager. Ford was encouraged into football by his father who would buy him a new football and boots for each birthday. He grew up in the Townhill district of the city and attended Powys Avenue School as a child, captaining the school's football side as a centre-half.|$|E
5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a <b>delivery</b> <b>van.</b> He {{was first}} {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's {{movement}} was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his stomach, and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{estimate}} the effect on road safety if lorries would be replaced by <b>delivery</b> <b>vans</b> for trips made within built-up areas. It had been noted that adequate exposure data, especially for trips within built-up areas, was missing. For this reason, carrying out the calculations of the effects on road safety had to be based on certain assumptions. These assumptions were used to establish the idea that replacing lorries by <b>delivery</b> <b>vans</b> would have a negative effect on road safety. The extent of this effect would increase in proportion to the degree to which the lorries would be replaced by <b>delivery</b> <b>vans.</b> Although the replacement of lorries by <b>delivery</b> <b>vans</b> would mean a decrease only in the number of fatalities (and this decrease would be slight), there would be a sharp increase in all other separate categories of the severity of injuries. The general conclusion was that a shift from using lorries to using <b>delivery</b> <b>vans</b> for transport inside built-up areas should be assessed negatively in consideration of both accidents and (be it a cautious conclusion) behaviour...|$|R

25|$|The Honda Life {{represented}} Honda's {{efforts in}} {{competing in the}} kei car segment, offering sedan, <b>delivery</b> <b>van</b> and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, {{appears to be an}} influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.|$|E
25|$|The 110 {{series was}} {{available}} as a sedan or as the rare W110/112/113 station wagon, which had a horizontally split tail gate. There was also a K110 listed, a two-door cabrio coach version. Based on the 110 was the stronger duty 120 series (intended for commercial usage), also {{available as a}} two-door <b>delivery</b> <b>van,</b> as a double cab truck, or as a two-seater pickup truck– part of the Datsun truck lineage. The 110 series' body was manufactured by Nissan Motor Kantō, using steel from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.|$|E
25|$|A diner is a {{restaurant}} {{characterized by a}} wide range of foods, a casual and often nostalgic atmosphere, a counter, and late operating hours. The precursor to the fast food eatery began in 1872 when Walter Scott, a myopic pressman for the Providence Journal, became serious about selling food and refreshments in the streets. Scott had a plan. Instead of wearing out the soles of his shoes and roaming the streets of Providence, Rhode Island, he decided to buy a horse-drawn <b>delivery</b> <b>van.</b> Rolling on four wagon wheels, he would take his food to the people.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1930s, then, six {{vehicles}} were introduced (designated 22a through f), including {{a sports car}}, a sports coupe, a truck, a <b>delivery</b> <b>van,</b> a farm tractor, and a tank. They were all cast in lead. Soon after, the first Dinky model car available individually was numbered 23 – a sports car based on the MG Magic Midget. At this early time a series 24 (a-h) were introduced and included a generic ambulance (made until the late 1940s) a grand sport open four-seater, a grand sport two-seater, a coupe and a limousine (Gardner and O'Neill 1996, pp.46–47). The 24 series was also made in France.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{distinct}} International promotionals was the boxy Metro <b>delivery</b> <b>van</b> which International made from 1948 to about 1959. PMC's Metro {{appears to have been}} made in the later 1950s, and was one of the company's last promotional offerings. It had an opening rear door which slid outward from the rear of the van, revealing storage space inside. This model was offered in a common light yellow, a purple, and a less common lime green. The PMC offering was often packaged in a toy-like plastic bag stapled to a cardboard hanging card. One recent eBay offering of the Metro in original packaging was being sold for $200.00.|$|E
25|$|Honda's {{automotive}} manufacturing ambitions can {{be traced}} back to 1963, with the Honda T360, a kei car truck built for the Japanese market. This was followed by the two-door roadster, the Honda S500 also introduced in 1963. In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial <b>delivery</b> <b>van,</b> called the Honda L700. Honda's first four-door sedan was not the Accord, but the air-cooled, four-cylinder, gasoline-powered Honda 1300 in 1969. The Civic was a hatchback that gained wide popularity internationally, but it wasn't the first two-door hatchback built. That was the Honda N360, another Kei car that was adapted for international sale as the N600. The Civic, which appeared in 1972 and replaced the N600 also had a smaller sibling that replaced the air-cooled N360, called the Honda Life that was water-cooled.|$|E

25|$|For the {{standard}} LH the 41-seat Plaxton coach and 43-seat ECW bus were most widely used; the bus bodies manufactured in Belfast by Alexander for Ulsterbus had 45 seats, East Midland Motor Services' ten 1969 buses {{were the only}} ones with Willowbrook bodies, as built they had 45 seats but with a 3+2 seating arrangement in three rows forward of the rear bench, making room for a pram pen, they were also unusual in carrying no grille badge, which puzzled the author of this sentence when he first came across a seemingly unidentifiable bus as a schoolboy in the mid 1970s. The LHS was produced as both buses and coaches with 26 to 35 seats. The LHL had up to 53 seats as a coach or 55 as a bus. Between 1975 and 1982 Vanplan built eight with <b>delivery</b> <b>van</b> bodies.|$|E
25|$|Two basic {{models were}} built: 410 (1964–1965) with a {{combination}} rear lamp set consisting of round and rectangular lenses, and 411 (1965–1967), which featured the same combination rear lamp set as the earlier 410 through 1966, changing to higher mounted rectangular tail light sets for 1967. On both, the rear direction indicators were red or amber, according to market – New Zealand, which allows either, took the 410 with both and the 411 with red only. This Bluebird {{was one of the}} first Japanese car lines assembled in New Zealand, initially imported under a tariff/duty arrangement allowing 300 cars a year (the so-called '300 Club') with CKD kits built up by Motor Holdings at Mount Wellington in Auckland. The 410 series sedan and station wagon plus a light <b>delivery</b> <b>van</b> was assembled in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria. These cars were all in CKD format.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, {{officers}} from the Emergency Response Unit were present when National Surveillance Unit detectives shot and killed an armed raider in Lucan, Dublin after he attempted to hold-up a cash-in-transit van. 27-year-old Gareth Molloy, who had previous criminal convictions, and his gang were under surveillance by the NSU {{for a number of}} weeks prior to the incident. Gardaí received intelligence that the gang were going to carry out a heist, and the NSU were backed-up by the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), Organised Crime Unit (OCU) and ERU. When Molloy and a gang associate attempted to hold-up a cash <b>delivery</b> <b>van</b> at gunpoint and fired a shot in the air, NSU detectives intervened and ordered the armed raiders to drop their weapons. Gareth Molloy pointed a sawn-off shotgun in the direction of armed Gardaí and was immediately fired upon by NSU officers and was fatally wounded. His associate refused to drop his weapon, and was also shot, but survived with serious injuries. 5 shots were fired by Gardaí in total. No one else was hurt. Four other gang members were arrested, charged and jailed following a pursuit {{in the aftermath of the}} incident.|$|E
