5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests {{that this was the}} main entrance of the auberge, although it might have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and a large room {{at the rear of the}} building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 1941, Orr and Sub-Lieutenant Graham Hogg {{observed}} two Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s {{making a}} torpedo bombing run on Illustrious; {{after a long}} chase they managed to shoot one of them down. The Italian planes, however, had <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> diversion, because {{at the same time}} three squadrons of Junkers Ju 87 from Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 and Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 arrived over the carrier. The Ju 87s were circling the fleet at , out of the range of the navy's anti-aircraft guns. They then targeted the carrier, diving down and hitting her six times. Orr, down at sea level and out of ammunition, climbed up through the carrier's anti-aircraft barrage in an attempt to disrupt the dive-bombers' attack.|$|E
25|$|The 'Commander's SSD' (Ship System Display) was introduced. SSDs had <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{half-sheet}} {{diagram of}} the ship's systems. Some combined ship classes that were differentiated using shaded boxes which were to be ignored to represent the smaller ship class (for instance the Klingon D6 and D7 cruisers were presented on the same SSD sheet with shaded boxes indicating the phasers and shield boxes that the D6 lacked). The new Commander's style SSDs (which did not appear in Volume I or II) took a full sheet and included extra record-keeping information, such as tracks for drone ammo and shuttles, and firing charts for all the weapons on the ship. A line of nine Commander's SSD Books were produced, the first few of which were mostly involved presenting new-style SSDs for the older ships, the last several of which had all new material.|$|E

On a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday, when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn, he had his driver stop his car. He jumped out and stomped on the flames, as did his wife and some of his staffers. [...] Johnson's leadership during the fire was praised by Democratic Congressman Tom Udall, who said: [...] "I think the real test of leadership is when you have circumstances like this. He's called on his reserves of energy and has <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here." [...] Johnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election, stating himself to be a Republican with no interest in running for president.|$|E
500|$|One of Jolie's {{requests}} was {{to rework}} the third act, which originally had Salt rescue {{his wife and son}} from a coalition of villains, because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided to then make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into [...] "a place harder than Fort Knox" [...] – after considering Camp David, Wimmer settled on the White House. When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said [...] "I think that it’s <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas – the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian mole, and has to go on the run to defend himself. That’s been the same since day one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In the same way, I guess, as – you know – action thrillers have changed {{along the lines of the}} Bond films and the Bourne films".|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of the monkey, Katy builds a cat toy which she uses to {{distract}} the tiger who ate her boyfriend earlier in the video. She lures it into an area of the jungle, and traps it inside. She comes face-to-face with the tiger {{and the two of them}} roar at each other, until her roar tames the tiger as it sits in front of her submissively. Afterwards, she is shown sitting on a giant grass throne, wearing a flower crown as the rest of the jungle animals sit around her, including the tiger, monkey and elephant. The tiger is shown wearing a collar that says [...] "Kitty Purry", a reference to her real-life cat of the same name. Katy takes selfies with the monkey on her boyfriend's phone, applies lipstick made from berry juice, and gives the elephant a pedicure. She then awakens from sleeping in the plane, leading the viewer to think all the previous events have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> dream, but walks out of the plane still in the jungle, stretching her arms and yawning with the animals sitting around her.|$|E

A coordinated attack shatters Mega-City One's defences, leaves multiple blocks destroyed by nuclear weaponry (the south of the city faces [...] "total nuke out!"

A bitter resistance is put up by Judges and Citizen-Defence units, despite heavy losses and the death (after being brainwashed into a Sov agent) of Chief Judge Griffin. Victory is achieved when a team led by Dredd causes the nuclear devastation of the entire East-Meg One.

2500|$|The {{response}} of Williams to a controversy about {{the teaching of}} creationism in privately sponsored academies was {{that it should not}} be taught in schools as an alternative to evolution. When asked if he was comfortable with teaching creationism, he said [...] "I think creationism is, in a sense, a kind of category mistake, as if the Bible were a theory like other theories... so if creationism is presented as a stark alternative theory alongside other theories, I think there's – there's <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> jar of categories, it's not what it's about." [...] When the interviewer said [...] "So it shouldn't be taught?" [...] he responded [...] "I don't think it should, actually. No, no. And that's different from saying–different from discussing, teaching about what creation means. For that matter, it's not even the same as saying that Darwinism is–is the only thing that ought to be taught. My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it." ...|$|E
