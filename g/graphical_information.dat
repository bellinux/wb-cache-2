50|$|All {{graphical}} elements can be {{specified in}} a textual source file that can be compiled into a binary file or one of two text representations. CGM provides a means of graphics data interchange for computer representation of 2D <b>graphical</b> <b>information</b> independent from any particular application, system, platform, or device. CGM was developed by W3C in 1999As a metafile, i.e., a file containing information that describes or specifies another file, the CGM format has numerous elements to provide functions and to represent entities, so that {{a wide range of}} <b>graphical</b> <b>information</b> and geometric primitives can be accommodated. Rather than establish an explicit graphics file format, CGM contains the instructions and data for reconstructing graphical components to render an image using an object-oriented approach.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{abundance}} of textual / static <b>graphical</b> <b>information</b> about insulin and diabetes on the web. However an AIDA-based Diabetes / Insulin Tutorial has been developed that can be accessed for free at http://www.2aida.info. The tutorial is unusual in that — in addition to offering textual / static <b>graphical</b> <b>information</b> about insulin and diabetes — it is also integrated with the AIDA on-line web-based diabetes simulator at http://www.2aida.net. In this way, visitors can not only read about insulin dosage adjustment in diabetes, but also interactively simulate examples {{of what they are}} learning about. The tutorial is currently arranged in four sections: (1) Insulin-dosage adjustment, (2) Choosing the insulin dose, (3) Timing of meals & diet planning, and (4) Glucose & the kidney.|$|E

The United States Government assumes no liability for its contents or use thereof. BACKGROUND EXECUTIVESU~ARY MIT Lincoln Laboratory, through the sponsorship of the Federal Aviation Administration, is developing a data link application that will provide <b>graphical</b> weather <b>information</b> to the general aviation (GA) pilot in the cockpit. The transmission of these complex images is made possible through application of image compression algorithms developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The availability of near-real-time <b>graphical</b> weather <b>information</b> via data link will significantly affect pilot decision-making. To assess this effect, as well as to aid in the proper design, implementation and certification of use of the Graphical Weather Service (GWS) in aircraft, a series of human factors studies is being conducted. This report describes the methodology and results of Phase One in this series of studies...|$|R

40|$|Risk {{communications}} are {{an integral}} aspect of health education and promotion. However, the commonly used textual risk information is relatively difficult to understand for the average recipient. Consequently, researchers and health promoters have started to focus on so-called decision aids, such as tables and graphs. Although tabular and <b>graphical</b> risk <b>information</b> more effectively communicate risks than textual risk information, the cognitive mechanisms responsible for this enhancement are unclear. This study aimed to examine two possible mechanisms (i. e., cognitive workload and attention). Cognitive workload (mean pupil size and peak pupil dilation) and attention directed to the risk information (viewing time, number of eye fixations, and eye fixation durations) were both measured in a between-subjects experimental design. The results suggest that <b>graphical</b> risk <b>information</b> facilitates comprehension of that information because it attracts and holds attention {{for a longer period}} of time than textual risk information. Graphs are thus a valuable asset to risk communication practice for two reasons: first, they tend to attract attention and, second, when attended to, they elicit information extraction with relatively little cognitive effort, and finally result in better comprehension...|$|R

50|$|Cognitive load theory (and by {{extension}} {{many of the}} multimedia instructional design principles) is {{based in part on}} a model of working memory by Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch who proposed that working memory has two largely independent, limited capacity sub-components that tend to work in parallel - one visual and one verbal/acoustic. This gave rise to dual-coding theory, first proposed by Allan Paivio and later applied to multimedia learning by Richard Mayer. According to Mayer, separate channels of working memory process auditory and visual information during any lesson. Consequently, a learner can use more cognitive processing capacities to study materials that combine auditory verbal information with visual <b>graphical</b> <b>information</b> than to process materials that combine printed (visual) text with visual <b>graphical</b> <b>information.</b> In other words, the multi-modal materials reduce the cognitive load imposed on working memory.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{the use of}} non-speech sound output to enhance the <b>graphical</b> display of <b>information</b> can overcome overload.

The approach described here is to integrate sound into the basic components of the human-computer interface. Two experiments are described where non-speech sounds were added to buttons and scrollbars. Results showed sound improved usability by increasing performance and reducing time to recover from errors. Subjective workload measures also showed a significant reduction. Results from this work show that the integrated display of <b>graphical</b> and auditory <b>information</b> can overcome information overloa...|$|R

We also show how PureProp provides a hitherto unavailable algorithm for solving classes of incomplete <b>information</b> <b>graphical</b> games with arbitrary graph structure for approximate Bayes-Nash equilibria, and conclude with some empirical analysis of the new algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{designing}} a computer-based {{decision support system}} is how best to depict the data. Since most systems use either graphical or tabular displays, this experiment compares the latter two when used as decision aids for the production scheduling problem modeled by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon.

Because the displays are not associated with each user, SAR scales naturally up to groups of users, thus allowing for collocated collaboration between users.|$|E
