25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. <b>Isothermal</b> <b>compression</b> or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect <b>isothermal</b> <b>compression.</b> However, with practical devices perfect <b>isothermal</b> <b>compression</b> is not attainable.

25|$|In an <b>isothermal</b> <b>compression</b> process, the gas in {{the system}} is kept at a {{constant}} temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange {{can be achieved by}} heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the intercoolers must be optimised for high heat transfer and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate <b>isothermal</b> <b>compression</b> even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.|$|E

In practice neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as some heat losses are unavoidable.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHot forging/Superplastic forming {{is widely}} used to produce high strength, defect free, {{homogeneous}} and complex shaped aerospace/automobile products. Deformation temperature and strain rate have {{significant effect on the}} mechanical properties of these products. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the influence of deformation parameters such as temperature and strain rate on flow behaviour of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, which is the most commonly used Titanium alloy for aerospace applications. Flow behaviour of Ti - 6 Al- 4 V has been investigated under uni-axial <b>isothermal</b> <b>compressions.</b> Flow curves of uni-axial <b>isothermal</b> <b>compressions</b> were analysed to determine the optimum strain-rate and temperature combination by using Taguchi method and analysis of variance. Softening parameter, which is the ratio of initial or maximum flow stress (σi) to steady state flow stress (σs), has been calculated at different strain rates and temperatures. Higher softening parameter implies better grain refinement. Grain refinement is one of the pre-requisites for superplastic forming. The optimum deformation parameter combination was obtained by analysis of signal to noise ratio. The analysis of experimental results revealed that strain rate was the most influential factor than temperature on the softening parameter. The optimum results of the softening parameter were obtained at intermediate temperature and strain rates...|$|R

Systematic comparisons are performed showing that the predicted hadronic phases of the matching named as RMF-PNJL, are larger than the confined phase obtained exclusively by the Polyakov quark models.

2500|$|Diabatic storage dissipates much of {{the heat}} of {{compression}} with intercoolers (thus approaching <b>isothermal</b> <b>compression)</b> into the atmosphere as waste; essentially wasting, thereby, the renewable energy used to perform the work of compression. [...] Upon removal from storage, the temperature of this compressed air is the one indicator {{of the amount of}} stored energy that remains in this air. Consequently, if the air temperature is low for the energy recovery process, the air must be substantially re-heated prior to expansion in the turbine to power a generator. This reheating can be accomplished with a natural gas fired burner for utility grade storage or with a heated metal mass. As recovery is often most needed when renewable sources are quiescent, fuel must be burned {{to make up for the}} wasted heat. [...] This degrades the efficiency of the storage-recovery cycle; and while this approach is relatively simple, the burning of fuel adds to the cost of the recovered electrical energy and compromises the ecological benefits associated with most renewable energy sources.

Recently, the artificial neural network models are considered as a powerful tool to describe the elevated temperature deformation behavior of materials. Based on the experimental data from the <b>isothermal</b> <b>compressions</b> of 42 CrMo high strength steel, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained with standard back-propagation learning algorithm to predict the elevated temperature deformation behavior of 42 CrMo steel. The inputs of the ANN model are strain, strain rate and temperature, whereas flow stress is the output. According to the predicted and experimental results, it indicates that the developed ANN model shows a good capacity of modeling complex hot deformation behavior and can accurately tracks the experimental data in a wide temperature range and strain rate range. In addition, the predicted data outside of experimental conditions were obtained, indicating good prediction potentiality of the developed ANN model.
