40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} {{the moment of}} inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was proposed in this paper, which was defined as Governor Sensitivity Test Method (GSTM). In this method, the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was estimated by means of measure transient speed change of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> when the engine load increases suddenly. In the present, {{there have been some}} methods for estimating the moment of inertia of engine, such as, Additional Mass Method, Running Down Test Method and Accelerating- Decelerating Method Under No Load. These methods for estimating the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> all have shortcomings on accuracy or operability. These shortcomings have been overcome by using the GSTM method proposed in this paper. It is easy to operate, and the factors affecting estimation errors are small. In this paper, the basic principle of the GSTM method was discussed. The factors affecting estimation errors ware analyzed. An example of calculating the moment of inertia of an engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> using the GSTM method was presented. The result of calculating the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was used to simulate the transient speed response of an engine <b>generator</b> <b>set.</b> The GSTM method was verified to be practical by comparing the results of simulation and experiment...|$|R

25|$|A Cayley graph is a graph defined {{from a pair}} (G,S) where G is a {{group and}} S {{is a set of}} {{generators}} for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a cycle graph, and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite path graph. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary <b>generator</b> <b>sets</b> are called circulant graphs. These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other point.

A prototype launch system was designed by January 1995. The prototype consisted {{of a series of}} boxcars welded together to form a launch tunnel. A track-mounted dune buggy was then propelled inside the tunnel {{through the use of a}} weight drop launch mechanism. The designers then experimented with different rates of acceleration, each emitting between one and five times the force of gravity. The final system which was implemented on The Incredible Hulk sees trains launch from 0 to [...] in 2 seconds. Riders travel at an angle of 30 degrees through a [...] tunnel, pulling 1G. To power this launch the designers investigated a variety of systems ranging from hydraulic, pneumatic, cable, steam catapult, and conveyor belt. In the end a drive tire system was selected, where 230 electrical motors power a set of tires that pinch the train's underside to provide propulsion. As this system required eight megawatts of power to launch a train, the park built several customized motor <b>generator</b> <b>sets</b> with large flywheels. Without these stored energy units, they would have had to build a whole substation and risk browning-out the local energy grid with every launch.
