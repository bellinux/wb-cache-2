5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played.

It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich <b>embroidery,</b> often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of <b>embroidery</b> on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of <b>embroidery</b> and no jade girdle to denote rank.
