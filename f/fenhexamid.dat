40|$|BACKGROUND The narrow-spectrum {{fungicide}} <b>fenhexamid</b> {{was introduced}} into French vineyards in 2000 to control grey mould {{caused by a}} complex of two cryptic species: Botrytis cinerea, the predominant species sensitive to <b>fenhexamid,</b> and Botrytis pseudocinerea, naturally resistant. <b>Fenhexamid</b> was suggested to inhibit the 3 -ketoreductase involved at C- 4 demethylation steps during ergosterol biosynthesis, as revealed by its effects on the B. cinerea sterol profile. Resistance monitoring studies have hitherto identified two B. cinerea fenhexamid-resistant phenotypes, both resulting from mutations in the erg 27 gene encoding 3 -ketoreductase. RESULTS The role of 3 -ketoreductase sensitivity in fungal susceptibility to <b>fenhexamid</b> was investigated by studying sterol profiles and microsomal 3 -ketoreductase in various fungal strains. <b>Fenhexamid</b> does inhibit B. cinerea 3 -ketoreductase activity. Erg 27 mutations causing amino acid substitutions {{in or near the}} transmembrane domain strongly decrease the affinity of <b>fenhexamid</b> for 3 -ketoreductase. <b>Fenhexamid</b> has very low affinities for 3 -ketoreductase in inherently resistant species, whether closely related to B. cinerea, like B. pseudocinerea, or more distantly related, like Nectria haematococca. CONCLUSION erg 27 mutation and erg 27 polymorphism may therefore contribute to the unfavourable binding of <b>fenhexamid</b> to its target, 3 -ketoreductase, explaining the acquisition of <b>fenhexamid</b> resistance in B. cinerea and the narrow spectrum of this fungicide.

40|$|The {{vegetative}} compatibility of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Glomus clarum MUCL 46238 {{was evaluated}} after continuous exposure to <b>fenhexamid,</b> a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor (SBI). Three lineages of this AMF were cultured in vitro for five generations {{in association with}} Ri T-DNA transformed carrot roots {{in the presence of}} 0, 5 or 10  mg l(- 1) of <b>fenhexamid.</b> Whatever the AMF generation, <b>fenhexamid</b> at 5 and 10  mg l(- 1) had no significant impact on the number of spores produced. However, vegetative compatibility tests (VCT) conducted with spores from the three lineages, in the presence of 10  mg l(- 1) of <b>fenhexamid,</b> impacted the anastomosis process. At this concentration, the morphology of the germ tubes was modified. In addition, nitrotetrazolium-trypan blue staining revealed that 10  mg l(-l) of <b>fenhexamid</b> significantly reduced the probability of fusion between the germ tubes regardless of the culture conditions (i. e. absence or presence of <b>fenhexamid)</b> preceding the VCT. Our results demonstrated that spore production was not affected by <b>fenhexamid,</b> while anastomosis between germ tubes was decreased. This suggested that high concentrations, accumulation or repeated application of this SBI fungicide may impact the community structure of AMF in soil...|$|E

40|$|The Botrytis species complex {{responsible}} for the grey mould disease found on grapevines is composed of two species: Botrytis cinerea, {{to a large extent}} (roughly 90 %), and Botrytis pseudocinera. Despite their genetic polymorphism, these species cannot be morphologically distinguished. However, they do differ in their response to several fungicides, especially to the sterol biosynthesis inhibitor <b>fenhexamid.</b> While B. cinerea is sensitive to this hydroxyanilide fungicide, B. pseudocinerea is naturally resistant. Because a strong synergism was found on B. pseudocinerea between <b>fenhexamid</b> and sterol 14 α-demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) known to inhibit Cyp 51, a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase, it was hypothetized that the detoxification of <b>fenhexamid</b> by a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase similar to Cyp 51 is involved in the resistance B. pseudocinerea. To test this, we sought the gene overexpressed in the presence of <b>fenhexamid</b> with the highest similarity to cyp 51. Taking into account the Cyp P 450 classification based on homology and phylogenetic criteria, this gene, whose function remains unknown, belongs to the Cyp 684 family. It was then deleted in a B. pseudocinerea strain. cyp 684 knock out mutants exhibit a loss of <b>fenhexamid</b> resistance and synergism between DMIs and <b>fenhexamid,</b> showing that the Cyp 684 cytochrome P 450 protein is {{responsible for}} B. pseudocinerea’s natural resistance to <b>fenhexamid</b> and is involved in <b>fenhexamid</b> detoxification. Although cyp 684 is also present in B. cinerea, which is sensitive to <b>fenhexamid,</b> polymorphism was observed between the two species: in B. pseudocinerea the cyp 684 promoter shows a deletion of 25 bp; an insertion of 10 bp is observed in the 3 ’ UTR of the gene. In addition, cyp 684 expression is induced after exposure to <b>fenhexamid</b> in B. pseudocinerea suggesting that one of these gene modifications might be responsible for cyp 684 overexpression. We are currently conducting experiments to correlate gene structure and resistance in different Botrytis species.

40|$|The Botrytis species complex {{responsible}} for grey mould disease on grapevine {{is composed of}} two species: Botrytis cinerea the major one (about 90 %) and Botrytis pseudocinerea.

However, they do differ in their response to several fungicides, especially to the sterol biosynthesis inhibitor <b>fenhexamid.</b> While B. cinerea is sensitive to this hydroxyanilide, B. pseudocinerea is naturally resistant. Enzyme assays showed that in B. pseudocinerea the <b>fenhexamid</b> target enzyme, the sterol 3 -ketoreductase was less sensitive to <b>fenhexamid.</b> In addition, a strong synergism between <b>fenhexamid</b> and sterol 14 α-demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) known to inhibit Cyp 51, a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase was observed in B. pseudocinerea. These results could suggest detoxification of <b>fenhexamid</b> by cytochromes P 450.

40|$|Antifungal {{compounds}} such as ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors {{are widely}} used to control crop diseases. Among them, {{one of the most}} recent, the hydroxyanilide <b>fenhexamid,</b> is efficient principally against Botrytis cinerea, the major causal agent of grey mould. <b>Fenhexamid</b> is a new type of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor affecting the sterol C 4 demethylation processes due to its specific interaction with one of the four proteins of the enzymatic complex, the 3 -ketoreductase. Our regular monitoring conducted on French vineyards allowed the identification of the first isolates of B. cinerea with acquired resistance. Two types of resistant isolates named HydR 3 - and HydR 3 + were distinguished by their resistance level. This acquired resistance is due to point mutations in the erg 27 gene leading to target modifications. These modifications induce a reduced in affinity of <b>fenhexamid</b> towards its target, the 3 -ketoreductase. Because of their high resistant level, the HydR 3 + strains have to be considered relative to the risk of resistance phenomenom occurrence in vineyards. Fitness studies conducted in vitro on isogenic mutants showed altered "overwintering" capacities of HydR 3 + mutants suggesting that they probably do not impact fenhexamid's field efficacy. While B. cinerea's acquired resistance could be explained only by target modifications, as in most cases of fungicide resistance, the situation is different for the related species Botrytis pseudocinerea naturally resistant to <b>fenhexamid.</b> We show that erg 27 polymorphism only slightly contributes to resistance whereas <b>fenhexamid</b> detoxification by a cytochrome P 450 named cyp 68. 4 is the major mechanism responsible for the resistance.

40|$|Forty three Chilean Botrytis cinerea {{isolates}} {{of different}} <b>fenhexamid</b> sensitivities, obtained from table grapes, were phenotypically analyzed and sequenced for the erg 27 gene that encodes the 3 -ketoreductaseenzyme. Fifteen isolates were highly resistant to <b>fenhexamid</b> (HydR 3 +) with conidial germination EC 50 values > 5 μg·mL- 1 and colony growth EC 50 values > 2 μg·mL- 1. Five isolates had slight to moderate resistance levels (HydR 3 -) with conidial germination EC 50 values between 0. 7 and 2. 6 μg·mL- 1 and colony growth EC 50 values between 0. 4 and 3 μg·mL- 1.

40|$|Telomere {{sequences}} {{have been}} found to enhance transformation frequencies of fungal plasmids. Such plasmids do not integrate into the genome; they may be replicated independently. We constructed two derivatives of the pFAC 1 plasmid, which transform B. cinerea at high frequencies (1). Our plasmids pFACR 5 and pFB 2 N both give rise to transformation frequencies 500 - 1. 000 times higher than integrative plasmids. They are replicated under selective pressure but unstable without selection. We analyzed conformation and copy number of both plasmids in B. cinerea transformants. Integration of a <b>fenhexamid</b> resistance allele into the pFB 2 N vector induces fungicide resistance in the transformants showing that dominant alleles can be selected from replicative plasmids (2). Genomic libraries in the pFB 2 N vector were used to transform the B 05. 10 strain.

Their response to the fungicide was EC 50 = 0. 1 - 0. 3 µg ml- 1 and MIC = 0. 3 - 3 µg ml- 1. Eight laboratory mutants resistant to the fungicide were obtained from UV-irradiated or unirradiated coni-dia plated on Fenhexamid-amended medium (3 µg ml- 1). Mutation ratios were 1. 7 · 10 - 6 of survivor conidia for UV-induced mutations and 0. 6 · 10 - 8 for spontaneous muta-tions.

Thirty per cent of such phenotypes were detected in an experimental glasshouse with lettuce crops, the third year after commencing fungicide applications. The average resistance factor (R-f) for mycelial growth to <b>fenhexamid,</b> pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cyprodinil and fludioxonil, was over 40, 1, 000, 100, 700 and 50, respectively.

In 2013 this distribution was 24 %, 29 %, 26 %, 8 %, 2 %, 0. 3 %, respectively, and also 0. 3 % (6 isolates) were resistant to all classes of fungicides. Resistance to thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, boscalid, pyraclostrobin and <b>fenhexamid</b> was based on target gene mutations in β-tubulin, bos 1, sdhB, cytb, and erg 27, respectively.

In this paper, {{the development of}} an indirect competitive immunoassay for the determination of <b>fenhexamid</b> residues in fruit samples is described. After optimisation of immunoreagent concentrations, the assay, based on monoclonal antibody FHo 4 # 27, showed high sensitivity, and selectivity, with a limit of detection for <b>fenhexamid</b> standards in buffer of 0. 04 μg/L. The influence of several physico-chemical factors, including pH, ionic strength, solvent tolerance, and matrix interferences on the analytical parameters of the standard curve was studied. For spiked liquid food samples like grape must, just a direct 1 : 50 dilution in water was sufficient to attain recoveries between 100 % and 110 %. For kiwifruit and strawberry samples, a double extraction procedure with methanol is proposed in this study, which afforded recovery values that ranged between 103 % and 116 %. The limit of quantification of the developed assay was 5 μg/kg for grape must, 10 μg/kg for kiwifruits, and 25 μg/kg for strawberries.

40|$|In Botrytis cinerea, multidrug {{resistant}} (MDR) strains {{collected in}} French and German vineyards {{were tested in}} vitro, at the germ-tube elongation stage, towards {{a wide range of}} fungicides. Whatever the MDR phenotype, resistance was recorded to anilinopyrimidines, diethofencarb, iprodione, fludioxonil, tolnaftate and several respiratory inhibitors (e. g., penthiopyrad, pyraclostrobin). In MDR 1 strains, overproducing the ABC transporter BcatrB, resistance extended to carbendazim and the uncouplers fluazinam and malonoben. In MDR 2 strains, overproducing the MFS transporter BcmfsM 2, resistance extended to cycloheximide, <b>fenhexamid</b> and sterol 14 alpha-demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). MDR 3 strains combined the overexpression of both transporters and exhibited the widest spectrum of cross resistance and the highest resistance levels. The four transport modulators, amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, diethylstilbestrol, and verapamil, known to affect some ABC transporters, were tested in B. cinerea. In our experimental conditions, the activity of several fungicides was only enhanced by verapamil. Interestingly, synergism was only recorded in MDR 2 and/or MDR 3 isolates treated with tolnaftate, <b>fenhexamid,</b> fludioxonil or pyrimethanil, suggesting that verapamil may inhibit the MFS transporter BcmfsM 2. This is the first report indicating that a known modulator of ABC transporters could also block MFS transporters...|$|E
40|$|In {{the years}} 2005 – 2007 in a {{collection}} of 527 cultivars of tall large-flowered irises (Iris × barbata group Elatior) in the Botanical Garden and Arboretum of MZLU in Brno the fungus Botrytis convolute in­fes­ted the plants. Within three years, {{as a consequence of the}} infestation, some cultivars showed symptoms of poor growth, in isolated cases the plants died. Control of irises against this pathogen has not yet been satisfactorily solved. At the present time no fungicides against B. convolute have been re­gis­te­red, only fungicides protecting ornamental plants against Botrytis cinerea. We explored the effect of seven active substances – captan, carbendazim, <b>fenhexamid,</b> iprodione, mancozeb, pyrimethanil and tolylfluanid (in vitro) in four different concentrations on the growth of the mycelia, germination of conidia and sklerotia. We evaluated the germination of B. convoluta conidia over 24 and 48 hours, my­ce­lium growth and germination of sclerotia over 5 days. In control plants the germination capacity of conidia over 48 hours reached 98 – 99 [*]%. Over 24 hours all the tested concentrations of preparations containing the active substances tolylfluanid and captan markedly affected the germination of conidia; their effectiveness ranged between 88 and 100 [*]%. All the active substances in the registered concentration (mancozeb 0. 2 [*]%, tolylfluanids 0. 2 [*]%, carbendazim 0. 2 [*]%, pyrimethanil 0. 25 [*]%, ipro­dio­ne 0. 3 [*]%, <b>fenhexamid</b> 0. 15 [*]% and captan 1 [*]%) prevented, or considerably reduced, the growth of B. convoluta mycelia (98. 8 – 100 [*]%). The active substances carbenazim, iprodione and fenhexamide very effectively (96. 4 – 100 [*]%) inhibited mycelium growth, at all the tested concentrations. Without an addition of fungicide all the sclerotia on the nutrient solution germinated and formed a mycelium disk 36 [*]mm in diameter. The active substance carbendazim inhibited sklerotia germination at all concentrations; the other active substances, i. e. tolylfluanid, pyrimethanil, iprodione and <b>fenhexamid</b> did not prevent mycelium growth, or the formation of conidiophores with conidia...|$|E
40|$|A novel, {{high-resolution}} melting (HRM) {{analysis was}} developed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with resistance to <b>fenhexamid</b> (hydroxyanilides) and boscalid (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors) in Botrytis cinerea isolates. Thirty-six single-spore isolates arising from 13 phenotypes were selected and tested for fungicide sensitivity. Germ tube elongation assays showed two distinct sensitivity levels for each fungicide. Sequencing revealed that resistance to <b>fenhexamid</b> was due to a nucleotide change in the erg 27 gene, resulting in an amino acid replacement of phenylalanine (F) with serine (S) or valine (V) at position 412 of the protein, whereas in isolates resistant to boscalid, a nucleotide change in the sdhB gene resulted in the replacement of histidine (H) with arginine (R) or tyrosine (Y) at position 272 of the respective protein. In each case, melting curve analysis generated three distinct profiles corresponding {{to the presence of}} each nucleotide in the targeted areas. HRM analysis successfully detected and differentiated the substitutions associated with resistance to both fungicides. In vitro bioassays, direct sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis showed a 100 % correlation with detection of resistance. The results demonstrate the utility of HRM analysis as a potential molecular tool for routine detection of fungicide resistance using known polymorphic genes of B. cinerea populations...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} for the determination of 10 pesticides widely used in lettuce production (acetamiprid, azoxystrobin, cyprodinil, <b>fenhexamid,</b> fludioxonil, folpet, iprodione, metalaxyl, pirimicarb, and tolyfluanid) using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode-array detection (DAD). The extraction performance of four different SPME coatings, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), PDMS/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), carbowax/templated resin (CW/TPR), and polyacrylate (PA) was evaluated using an interface SPME–HPLC. CW/TPR fibre {{was selected as the}} most appropriate for the extraction of majority of these pesticides. Three variables (pH, NaCl% and extraction time) were considered key factors in the optimisation process. Interactions between these analytical factors and their optimal levels were investigated by response surface methodology based on central composite design. The method allowed the determination of azoxystrobin, cyprodinil, fenehexamid, fludioxonil, folpet, iprodione, and tolyfluanid in lettuce at concentrations between 0. 8 and 25. 6 mg/kg, i. e., bellow the maximum residues levels allowed for those compounds in lettuce. Lettuce samples that suffered pesticide treatments with folpet and fenehexamid were analysed during days to harvest to study the dissipation behaviour of the pesticides used. Concentration of folpet was 92. 8; 53. 4; 22. 9; 17. 9; 7. 45; 1. 85 mg/kg and concentration of <b>fenhexamid</b> was 158. 1; 76. 2; 31. 0; 27. 3; 7. 24; 0. 87 mg/kg, respectively for t 0, t 1, t 3, t 6, t 7, t 9 days, and not detected at t 14 days for the two pesticides.

40|$|Mixtures of {{pesticides}} in foodstuffs {{and the environment}} are ubiquitous {{in the developed world}} and although agents are usually exhaustively tested individually, the toxicological implications of pesticide mixtures are underreported. In this study, the effects of two fungicides, <b>fenhexamid</b> and myclobutanil were investigated individually and in combination on two human cell lines, SH-SY 5 Y neuronal cells and U- 251 MG glial cells. After 48. h of incubation with increasing concentrations {{of pesticides}} ranging from 1 to 1000. μM, gene expression profiles were studied in addition to toxicity end points, including cell viability, mitochondrial depolarisation as well as cellular glutathione maintenance. There {{were no significant differences between}} the susceptibility of the two cell lines in terms of cell viability assessment or mitochondrial membrane potential, when agents were administered either individually or in combination. By contrast, in the presence of the fungicides, the SH-SY 5 Y cells showed significantly greater susceptibility to oxidative stress in terms of total thiol depletion in comparison with the astrocytic cells. Treatment with the two pesticides led to significant changes in the cell lines' expression of several genes which regulate cell cycle control and growth (RB 1, TIMP 1) as well as responses to DNA attrition (ATM and CDA 25 A) and control of apoptosis (FAS). There was no evidence in this study that the combination of <b>fenhexamid</b> and myclobutanil was significantly more toxic than individual exposure, although gene expression changes suggested there may be differences in the sub-lethal response of both cell lines to both individual and combined exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} {{for the removal}} of pyrimethanil and <b>fenhexamid,</b> two fungicides commonly used for the control of Botrytis cinerea in vineyards, has been evaluated during an alcoholic fermentation process in batch system. Commercial and wild strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used. Batch fermentations were carried out in yeast extract-malt extract medium (YM) with 18. 0 % (by mass) glucose, and the fungicides were added separately at three concentrations: 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10. 0 mg/L. The removal capacity of yeast strains was also examined in stationary phase cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Stationary assays were performed with yeast biomass harvested from the stationary phase of an anaerobic fermentation process, with separate additions of 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10. 0 mg/L of both fungicides. Removal studies with stationary phase cells were performed with viable and non-viable cells inactivated with sodium azide. This study clearly shows that both Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were able to remove <b>fenhexamid</b> and pyrimethanil in stationary and fermentative assays. The removal potential is shown to be strain dependent in stationary but not in fermentative assays. However, the removal potential is dependent on the type of fungicide in both stationary and fermentative assays. In stationary phase cultures no significant difference in fungicide removal potential between viable and non-viable cells was observed, indicating that both pesticides were not degraded by metabolically active cells. However, the presence of both pesticides influenced fermentation kinetics and only pyrimethanil at 10. 0 mg/L increased the production of volatile acidity of both strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{gene cluster}} {{responsible}} for the biosynthesis of the red polyketidic pigment bikaverin has only been characterized in Fusarium ssp. so far. Recently, a highly homologous but incomplete and nonfunctional bikaverin cluster {{has been found in}} the genome of the unrelated phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. In this study, we provided evidence that rare B. cinerea strains such as 1750 have a complete and functional cluster comprising the six genes orthologous to Fusarium fujikuroi ffbik 1 -ffbik 6 and do produce bikaverin. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the whole cluster was acquired from Fusarium through a horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In the bikaverin-nonproducing strain B 05. 10, the genes encoding bikaverin biosynthesis enzymes are nonfunctional due to deleterious mutations (bcbik 2 - 3) or missing (bcbik 1) but interestingly, the genes encoding the regulatory proteins BcBIK 4 and BcBIK 5 do not harbor deleterious mutations which suggests that they may still be functional. Heterologous complementation of the F. fujikuroi Dffbik 4 mutant confirmed that bcbik 4 of strain B 05. 10 is indeed fully functional. Deletion of bcvel 1 in the pink strain 1750 resulted in loss of bikaverin and overproduction of melanin indicating that the VELVET protein BcVEL 1 regulates the biosynthesis of the two pigments in an opposite manner. Although strain 1750 itself expresses a truncated BcVEL 1 protein (100 instead of 575 aa) that is nonfunctional with regard to sclerotia formation, virulence and oxalic acid formation, it is sufficient to regulate pigment biosynthesis (bikaverin and melanin) and <b>fenhexamid</b> HydR 2 type of resistance. Finally, a genetic cross between strain 1750 and a bikaverin-nonproducing strain sensitive to <b>fenhexamid</b> revealed that the functional bikaverin cluster is genetically linked to the HydR 2 locus...|$|E
40|$|Two {{preliminary}} {{biological control}} screens were developed, using lettuce & strawberry as model systems, to test potential biocontrol micro-organisms {{for their ability}} to control Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of grey mould. The first screen evaluated a range of saprophytic yeasts, bacteria & fungi {{for their ability to}} inhibit Botrytis lesions on whole lettuce plants. In a controlled environment (18 - 22 °C, 85 - 90 % relative humidity & 12 h photoperiod), lettuce leaves were spray inoculated with antagonists (10 ⁷ fungal spores mL⁻¹ or 10 ⁸ bacterial cells mL⁻¹), allowed to dry & challenged by spray inoculation with the pathogen (10 ⁶ conidia mL⁻¹). After 7 days Pseudomonas fluorescens LU 1001 & LU 1003, P. synxantha LU 1004 & P. veronii LU 1002 had significantly reduced lesion areas by an average of 79 % on whole lettuce plants. An Ulocladium sp. LU 865 & Epicoccum purpurascens LU 148 reduced lesion areas by 94 % & 78 %, respectively. The second screen evaluated selected saprophytic bacteria & filamentous fungi, with previously identified antagonistic properties (against a range of plant pathogens), for the ability to inhibit B. cinerea on detached strawberry tissues & whole strawberry plants. The most successful isolates, E. purpurascens LU 148 & Trichoderma atroviride LU 132, inhibited lesion development by up to 32 % & suppressed sporulation on detached strawberry leaves by up to 87 %. They were further evaluated on detached strawberry flowers & whole strawberry plants in a controlled environment (18 °C & 85 - 95 % relative humidity). The most consistently effective antagonist was T. atroviride LU 132, which inhibited B. cinerea in all experiments, significantly (P≤ 0. 05) suppressing B. cinerea sporulation on detached strawberry flowers & leaf discs removed from inoculated whole plants by 100 % & 81 %, respectively. This was similar to the level of disease suppression given by the commercial biocontrol product, Prestop & the fungicide, <b>fenhexamid.</b> The mechanism of action of T. atroviride LU 132 was investigated. Competition for glucose & sucrose occurred on detached strawberry leaf pieces & on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes, significantly inhibiting B. cinerea germ tube length at low sugar concentrations. The isolate also produced non-volatile inhibitory substances in minimal medium that inhibited B. cinerea germ tube elongation & in dual culture, T. atroviride LU 132 was found to directly parasitize B. cinerea hyphae leading to cell collapse. The biological activity of T. atroviride LU 132 against the grey mould pathogen was investigated on three cultivars of strawberry under field conditions. The study also examined the effect of commonly used botryticides on germination & growth of T. atroviride LU 132 to allow selection of a fungicide for mixed application. The fungicide <b>fenhexamid</b> significantly increased conidial germination frequency by up to 34 % & was later used in mixed tank applications. The field trials demonstrated that treatment with T. atroviride LU 132, <b>fenhexamid,</b> & the tank-mix of both could all equally suppress B. cinerea sporulation, significantly, on strawberry leaves & stamens by 42 - 100 %. These treatments increased yield of strawberry fruit by up to 36 % but they did not reduce disease incidence in the fruit in a 7 day ambient storage trial. This research has identified T. atroviride LU 132 as a successful biological control agent (BCA) of B. cinerea in strawberry. The more obvious mechanisms of action such as antibiosis, competition for nutrients & mycoparasitism have been investigated & the use of the BCA within an integrated management strategy, with the fungicide <b>fenhexamid,</b> has been successfully implemented. Future work will focus on developing a suitable formulation for the BCA in order to increase its efficacy under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|Three Botrytis cinerea populations, {{isolated}} from three vineyards, one untreated and two treated twice a year, respectively, with <b>fenhexamid</b> or cyprodinil+fludioxonil, were investigated {{to evaluate the}} effect of repeated fungicide treatments on the presence and distribution of the transposons Boty and Flipper, and on the phenotypic traits of each pathogen community. The vacuma individuals lacking the two transposons represented {{the majority of the}} 390 B. cinerea isolates followed by transposa strains containing Boty and Flipper, while the remaining 67 isolates harboured respectively only Boty (60) or Flipper (7). This research has demonstrated that fungicide application did not influence the transposon distribution patterns, the sensitivity towards various botryticides, or the growth rate of the isolates belonging to the three different populations, but did induced overall reduction of the population size and selected isolates characterized by an enhanced pathogenicity, especially on Vitis vinifera leaves...|$|E
