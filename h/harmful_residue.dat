Crude extracts from fruits of Capsicum chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. annuum, were prepared and tested under laboratory conditions for their insecticidal and acaricidal performance. Mortality was greatest (94 %) when fruit extract of accession PI- 593566 (C. annuum) was sprayed on larvae of the cabbage looper, while crude extracts of accessions PI- 241675 (C. frutescens) and PI- 310488 (C. annuum) were repellent to the spider mite. We investigated differences in chemical composition of the crude fruit extracts that may explain the observed differences in mortality and repellency between accessions. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry spectrometric analysis revealed that capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, the pungent components of pepper fruit, {{were not correlated with}} toxicity or repellency, indicating that the two capsaicinoids are not likely related to the efficacy of pepper fruit extracts.

In order to protect the consumer against the potential <b>harmful</b> <b>residues</b> present in the derived animal products, their use for growth promoting purposes has been prohibited within the European Union. Due to the low limits of detection, enabled by recent developments within the field of analytical chemistry, in recent years prednisolone-positive bovine urine samples have surfaced. Under specific conditions of storage, the presence of microorganisms in urine samples may alter the endogenous concentration of steroid hormones. It is important to ensure that analyte instability will not affect the analytical results during transportation and storage. A well-known example of incurrent storage is the microbial transformation of testosterone to boldenone by a Δ 1 -dehydrogenation. Due to the related structure with testosterone a similar reaction might be expected of cortisol to prednisolone and cortisone to prednisone. The present study examined the changes of glucocorticoid concentrations in bovine urine samples and the effect of different long-term storage conditions such as pH and temperature. The preservation under aerobe and anaerobe environments, as well as the contamination with fecal bacteria, were evaluated. Another experiment was carried out to determine losses during freeze-thaw cycles. To this end an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method coupled to an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (U-HPLC-Orbitrap-MS) was developed and successfully validated according to 2002 / 657 /EC.

Groups 2, 3, and 4 were fed the BD supplemented with 10 g basil, 10 g chamomile, and 5 g basil plus 5 g chamomile per kg of food, respectively. Basil supplementation alone or in combination with chamomile non-significantly (P≥ 0. 05) increased final body weight (3. 2 % and 0. 3 %, respectively) and weight gain (3. 5 % and 3. 6 %, respectively) over the experimental period. Chamomile supplementation alone non-significantly (P≥ 0. 05) reduced final body weight and weight gain over the experimental period by 1. 7 % and 1. 7 %, respectively. In comparison to the control group, herbal seed supplementation reduced feed intake and improved the feed conversion and protein efficiency ratios. In general, basil seed supplementation stimulated chicken growth and improved the feed efficiency more effectively than chamomile seed supplementation. The antioxidant activities of basil and/or chamomile supplementation were examined in the thymus, bursa, and spleen. In chickens that received supplements, the level of malondialdehyde was significantly decreased, whereas the activities of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were significantly increased (P< 0. 05). Supplementation of basil and/or chamomile did not affect blood protein levels, but had lipid-lowering effects as evidenced by reduced serum levels of total lipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol.

Irradiation is an alternative to the use of chemicals which often leave <b>harmful</b> <b>residues</b> in the food. Currently about 40 countries have introduced legislation allowing the irradiation of specific foods. No standards have yet been promulgated for Australia, although some irradiation of foods has been done. In the interests of facilitating export and import trade, it would be prudent for this country to adopt the international standard and allow the process to compete commercially. Considerations 1. Historical Development The need to preserve food for troops in World War 2 stimulated interest in treatment using gamma radiation. Further research was subsequently coordinated by the IAEA, FAO and WHO of the UN and continues to the present. 2. Effects of Gamma Radiation on Food Treatment by gamma irradiation does not cause food to become radioactive. The radiation dose used depends upon the purpose of the treatment, not on the type of food. In practical terms, applications are limited by undesirable changes in taste, texture, colour and odour of specific foods at the doses required for treatment. Relatively low doses in the range of 0. 1 – 10 kiloGray (kGy) are used. These compare to doses of 10 – 25 kGy used for the sterilisation of medical and other items. Irradiation produces free radicals but these disappear long before the food is likely to be consumed. It causes some nutritional losses to an extent which is no greater (sometimes much less) than alternative treatments such as freezing, dehydration, curing, fumigation and cooking...|$|R

The most common method to treat these problems is through chemical treatments, however, such treatments are not generally acceptable due to the <b>harmful</b> chemical <b>residues</b> for the consumers. Here we pursue an alternative approach using essential oils studied in vitro. Lemon grass oil {{has been found to be}} the most effective agent against some microbial {{diseases and}} the parasitic mite. In this study we pursue an effective means to deliver the volatile oils by using porous ceramic materials as supporting media. In field trials, we used porous ceramics prepared using diatomaceous earth and activated charcoal as the main starting materials. The amount of activated charcoal was varied at 10, 20, 25, and 42. 1 g. to determine optimal adsorption and control emission of the volatile lemongrass oil...|$|R
40|$|Application {{of organic}} manures not only improve the {{physical}} {{conditions of the}} soil, but also helps in better root growth, nutrient uptake and in tum increase the yield. Generally, organic manures are low in nutrients compared to chemical fertilizers but in bulk supply, organic manures can provide enough nutrients for vegetable crops. The yield obtained {{with the use of}} fertilizers in combination with organic manures are higher than the lise of in-organic fertilizers alone (Sharma and Dua. 1995). Yield of tomato is influ enced by several factors including optimum nutrition of the crop. Farmers are attracted towards the organic farming in developed countries {{in order to reduce the}} <b>harmful</b> chemical <b>residues,</b> but it has not yet commer cially adopted in developing countries like India. Hence, this trial was undertaken to find out the effect of organic farming on tomato production.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{alarming}} increase in cases of imported foodstuffs, from the Far East in particular, containing <b>residues</b> <b>harmful</b> to health. The Agriculture Council, meeting on March 18 th, discussed the need to re-examine the criteria used in the EU to assess the effectiveness of residue checks applied by third countries. Comment: Increased checks on residues could increase costs to ACP suppliers as they have to tighten up their controls to check for substances which, in many cases, have no role in production in ACP countries. There {{has been an}} alarming increase in cases [...] ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The ABC efflux {{transporter}} ABCG 2 {{represents the}} main route for active secretion of various xenobiotics like drugs into human and dairy milk. Our recent {{studies showed that}} the pesticide prochloraz (PZ) induced ABCG 2 activity in primary bovine mammary cells by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Pesticides are extensively used in agriculture and exposure of dairy animals occurs through contaminated feed. Despite the toxicological relevance of the mammary ABCG 2 secretory activity, there is no detailed information on ABCG 2 -pesticide interactions in dairy cows. MATERIAL AND METHODS For this study, we used MDCKII cells stably expressing mammary bovine ABCG 2 (bABCG 2) that exhibits an AhR binding motif in its 50 -untranslated region. Cells were incubated with selected pesticides. Chosen concentrations reflected the oneand ten-fold maximum residue levels (MRLs) in ruminant tissues. The bABCG 2 promoter activity was examined by reporter assays. The mRNA levels of ABCG 2, AhR and of the prototypical AhR target gene cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1 were detected by quantitative RT-PCR. The CYP 1 A 1 catalytic activity was measured by using 7 -ethoxyresorufin –deethylase (EROD) as a substrate. We assessed ABCG 2 efflux activity by the Hoechst H 33342 test. RESULTS Of all 14 tested substances, we detected ABCG 2 -pesticide interactions with one-fold MRL concentrations of chlorpyrifosmethyl (CPM), diflufenican (DF), glyphosate (GY), methiocarb (MT), PZ and thiacloprid (TC). This interaction was reflected by the competitive inhibition of bABCG 2 -mediated H 33342 excretion through the tested pesticide. A combined incubation of CPM and MT resulted in a further increase of cellular H 33342 levels. Pre-treatment of cells (72 h) with PZ, CPM and iprodion caused a dose-dependent increase in bABCG 2 mRNA levels and EROD activity. The AhR antagonist CH 223191 significantly blocked the PZ-induced increase in bABCG 2 mRNA amounts. Moreover, 10 -fold MRL levels of these pesticides caused an increase in CYP 1 A 1 but not AhR mRNA levels. In this concentration, PZ further induced bABCG 2 promoter activity. CONCLUSIONS This study identified several pesticides as potential bABCG 2 substrates. For some of them activation of AhR and AhRdepen-dent induction of bABCG 2 gene expression was noticed. Hence, our results suggested that animal exposure with these feed contaminants may {{increase the risk of}} potential <b>harmful</b> <b>residues</b> of ABCG 2 substrates in dairy milk like drugs and toxins...|$|R
