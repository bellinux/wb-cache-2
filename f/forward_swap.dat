5000|$|There is {{a debate}} between school board members and an {{organization}} named State High Vision (SHV). The school board plans High School Facilities Plan to demolish one {{of the high school}} buildings and disintegrate the other. The school board believes this is the most cost effective option and that they have looked at all of the options. State High Vision, an organization of some community citizens, claims that the plan was decided on with little community input. SHV also doesn’t like the creation of what they deem a mega-school (3,400 students in one building), claiming that students learn better in a smaller environment. About 200 students held walk outs in protest of the renovation project in 2007. Eric Topp provides a comprehensive description of the hullabaloo and opined incompetence by the school board at: http://www.erictopp.net/5.html State College Area School District in Pennsylvania several years ago abandoned plans to build a new high school. In May 2011 the district received notice that it owed $10 million to the Royal Bank of Canada for skipping an interest payment on money it never borrowed for a school it didn't build. The State College case has an unusual twist reported by the Wall Street Journal. the district agreed to swap interest rates before it borrowed the money, called a forward swap; it filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court saying their ignorance made the contract void. The district skipped its first payment—for $978,000. Royal Bank of Canada says the school authorized the debt—even if it never borrowed money for the project—and that the swap is valid. The court agreed. The SCASD earned the distinction of approving the only <b>forward</b> <b>SWAP</b> by a school district in Pennsylvania and probably in the nation.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 156 - 160). The lognormal forward-Libor and Swap market {{models were}} formulated to price caps and swaptions. However, the prices computed {{by these two}} models, under equivalent measures, are reported to be unequal. This study investigates this incompatibility by computing the prices of caps and swaptions under both the forward Libor measure and the <b>forward</b> <b>Swap</b> measure, in both the Libor and Swap market models. This was done by building a computer program that implements the Monte Carlo versions of the models, using data from caps and swaptions traded in the South African market. It {{was found that the}} actual price of caps, using the same implied volatility, were simulated accurately in both the Libor and Swap market models under both the forward Libor measure and the <b>forward</b> <b>Swap</b> measure. On the other hand, although the actual swaption prices were also simulated accurately in both the Libor and Swap market models under both the forward Libor measure and the <b>forward</b> <b>Swap</b> measure, a different implied volatility was used for each model. Therefore, the swaption price computed by the Libor market model was inconsistent with the price generated by the Swap market model; the two models are indeed incompatible. In order to price interest rate derivatives consistently, either the Libor market model or the Swap market model must be chosen. Since the Libor market model priced consistently under the two forward measures, and the time taken to simulate a price in the Libor market model was much less than in the Swap market model, the practice in the market to use the Libor market model in favour of the Swap market model is justiﬁed...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses an {{extensive}} set of market data of <b>forward</b> <b>swap</b> rates and swaptions covering 3 July 2002 to 21 May 2009 {{to identify a}} two-dimensional stochastic volatility process for the level of rates. The process is identified step by step by increasing the requirement of the model and introducing appropriate adjustments. The {{first part of the}} paper investigates the smile dynamics of <b>forward</b> <b>swap</b> rates at their setting dates. Comparing the SABR (with different β) and Heston stochastic volatility models informs us what different specifications of the driving SDEs have to offer in terms of reflecting the dynamics of the smile across dates. The outcome of the analysis is that a normal SABR model (β= 0) satisfactorily passes all tests and seems to provide a good match to the market. In contrast, we find that the Heston model does not. The next step is to seek a model of the <b>forward</b> <b>swap</b> rates (in their own swaption measure) based on only two Brownian motions that enables a specification with common parameters. It turns out that this can be done by extending the SABR model with a time-dependent volatility function and a mean-reverting volatility process. The performance of the extended (SABR with mean-reversion) model is analysed over several historical dates and is shown to be a stable and flexible choice that allows for good calibration across expiries and strikes. Finally, a time-homogeneous candidate stochastic volatility process that {{can be used as a}} driver for all swap rates is identified. This candidate process may in future work be used as a building block for a separable stochastic volatility LIBOR market model or a stochastic volatility Markov-functional model...|$|E

While this level of trade may seem disproportionate to investors’ rebalancing and hedging needs, we lack economic models that predict what trading volume in these market should be. In theoretical models trading volume ranges from zero (e. g., in rational expectation models without noise) to infinite (e. g., when traders dynamically hedge in the absence of trading costs).
