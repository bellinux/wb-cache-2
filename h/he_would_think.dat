5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} happy with his race victory which he believed would help his confidence throughout the remainder of the season. Häkkinen added that his team displayed pit boards which instructed him not to over rev his engine during the race's first half. Coulthard said that he was satisfied with the outcome of the first lap as it allowed him to drive a conservative race. He added that his strong finish would not mean that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about his potential to clinch the Drivers' Championship. Barrichello explained that his car was loose from contact with Trulli during the race's early stages which prevented him from challenging de la Rosa.|$|E

25|$|So Kock went {{directly}} to President Lincoln. Lincoln had his doubts about Kock's sincerity at first. He suspected that Kock was only after the $50 per person which had been promised. Kock managed to convince him, however, and on December 31, the President promised that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about his plan. But just one day later, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which contained not a single word about {{this or any other}} colonial plan.|$|E

Reactions to the bat were mixed. Stuart Law said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> 'twice' before using the Mongoose, while MS Dhoni said in his column that he believed in Hayden's ability 'no matter what means he uses'. After a quiet start to the third edition of the IPL, Hayden made a blistering 93 off 43 deliveries to kickstart his campaign.|$|E

[...] He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this {{would be good for the}} country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Khánh then ended the meeting, saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about his future.|$|E

500|$|Following its release, {{the music}} video became popular {{for the gold}} hotpants Minogue sported. It {{resulted}} in a media sensation regarding her bottom. British national broadsheet newspaper The Sunday Times deemed her bottom a [...] "wonder of nature" [...] and The Sun sponsored a campaign to [...] "have Kylie Minogue's rear-end heritage-listed, preserved for [...] "posteriority" [...] {{on the grounds that}} it's an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty." [...] Readers were requested by the tabloid newspaper to persuade the government to make sure [...] " [...] bum remains in safe hands - by turning it into a national institution." [...] Rumours and speculations claiming Minogue had undergone plastic surgery to make her bottom look more appealing also began to arise during this time. In the same year, English broadcaster and journalist Johnny Vaughan commented [...] "if an alien landed on Earth <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> Kylie's arse is the world's leader." [...] Minogue's stylist and close friend William Baker explained his decision to [...] "showcase" [...] her bottom in the video, saying [...] "Kylie's bottom is like a peach - sex sells and her best asset is her bum." [...] The singer's response to the attention regarding her bottom was [...] "dry," [...] claiming [...] "You never know what the future holds. It could become a pear." [...] It was reported that Minogue had her bottom insured for five million dollars.|$|E
500|$|At this point, Team International's Sabin and Shelley took {{advantage}} of their well-developed teamwork, having worked together as the Motor City Machine Guns since 2006, by double-teaming Dr. Wagner Jr. to allow Shelley to eliminate the Doctor over 47 minutes into the match. Just over a minute later Shocker and Último Guerrero countered one of Corleone's high flying moves to pin and eliminate Corleone from Team International. A double Superkick to Shocker allowed Shelley and Sabin to eliminate him, leaving Último Guerrero as {{the only member of}} Team Mexico. Último Guerrero was able to pin Chris Sabin, leaving only himself and Shelley. In the closing moments of the match, Último Guerrero managed to pin Sabin, eliminating him from the match. Minutes later Alex Shelley locked in a submission hold, then pulled Guerrero's mask off in the process out of view of the referee. The hold and Guerrero's attempts to cover his face led to Último Guerrero submitting to the hold moments later, giving Alex Shelley the victory and the International Gran Prix trophy. After the match Último Guerrero challenged Alex Shelley to a Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", where Shelly would risk his hair against Guerrero's wrestling mask. Shelly said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about it and would give Guerrero an answer after {{he had a chance to}} relax.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} cases, Yamazaki would usually {{come up with}} the twist of the case first; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of {{something}} shocking or a surprising event, as well as the setting and set-up of the episode. He would then figure out how it could logically have happened, which he said was the most compelling method, story-wise; if it were done in the other direction – starting with how the case would work logically and then adding a twist - he found that it would not [...] "ring true". He found that coming up with ways of resolving these mysteries was very difficult compared to coming up with the set-up. He worked towards including story developments that would [...] "keep [...] guessing", and puzzles that [...] "appeal to their curiosity". He tried to create scenarios that make the player interested, which resulted in the bombing in the first episode and how the second episode's murderer appears to be a mythical creature. Among scrapped ideas for the episodes were a case of an [...] "ethereal murder" [...] where the suspect remembers killing someone but there is no body and no evidence of it even happening, and a case where a doll has been killed. He noted that these ideas, while having an impact and sounding interesting, were unrealistic and would not work. Yamazaki took inspirations from several different kinds of stories, including books, movies and television; the second episode in particular was inspired by the works of the author Natsuhiko Kyogoku.|$|E

500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because of who he is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because I was afraid <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> I was going after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E
500|$|Arranger Nelson Riddle found Sinatra to be a [...] "perfectionist {{who drove}} himself and {{everybody}} around him relentlessly", {{and stated that}} his collaborators approached him {{with a sense of}} uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. [...] Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. [...] After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for Anchor's Away, [...] "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it were a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it were a [...] "rhythm" [...] number, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter {{at the end of each}} number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as [...] "Isn't that a pretty ballad" [...] or [...] "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with [...] "childlike delight". She states that after each show, Sinatra would be [...] "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".|$|E
2500|$|Before leaving Washington D.C. for the Territory of Idaho, Edgerton had {{a private}} meeting with President Abraham Lincoln, in which he asked for the {{position}} of Territorial Governor of Montana. [...] Lincoln told Edgerton that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about it. Edgerton then left for the west, unsure {{of whether or not}} he would have a new position when he arrived, but on May 23, 1864, while on his way home, Mary Edgerton had a baby girl. She named her Idaho, unknowing {{of the fact that it}} was now the Territory of Montana. After seeing his skills in the Territory of Idaho, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Edgerton as the first Territorial Governor of Montana.|$|E

2500|$|Tommy Dorsey's first {{band was}} formed {{out of the}} remains of the Joe Haymes band, and so began Dorsey's long-running {{practice}} of raiding other bands for talent. If he admired a vocalist, musician or arranger, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> nothing of taking over their contracts and careers. [...] Dorsey had a reputation for being a perfectionist. He was volatile and also known to hire and fire (and sometimes rehire) musicians based on his mood. [...] The new band was popular from almost the moment it signed with RCA Victor with [...] "On Treasure Island," [...] the first of four hits for the new band in 1935. After his 1935 recording, however, Dorsey's manager cut the [...] "hot jazz" [...] that Dorsey had mixed with his own lyrical style and instead had Dorsey play pop and vocal tunes. Dorsey would keep his Clambake Seven as a Dixieland group that played during performances, too. The Dorsey band had a national radio presence in 1936, first from Dallas and then from Los Angeles. Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra took over comedian Jack Pearl's radio show in 1937.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{forefront}} of the bowling attack was Ray Lindwall, who became a fast bowler after watching Harold Larwood in 1932-33. His whose smooth run up and perfect delivery produced swing and control and bouncers at a lethal pace, though he dropped the ball short less than Miller. Neville Cardus later wrote that [...] "He has so many brains it's a wonder why he ever went in for fast bowling" [...] and working hand-in-glove with his captain Don Bradman <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> batsman out and catch them in carefully selected field-placings. A. P. Herbert was moved to poetry to describe his bowling action and Trevor Bailey wrote [...] "Watching him bowl {{was one of the most}} satisfying spectacles the game has ever produced". Even so, his arm was thought to be too low (Frank Tyson thought him almost a round-arm bowler) and his long drag could have produced numerous no balls, though he was rarely called for this. His partner Keith Miller had been a batsmen, but in the Victory Tests the Australian Services XI were short of bowlers and Hassett used Miller initially as a change bowler and then gave him the new ball. To everyone's surprise he picked up wickets and soon his strength and natural talent made him into a genuine fast bowler. Bradman knew Australia needed this more than another batsman and encouraged Miller to develop his new talent, though his back injury limited him to short spells. Unlike his new-ball partner Miller liked to drop the ball short and lacked consistency, sometimes bowling leg-breaks or off-spin. Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well under the control of the batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone". Together they formed the best fast bowling duo in post-war cricket, perhaps the greatest of any era, and were the spearhead of Australia's success. Ernie Toshack was a left-arm medium pace bowler who bowled with a packed leg-side field and tied up the batsmen when Lindwall and Miller were resting. In the First Test he had the perfect pace to unhinge the English batting on a Brisbane sticky, but failed to understand Bradman's instructions. In the end Bradman took him to the middle, pointed to the spot where he wanted Toshack to bowl, and made him practice alongside the wicket until he understood what was required. Once this was done 9 of the last 15 wickets fell to his bowling and Australia won by an innings. Fred Freer was a steady fast-medium swing bowler who liked to drop the ball short and replaced Ray Lindwall in the Second Test when the fast bowler had chickenpox.|$|E
