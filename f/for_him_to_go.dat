5|$|In November, Fowler {{travelled}} to Frankfurt, Germany to see Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, {{a specialist}} sports injuries doctor, {{to try and}} resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds. The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on 15 December as a late substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Bristol City. However {{he went on to}} suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain Darren Purse left him with damaged ankle ligaments. Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Colorado, United States to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it would finally resolve the problem.|$|E

On 4 July 2013, Miliband effectively sacked Tom Watson from the Shadow Cabinet after allegations of corruption over the selection of a parliamentary candidate for Falkirk. Watson had offered his resignation, but when Miliband was asked by a journalist specifically whether he had sacked Watson, he replied, [...] "...I said it was right <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> yes." ...|$|E

Later, after going to the bar to drink, Brian talks to Bill, the father from The Family Circus syndicated comic strip. After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book, Brian responds by yelling that all Bill does is [...] "judge" [...] other people, and demands <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home and [...] "fuck [...] wife in the face", to which Bill agrees. This is also later recognized by Peter the next day, when he is seen reading the funnies, and murmurs to himself, [...] "this is a very shocking Family Circus." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{shooting}} the first subway scenes, D'Onofrio's performance was over-the-top and bombastic. Yoshimura {{asked him to}} act a little calmer during the earlier scenes and save the energy for the later scenes, because [...] "if he did go up right away, there was nowhere else <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after that". D'Onofrio agreed and modified his performance accordingly. Fleder also clashed with MacVittie over his portrayal of the Biedron character. Fleder felt that the character appeared too crazy in earlier scenes, and that the actor was telegraphing the twist in which MacVittie {{would turn out to}} be a murderer. MacVittie approached Yoshimura about the criticism, but Yoshimura agreed with Fleder's interpretation. After MacVittie toned down the character's behavior, Fleder said that he was extremely pleased with the end result.|$|E

In his next {{appearance}} vs. Yale, despite scoring only six points, he posted a career-high 13 rebounds. Teammate Stéphane Lasme added 10 boards. Lappas said, [...] "What {{else do you}} say about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its great to see Anthony have six points in the game and win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance. It's good <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out there and play and direct these kids that he has out there under him." [...] In mid-December 2004, Anderson was suspended for three games after failing a drug test. Lappas called it a [...] "violation of team rules." ...|$|E
500|$|As it {{had done}} in 2005, ERT asked 2004 entrant Sakis Rouvas to {{represent}} Greece in the 2006 contest, but he once again denied. In an interview with Down Town magazine Rouvas recalled getting the proposal from the network in [...] "either August or September" [...] and considering it briefly; however, he ultimately found {{there was no reason}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> especially when Greece was the reigning champion, making chances of winning little to none. Nevertheless, ERT still wanted Rouvas involved in some way and they asked him to host the competition, which he accepted. With the news leaked by the newspaper Ethnos, a public announcement was made on 1 November 2005. Rouvas said of his decision, [...] "but when I received the proposal for the hosting of Eurovision I found it intriguing", and that it would challenge him. American television personality and actress Maria Menounos was eventually announced as his female co-host. The two presented all of the major Eurovision events, including the allocation draw, in addition to the semi-final and final.|$|E

500|$|Still {{feeling the}} chest injury {{sustained}} during the 1818 election, Maxwell returned to Britain in 1826 and entered retirement; {{during this period}} he also reportedly had a bout of depression, especially following {{the sudden death of}} his youngest daughter in 1827. In 1830, he was recalled by the newly crowned King William IV. [...] A former naval officer himself, King William selected a number of senior Navy officers to be his aides de camp, including Maxwell, who was subsequently appointed to succeed John Ready as Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island on 14 March 1831. As Maxwell sailed from his home in Scotland to London to make preparations for his departure, he was suddenly taken ill. Medical assistance was unavailable for 48 hours during the passage, and the weather too rough <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ashore in an open boat in his condition. As a result, Maxwell died shortly after arriving at Green's Hotel in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London; Colonel Aretas William Young took his place as governor. Maxwell was buried at St Marylebone Parish Church, and was survived by his wife and their son John Balfour Maxwell, who died in 1874 as an admiral of the Royal Navy.|$|E
500|$|Cragh's {{recovery}} {{began the}} day after his hanging, but it was some time– one witness said 15 days– before he was able to stand unaided. That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle, as miracles were supposed to be immediate, but [...] "partial miracles" [...] could be explained by the [...] "lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow". Once sufficiently recovered, Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The chaplain, William of Codineston, was also present. Cragh explained, [...] "with great fear and apprehension" [...] according to the chaplain, that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him. His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again, and he had good reason to be worried. Although those who survived were usually pardoned, it was not unknown for them to be hanged again. Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe, or he may simply have decided that it would be prudent <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with the story for his own safety. Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop dressed all in white appeared, and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth.|$|E

Totor is victorious, and throws his three captors out of the building. [...] He discovers his uncle tied to a chair; Totor frees him, and Pad tells his nephew that the bandits kidnapped his aunt Save. [...] Totor suddenly has an idea to use the treasure he found as a ransom for his aunt. [...] The two of them set out to go fetch it, but along the way a criminal steals their map while they sleep. After discovering the loss of their jewels they follow the thief's unique footprints for a few miles. [...] When they see another set of footprints join the first and then head up into some mountains, Totor continues on his own. Having eluded several Native sentries he spies the chest {{in the hands of the}} Chief. After recovering the box and outrunning the Natives back to his uncle, they hurriedly head home. [...] There they find a ransom note from the leader of the bandits, Jim Blackcat, saying to meet them under a big fir tree that day or they would kill his aunt. [...] Totor rushes to the rendezvous where he overwhelms the criminals and orders them to tell him where they are keeping his aunt hostage. After a heroic rescue and an emotional reunion between his aunt and uncle, he finds out that it is time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Belgium.

When the Valar decided to send the order of the Wizards (Istari) to Middle-earth in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed Sauron, Olórin was proposed by Manwë. Olórin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manwë replied that that was all the more reason <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E

Dappy secretly copied her phone number from the studio console and sent abusive and threatening text messages to the woman the following day including one telling her she was [...] "gonna die!". Moyles said of the resulting criticism: [...] "I feel let down by him, I've supported them and said, 'Do you know what, N-Dubz aren't {{just a bunch of}} dippy chavs, they're really good.'

To contradict critics who thought this would leave him tightly musclebound and uncoordinated, LaLanne liked to demonstrate one-handed balancing. His home contained two gyms and a pool which he used daily. He also dismissed warm-ups, calling them [...] "shtick" [...] and [...] "something else to sell". He said, [...] "15 minutes to warm up?
