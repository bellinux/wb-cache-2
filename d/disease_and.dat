40|$|Abstract: Pathogenic {{dampness}} {{can cause}} many <b>diseases,</b> <b>and</b> {{that is why}} traditional Chinese medicine pays close attention to pathogenic dampness. In recent years many researches discovered that dampness <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> aquaporin have close correlation. By analyzing the progress in research on correlation between dampness <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> aquaporin, it is discovered that aquaporin has close correlation with urinary system, digestive system, respiratory system and central nervous system. Normal expression of aquaporin may be the molecular biological basis of dispelling dampness, while abnormal expression {{may be one of}} the main causes for dampness diseases. Studying the correlation between dampness <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> aquaporin has quite important significance in understanding mechanism of dampness <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> formulating treatment protocols...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of neurological <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> disorders remains mostly unknown. Neuroinflammation {{has been}} proposed as a causative factor for neurological diseases. The confirmation that neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain and neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in the adult central nervous system (CNS) of mammals has tremendous implications for {{our understanding of the}} physio- and pathology of the nervous system. The generation of newborn neuronal cells in the adult brain is modulated in neurological <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> during inflammation. This suggests that adult neurogenesis is involved in the pathogenesis of neurological <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> disorders, particularly during neuroinflammation. In this manuscript, we will review the modulation of adult neurogenesis in neurological <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> during neuroinflammation. We will discuss the role and contribution of neuroinflammation and adult neurogenesis to neurological <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> disorders, and for the therapeutic potential of adult NSCs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although disability-free life {{expectancy}} {{has been investigated}} in Japan, gains from elimination of <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> injuries have not been examined. Methods: We used data from the 2007 Japanese national health statistics to calculate {{the number of years}} with and without activity limitation that could be expected from eliminating 6 selected <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> injuries. Results: At birth, the number of expected years of life without and with activity limitation was 70. 8 and 8. 4, respectively, in males and 74. 2 and 11. 8 in females. More than 1. 0 expected years without activity limitation were gained from eliminating malignant neoplasms and cerebrovascular diseases; smaller gains were observed after eliminating other <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> injuries. Elimination of cerebrovascular <b>diseases,</b> dementia, <b>and</b> fracture decreased expected years with activities of daily living (ADL) limitation, and elimination of shoulder lesions/low back pain decreased expected years with non-ADL limitation. Conclusions: Elimination of <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> injuries increased expected years with and without activity limitation among Japanese, which suggests that improved prevention of those <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> injuries—including cerebrovascular <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> dementia—would result in longer disability-free {{life expectancy}} and fewer years of severe disability...|$|R
5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the <b>disease,</b> <b>and</b> researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
