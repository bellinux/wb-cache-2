This analysis is important in the design of great industrial plants, where equipment of great size and high cost is present, and in which an adequate structural behavior is essential for the plant operation. The analysis methodology is initially presented, based on two computer programs, BLOCKSOLVER and PILAY. This methodology is applied in a comparative analysis of solutions in shallow foundations and in pile foundations for a Flue <b>Gas</b> <b>Blower,</b> equipment present in a petrochemical plant. The dynamic analysis is done for the two types of foundation, and also for a parametric variation in the shear modulus of the soil (G). The design of the foundation is done considering the geometrical limitations for the location of the equipment, consequent of the plant layout. The most important results are the maximum displacements, checked against the stringent limitations imposed by the design standards...|$|E

The high-temperature apparatus is composed of two devices of a hot nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>blower</b> and its duct which are located {{very close to the}} specimen so as to avoid heat dissipation to the other parts. The apparatus is attached to the CCD diffractometer to enable fast data collection at high temperatures up to over 1000 ºC with a stability of less than 1 ºC. The apparatus places no geometrical restriction to the diffractometer, allowing measurements up to 120 º in 2 θ. High temperature diffraction data were collected for the α-Al 2 O 3 single crystal at 300, 600 and 900 ºC within 3 hours for each measurements. The merge R factors were less than 0. 019 and the final agreement factors between Fo and Fc were less than 0. 031 in the range 1 º < 2 θ < 92 º. The Al atom was found to be gradually displaced with increasing temperature so that the Al-Al repulsion force across a pair of face-sharing octahedra can relax.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work performed for manufacturing and demonstrating {{the performance of}} its 250 -kW molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) stack in an integrated system at the Naval Air Station Miramar (NAS Miramar) located in San Diego, California. The stack constructed for the demonstration test at the NAS Miramar consisted of 250 cells. It was manufactured using M-C Power`s patented Internally Manifolded Heat Exchanger (IMHEX{reg_sign}) stack design. The demonstration test at NAS Miramar was designed to operate the 250 -kW MCFC stack in a cogeneration mode. This test represented the first attempt to thermally integrate an MCFC stack in a cogeneration system. The test was started on January 10, 1997, and voluntarily terminated on May 12, 1997, after 2, 350 hours of operation at temperatures above 1, 100 F and at a pressure of three atmospheres. It produced 160 MWh of d. c. power and 346, 000 lbs of 110 psig steam for export during 1, 566 hours of on-load operations. The test demonstrated a d. c. power output of 206 kW. Most of {{the balance of the}} plant (BOP) equipment operated satisfactorily. However, the off-the-shelf automotive turbocharger used for supplying air to the plant failed on numerous occasions and the hot <b>gas</b> <b>blower</b> developed seal leakage problems which impacted continuous plant operations.

40|$|The general {{trend towards}} {{increasing}} e ciency and energy density drives {{the industry to}} high-speed technologies. Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs) {{are one of the}} technologies that allow contactless support of a rotating body. Theoretically, there are no limitations on the rotational speed. The absence of friction, low maintenance cost, micrometer precision, and programmable sti ness have made AMBs a viable choice for highdemanding applications. Along with the advances in power electronics, such as signi cantly improved reliability and cost, AMB systems have gained a wide adoption in the industry. The AMB system is a complex, open-loop unstable system with multiple inputs and outputs. For normal operation, such a system requires a feedback control. To meet the high demands for performance and robustness, model-based control techniques should be applied. These techniques require an accurate plant model description and uncertainty estimations. The advanced control methods require more e ort at the commissioning stage. In this work, a methodology is developed for an automatic commissioning of a subcritical, rigid <b>gas</b> <b>blower</b> machine. The commissioning process includes open-loop tuning of separate parts such as sensors and actuators. The next step is to apply a system identi cation procedure to obtain a model for the controller synthesis. Finally, a robust model-based controller is synthesized and experimentally evaluated in the full operating range of the system. The commissioning procedure is developed by applying only the system components available and a priori knowledge without any additional hardware.

40|$|A {{parallel}} {{reactor cell}} for catalytic in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements was developed. The cell facilitates the simultaneous catalytic and structural investigation of six catalysts under different feed gas conditions. A two-dimensional X-ray sensor {{was used for}} spectra collection. Gas compositions were measured by on-line mass spectrometry. The potential and limitations of the high throughput XAS cell are discussed. The heterogeneously catalyzed partial oxidation of methane (CPO) was chosen as a test reaction. Alumina-supported Rh and Au/Rh catalysts with different metal loadings (0. 5 – 2. 5 wt%) were applied and prepared via different preparation routes using flame spray pyrolysis (fsp) and colloid adsorption (col). For comparison the same catalysts were also investigated in a fixed-bed capillary reactor heated by a <b>gas</b> <b>blower</b> (also for XAS measurements) and in an eight-fold parallel gas phase reactor using similar reaction conditions (6 % CH$_ 4 $– 3 % O$_ 2 $–He, 250 – 500 °C). Similar catalytic results were obtained in all three reactor types, confirming the suitability of the parallel reactor XAS cell for catalytic measurements. The catalysts showed different activity, selectivity and reducibility depending on metal loading, preparation route and Au/Rh ratio. The analysis of the catalytic data, STEM images and the in situ XANES experiments of the various catalysts indicated the following characteristics for the CPO reaction: sufficient heat production by combustion of methane, total conversion of oxygen, and reduction of a certain fraction of the catalyst. The overall catalytic behavior was in line with a two-zone model of the catalyst bed where catalytic combustion dominates in the front zone and reforming reactions become favored {{in the second part}} of the catalyst bed...|$|E

40|$|Operating {{results of}} the {{stationary}} SOFC CHP system jointly developed within the project “SOFC 20 ” by Plansee, IKTS, FZJ, Schott and AVL will be shown. The system {{is based on a}} CFY-stack platform with chromium based (CFY) interconnects and electrolyte supported cells. The successful development of all stack components i. e. : interconnect (Plansee), cells (IKTS), glass sealing (IKTS and Schott), protection- and contact layer (IKTS) enables robust, redox stable stacks with a low degradation rate. The stacks were arranged to modules of eight 30 -cell stacks and were electrically connected in series. Uniform gas and air distribution were simulated with CFD tools and reproduced in tests. The stack module was tested at a test rig at IKTS and showed good results. Stationary power points were measured to compare the behavior of the stack module to the system test at AVL. For an optimized start of the system a procedure for a start of the stack module with CH 4 containing reformate was determined. After shipping the stack module was tested in the system at AVL in Graz and showed comparable results. AVL as the system integrator operated the system at 3 - 6 kWel for more than 1000 h at an efficiency of ~ 56 %DC. The system was operated at ~ 830 °C up to a current output of 36 A. During this testing period the stack module has shown no observable degradation. The natural gas driven system is equipped with an anode gas recirculation cycle using a hot anode <b>gas</b> <b>blower</b> to enable steam reforming during load operation without an external steam supply. The blowers use hydrodynamic bearings and were successfully operated at 600 °C gas temperature with a significant amount of start/stop cycles showing no degradation. By controlling the rotor speed of the blower the recirculation ratio could be adjusted in a wide range. An exhaust gas heated steam reformer was used to control the reforming temperature and thus influence the methane content at the stack inlet. The results of operation of the stack module under lab conditions and in the real system are in a good agreement. The module performance in terms of cell voltages, stack temperature distribution and fuel utilization under methane reformate fuel will be shown...|$|E

40|$|Post-combustion CO 2 capture (PCC) with {{chemical}} solvents is a near-term option for commercial deployment of CO 2 capture from power plants. However, {{the technology is}} energy intensive and costly, {{and there is no}} experience with the deployment of CO 2 capture at large power plant scale. Therefore, proper knowledge of CO 2 capture mechanisms is required to solve the technological challenges. Also, due to lack of experience with large-scale CO 2 capture, the reasonable way for evaluation of the process is simulation and precise modeling. In the design of an absorber, the largest capital unit, important parameters such as mass and heat transfer, wetting and active area, kinetics for the solvent chosen and effects of operational conditions need to be properly understood before moving from small to large-scale. Due to lack of proper understanding of the complex transfer phenomena occurring in the absorber, modeling the absorber is based on empirical and semi-empirical correlations with parameters obtained from fitting to experimental data. Therefore, using these correlations in largescale column applications requires good confidence in the parameters which affect the performance of the system. In this thesis, several correlations for prediction of the hydrodynamics and mass transfer through structured packed columns were compared and the studies showed that there is a large uncertainty associated with applying these correlations to large-scale packed columns. None of the proposed correlations in the literature are verified for large-scale CO 2 capture processes. The uncertainty can be explained by three main factors: (i) the models which the correlations are based on may contain many assumptions that are not generally valid; (ii) the data basis for fitting parameters and for validation of the models may not be extensive enough, or of sufficient quality, and (iii) the complexity of the models may need a numerical approach for solving equations where accuracy may be an issue. A series of rate-based model simulations (RateSep models) were carried out in Aspen plus in order to perform a sensitivity analysis and compare the effect of different design correlations (e. g. mass transfer and interfacial area), physiochemical properties and kinetic models on the performance of an absorber in a large-scale CO 2 capture process with a chemical solvent. The RateSep models were validated using pilot data, the important design parameters such as pressure drop, temperature profiles and CO 2 removal were compared to the pilot data. The results showed that the accuracy of the Aspen RateSep model depends heavily on the reaction kinetic model, selected mass transfer and interfacial area correlations, and more confidence is required for applying the available kinetics and mass transfer models in rigorous rate based modeling of industrial absorber units. Model validation using pilot plant or commercial data for the absorption system chosen is highly recommended. Multi-scale simulations of the absorber were also investigated using Aspen RateSep in order to perform cost and sensitivity analysis for CO 2 capture process from a coal-fired and a gas-fired power plant both with a net power output of 400 MWe. Possible redesign of the absorber was studied and the results show that large electrical energy savings in the feed <b>gas</b> <b>blower</b> can be obtained when a design is chosen giving reduced absorber pressure drop. This can be achieved if the column cross sectional area is increased. This is offset by extra capital cost by a need for slightly more volume of packing. The operational design flexibility in a CO 2 capture plant for a gas-fired power plant is higher than for a coal-fired power plant.

40|$|The {{usage of}} OPEFB biomass as an {{alternative}} source for renewable energy such as biochar has a great potential to overcome the shortage of fossil fuel. Moreover, the utilization of biomass {{as a source of}} biofuel can reduce the problem of environmental pollution particularly on the issues related to greenhouse gases. Being the second largest oil palm producer in the world, Malaysia has a great potential to produce clean renewable energy from biomass. The selfsustained carbonization was proposed and tested in this study, whereby oil palm biomass itself was combusted to provide heat for self-carbonization in inadequate oxygen without electrical heating element. In the first chapter, the reviews on the literature pertaining Malaysia palm oil industry, current carbonization technologies, proposed self-sustained carbonization to produce biochar and the objectives of this study have been discussed. In the second chapter, the temperature profiles and gaseous emission concentration during self-sustained carbonization of empty fruit bunch biomass in a pilot scale reactor (30 kg capacity) at different particles sizes (100 - 150, 30 - 99 and less than 29 mm) was evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate, the maximum temperatures ranging 417 - 580 oC at all particle sizes were tested and found to be suitable for biochar production. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 2. 8 - 4. 1, 0. 38 - 0. 51 and 0. 17 - 0. 26 %, respectively. For self-sustained carbonization with fixed exhausted gas flow rate, the maximum temperatures were slightly similar when compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate which was between 493 - 564 oC at all particle size tested. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 3. 65 - 5. 59, 0. 56 - 0. 72 and 0. 29 - 0. 39 %, respectively. SO 2 and HCl were not detected while NOx and particulate matter, (PM 10) were well below permitted level set by the Department of Environment, Malaysia for both natural and fixed exhausted gas flow rate. Gaseous pollutant in this study can be considered low and the self-sustained carbonization process was environmental friendly when compared to other studies using same palm oil biomass carbonization. In the third chapter, the effect of exhausted gas flow rate and OPEFB biomass particle sizes on biochar yield and quality in a pilot scale (30 kg capacity) reactor under self-sustained carbonization were evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate, harvesting carbonization temperature of < 500 oC of OPEFB biomass at the particle size ranging from 100 - 150 mm produced the highest biochar yield and CV between 23 - 25 % and 22. 6 - 24. 7 MJ/kg, respectively. The carbonization retention time was between 790 - 893 min and less compared to other particle sizes tested. This particle size, without further size reduction, is needed to reduce the energy requirement at production line. For self-sustained carbonization temperature with fixed exhausted gas flow rate, the OPEFB biochar yield at particle size 100 - 150 mm produced the highest yield (25 - 27 %), harvested at carbonization temperature of < 500 oC compared to other particle sizes in the same condition. Moreover, this yield was also high as compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate. The CV were found between 23. 0 - 24. 4 MJ/kg which were also comparable with other studies. The carbonization retention time between 280 - 462 min were found less when compared to natural exhausted gas flow rate which contributed to high yield. More consistent result can be achieved under self-sustained carbonization temperature with fixed exhausted gas flow rate but energy required from the usage of exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>blower.</b> In this study, as the carbonization harvesting temperature decreased, the biochar yield decreases, the carbonization retention time increased. In the fourth chapter, self-sustained carbonization of pressed-shredded and whole bunchOPEFB in large scale pool type reactor (3000 kg) from the development of YAMASEN oven (Shimane) were successfully adopted and tested. The pressed-shredded OPEFB was found suitable to be carried out under an open carbonization system while closed carbonization system was preferable for whole bunch OPEFB. The maximum self-sustained carbonization temperature were ranged 583 - 695 oC for pressed-shredded and bunch OPEFB biomass. In terms of CV, large scale biochar production for open and closed system under self-sustained carbonization produced in between 21. 9 - 24. 3 and 19. 6 - 22. 9 MJ/kg, respectively which is comparable to small scale biochar production. In the fifth chapter, the energy balance and potential energy saving of raw and biocharOPEFB (pressed-shredded and whole bunch) in a scaled-up pool type self-sustained carbonization reactor (3 tones capacity) was evaluated. The ratio energy output/input for pressedshredded biochar, whole bunch biochar and raw pressed-shredded OPEFB briquette were positive which were 12, 15 and 8 respectively. Whole bunch biochar is still the highest ratio energy output/input biochar production although without pressed-shredder machine process step resulting in more energy produced than energy consumed. Briquetting raw pressed-shredded without carbonization process step also showed viable energy produced, however drying step with moisture below than 10 % is required. In conclusion and remarks, the self-sustained carbonization was successfully materialized, producing high yield and comparable CV in a small scale followed by scaling-up production of OPEFB biochar. This proposed system is preferable to the industry due to its simplicity, ease of operation and low energy requirement. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 236 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 25 日 1.

40|$|One method {{proposed}} for the cleanup of the D-Area Oil Seepage Basin was in situ bioremediation (bioventing), involving the introduction of air and gaseous nutrients to stimulate contaminant degradation by naturally occurring microorganisms. To test the feasibility of this approach, a bioventing system was installed at the site for use in optimization testing by the Environmental Biotechnology Section of the Savannah River Technology Center. During the interim action, two horizontal wells for a bioventing remediation system were installed eight feet below average basin grade. Nine piezometers were also installed. In September of 1996, a generator, regenerative <b>blower,</b> <b>gas</b> cylinder station, and associated piping and nutrient injection equipment were installed at the site and testing was begun. After baseline characterization of microbial activity and contaminant degradation at the site was completed, four injection campaigns were carried out.

This report describes results of these tests, together with conclusions and recommendations for further remediation of the site. Natural biodegradation rates are high. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane levels in soil gas indicate substantial levels of baseline microbial activity. Oxygen is used by indigenous microbes for biodegradation of organics via respiration and hence is depleted in the soil gas and water from areas with high contamination. Carbon dioxide is elevated in contaminated areas. High concentrations of methane, which is produced by microbes via fermentation once the oxygen has been depleted, are found at the most contaminated areas of this site.

40|$|This study explores {{a method}} of {{generating}} electricity while recovering waste heat through the integration of heat pipes and thermoelectric generators (i. e. HPTEG system). The simultaneous waste heat recovery and power generation processes are achieved {{without the use of}} any moving parts. The HPTEG system consists of bismuth telluride thermoelectric generators (TEG), which are sandwiched between two finned pipes to achieve a temperature gradient across the TEG for electricity generation. A counter-flow heat exchanger was built using two separate air ducts. The air ducts were thermally coupled using the HPTEG modules. The evaporator section of the heat pipe absorbed the waste heat in a hot air duct. The heat was then transferred across the TEG surfaces. The condenser section of the HPTEG collected the excess heat from the TEG cold side before releasing it to the cold air duct. A 2 -kW electrical heater was installed in the hot air duct to simulate the exhaust <b>gas.</b> An air <b>blower</b> was installed at the inlet of each duct to direct the flow of air into the ducts.

The results showed that by increasing the cold air velocity, the effectiveness of the heat exchanger was able to be increased from approximately 52 % to 58 %.

40|$|Residential <b>gas</b> {{furnaces}} contain <b>blowers</b> {{to distribute}} warm air. Currently, furnace blowers use either a Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) motor. Blowers {{account for the}} majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of blower motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|R
