5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{a player}} faces the basket {{with both feet}} facing the basket. A player will rest {{the ball on the}} {{fingertips}} of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> or may use the backboard to redirect the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|E

25|$|On offense, Pippen relied {{primarily}} on his remarkable athleticism {{to gain an}} advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots—mid-range and three pointers—on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> He honed his jump shot {{over the course of}} his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{developed}} {{large wooden}} wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert {{pressure on the}} pomace. That style of wine press would eventually evolve <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, most {{winemaking}} technology advances {{were made}} by religious orders (particularly in France and Germany) who owned vast amounts of vineyard land and produced large quantities of wines in their abbeys and bishoprics. It was here that the basket press became popular. The press included large cylindrical basket made of wood staves bound together by wood or metal rings with a heavy horizontal disc fitted at the top. After the grapes were loaded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> the disc would depress towards the bottom with juice seeping out between the staves into a waiting basin or tray. In some presses, added pressure would come from a giant lever or manual hand crank.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} designs that are woven <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> that signify different cultural meanings. For example, the Dau is a pattern woven into a basket by creating a small change in the stitching to create a small opening between two stitches. The Dau is the design that is also called the Spirit Door. This Spirit Door allows good spirits to come and circulate inside of <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> while <b>the</b> good or bad spirits are released.|$|R

25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|E
25|$|While {{in junior}} high, Law broke {{his right hand}} during {{basketball}} practice. In order to continue to compete, the naturally right-handed Law taught himself to shoot the basketball with his left hand. After recovering from his injury, Law was able to shoot with either hand, but as of 2007 still primarily relied on his left hand to shoot from a long distance. His left-handed jump shots are unusual, however, because the ball has hardly any spin, instead flying straight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> After much examination, Texas A coach Billy Gillispie realized that this is because Law uses his right thumb when he shoots, negating the spin. To help improve his form, Gillispie ordered Law to tape his right thumb against his hand in practice and try shooting without it. Law was unable to make the shots, and Gillispie quickly decided not to intervene further.|$|E

500|$|Basketball player Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers guest {{stars in}} the episode as himself. He was the first {{professional}} athlete to do so on the show.

The recording of the episode was done during the National Basketball Association's regular season, so the producers had a hard time scheduling Johnson's session. With the deadline approaching, the producers traveled to Johnson's home to record his lines. According to the San Jose Mercury News, the recording equipment brought to his home did not work at first and [...] "almost doomed the guest spot."

500|$|A {{published}} synopsis in The Nickelodeon {{reads as}} follows, [...] "An old fairy realizing that her span {{of life is}} rapidly drawing to a close, brings to life a new race of people, called the Gnomes, who are governed by a new fairy. When the Gnomes appear, the old fairy informs them that their duties will be to perform acts of kindness to all people of the world. After thus admonishing them, the old fairy disappears, and the Gnomes start upon their career of well doing. Many beautiful acts of kindness are performed {{in the course of}} their travels, which is through wonderful scenery and in strange places. In one scene the Gnomes discover an old man bemoaning his fate, and him they magically transform to a youth of great beauty. Many other acts of kindness are performed, all of great interest. Finally, the band of Gnomes discover a balloon, and the fairy queen being helped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> by the Gnomes, is last seen flying away watched by her adoring subjects." [...] The film was billed at being 1000 feet in length and having a set release for December 12, 1910. Though an announcement stated that the release would be delayed to [...] "Christmas week". No release was ever confirmed in any trade publication after it was delayed into January 1911.|$|E
500|$|With 2:12 left, Chamberlain had 94 points, and {{he scored}} on a fadeaway for his 96th point. His next basket at 1:19 came off a lob pass from York Larese for a {{powerful}} dunk that was rare for Chamberlain. Gary M. Pomerantz in his book Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era wrote that Chamberlain's usual [...] "Dipper Dunk" [...] was [...] "a considerably less emphatic basket stuff, like a rock that barely ripples the pond." [...] With {{less than a minute}} left in the game, Chamberlain set up in the post. Ruklick passed to Rodgers, who passed to Chamberlain close to the basket, but he missed the shot. Ted Luckenbill rebounded and passed it back to Chamberlain, who missed again. Luckenbill again rebounded and this time passed to Ruklick, who eschewed an easy layup and instead lobbed a high pass to Chamberlain. With 46 seconds left, Chamberlain got free from the five Knicks, jumped high and put the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> to hit the century mark. [...] Eyewitness accounts of the historic basket differ as to whether Chamberlain merely laid the ball in or actually stuffed the ball through the hoop for an alley-oop slam dunk. In any event, the arena exploded in a frenzy and over 200 spectators stormed the floor, wanting to touch the hero of the night. Ruklick immediately ran to the scorer's table to ensure that he was officially credited with the assist.|$|E

500|$|Charles Ellet and {{his team}} tied a heavier line to the kite string and pulled the joined lines across. [...] They pulled {{successive}} heavier and stronger lines across until the final bridge cable— thick—was hanging across the gorge. [...] The cable was suspended between two wooden towers [...] tall, and it was attached to an iron basket. Ellet planned to use this system as a basket ferry to shuttle workers and materials across the gorge, saving time that {{would otherwise have been}} spent on land and ferry travel. [...] Through media coverage and word-of-mouth, many people knew of Ellet's efforts and flocked to the site to watch the construction. [...] On March 13, 1848, the system was completed, and the team planned to test it by pulling the empty basket across. [...] They hit a snag when the basket kept getting stuck halfway and could not move ahead. [...] Pulling back the basket, Ellet decided to assure the watching crowd that the system was workable. [...] He stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> and it moved towards the opposite shore. [...] When Ellet reached the problematic spot, he spotted the issue; the basket's rollers could not pass over a portion of the cable that had been accidentally flattened during the construction. [...] He fixed the problem and proceeded to cross to the Canadian side and back, becoming the first person to cross the gorge. [...] Although the bridge companies had prohibited Ellet from collecting tolls, he charged each person $1.00 for the chance to [...] "observe first hand the engineering wonder of bridging the Niagara". [...] On some days, the basket ferry conveyed up to 125 people across the gorge.|$|E
2500|$|Another common shot {{is called}} the lay-up. This shot {{requires}} the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to [...] "lay" [...] the ball [...] "up" [...] and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll). The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk, in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it.|$|E
2500|$|USAF KC-135 and French Air Force KC-135FR refueling-boom {{equipped}} tankers can be field {{converted to}} a probe-and-drogue system using a special adapter unit. [...] In this configuration, the tanker retains its articulated boom, but has a hose/drogue {{at the end of}} it instead of the usual nozzle. [...] The tanker boom operator holds the boom in a static position, while the receiver aircraft then flies the probe <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> [...] Unlike the soft canvas basket used in most drogue systems, the adapter units use a steel basket, grimly known as the “iron maiden” by naval aviators because of its unforgiving nature. [...] Soft drogues can be contacted slightly off center, wherein the probe is guided into the hose receptacle by the canvas drogue. [...] The metal drogue, when contacted even slightly off center, will pivot out of place, potentially “slapping” the aircraft’s fuselage and causing damage.|$|E

2500|$|The tanker {{aircraft}} flies straight and level and extends the hose/drogue which {{is allowed to}} trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces. The pilot of the receiver aircraft extends his probe (if required) and uses normal flight controls to [...] "fly" [...] the refueling probe directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> [...] This requires a closure rate of approximately two knots (walking speed) {{in order to establish}} solid probe/drogue coupling and push the hose several feet into the HDU. [...] Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow (or occasionally leaking fuel). Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse oscillation in the hose, severing the probe tip. Another significant danger is that the drogue may hit the recipient aircraft and damage it—instances have occurred in which the drogue has shattered the canopy of a fighter aircraft, causing great danger to its pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{posited that}} one could have {{inferred}} that meal-offerings would require the purest olive oil, for if the Menorah, whose oil was not eaten, required pure olive oil, how much more so should meal-offerings, whose oil was eaten.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2003[...] The Mishnah taught that there were three harvests of olives, and each crop gave three kinds of oil (for a total of nine types of oil). The first crop of olives were picked {{from the top of the}} tree; they were pounded and put into a basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were then pressed beneath a beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The second crop is when the olives at roof-level were picked from the tree; they were pounded and put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil (of the second crop). The olives were then pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil (of the second crop). The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Once again, with the second crop, only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The third crop was when the last olives of the tree were packed in a vat until they became overripe. These olives were then taken up and dried on the roof and then pounded and put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were next pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. And then they were ground and pressed again to yield the third oil.
