25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using <b>peroxides</b> (e. g. <b>dicumyl</b> or di-tert-butyl <b>peroxide)</b> {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|R
50|$|Peroxide curing {{is widely}} used for curing {{silicone}} rubber. The curing process leaves behind byproducts, which can {{be an issue in}} food contact and medical applications. However, these products are usually treated in a postcure oven which greatly reduces the peroxide breakdown product content. One of the two main peroxides used, <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> has principal breakdown products of acetophenone and phenyl-2-propanol. The other is dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, whose principal breakdown products are dichlorobenzoic acid and dichlorobenzene.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT：Poly[styrene-b-(ethylene- 1 -butene) -b-styrene] triblock {{copolymer}} (SEBS) was functionalized with 0 to 3. 0 phr maleic anhydride {{and the amount}} of <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> used as an initiator was varied from 0 to 0. 3 phr. The gel content of the modified SEBS was determined by xylene extraction and poly(oxymethylene) was blended with the modified SEBS. The impact, tensile, flexural strength and morphologies of the blends were investigated. The Izod impact strength of poly(oxymethylene) was improved through its blending with modified SEBS. However, the Izod impact strength of poly(oxymethylene) /modified SEBS blend decreased above 5 % modified SEBS content. Regarding the effect of <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> content on the Izod impact strength, the blend had a maximum Izod impact strength when poly(oxymethylene) was blended with modified SEBS prepared with 0. 1 phr <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide.</b> It was also confirmed by SEM micrographs that the average particle size of modified SEBS in poly(oxymethylene) /modified SEBS blends was smaller than that of SEBS in poly(oxymethylene) /SEB...|$|E

The potential usefulness of the method is illustrated by applying it to (i) DSC oxidative induction time (OIt) data for medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) formulations made using two levels of carbon black and base-stabilized with Irgafos 168 ™ (tris-(2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) -phosphite) and Irganox 1010 ™ pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-(3 -(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) propionate), and (ii) chemiluminescence OIt data for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) containing 0. 2 % (w/w) of Chimassorb 944 ™ and 0. 5 % (w/w) or 1. 0 % (w/w) of <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> cross-linking agent and base-stabilized with 0. 2 % (w/w) of various commercial antioxidants. The proposed method is validated using data from a previous study on MDPE and is applied to a preliminary investigation of LDPE destabilization by <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide.</b> The results suggest that a styrenated phenolic stabilizer blended with zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate and zinc stearate is an effective system for stabilizing LDPE {{in the presence of}} <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} polypropylene/ethylene–propylene– diene terpolymer (100 / 8) blends with different microstructure was investigated using the essential work of fracture approach. Ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer and <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> were mixed in a single-screw extruder at 1408 C, and the crosslinking reaction had hardly taken place at this temperature. Then the reactive extrusion of ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer and polypropylene {{was performed on}} a twin-screw extruder at a temperature range of 160 – 2108 C and ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer was crosslinked in this process. Various crosslinking density of ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer in polypropylene/ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer (100 / 8) blends was obtained by varying the concentration of <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide.</b> With increasing <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentration, melt flow rate of the blends gradually increased but the increasing trend was slowed up. The degradation reaction of polypropylene was markedly restrained by adopting such a processing method. From the result of scanning electron microscopy, the size of ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer particles was reduced and a more uniform particle size distribution was obtained. The existence of polypropylene/ ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer graft copolymer was demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry and the negative effect of the graft copolymer on the crystalline rate of polypropylene macromolecules which wer...|$|E

The concentration of <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> was 0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 7 wt%. Crosslinking was analyzed by a rubber process analyzer in the temperature range 150 - 200 °C.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Acid and alkali {{resistance}} properties of crosslinked blends of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polydimethyl siloxane rubber (PDMS) have been studied. Ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA) copolymer {{acts as a}} compati-bilizer and <b>dicumyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> (DCP) acts as the crosslinking agent for the blend systems. Tensile properties of the individual components and the blends before and after treatment with different acids and two various concentrations of alkali are reported. Treatment with nitric acid has resulted in severe deterioration of tensile properties of all samples compared to all other acids studied. Retention of tensile properties of all the blends is found to improve significantly {{as compared to the}} reference sample, the PDMS rubber.
