40|$|An {{analysis}} is conducted of the 1996 - 1998 Hanford tank ventilation studies of average ventilation rates to help define characteristics of shorter term releases. This effort is being conducted {{as part of}} the design of tests of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygiene’s</b> (IH) instrumentation ability to detect transient airborne plumes from tanks using current deployment strategies for tank operations. This analysis has improved our understanding of the variability of hourly average tank ventilation processes. However, the analysis was unable to discern the relative importance of emissions due to continuous releases and short-duration bursts of material. The key findings are as follows: 1. The ventilation of relatively well-sealed, passively ventilated tanks appears to be driven by a combination of pressure, buoyancy, and wind influences. The results of a best-fit analysis conducted with a single data set provide information on the hourly emission variability that IH instrumentation will need to detect. 2. Tank ventilation rates and tank emission rates are not the same. The studies found that the measured infiltration rates for a single tank are often a complex function of air exchanges between tanks and air exchanges with outdoor air. This situation greatly limits the usefulness of the ventilation data in defining vapor emission rates. 3. There is no evidence in the data to discern if the routine tank vapor releases occur over a short time (i. e., a puff) or over an extended time (i. e., continuous releases). Based on this analysis of the tank ventilation studies, it is also noted that 1) the hourly averaged emission peaks from the relatively well-sealed passively-vented tanks (such as U- 103) are not a simple function of one meteorological parameter – but the peaks often are the result of the coincidence of temporal maximums in pressure, temperature, and wind influences and 2) a mechanistic combination modeling approach and/or field studies may be necessary to understand the short-term temporal characteristics of transient releases - This requirement has implications in both the design of IH field tests and in understanding transient plumes during the times that worker complaints were recorded...|$|R

25|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of training {{applicable to the}} field of occupational safety and health (OSH). Programs range from individual non-credit certificates, focusing on specific areas of concern, to full doctoral programs. The University of Southern California {{was one of the first}} schools in the US to offer a Ph.D. program focusing on the field. Further, multiple master's degree programs exist, such as that of the Indiana State University who offer a master of science (MS) and a master of arts (MA) in OSH. Graduate programs are designed to train educators, as well as, high-level practitioners. Many OSH generalists focus on undergraduate studies; programs within schools, such as that of the University of North Carolina's online Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety, fill a large majority of hygienist needs. However, smaller companies often don’t have full-time safety specialists on staff, thus, they appoint a current employee to the responsibility. Individuals finding themselves in positions such as these, or for those enhancing marketability in the job-search and promotion arena, may seek out a credit certificate program. For example, the University of Connecticut's online OSH Certificate, provides students familiarity with overarching concepts through a 15-credit (5-course) program. Programs such as these are often adequate tools in building a strong educational platform for new safety managers with a minimal outlay of time and money. Further, most hygienists seek certification by organizations which train in specific areas of concentration, focusing on isolated workplace hazards. The American Society for Safety Engineers (ASSE), American Board of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygiene</b> (ABIH), and American <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygiene</b> Association (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. In the U.S. the training of safety professionals is supported by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health through their NIOSH Education and Research Centers.|$|E

When Amdur returned from the meeting, Drinker demanded that Amdur remove her name from the paper and to withdraw it from The Lancet, despite the fact it had already been accepted. Amdur refused Drinker's demands, so her position on his staff was removed and she was left to find new work. The paper was never published.|$|E

NIOSH is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM) is a compilation of validated sampling and analytical methods that are used globally for occupational exposure assessment in the <b>industrial</b> (occupational) <b>hygiene</b> field and related professions. The methods that are published in NMAM are evaluated and validated in consideration of their fitness-for-purpose for exposure monitoring in work areas. NIOSH methods primarily address workplace air sampling and analysis, but NMAM also includes protocols for biological, surface, dermal, and bulk samples. Within NMAM, but separate from the methods themselves, are assorted chapters providing background and guidance covering a number of subjects. Explanatory chapters on quality assurance, sampling guidance, method development and evaluation, aerosol collection, etc., provide valuable information to users of NIOSH methods. NMAM chapters provide a convenient resource that augments technical information often (but not always) available elsewhere in texts and monographs. Now in its fifth edition, NMAM is continuously updated as new or revised methods are evaluated and their performance verified. This document is a compilation of its guidance chapters and methods, current as of the date shown on the front page.

The contents of 7 core and 35 sub-core competences were developed and used to conduct field surveys to safety and health managers (SHMs) from two types of industry of the high-tech and traditional, respectively. Both the “deficiency ” of ISHPEs and the “importance ” of each investigated sub-core competence were assessed by the SHMs from each selected industry type using a 5 -point Likert scale (5 : very high; 4 : high; 3 : moderate; 2 : low; 1 : very low). We found that 9 out of 35, and 13 out of 35 sub-core competences were “high deficiency ” and “high importance”, respectively. The Bayesian decision making process {{was used to determine}} the training demand of each investigated sub-core competence. We found that 16 and 14 sub-core competences were determined as “high training demand” for ISHPEs based on judgments made by SHMs of the high-tech and traditional industry, respectively.

40|$|Recent {{industry}} {{change in}} swine-management practices {{have resulted in}} a growing controversy surrounding the environmental and public health effects of modern swine production. The numerous wastes produced by intensive swine production not only pose a significant chalienge to effective environmental management but also are associated with decreased air quality in confinement houses, potentialy transferable antimicrobial resistance patterns, and several infectious agents that can be pathogenic to humans. Published studies have documented a variety of contaminants, microbial agents, and health efFects in those occupationally exposed to swine, and these have provided the groundwork for an increasing body of research to evaluate possible community health effects. Nonetheless, several factors limit our ability to define and quantify the potential role of intensive swine-rearing facilities in occupational and community health. Our incomplete understanding and ability to detect specific exposures; the complicated nature of disease etiology, pathogenesis, and surveillance; and the inherent difficulties assodated with study design all contribute to the inadequate level of knowledge that currendy prevails.

40|$|THE new {{therapeutic}} attack upon psychiatric conditions hitherto treated passively or empirically {{is a most}} encouraging development. The {{advent of}} new drugs and new methods, chemical, biological, and electrical, has changed the prognosis of mental disease and placed psychiatry in an enviable position, for it has progressed further {{in the past decade}} than many of its sister branches of medical science. As in all other branches of medicine, preventive measures play a most important part and the contributions of mental hygiene are of inestimable importance. We are beginning to recognize that there is a form of <b>industrial</b> mental <b>hygiene</b> the importance of which is as yet not completely appreciated. It merits our attention as this paper will demon-strate, and a careful survey of the mental health and mental hygiene measures in those industries with high morbidity rates would probably go far toward reducing the admissions to mental hospitals. This paper is concerned with the results of the psychiatric examination of 120 workers employed in the viscose rayon industry. In the course of their daily work these individuals had been exposed to carbon disulphide fumes in varying intensity depending upon the department in which they were employed. The occurrence of CS 2 poisoning and the opportunity for frequent con-tact with persons suffering from it are obviously small and limited to a few industrial centers. Despite the fact that exposure to carbon disulphide is a recognized industrial hazard, many experienced practitioners will never encounter its effects, and yet it cannot be said that a study of this kind is merely of academic importance. It reminds us of the necessity for question-ing patients about their past and present occupation and of the importance of industrial hazards and occupational diseases. It would be most difficult to diagnose chronic CS 2 intoxication if the physician were not aware of the type of work his patient was doing.

[...] Originating in the renovated former Municipal Hospital, now Salk Hall, the school was accredited on April 6, 1950, and admitted its first class of 29 full-time and 5 part-time students in September 1950. [...] The school moved into a new facility, now named Parran Hall, completed for it in 1957. The school's first dean, Thomas Parran, had previously founded the World Health Organization and served for twelve years as Surgeon General of the United States. Parran guided the early development of the school and recruited many of its prominent early faculty. [...] An early focus of the school was occupational and <b>industrial</b> health and <b>hygiene</b> in the steel mills of Pittsburgh. These studies, and Pitt Public Health investigations of black lung among coal miners, strongly influenced the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 which, based mostly on school generated data, created the first national standards for on-the-job worker safety and health. Although the scope of the school has greatly broadened, this theme of research has continued throughout the years with significant implications including, among other things, information on the hazards of asbestos. Pitt Public Health has become one of the top schools for sponsored research funding. It has also pioneered research directions: it the first school of public health to have a department of human genetics; it had the first and only public health school chair in minority health; and played a critical role in understanding diseases such as AIDS for which it initiated the longest-running national study of the natural history of the disease.
