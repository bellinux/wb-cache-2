500|$|In 2007, Rowling {{stated that}} {{she planned to}} write an {{encyclopaedia}} of Harry Potters wizarding world consisting of various unpublished material and notes. Any profits from such a book would be given to charity. During {{a news conference at}} Hollywood's Kodak Theatre in 2007, Rowling, when asked how the encyclopaedia was coming along, said, [...] "It's not coming along, and I haven't started writing it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> it was the next thing I'd do." [...] At the end of 2007, Rowling said that the encyclopaedia could take up to ten years to complete.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't {{fuck with}} the formula" [...] is a quote and subject of {{controversy}} {{attributed to the}} Beach Boys' lyricist and co-lead vocalist Mike Love circa 1967. Love called it the [...] "most famous thing I've ever said, even though <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> it." [...] It originates from a 1971 Rolling Stone magazine article written by freelancer Tom Nolan, in which business associate David Anderle reported disagreements from within the Beach Boys' circle. According to Anderle, Love wanted the band to remain profitable for himself—"and don't fuck with the formula." [...] In the ensuing decades, the line has been repeated in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs.|$|E

500|$|Cagney was {{diagnosed}} with glaucoma and began taking eye drops, but continued to have vision problems. On Zimmermann's recommendation, he visited a different doctor, who determined that glaucoma had been a misdiagnosis, and that Cagney was actually diabetic. Zimmermann then took it upon herself to look after Cagney, preparing his meals to reduce his blood triglycerides, which had reached alarming levels. Such was her success that, by the time Cagney made a rare public appearance at his American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement award ceremony in 1974, he had lost [...] and his vision had improved. Charlton Heston opened the ceremony, and Frank Sinatra introduced Cagney. So many Hollywood stars attended—said {{to be more than}} for any event in history—that one columnist wrote at the time that a bomb in the dining room would have ended the movie industry. In his acceptance speech, Cagney lightly chastised the impressionist Frank Gorshin, saying, [...] "Oh, Frankie, just in passing, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> 'MMMMmmmm, you dirty rat!' What I actually did say was 'Judy, Judy, Judy!'"—a joking reference to a similar misquotation attributed to Cary Grant.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E
2500|$|The Hamburger Morgenpost {{questioned}} whether RTL misquoted DSDS Top 10 candidate Anna-Carina Woitschack. In an interview, Anna-Carina {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "It was cut together all wrong. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> that I hate Sarah – but on the contrary, I do not hate Sarah Engels. That is what I said. But it was cut this way by RTL, because it looks good for the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|National Catholic Register {{columnist}} Patrick Kenny {{questioned whether}} the bones found in 1975 were from the Bon Secours Home or {{from one of the}} previous institutions which had occupied the same building, as well as whether or not the structure Corless speculated was a mass grave was a disused septic tank or a [...] "19th-century burial vault." [...] Corless herself corrected portions of the media coverage, telling the Irish Times, [...] "I never used that word 'dumped'. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> to anyone that 800 bodies were dumped in a septic tank." ...|$|E
2500|$|The story {{eventually}} moved {{south of}} the border, with {{a story in the}} Daily Mirror reporting that Gaiman had accused Rowling of plagiarism being repeated in the Daily Mail. [...] Gaiman has stressed, [...] "This is not true, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> this", and when asked, repeats his belief that Rowling had not read The Books of Magic and that the similarities most likely result from both being inspired by similar works, in particular those of T. H. White. Hunter: Age of Magic author Dylan Horrocks has pointed out that neither Hunter nor Potter was truly an original idea, with another boy wizard preceding Hunter in comics, and they should be considered more as part of a genre: ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 17, 1974, Owens' {{best friend}} and Buckaroos guitarist Don Rich was killed when he lost control of his {{motorcycle}} and struck a guard rail on Highway 1 in Morro Bay, where he was to have joined his family for vacation. Owens was devastated. [...] "He was like a brother, {{a son and a}} best friend," [...] he said in the late 1990s. [...] "Something <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> before, maybe I couldn't, but I think my music life ended when he died. Oh yeah, I carried on and I existed, but the real joy and love, the real lightning and thunder is gone forever." [...] Owens would never fully recover from the tragedy, neither emotionally nor professionally.|$|E
2500|$|Haye's cameo at heavyweight in April 2007 {{resulted}} in an impressive first-round KO win over Polish fighter Tomasz Bonin, {{who at the time}} was ranked No. 9 by the WBC and had only one loss, against Audley Harrison. Haye admitted he was taking [...] "a crazy step up" [...] when he fought world-ranked heavyweight Bonin at Wembley Arena. Haye said in a post fight interview [...] "If you asked me when I was three years old, I'd say I'm going to be the heavyweight champion of world. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> cruiserweight. It's what I wanted to do since I can remember. I always wanted to be the main man in boxing. I want everyone to recognise I can beat every other boxer in the world.

For decades that lore has echoed through new records and retrospective box sets, countless books and essays, documentaries, TV movies, fictional accounts, ... and tribute songs". [...] The story of Brian Wilson features its own antagonist, Mike Love, {{who is known for}} his distaste of the Smile album and for urging Wilson not to [...] "fuck with the formula". Love called the quote the [...] "most famous thing I've ever said, even though <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> it." [...] He wrote that it crystallized a reductive [...] "morality tale" [...] that positions Wilson as [...] "the tormented genius who was undone by his own family", a theme which appears throughout the writings of Wilson's [...] "awestruck biographers".|$|E

2500|$|Diane Sawyer interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, {{episode of}} PrimeTime Thursday. O'Donnell told USA Today that {{she chose to}} talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, [...] "I {{would like to talk}} about my life and how (the case) {{pertains}} to me." [...] She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who faced having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law wouldn't let them adopt because Florida banned gay or bisexual people from adopting. O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on The Rosie O'Donnell Show as deceptive. She responded in her act stating, [...] "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> I wanted to blow him." [...] After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair. O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former Culture Club backup singer Helen Terry.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that all 796 child remains {{were found in}} the septic tank, but on 5 June 2014, an RTÉ Prime Time television report by Mark Coughlan, [...] "Home Babies", reported that [...] "We don't know for sure, as yet anyway, if the babies who died in the Tuam home were buried in a septic tank: no burial location is listed on the death records." [...] Two days later, on 7 June, The Irish Times quoted Corless as stating that the story had [...] "been widely misrepresented" [...] in the days since it broke nationally and internationally ("I never used that word 'dumped.' ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> to anyone that 800 bodies were dumped in a septic tank.") She said the skeletons found in 1975 had most likely been in the septic tank, but added that only 204 of the babies had died when the septic tank was in use, saying it [...] "seemed impossible" [...] that all of them could have been [...] "put in a working sewage tank". One of those who found the skeletons told the newspaper he had seen about 20 skeletons. The Garda Síochána said claims that all the children may be buried in a septic tank had not yet been [...] "properly tested".|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I take it out of my mouth occasionally'? [...] <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E
