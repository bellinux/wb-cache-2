They walled the confines of their coral reefs and sand-banks with coral-rock stolen from the mainland on dark nights.

60|$|In short, I {{throw it}} out as a {{conjecture}} more than as an ascertained fact, it is true, but from all I have seen in Europe, I am induced to think that, in making our experiments on the vine, we have been too ambitious to obtain a <b>fat</b> <b>soil,</b> and too warp of the higher latitudes of the country. A gravelly hill-side, in the interior, that has been well stirred, and which has the proper exposure, I cannot but thing would bring good wine, in all the low countries of the middle states.|$|E

50|$|Many other {{classification}} schemes exist, including vernacular systems. The {{structure in}} vernacular systems are either nominal, giving unique names to soils or landscapes, or descriptive, naming soils by their {{characteristics such as}} red, hot, <b>fat,</b> or sandy. <b>Soils</b> are distinguished by obvious characteristics, such as physical appearance (e.g., color, texture, landscape position), performance (e.g., production capability, flooding), and accompanying vegetation. A vernacular distinction familiar to many is classifying texture as heavy or light. Light soil content and better structure, take less effort to turn and cultivate. Contrary to popular belief, light soils do not weigh less than heavy soils on an air dry basis nor do they have more porosity.|$|R
60|$|And {{in a few}} minutes, Harold and Jane {{with pieces}} of bread and butter in their hands, they sauntered through the meadow into the hop-field. They were the last to leave.

It was with no sense of strangeness, but as though he were at home, that Philip followed Sally through the long lines of the hops. The sun was bright now and cast a sharp shadow. Philip feasted his eyes on the richness of the green leaves. The hops were yellowing, and to him they had the beauty and the passion which poets in Sicily have found in the purple grape. As they walked along Philip felt himself overwhelmed by the rich luxuriance. A sweet scent arose from the <b>fat</b> Kentish <b>soil,</b> and the fitful September breeze was heavy with the goodly perfume of the hops. Athelstan felt the exhilaration instinctively, for he lifted up his voice and sang; it was the cracked voice of the boy of fifteen, and Sally turned round.|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke to}} the princes, the nobles, the magistrates, and the burghers, with just the same ease, with almost the same pointed, choleric earnestness, with which he was wont to harangue the three {{divisions}} of the Rue Fossette.

Who would have thought the flat and <b>fat</b> <b>soil</b> of Labassecour could yield political convictions and national feelings, such as were now strongly expressed? Of the bearing of his opinions I need here give no special indication; yet it may be permitted {{me to say that}} I believed the little man not more earnest than right in what he said: with all his fire he was severe and sensible; he trampled Utopian theories under his heel; he rejected wild dreams with scorn;--but when he looked in the face of tyranny--oh, then there opened a light in his eye worth seeing; and when he spoke of injustice, his voice gave no uncertain sound, but reminded me rather of the band-trumpet, ringing at twilight from the park.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{practical}} answer to this, there steals across the council chamber just one faint {{whiff of the}} Stink. It is as though some one laughed low and bitterly. But no man heeds. The Englishmen look supremely bored, the native members stare stolidly in front of them. Sir Steuart Bayley's face is as set as {{the face of the}} Sphinx. For these things he draws his pay,--a low wage for heavy labour. But the speaker, now adrift, is not altogether to be blamed. He is a Bengali, who has got before him just such a subject as his soul loveth,--an elaborate piece of academical reform leading nowhere. Here is a quiet room full of pens and papers, and there are men who must listen to him. Apparently there is no time limit to the speeches. Can you wonder that he talks? He says [...] "I submit" [...] once every ninety seconds, varying the form with [...] "I do submit, the popular element in the electoral body should have prominence." [...] Quite so. He quotes one John Stuart Mill to prove it. There steals over the listener a numbing sense of nightmare. He has heard all this before somewhere--yea; even down to J. S. Mill and the references to the [...] "true interests of the ratepayers." [...] He sees what is coming next. Yes, there is the old Sabha, Anjuman journalistic formula--"Western education is an exotic plant of recent importation." [...] How on earth did this man drag Western education into this discussion? Who knows? Perhaps Sir Steuart Bayley does. He seems to be listening. The others are looking at their watches. The spell of the level voice sinks the listener yet deeper into a trance. He is haunted by the ghosts of all the cant of all the political platforms of Great Britain. He hears all the old, old vestry phrases, and once more he smells the Smell. That is no dream. Western education is an exotic plant. It is the upas tree, and it is all our fault. We brought it out from England exactly as we brought out the ink-bottles and the patterns for the chairs. We planted it and it grew--monstrous as a banian. Now we are choked by the roots of it spreading so thickly in this <b>fat</b> <b>soil</b> of Bengal. The speaker continues. Bit by bit we builded this dome, visible and invisible, the crown of Writers' Buildings, as we have built and peopled the buildings. Now we have gone too far to retreat, being [...] "tied and bound with the chain of our own sins." [...] The speech continues. We made that florid sentence. That torrent of verbiage is Ours. We taught him what was constitutional and what was unconstitutional in the days when Calcutta smelt. Calcutta smells still, but We must listen to all that he has to say about the plurality of votes and the threshing of wind and the weaving of ropes of sand. It is Our own fault.|$|E
60|$|An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd {{miles through}} a garish mid-day {{atmosphere}} {{brought him in}} the afternoon to a detached knoll {{a mile or two}} west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or Froom. Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the <b>fat</b> alluvial <b>soil</b> below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals, the very bees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads. It was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student-days; and, much as he loved his parents, he could not help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of home-life, affected him like throwing off splints and bandages; even the one customary curb on the humours of English rural societies being absent in this place, Talbothays having no resident landlord.|$|R
60|$|This nobleman's {{personal}} appearance was somewhat impressive. His complexion {{was that of}} the copper-beech tree. His frame was stalwart, though slightly stooping. His mouth was large, and he carried an unpolished sapling as his walking-stick, except when he carried a spud for cutting up any thistle he encountered on his walks. His castle stood {{in the midst of a}} park, surrounded by dusky elms, except to the southward; and when the moon shone out, the gleaming stone facade, backed by heavy boughs, was visible from the distant high road as a white spot on the surface of darkness. Though called a castle, the building was little fortified, and had been erected with greater eye to internal convenience than those crannied places of defence to which the name strictly appertains. It was a castellated mansion as regular as a chessboard on its ground-plan, ornamented with make-believe bastions and machicolations, behind which were stacks of battlemented chimneys. On still mornings, at the fire-lighting hour, when ghostly house-maids stalk the corridors, and thin streaks of light through the shutter-chinks lend startling winks and smiles to ancestors on canvas, twelve or fifteen thin stems of blue smoke sprouted upwards from these chimney-tops, and spread into a flat canopy on high. Around the site stretched ten thousand acres of good, <b>fat,</b> unimpeachable <b>soil,</b> plentiful in glades and lawns wherever visible from the castle-windows, and merging in homely arable where screened from the too curious eye by ingeniously-contrived plantations.|$|R

The rich man went to his godmother and got answers: her husband's bay mare, a pig that they had been fattening, eider down, and her baby nephew.

Some miles up the turnpike road he went, and then away to the right, through the ash-woods of Trebooze, up by the rill which drips from pool to pool over the ledges of grey slate, deep-bedded in dark sedge, and broad bright burdock leaves, and tall angelica, and ell-broad rings and tufts of king, and crown, and lady-fern, and all the semi-tropic luxuriance of the <b>fat</b> western <b>soil,</b> and steaming western woods; out into the boggy moor at the glen head, all fragrant with the gold-tipped gale, where the turf is enamelled with the hectic marsh violet, and the pink pimpernel, and the pale yellow leaf-stars of the butterwort, and the blue bells and green threads of the ivy-leaved campanula; out upon the steep smooth down above, and away over the broad cattle-pastures; and then to pause a moment, and look far and wide over land and sea.|$|R
40|$|NoDespite an {{increasing}} {{literature on the}} decomposition of human remains, whether buried or exposed, {{it is important to}} recognise the role of specific microenvironments which can either trigger or delay the rate of decomposition. Recent casework in Northern England involving buried and partially buried human remains has demonstrated a need for a more detailed understanding of the effect of contrasting site conditions on cadaver decomposition and on the microenvironment created within the grave itself. Pigs (Sus scrofa) were used as body analogues in three inter-related taphonomy experiments to examine differential decomposition of buried human remains. They were buried at three contrasting field sites (pasture, moorland, and deciduous woodland) within a 15 km radius of the University of Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK. Changes to the buried body and the effect of these changes on hair and associated death-scene textile materials were monitored as was the microenvironment of the grave. At recovery, 6, 12 and 24 months post-burial, the extent of soft tissue decomposition was recorded and samples of <b>fat</b> and <b>soil</b> were collected for gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. The results of these studies demonstrated that (1) soil conditions at these three burial sites has a marked effect on the condition of the buried body but even within a single site variation can occur; (2) the process of soft tissue decomposition modifies the localised burial microenvironment in terms of microbiological load, pH, moisture and changes in redox status. These observations have widespread application for the investigation of clandestine burial and time since deposition, and in understanding changes within the burial microenvironment that may impact on biomaterials such as hair and other associated death scene materials...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} and to quantify polychlorinated terphenyls (PCT) in environmental matrices, the chro- matographic behavior of coplanar and non-coplanar congeners was evaluated. A mixture of 16 single PCT congeners was used for method development. Four of these compounds were synthesized for the ﬁrst time by SUZUKI-coupling reaction. These were p-PCT (2, 200, 6, 600 -tetrachloro-, 20, 3, 300, 4, 400, 50,-hexachloro-, 20, 3, 300, 5, 50, 500 -hexachloro-) and m-PCT (2, 200, 3, 300, 5, 500 -hexachloro-). They were characterized by NMR (1 H, 13 C) spectroscopy. By means of the new column chromatographic clean-up reported here, a good matrix removal and {{the separation of the}} coplanar PCT congeners from the non-coplanar ones was obtained. The recovery rates for all congeners were good for the PCT in different test matrices like <b>fat,</b> charcoal, and <b>soil.</b> The quality of the clean-up, the separation and the recovery rates were determined by GC/MS analysis. The method was applied for the ﬁrst time to a real sample from a ﬁre accident, where different PCT, obviously formed during the combustion process, were found.

40|$|In Flanders (Belgium), the BATNEEC {{methodology}} {{is traditionally}} {{used to make}} a selection between different options for the remediation of a contaminated site. Previous research (Cappuyns et al., 2011) showed that a more detailed analysis is often necessary for a more correct estimation of the environmental impact of the soil remediation process. In the present study, several methods {{that can be used to}} estimate the environmental and health impact of a soil remediation process were compared. The environmental impact assessment was performed using two LCA-based evaluation tools, namely the REC (Risk reduction, Environmental Merit and Cost) method and the ReciPe method, which is incorporated in the SimaPro software program. The human health risk as inferred from the REC-analysis was compared to the human health risk assessment based on a Risk Human analysis. For the financial risk, a risk matrix according to the PRINCE 2 TM method was constructed. The comparison and evaluation of the different tools used to estimate the environmental and human health impact of brownfield remediation was based on a case study which consisted of the remediation of former oil and <b>fat</b> processing plant. <b>Soil</b> and groundwater at this site were contaminated with mineral oil, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and BTEX. Two remediation scenarios were considered: excavation and off-site cleaning and in situ steam extraction. For the environmental impact assessment, both the REC and ReciPe methods result in a single score for the environmental impact of the soil remediation process. The ReciPe method takes into account more impact categories, but is also more complex to work with and needs more input data. However, for the evaluation of soil remediation alternatives, estimation of the environmental impact with the REC method will in most cases be sufficient. Within the routinely evaluation of soil remediation alternatives, a detailed LCA evaluation will often be too time consuming and costly. Moreover, both evaluation methods allowed to drawn the same conclusion concerning the environmental impact of the soil remediation options: excavation and off-site cleaning has a more pronounced environmental impact than in situ soil remediation by means of steam extraction. The human health risk assessment gives similar results with both the REC and RISK-HUMAN method, since both methods are based on the same model. However, the risk assessment part of the REC method is easier to use compared to the RISK-HUMAN method, therefore the former method is preferred in soil remediation evaluations. Finally, besides estimating the total cost of a soil remediation, the financial risk associated the remediation project should be taken into account. The case study worked out in this paper wants to provide a basis for a more sounded selection of soil remediation technologies based on human health, environmental impact and financial criteria. status: publishe...|$|R
