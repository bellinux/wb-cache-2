5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E

[...] "Sir Percy Blakeney, you remember, threw himself across my plans, quite innocently of course. <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> where you succeeded. Luck has deserted me. Our government offered me a humble post, away from France. I look after the interests of French subjects settled in England. My days of power are over. My failure is complete. I do not complain, for <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> in a combat of wits... but <b>I</b> <b>failed...</b> <b>I</b> <b>failed...</b> <b>I</b> <b>failed...</b> <b>I</b> am almost a fugitive and I am quite disgraced. That is my present history, Lady Blakeney," [...] he concluded, taking once more a step towards her, [...] "and you will understand {{that it would be}} a solace if you extended your hand to me just once more, and let me feel that although you would never willingly look upon my face again, you have enough womanly tenderness in you to force your heart to forgiveness and mayhap to pity." ...|$|R

500|$|Dostoyevsky {{initially}} {{attended the}} best {{private school in}} Moscow, the Chermak boarding school. Founded by a Czech immigrant, who moved to Russia after the Napoleonic Wars, it put strong emphasis on literature. As the school required 800 rubles per year, his father had to do additional work and ask his aristocratic relatives, the Kumanins, for money. Although Dostoyevsky settled in well, {{he had to leave}} after his mother's death on 27 September 1837 led to financial problems for his family. He was sent to the Military Engineering-Technical University, he had problems adjusting to life there, but nevertheless managed to graduate on 12 August 1843 as a military engineer. After his graduation, he lived a quite liberal lifestyle, attending many plays and the ballets of composers Ole Bull and Franz Liszt, and renting an expensive apartment, the Prianishnikov House, for 1,200 rubles, even though he was only earning 5,000 rubles per year. These events and his introduction to casinos were responsible for his deteriorating financial situation. He worked as a translator, but the translations he completed in 1843, such as Balzac's Eugénie Grandet and Sand's La dernière Aldini, were not very successful. His gambling and betting on billiard games were a huge drain on his funds because of his frequent losses. As a consequence, Dostoyevsky was often forced to ask his relatives for money, but he felt uncomfortable doing so and decided to write a novel to raise money. [...] "It's simply a case" [...] Dostoyevsky wrote to his brother Mikhail, [...] "of my novel covering all. If <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> in this, I'll hang myself." ...|$|E

Chengal Reddy, secretary general of CIFA claimed retail reform could do lots for Indian farmers. Reddy commented, [...] "India has 600 million farmers, 1,200 million consumers and 5 million traders. <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> to understand why political parties are taking an anti-farmer stand and worried about half a million brokers and small shopkeepers". CIFA mainly operates in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu; but has a growing members from rest of India, including Shetkari Sanghatana in Maharashtra, Rajasthan Kisan Union and Himachal Farmer Organisations.|$|E

2500|$|Beatty {{spent much}} of his life (when not at sea) in Leicestershire, and lived at Brooksby Hall and Dingley Hall. Beatty's old {{commander}} Admiral John Jellicoe died on 19 November 1935. Already suffering from heart failure, and sick with influenza, Beatty defied doctors' orders and left his bed to act as a pallbearer, saying, [...] "What will the Navy say if <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> to attend Jellicoe's funeral?" [...] He was so obviously ill that, as the funeral procession passed up Fleet Street, a bystander sent a glass of brandy out to him. He also insisted on attending the funeral of King George V in January 1936. These acts hastened his own death.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{a part in}} the {{suspense}} drama Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Case of Miss Faulkner and her desire to play more-challenging roles, Entwistle was often cast as a comedian, most often the attractive, good-hearted ingénue. In 1929 she told a reporter:"I would rather play roles that carry conviction. Maybe it is because they are the easiest and yet the hardest things for me to do. To play any kind of an emotional scene I must work up to a certain pitch. If I reach this in my first word, the rest of the words and lines take care of themselves. But if <b>I</b> <b>fail,</b> I have to build up the balance of the speeches, and in doing this the whole characterisation falls flat. I feel that I am cheating myself. I don't know whether other actresses get this same reaction or not, but it does worry me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Justice {{also agreed}} that the outcome of Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982) {{was based on the}} Property Clause of Article IV, §3 and so was not a viable {{precedent}} in this case. Souter noted that the majority expressed their fear that a great many Executive branch actions would be open to lawsuit if they ruled for the Foundation, he said [...] "that does not mean taxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the merits, <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> to see the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a claim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are meritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a compelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep them from being heard." ...|$|E
