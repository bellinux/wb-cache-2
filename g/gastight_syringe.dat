40|$|Generation of {{volatile}} cobalt carbonyl {{was accomplished}} by exposing a solution of inorganic cobalt, containing low molecular weight organic acids, to UV irradiation. The gaseous products {{were removed from the}} liquid phase in a gas 2 ̆ 013 liquid separator and transported to a Pyrex U-tube cryogenic trap. Following cryocondensation of the products using a dry ice 2 ̆ 013 acetone bath, the U-tube was placed in a hot water bath (352 ̆ 01340 0 C) and the trapped species were introduced to an ICP-MS for estimation of the efficiency of generation. Alternatively, the gas phase containing the Co species was sampled with a <b>gastight</b> <b>syringe</b> and injected into a GC-MS for species identification. The product, which is stable for periods in excess of 60 minutes, is tentatively identified as a carbonylated cobalt species, generated with an efficiency of 0. 32 ̆ 0130. 4...|$|E
30|$|For {{ethylene}} production, the FA-treated {{and control}} leaf tissues of tomato plants were excised {{and placed in}} test tubes for 30 min to allow the escape of wound ethylene (Lund et al. [1998]). After this the tubes were sealed for 2 h. Gaseous samples were then analysed for ethylene content on gas chromatograph (Model CP- 3800 GC, Varian, Inc. CA, USA) equipped with an flame ionization detector (FID) and a column (CP-Pora PLOT Q, 25 m × 0.32 mm) packed with fused silica. For measuring ethylene content 1 ml gas sample was injected into the GC column using a Hamilton <b>gastight</b> <b>syringe</b> (Model: 701 RN). The column, injector and detector temperatures were set at 110 °C, 130 °C and 130 °C respectively. Nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 30 ml/min {{was used as the}} carrier. The ethylene content was quantified by comparison of peak areas with standard curve constructed from known amounts of ethylene gas (SSG, Alltech Asso. Inc. USA).|$|E
30|$|For the electrospinning, {{a system}} (ESDR 200 H, NanoNC) with {{integrated}} motion stage (linear servo motor 800  W, maximum run speed 500  mm/s), a high voltage generator (~[*] 30  kV) and syringe pump (minimum z-axis direction speed 8.3  μm/min) were used. A Hamilton <b>gastight</b> <b>syringe</b> (100  μL) {{was used for}} precise polymer solution flow rate control, and a 32 G steel needle with an inner diameter of 100  μm was used. Figure  1 b is a schematic diagram for the proposed electrospinning experiment. For the line pattern experiments, {{the gap between the}} paper and the needle was set to height, and the distance between the edge of the pattern and the needle was set to offset. The motion stage speed was fixed at 10  mm/s and the flow rate was fixed at 14  nL/min. The experiment was repeated 50 times on the same path with the fixed voltage to observe the status of stacked fiber. Experiments on sharp-edged shapes pattern were performed with the constant distance between the edge of the pattern and the needle path with 150  μm offset and 750  μm height value, and with 1.9  kV voltage. During the process, the jet ejection was monitored in real-time using a vision system (EV 200 L, NanoNC). Figure  1 c was the captured image of the induced fiber during the electrospinning process. Charge-coupled device camera (CCD camera) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used for observation of the fiber deposition and stacking.|$|E
40|$|Microfluidic device {{design and}} {{fabrication}} Microfluidic devices were fabricated by using soft lithography 1 as described previously. 2 - 4 Except where noted, plugs {{were collected in}} PFA or PTFE Teflon tubing (Zeus, Orangeburg, SC) with 150 µm or 200 µm inner diameter (I. D.). The tubing was cut at a 45 o angle, inserted into the outlet of the microfluidic device up to the inlet junction, and sealed into the device by using PDMS prepolymer (10 : 1 elastomer to curing agent). To aid in imaging of the plugs, the Teflon tubing was wound in a spiral on a glass slide, and PDMS prepolymer was poured over the tubing to fix it in place. The device with attached tubing was then autoclaved at 135 oC for 10 min to sterilize. Once sterilized, the glass slide containing the tubing was transferred to a sterile Petri dish. Flowing solutions into the microfluidic devices All solutions were loaded into 1700 series <b>Gastight</b> <b>syringes</b> (Hamilton, Reno, NV) with removable 27 gauge needles and 30 gauge Teflon tubing (Weico, Wire & Cable, Edgewood, NY). To maintain sterility, the syringes were filled and attached to the device within a biosafety cabinet. Syringes were connected to the microfluidic devices by using 30 gauge Teflon tubing. Solutions where flowed into the microfluidic devices by using previously described methods. 4 Flow rates were controlled by using PHD 2000 infusion syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} {{experiment}} designed to optimise the cone voltage on the MS, nine different oils were analysed by direct infusion ESI-MS (with the code for the plots in parenthesis) : corn (C), grapestone oil (G), husk oil (H), olive oil (O), {{extra virgin olive}} oil (V), peanut oil (P), soya oil (S), sunflower oil (F) and a mixed oil (M) comprising peanut, sunflower and soya oils. In the second experiment four oils were analysed by direct infusion ESI-MS-MS. The oils analysed were refined olive oil (O), refined hazelnut oil (H), unrefined peanut oil (P) and sunflower oil (S). All oils were supplied by G. Bianchi and were stored at 4 °C. Prior to analysis these oils were allowed to come up to room temperature (~ 20 °C) for 24 h. ESI-MS All oils were analysed by diluting them 1000 -fold in 60 % dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2) : 40 % 10 mM ammonium acetate (NH 4 OAc) in methanol (CH 3 OH). All data were collected in the positive ion mode (ES +).

40|$|A <b>gastight</b> <b>syringe</b> (GTS) is {{commonly}} used as a medium for transfer or storage of gaseous standards (or samples) {{in the analysis of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, the sorptive loss patterns of 21 VOCs were examined, using GTS as the transfer medium. The results of the test were evaluated with respect to a number of key variables including concentration, sampling volume, and physicochemical properties (molecular weight and boiling point). The VOCs with relatively high volatility (Group 1 : aldehyde, ketone, ester, alcohol, and aromatic hydrocarbons (n = 12)) showed low sorptive losses with a mean (+/- SD) of 2. 56 +/- 2. 87 %, regardless of differences in the aforementioned key variables (p-value by t-test before and after using GTS = mean 0. 15 +/- 0. 13). Conversely, the sorptive losses of seven semi-VOCs (Group 2 : carboxyl and cresol (n = 9)) were significantly high, ranging from 18. 0 +/- 4. 10 % (propionic acid) to 65. 4 +/- 10. 9 % (n-heptanonic acid). In addition, we also measured the sorptive losses on the syringe needle (mean sorptive loss of Group 2 = 5. 94 +/- 5. 63 %). A linear regression analysis showed that the sorptive losses for Group 2 increased as molecular weight (or boiling point) increased, exhibiting a highly significant correlation (R- 2 value (0. 804 +/- 0. 084) and mean p-value (0. 002 +/- 0. 003).

40|$|Given the {{universal}} detection {{capability of the}} PDHID, the simultaneous analysis of organic and inorganic volatiles requires {{a high degree of}} separation, sufficient to quantify each compound. For measurements of sam-ples containing air, special care must be taken for to sepa-rate the major components of air (O 2, N 2, and moisture). In the present study, a simple and convenient system, comprising a single column and a single detector of the PDHID, is designed for simultaneous analyses of organic and inorganic volatiles. We also evaluate the performance of this gas chromatography (GC) –PDHID system. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sample preparation Pure and mixed standard gases in disposable cans were purchased from GL Sciences (Tokyo, Japan). The degree of purity of each pure gas (CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 8, H 2, CO, and CO 2) is more than 99. 5 %. The concentrations of each component in mixed gases (C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 6, C 3 H 8, i-C 4 H 10, and n-C 4 H 10) are ca. 1 %. To prepare mixtures of the standard gases, their concentrations were adjusted by introducing them into a 200 ml glass canister. The sol-vent gas in the standards was air. The end of the canister was capped with a silicon septum, and the gas samples were collected through the septum with a <b>gastight</b> <b>syringe.</b> Simultaneous and sensitive analysis of inorganic and organic gaseous compounds by pulsed discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID...|$|E
40|$|A new {{simultaneous}} derivatization and extraction {{method for}} the preconcentration of ammonia using new one-step headspace dynamic in-syringe liquid-phase microextraction with in situ derivatization {{was developed for}} the trace determination of ammonium in aqueous samples by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC–FLD). The acceptor phase (as derivatization reagent) containing ophthaldehyde and sodium sulfite was held within a syringe barrel and immersed in the headspace of sample container. The gaseous ammonia from the alkalized aqueous sample formed a stable isoindole derivative with the acceptor phase inside the syringe barrel through the reciprocated movements of plunger. After derivatization-cum-extraction, the acceptor phase was directly injected into LC–FLD for analysis. Parameters affecting the ammonia evolution and the extraction/derivatization efficiency such as sample matrix, pH, temperature, sampling time, and the composition of derivatization reagent, reaction temperature, and frequency of reciprocated plunger, were studied thoroughly. Results indicated that the maximum extraction efficiency was obtained by using 100 L derivatization reagent in a 1 -mL <b>gastight</b> <b>syringe</b> under 8 reciprocated movements of plunger per min to extract ammonia evolved from a 20 mL alkalized aqueous solution at 70 ◦C (preheated 4 min) with 380 rpm stirring for 8 min. The detection was linear in the concentration range of 0. 625 – 10 M with the correlation coefficient of 0. 9967 and detection limit of 0. 33 M (5. 6 ng mL− 1) based on S N− 1 = 3. The method was applied successfully to determine ammonium in real water samples without any prior cleanup of the samples, and has been {{proved to be a}} simple, sensitive, efficient and cost-effective procedure for trace ammonium determination in aqueous samples...|$|E
