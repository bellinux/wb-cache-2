6000|$|From a {{group in}} one of Mr. Lloyd's vases. Fig. 3 A is the natural size of the central group of cells, in a {{specimen}} coiled round a thread-like weed. Underneath {{this is the same}} portion enlarged. [...] When magnified to this apparent size, the cells could be seen in different states, some closed, and others with their bodies protruded. When magnified to 3 D, we could pleasantly watch the gradual eversion of the membrane, then the points of the tentacles slowly appearing, and then, when fully protruded, suddenly expanding into a bell-shaped circle. This was their usual appearance, but sometimes they could be noticed bending inwards, as in fig. 3 C, as if to imprison some living atom of importance. [...] <b>Fig.</b> <b>B</b> represents two tentacles, showing the direction in which the cilia vibrate.|$|E
6000|$|... 68. <b>Fig.</b> <b>b</b> is {{a chimney}} common {{over the whole}} of the north of England; being, as I think, one that will go well in almost any wind, and is {{applicable}} at any part of the roof. It is also roughly built, consisting of a roof of loose stones, sometimes one large flat slab, supported above the flue by four large supports, each of a single stone. It is rather light in its appearance, and breaks the ridge of a roof very agreeably. Separately considered, it is badly proportioned; but, as it just equals the height to which a long chimney at the extremity of the building would rise above the roof (as in a), it is quite right in situ, and would be ungainly if it were higher. The upper part is always dark, owing to the smoke, and tells agreeably against any background seen through the hollow.|$|E
6000|$|... 144. Let us take {{then the}} simple {{form a b}} c d, {{interrupting}} the curve c e [fig. 11, A]. Now, the eye will always continue the principal lines of such an object for itself, until they cut the main curve; that is, it will carry on a b to e, and the total effect of the interruption will be that of the form c d e. Had the line b d been nearer to a c, the effect {{would have been just}} the same. Now, every curve may be considered as composed of an infinite number of lines at right angles to each other, as m n is made up of o p, p q, etc., (<b>fig.</b> <b>B),</b> whose ratio to each other varies with the direction of the curve. Then, if the right lines which form the curve at c (fig. A) be increased, we have the figure c d e, that is, the apparent interruption of the curve is an increased part of the curve itself. To the mathematical reader we can explain our meaning more clearly, by pointing out that, taking c for our origin, we have a c, a e, for the co-ordinates of e, and that, therefore, their ratio is the equation to the curve. Whence it appears, that, when any curve is broken in upon by a building composed of simple vertical and horizontal lines, the eye is furnished, by the interruption, with the equation to that part of the curve which is interrupted. If, instead of square forms, we take obliquity, as r s t (fig. C), we have one line, s t, an absolute break, and the other r s, in false proportion. If we take another curve, we have an infinite number of lines, only two of which are where they ought to be. And this is the true reason for the constant introduction of features which appear to be somewhat formal, into the most perfect imaginations of the old masters, and the true cause of the extreme beauty of the groups formed by Italian villages in general.|$|E

In the first two cases, the spectrum of the aged solution contains fewer, better separated signals at m/z values above those attributed to the H-bonded dimers than in the starting solution. In the aged R-phenylglycine sample, for example, two such signals are perceptible at m/z 413 and 582 (<b>Fig.</b> 5 <b>b).</b> The mass values suggest that all these signals might originate, e.g., from the fragmented tetrapeptide.
