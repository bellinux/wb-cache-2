Moores backed Smith {{to succeed in the}} long form of the game, stating [...] "We've backed Tom to do it because it balances our team and he has shown he is a very good player. I think we've seen that in the one-day stuff. I think Tom is playing well. You judge a player on how he's playing. Tom's developing and learning quickly. Technically, <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> tall and plays up the ground which is what you want your openers to do".|$|E

Josh Schwartz, the show's creator, stated that in Season 2, the show would [...] "no longer be about Ryan's past; now it's {{going to be about}} Ryan's future," [...] and that this season would [...] "slow down the storytelling a little bit ... and evolve the characters." [...] For example, the story closely follows Ryan in his advanced physics class, where tension is created between him and another student, Lindsay, who presumes that Ryan will be useless as a lab partner, who thus prevents him from contributing to the work that must be submitted. Ryan's character begins to grow when <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> to Lindsay and convinces her to allow him to contribute, forcing them to work together to complete the assignment. They later become involved romantically, creating extreme complications and relational shifts amongst the now [...] "Cooper-Nichol" [...] family. The Bait Shop becomes a prominent social destination for the teenage characters. A number of recurring characters are introduced, such as D.J., Lindsay Gardner, Zach Stevens, and Alex Kelly, with whom the main characters form a variety of relationships.
