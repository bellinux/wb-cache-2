40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the degree of}} comovement of gross capital inflows, which is a highly sensitive issue for policy makers. We estimate a dynamic hierarchical factor model that is able to decompose inflows {{in a sample of}} 47 economies into (i) a global factor common to all types of flows and all recipient countries, (ii) a factor specific to a given type of capital <b>inflows,</b> (<b>iii)</b> a regional factor and (iv) a country-specific com-ponent. We find that the latter explains by far the largest fraction of fluctuations in capital inflows followed by regional factors, which are particularly important for emerging markets ’ FDI and portfolio inflows as well as bank lending to emerging Europe. The global factor, however, explains only a small share of overall variation. The exposure to global drivers of capital flows, i. e. the global factor and the factor specific to each type of capital inflows, is particularly pronounced for countries with a more developed financial system. A fixed exchange rate regime does not shield countries from {{the ebb and flow of}} global capital flow cycles...|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of a hydrologic model {{is directly related}} to its application and how well it is calibrated. Calibration is a subjective exercise where model parameters are adjusted to reduce discrepancies between measured data and modeled predictions. Automated calibration can be used to accelerate the model calibration process, minimize modeler bias, and increase the goodness of fit between measured and modeled hydro graphs. During calibration of a complex hydrologic model, {{it may be difficult to}} simultaneously adjust predicted output hydrographs to correspondingly match multiple objectives (peak flows, total volume and shape of the hydrograph). Custom programming was used to link SWMM Runoff version 4. 4 h with Palisade's Evolver software to improve model goodness of fit. A small sanitary sewer basin was simulated as part of a collection system rehabilitation pilot program to judge the effectiveness of infiltration and <b>inflow</b> (<b>III)</b> removal. A one-month time series of hourly flow measurements were used and calibration was perfonned with an automated calibration method that applied a genetic algorithm solution technique. Several goodness-of-fit metrics revealed an improved calibration for both pre- and post-rehabilitation flow hydrograph, as well as for projected hydrographs to a design event. This study demonstrates an accurate and cost-effective auto-mated method for model calibration that is not only valuable for repeated model analyses perfonned throughout a collection system rehabilitation program, but can also be applied to other watershed models...|$|R

Using arguments rooted in political economy models and large-N statistics, this dissertation provides three core findings: (i) Foreign aid can be driven by heterogenous motives in the donor country.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Much research activity is carried out to reduce water consumption for domestic purposes. This leads {{to the possibility of}} reducing the amount of water introduced into building drainage systems. However, an accurate estimation of the flow attenuation within building drainage pipes is of great importance to prevent solid eposition and subsequent blockage. The research is focused on the field of subcritical flow in partially-filled pipes. Experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out to study the wave attenuation in the following configurations encountered in drainage pipe systems: i) A simple pipe, ii) A pipe subject to one concentrated lateral <b>inflow,</b> <b>iii)</b> A pipe with gate fixed at the downstream section, generating an interaction between wave and backwater profiles. In the present study the Saint-Venant equations are derived in their general and characteristic forms. A number of numerical procedures for solution of the Saint-Venant equations are reviewed, and the rectangular grid characteristics method, diffusing scheme and Strelkoff's implicit method are chosen to solve the equations. The stability of the finite-difference methods used is investigated for free-outfall and controlled outfall boundary conditions. An experimental installation consisting of 0. 105 m diameter uPVC pipe is used to investigate the characteristics of the flow and to form test cases for the numerical methods. Comparisons between computed and observed depth hydrographs, peak depths and depth variations along the pipe are made for subcritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 300. The rectangular-grid characteristics method and the diffusing scheme are also applied to supercritical flow. Flow tests are undertaken for supercritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 200 to validate the use of these methods. The investigation revealed that the attenuation rate of peak depths is affected by the volume of the waves. The implicit method is the most suitable method, dealing efficiently with most problems encountered in drainage pipe systems of flat slope. The diffusing scheme can model the attenuation of supercritical flow within building drainage pipes.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} new {{detailed}} biomarker-based sea ice records from two sediment cores recovered in the Chukchi Sea and the East Siberian Sea. These new biomarker data may provide new insights on processes controlling recent and past sea ice changes. The biomarker proxy records show (i) minimum sea ice extent during the Early Holocene, (ii) a prominent Mid-Holocene short-term high-amplitude variability in sea ice, primary production and Pacific-Water <b>inflow,</b> and (<b>iii)</b> significantly increased sea ice extent {{during the last}} ca. 4. 5 k cal a BP. This Late Holocene trend in sea ice change in the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas seems to be contemporaneous with similar changes in sea ice extent recorded from other Arctic marginal seas. The main factors controlling the millennial variability in sea ice (and surface-water productivity) are probably changes in surface water and heat flow from the Pacific into the Arctic Ocean {{as well as the}} long-term decrease in summer insolation. The short-term centennial variability observed in the high-resolution Middle Holocene record is probably related to solar forcing. Our new data on Holocene sea ice variability may contribute to synoptic reconstructions of regional to global Holocene climate change based on terrestrial and marine archives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} structural policies—that is, policies that increase the role of market forces and competition in the economy, while maintaining appropriate regulatory frameworks to deal with market failures—to economic performance. The results {{are based on a}} new dataset covering reforms of domestic product markets, international trade, the domestic financial sector, and the external capital account, in 91 developed and developing countries. Some key results are: (i) real and financial sector reforms have tended to boost per capita income growth and enhance macroeconomic stability, including by facilitating adjustment to various shocks; (ii) financial sector reforms have raised growth through a number of channels, including a reduction in domestic credit constraints and larger <b>inflows</b> of FDI; (<b>iii)</b> structural reforms have exerted meaningful effects on allocative efficiency, as firms across different sectors react to the shifts in comparative advantage brought about by deregulation; and (iv) growth effects differ significantly across alternative reform sequencing strategies, with a trade-before-capital-account strategy achieving better outcomes than the reverse sequence, or even than a “big bang ” where reforms are pursued together.

40|$|Theoretical {{solutions}} for thermal stratification and airflow rates are obtained for buoyancy-driven displacement ventilation in a single-zone building with three-level openings. Three displacement natural ventilation modes are identified: (I) the middle opening (MO) {{is below the}} stratification interface; (II) MO is above the stratification interface with <b>inflow</b> through MO; (<b>III)</b> MO is above the stratification interface with outflow through MO. It was found that {{for a wide range}} of building geometries, the ventilation mode is uniquely determined by the building geometry and the type of buoyancy sources. However, there are certain ranges of building geometry for which displacement ventilation may occur with either mode (I) or mode (II) depending on initial conditions. The significance of this finding is that numerical simulation packages for predicting displacement natural ventilation of buildings need to have the ability to cope with multiple solutions. It was also found that for a given ventilation mode, the location of the stratification interface is a function of the geometrical parameters only and independent of the strength of buoyancy sources. Some general guidelines for optimising natural ventilation in a building with three-level openings are provided. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Fixed and {{flexible}} exchange rates each have advantages, and a country {{has the right to}} choose the regime suited to its circumstances. Nevertheless, several arguments support the view that the de facto dollar peg may now have outlived its usefulness for China. (i) Although foreign exchange reserves are a useful shield against currency crises, by now China’s current level is fully adequate, and US treasury securities do not pay a high return. (ii) It may become increasingly difficult to sterilize the <b>inflow</b> over time. (<b>iii)</b> Although external balance could be achieved by expenditure reduction, e. g. by raising interest rates, the existence of two policy goals (external balance and internal balance) in general requires the use of two independent policy instruments (e. g. the real exchange rate and the interest rate). (iv) A large economy like China can achieve adjustment in the real exchange rate via flexibility in the nominal exchange rate more easily than via price flexibility. (v) The experience of other emerging markets points toward exiting from a peg when times are good and the currency is strong, rather than waiting until times are bad and the currency is under attack.

40|$|In this master thesis {{different}} propeller {{design and}} analysis methods are presented and compared {{in terms of}} the accuracy and computational efficiency of their theory. These methods include lifting line, vortex lattice lifting surface and panel methods. A propeller design program based on lifting line theory was developed by the author. This program has been used together with the propeller design programs OpenProp and AKPD to make six propeller designs. The designs are based on two sets of input data, making three designs for each set. Each propeller design has been analyzed for performance in the analysis software AKPA. Cavitation analyses have also been performed. An effort has been made to include a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis as was initially intended. Eventually this is not included due to time limitations and software issues. The objective of the thesis is to give recommendations regarding what is the most suitable propeller software. The following conclusions could be drawn from the performed analysis on the two design programs utilized in the thesis: Based on the propellers designs analyzed in this thesis, OpenProp is able to produce the better designs. Both of the OpenProp propeller designs achieves the highest efficiency as well as showing the least cavitation. OpenProp has an advantage in time required to produce a design. It is able to design and run a performance analysis in a matter of seconds. AKPD requires several minutes to produce a full design if the number of unsteady calculation iterations are set to 5 or above (which is recommended by the author for convergence). AKPD is the only design tool of the two which is able to account for effects from skew and rake. Skew is often preferred in modern propeller design in order to reduce cavitation, noise and vibrations. AKPD is set up for a seamless transition to AKPA. If AKPA is the preferred analysis program, making the designs in AKPD may end up saving time in the design process. While both AKPD and OpenProp are restricted to circumferentially averaged <b>inflow,</b> AKPD <b>iii</b> can account for inflow in the radial as well as the axial and tangential direction. This might be of importance for propellers with high shaft angles or high rake...|$|R
40|$|Privatization in {{the sense}} of {{transfer}} of ownership and control rights of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has been either minimal or ineffective in many transition economies, including Viet Nam. One major barrier in this respect appears to be the general absence or weakness of an appropriate institutional infrastructure. Institution building, however, is extremely difficult and a painstakingly slow process. Although Viet Nam has attained some notable progress in this regard, many anomalies and shortcomings persist. For example, the laws relating to property rights, foreign investment and corporate governance are still not clearly defined and/or suffer from many inadequacies. The judiciary is also undeveloped and the enforcement of laws is extremely weak. There is no competition policy. Restructuring of enterprises has been few and far between. A stock market is yet to be established. And there is no worthwhile social safety net to protect the interests of any retrenched labor. This creates an important policy dilemma. On the one hand, privatization is urgently warranted to help the desired switch-over to a market economy. On the other hand, institutional weaknesses dictate a slower approach to avoid such serious problems as possible pilferage of state assets and replacement of SOEs by corrupt, private monopolies. This policy dilemma which does not lend itself to any easy resolution, gives rise to several major questions relating to SOE reforms, the pace and sequencing of the privatization program and any alternative mechanism to crack the institutional barriers. This paper argues that given the inherent difficulty in building up an appropriate, market oriented institutional infrastructure, a better policy option for the country may be to stimulate a robust private sector growth. This calls for 2 ̆ 01 cleveling the playing field 2 ̆ 01 d by the abolishment of special incentives to large SOEs and making them face hard budget constraints. More importantly, measures should be taken urgently to: (i) privatize the small SOEs, along with mainstreaming and strengthening the existing private sector enterprises, (ii) streamline the foreign investment laws and regulations to attract greater FDI <b>inflows,</b> and (<b>iii)</b> encourage the emergence of such other innovative entities as township and village enterprises (TVEs). These are all expected to infuse greater competition in the economy. Trade liberalization should {{play an important role in}} this frame by helping lower or break the protective walls. To offset possible economic and social disruptions in the process, it would be necessary to introduce social safety net schemes, although it must be pointed out that only a vigorous growth of the non-state enterprises can provide a more lasting solution to the problem by absorbing the surplus labor force...|$|R
40|$|During {{end-of-life}} {{production from}} an oil well {{it is often}} impossible to sustain continuous production. Gas coning is a common cause of production problems, especially in thin oil reservoirs. This study compares three production strategies {{that can be used}} to deal with this problem for a specific field case. The strategies will be evaluated on the basis of two criteria: Total number of barrels produced and Net Present Value (NPV). The three strategies considered are (i) intermittent production, (ii) Well Head Control (WHC), (<b>iii)</b> <b>Inflow</b> Control Devices, (ICD). The first two are currently common practice, while the latter is an emerging technology which is not applied on a large scale yet, because of the larger expense incurred by ICD installation. The onset of gas breakthrough occurs in a much shorter timescale than many other production upsets, such as water flooding, making it a very challenging situation for a control strategy. A coupled dynamic reservoir-well model has been used in order to describe the breakthrough accurately. A simulation environment has been constructed and validated in which different well and reservoir models can be coupled. Since correct prediction of flow and pressure drop over ICDs is essential, special care was taken to accurately model these devices. For the WHC control strategies a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm was used. Despite the higher initial completion costs associated with ICDs, they can provide a cost-effective way to reduce long-term operating costs and increase yield. Production targets are achieved with longer, but fewer wells, maintenance and overhead. From a reservoir management point of view, ICDs can improve the productivity index (PI) by maximizing reservoir contact, minimizing gas coning by operating at lower drawdown, and increasing overall efficiency. In this study we evaluate a field case, which suffers from gas coning, to verify whether the implementation and usage of ICDs are cost-effective alternatives, and quantify the relative merits for each technology. The comparison is based on both the total barrels produced and the NPV, taking into account the integral cost, including installation, operating, and maintenance costs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{contracts and}} organizational form {{decisions in the}} empirical setting of venture capital investments. The first chapter asks how entrepreneurs and venture capital investors are affected by a specific design feature of investment contracts. Participating preferred rights, which are venture capital contract terms that give investors returns greater than their intrinsic ownership, are used extensively despite possible deleterious effects on founder incentives. Using a novel data set of venture capital investment contracts from 2004 - 2009, I ask three fundamental questions about these rights: when are they used, who uses them, and what are their consequences? The findings indicate that (i) lower inflows of venture capital funding increase the use of participating preferred rights; (ii) less experienced investors and certain industry sectors utilize participating preferred rights more often; and (iii) firms with participating preferred rights {{are less likely to}} raise a subsequent financing at a higher valuation and less likely to exit through an IPO or acquisition, suggesting that the incentive implications of these rights may affect firm performance. These results are robust to specifications that attempt to control for the endogeneity of the contract right. The findings provide important insights for entrepreneurs and investors who are weighing the consequences of certain contractual forms. The second chapter broadens the analysis to other contractual rights to asks how investors and entrepreneurs allocate ownership and venture capital investment rights in competitive markets. Using the same data set of venture capital financings from 2004 - 2009, I find that changes in market competition, or venture capital supply, affect contractual terms in significant ways. Competition not only affects firm valuations, but how actual firm ownership is divided between entrepreneurs and investors. Additionally, certain contractual rights shift in response to venture capital scarcity. Specifically, the results suggest that (i) entrepreneurs own more of the firm in periods of high venture capital inflows, (ii) entrepreneurs give up cash flow rights in periods of low venture capital <b>inflows,</b> and (<b>iii)</b> the incidence of control rights are not significantly affected by venture capital inflows. Similarly, the results are robust to specifications that attempt to control for the endogeneity of venture capital inflows. The third chapter (co-authored with Eric J. Allen) focuses on a potential inefficiency of organizational design, specifically when a startup chooses to organize as a C-corporation rather than as a limited liability company (LLC). We examine the previously documented anomaly of loss-generating startup firms organizing as C-Corporations, as opposed to the theoretically more tax efficient alternative - the LLC. While prior research examines the potential reasons for this divergence between theory and practice, this is the first study that actually attempts to quantify the foregone tax benefits incurred by the current system. We examine a sample of venture backed firms that reached the Initial Public Offering stage between 1996 and 2008. We find {{that the vast majority of}} these firms have accumulated tax losses at issuance, on average $ 33 million, and that the associated potential tax benefit is significant. We also examine a subsample of firms that were, at one time, organized as pass-through entities prior to going public. We find that, while the majority switched to the C-Corporate form upon the entrance of a venture capital investor, a small number were allowed to retain their pass-through status until issuance. Their existence provides further evidence that the alternative form's lack of adoption must be attributable to some aspect other than technical limitations that would prevent venture capital investment...|$|R
40|$|The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey {{has been}} {{deployed}} since 1931 {{to describe and}} analyze plankton variability in the North Atlantic and North Sea. This survey measures the presence and abundance of 437 phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa and provides an assessment of phytoplankton biomass, the Phytoplankton Colour Index (VCI). The diatoms and dinoflagellates are the two main phytoplankton groups identified by the CPR survey. The {{first part of this}} work provides insights into the space-time dynamics of phytoplankton communities through an analysis of diatom and dinoflagellate populations in the whole North Atlantic basin. Because the North Atlantic Ocean includes many different biotopes, the second part focuses on the mesoscale variability of phytoplankton species. The long-term fluctuations of the phytoplankton species are studied in the NW and in the NE Atlantic, the two best sampled areas of the CPR survey. In the NE Atlantic, the aim is to determine the contribution of the diatoms and dinoflagellates to the PCI, their fluctuations over 45 years of sampling and their geographical variations. Because local variability in environmental conditions is thought to play a dominant role in temporal fluctuations of phytoplankton biomass, the next part takes advantage to define small areas around the British Isles. This allowed me to study more precisely the processes influencing the long-term variation of phytoplankton assemblages. The North Atlantic Current transports water across the Northern basin of the Atlantic Ocean, along the shelf of Ireland and form the Norwegian current which corresponds to the inflow of oceanic waters into the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea. In this highly hydrodynamic region attention is focused on the fluctuations of plankton species in relation to the currents. The aim of this part is therefore to investigate the fluctuations of phytoplankton biomass, diatoms and dinoflagellates, their geographical distribution and abundance within the area and their relationship with physical processes. The intense hydrodynamic activity observed in the Northwestern Atlantic Shelves Province (NWCS) makes this region especially intriguing {{from the point of view}} of physical-biological interactions. The relationship between spatial and temporal structures of eddies (via Sea Surface Heights) and chlorophyll a (from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor, Sea WiFS) was assessed along the Gulf Stream axis. In particular, the physical structures identified were followed and compared with phytoplankton distribution. In addition, the impact of the LSW changing flow along the Scotian Shelf and the influence of Gulf Stream rings along the George Bank is determined. This work demonstrated that changes are occurring in pelagic ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales. These changes have been illustrated by the spatial variability induced by eddies and/or currents but also by the regional variability of the hydro-climatic processes, influencing in different ways Sea Surface Temperature, wind-regimes and mixing of local environments. Several different aspects of the North Atlantic Oscillations impact on pelagic ecosystems have been highlighted. In the northeast Atlantic, NA 0 fluctuations imply changes in (i) SST in northern Europe, (ii) wind regimes, (<b>iii)</b> Atlantic Water <b>inflow</b> into the North Sea. In contrast, in the northwest Atlantic, the variations of NAO imply changes in (i) SST on the Scotian Shelf, (ii) coastal currents, and (<b>iii)</b> <b>inflow</b> of Labrador Sea Slope Water (LSSW) towards the Scotian Shelf and Georges Bank. These changes in environmental process impact phytoplankton production, abundance, spatial distribution, community structure phenology and ultimately would impact trophodynamics processes. It is, however, still difficult to explain unambiguously all the mechanisms that are involved in the control of the observed patterns. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
