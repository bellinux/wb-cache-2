5|$|The British rock {{movement}} {{known as}} {{the new wave of}} British heavy metal (frequently abbreviated in NWOBHM), which started in the late 1970s and broke in the mainstream in the early 1980s, was just <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom and the band gained the support of a strong label at exactly the right time to exploit the moment and form a solid fan base.|$|E
5|$|A smaller, single-panel oil {{painting}} by Lichtenstein {{around the same}} time, Tex!, has a similar composition, with a plane at the lower left shooting an air-to-air missile at a second plane that is <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the upper right, with a word bubble. The same issue of All-American Men of War was the inspiration {{for at least three}} other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata and Blam, in addition to Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. Several of Lichtenstein's other comics-based works are inspired by stories about Johnny Flying Cloud written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by Novick, including Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Jet Pilot and Von Karp.|$|E
5|$|Clear Rivers is {{introduced}} in the 2000 film Final Destination {{as one of the}} seniors from the fictional Mt. Abraham High School boarding Volée Airlines Flight 180 heading to Paris on May 13, 2000. On board, Alex Browning warns the passengers about his vision of the airliner <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> mid-air, gaining no support except for Clear. She along with Alex and their classmates Tod Waggner, Terry Chaney, Carter Horton, Billy Hitchcok and teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton are removed from the plane before it explodes in midair minutes after take off, killing the other 286 passengers. Thirty nine days later, while at the memorial for the victims, she presents Alex a white rose as gratitude for saving her life.|$|E

5|$|Littorio was {{inactive}} for {{the first}} six months of 1943 due to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. Only enough fuel was available for Littorio, Vittorio Veneto and their recently commissioned sister , but even then the fuel was only enough for emergencies. On 19 June 1943, an American bombing raid targeted the harbor at La Spezia and hit Littorio with three bombs. She was renamed Italia on 30 July after the government of Benito Mussolini fell from power. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, Italia and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be interned for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. One Fritz X hit Italia just forward of turret no. 1; it passed through the ship and exited the hull, <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the water beneath and causing serious damage. Roma was meanwhile sunk in the attack.|$|E
5|$|That day, Lützow had led {{a flight}} of six Me262s of JV44 against a force of 256 medium bombers of the 322nd and 344th Bombardment Group (344th BG). Lützow's flight {{included}} Hauptmann Walter Krupinski and Oberleutnant Klaus Neumann. Two of the Me262s had to abort the mission due to engine problems. The remaining four, of which at least Lützow's and Neumann's Me262s were armed with the R4M air-to-air rockets, attacked elements of 344thBG. Following the first attack, at least three B-26 Marauder bombers were seen trailing smoke, when the Me262s came under attack by P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft of the 365th Fighter Group. Blue Flight leader Captain Jerry G. Mast and his wingman, Second Lieutenant Byron Smith, went into full power dives to drive the attacking Me262s away. Following the dive, Smith got separated from Mast and pursued an Me262. Mast and Second Lieutenant William H. Myers then jointly went after another Me262 which went into an even steeper dive. The Me262 was seen crashing {{into the ground and}} <b>exploding.</b> <b>In</b> Forsyth's account, the Me262 chased by Mast and Myers was Lützow's and had been flying furthest to the south.|$|E

25|$|On 17 February 1918 a German Gotha {{aircraft}} dropped five bombs one {{of which}} destroyed {{the roof of the}} station's ornate booking hall and killed 20 people. The station was also bombed in World War II, including a land mine damaging the roof on 15–16 October 1940, and a bomb <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the beer vaults underneath Platform 3 on 10–11 May 1941.|$|E
25|$|While {{attempting}} the pickup, a Chinook {{transport helicopter}} crashed {{in the darkness}} at 10:09 PM when the rear rotor hit a tree, and the helicopter slid down the slope and over a cliff, <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> flames and killing all the crew and passengers. There was an element of ABLE Troop 3-71 CAV 2nd Platoon still left on the PZ after the crash that worked relentlessly to recover the bodies of their 10 comrades and destroy sensitive equipment left among the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{had felt}} {{relatively}} safe from timed artillery fire {{because they thought}} that the bad weather prevented the Allies from observing their movements accurately. When the Americans employed the POZIT proximity fuse, their artillery fire was far more devastating, decimating German troops caught in the open, causing up to 20% losses. The effectiveness of the new fused shells <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> mid-air stirred some German soldiers to refuse orders {{to move out of}} their bunkers during an artillery attack. U.S. General George S. Patton said that the introduction of the proximity fuse required a full revision of the tactics of land warfare.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August 2011, Haaretz {{reported}} {{that according to}} Israeli security sources, Palestinian militants changed their rocket-launching tactics {{in an attempt to}} evade the two Iron Dome batteries deployed in southern Israel. The new tactics included aiming more frequently at areas beyond the Iron Dome protection range. After the Palestinian launch teams realized that the systems deployed in the previous two weeks around Ashkelon and Be'er Sheva provided near-perfect protection from rockets, they began firing more frequently at Ashdod and Ofakim. When they did aim at Beersheba on 21 August, they did not fire one or two rockets, as in the past, but rather a volley of seven rockets almost simultaneously. Iron Dome intercepted five of them successfully, but one penetrated the defense system, <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> a residential area and killing a man.|$|E
25|$|In Dogma, Metatron {{is portrayed}} by Alan Rickman, stating that he {{acts as the}} Voice of God in {{situations}} where people hear God speak to them, as humanity is psychologically and physically incapable of hearing God's actual voice without their heads <b>exploding.</b> <b>In</b> {{the course of the}} film, he recruits abortion clinic worker Bethany Sloan (Linda Fiorentino), who is revealed {{over the course of the}} film to be the last living relative of Jesus, to stop two angels from unwittingly negating existence while God is incapacitated after he is attacked and left in a coma while in a mortal form. During a later conversation with Bethany, the Metatron notes that Jesus had trouble adapting to the news that he was God's son and asked Metatron to take it back, with Metatron admitting to Bethany that he regretted placing so much responsibility on a child.|$|E
25|$|Arnett {{worked for}} CNN for 18 years ending in 1999. During the Gulf War, {{he became a}} {{household}} name worldwide when he became the only reporter with live coverage directly from Baghdad. His dramatic reports often had air raid sirens blaring {{and the sound of}} US bombs <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the background. Together with two other CNN journalists, Bernard Shaw and John Holliman, Arnett brought continuous coverage from Baghdad for the 16 initial intense hours of the war (17 January 1991). Although 40 foreign journalists were present at the Al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad at the time, only CNN possessed the means — a private phone line connected to neighboring Amman, Jordan — to communicate to the outside world. CNN broadcast Arnett's extended call live for several hours, with a picture of Arnett as video. Soon the other journalists left Iraq, including the two CNN colleagues, which left Arnett as the sole remaining reporter.|$|E

The IJN then completed a domestically-produced replica in 1923, which flew once from Yokosuka to Osaka and back to Kasumigaura Air Field; it <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> midair in 1924, killing all of its crew.|$|R
25|$|Because neutrinos {{interact}} {{so little}} with matter, {{it is thought}} that a supernova's neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost regions of the explosion. Much of the visible light comes from the decay of radioactive elements produced by the supernova shock wave, and even light from the explosion itself is scattered by dense and turbulent gases, and thus delayed. The neutrino burst is expected to reach Earth before any electromagnetic waves, including visible light, gamma rays or radio waves. The exact time delay depends on the velocity of the shock wave and on the thickness of the outer layer of the star. For a Type II supernova, astronomers expect the neutrino flood to be released seconds after the stellar core collapse, while the first electromagnetic signal may emerge hours later, after the explosion shock wave has had time to reach the surface of the star. The Supernova Early Warning System project uses a network of neutrino detectors to monitor the sky for candidate supernova events; the neutrino signal will provide a useful advance warning of a star <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Young {{communist}} militants (UJRF) {{were also}} accused of sabotage actions like the famous Henri Martin affair {{and the case}} of Raymonde Dien, who was jailed one year for having blocked an ammunition train, {{with the help of}} other militants, in order to prevent the supply of French forces in Indochina in February 1950. Similar actions against trains occurred in Roanne, Charleville, Marseille, and Paris. Even ammunition sabotage by PCF agents has been reported, such as grenades <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the hands of legionaries. These actions became such a cause for concern by 1950 that the French Assembly voted a law against sabotage between March 2–8. At this session tension was so high between politicians that fighting ensued in the assembly following communist deputees’ speeches against the Indochinese policy. This month saw the French navy mariner and communist militant Henri Martin arrested by military police and jailed for five years for sabotage and propaganda operations in Toulon's arsenal. On May 5 communist Ministers were dismissed from the government, marking the end of Tripartism. A few months later on November 11, 1950, the French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez went to Moscow.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{physics in}} the world of Dust, Chahi commented that the {{developers}} had: [...] "worked hard to translate a vision {{of the power of the}} Earth moving and <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the game". Volcanic eruptions, explosions, and lava flows, function in a way similar to actual volcanoes, such as Mount Etna. However, the developers opted for more theatrical, [...] "visually impressive" [...] tsunamis. Dynamic textures were used to represent water transparency, moving lava, and the real time adaptation of rock and soil to fluids.|$|E

500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board report {{stated that}} [...] "the {{airplane}} was seen lifting off the runway, and then nose down, impacting in a marsh {{on the south}} side of the departure end of runway 27 and then <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> flames." [...] It indicated that the pilot was not approved to fly the plane. Morales falsely obtained his FAA license by showing hundreds of hours never flown, and he may also have falsified how many hours he had flown in order to get a job with his employer, Blackhawk International Airways. Additionally, toxicology tests performed on Morales revealed traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system.|$|E
500|$|The move to Los Angeles {{also meant}} a drastic price {{increase}} for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, [...] "At the time, {{the exchange rate}} between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. Somebody {{told me that the}} cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved". In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained [...] "everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. [...] It became apparent very quickly to me that we were no longer going to have things such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the woods".|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{weight of the}} shot was listed at 68lbs but in reality this varied according to the material of the shot itself; cast iron shot weighed , wrought iron shot and steel shot weighed , and chilled steel weighed [...] [...] It was estimated that one 68-pound shot had the destructive power equivalent to five 32-pound shot. The explosive shells were primed with [...] of gunpowder. They were fitted with simple fuses that were ignited by the flash of the charge – early wooden fuses were eventually replaced by more reliable fuses designed by Captain Edward Boxer in 1849. The gun crew still had to gauge the best length of fuse for the range they were firing – ideally the shell should explode just before hitting its target. To prevent the shell <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> the barrel it was fitted with a sabot to ensure the fuse faced away from the charge.|$|E
