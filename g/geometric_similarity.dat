40|$|Abstract. Given a gene {{expression}} data matrix where each cell is the expression {{level of a}} gene under a certain condition, biclustering {{is the problem of}} searching for a subset of genes that coregulate and coexpress only under a subset of conditions. The traditional clustering algorithms cannot be applied for biclustering as one cannot measure the similarity between genes (or rows) and conditions (or columns) by normal <b>geometric</b> <b>similarities.</b> Identifying a network of collaborating genes and a subset of experimental conditions which activate the specific network is a crucial part of the problem.

The authors present a new method {{based on the}} {{computation}} of geodesic distance maps between a source and a destination surface.

Actually, the matching constraints are explicitly expressed by the definition of a hypersurface. The connecting paths between the two surfaces lie on this hypersurface. The authors construct a hypersurface that allows the matching process to preserve <b>geometric</b> <b>similarities</b> in the case of small deformations, and loosen these geometric constraints when large deformations occur.

The resulting metastable microcompartment structures closely resemble those of carboxysomes, with a narrow size distribution and faceted shells.

40|$|Fiber {{tracking}} {{is one of}} the clinically most well-established analysis {{techniques for}} Diffusion Tensor Imaging data (DTI). It facilitates the reconstruction of anatomically known white matter structures by tracing trajectories on a tensor field obtained from diffusion weighted MR images. A crucial step when using this technique is the placement and shape of regions-of-interest (ROIs) to identify the structures in question. Typically, free-hand contours or simple geometric shapes like rectangles are placed in regions, where a given structure can be identified using the color coded DTI representation. However, such approaches result in a high variability of the resulting tracts and usually require additional filtering and placement of multiple ROIs. Also, the generation of accurate ROIs using a free-hand tool requires a significant amount of interaction time. We present a method which allows for interactive generation of anatomically meaningful ROIs for DTI fiber tracking based on <b>geometric</b> <b>similarities</b> of the underlying tensor field.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a {{detailed}} numerical study of three-dimensional structures in gaseous detonations, using a parallelized, unsplit, shock-capturing algorithm. The computational domain consisted of a rectangular tube with periodic conditions on its lateral boundaries. A slightly perturbed ZND profile {{has been used as}} initial condition. Previous experimental studies in rectangular shock tubes suggest that there are two basic types of detonation structures: rectangular and diagonal ones. Rectangular structures are characterized by triple lines along the front that are parallel to the walls of the flow domain and by the presence of slapping waves on the walls. On the other hand, diagonal structures are characterized by diagonal triple lines and the absence of slapping waves on the walls. Both structures have been numerically reproduced in our study by suitably perturbing the initial conditions. All the important features of the flow fields that have been experimentally observed are reproduced in our simulations.

40|$|Protein {{structure}} alignment is {{the problem}} of determining an assignment between the amino-acid residues of two given proteins in a way that maximizes a measure of similarity between the two superimposed protein structures. By identifying <b>geometric</b> <b>similarities,</b> structure alignment algorithms provide critical insights into protein functional similarities. Existing structure alignment tools adopt a two-stage approach to structure alignment by decoupling and iterating between the assignment evaluation and structure superposition problems. We introduce a novel approach, SAS-Pro, which addresses the assignment evaluation and structure superposition simultaneously by formulating the alignment problem as a single bilevel optimization problem. The new formulation does not require the sequentiality constraints, thus generalizing the scope of the alignment methodology to include non-sequential protein alignments. We employ derivative-free optimization methodologies for searching for the global optimum of the highly nonlinear and non-differentiable RMSD function encountered in the proposed model. Alignments obtained with SAS-Pro have better RMSD values and larger lengths than those obtained from other alignment tools. For non-sequential alignment problems, SAS-Pro leads to alignments with high degree of similarity with known reference alignments. The source code of SAS-Pro is available for download a...|$|R

With respect to calibration of flowmeters, the Law of Similarity {{is the foundation}} for flow measurement standards. To satisfy the Law of Similarity, the central facility concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the laboratory meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined {{at the time of}} calibration is valid if both dynamic and <b>geometric</b> <b>similarity</b> exists between the field installation and the laboratory installation of the artifact. A proper manufacturer’s experimental pattern locates sensitive regions to explore, measure and empirically adjust. The manufacturer’s recommended correlation method is a rational basis for performance prediction provided the physics do not change. For instance, the physics are different between subsonic and sonic flow. To satisfy the Law of Similarity the in situ calibration concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the calibrated meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations.

5000|$|Scaling up {{a process}} {{involves}} {{using data from}} an experimental-scale operation (model or pilot plant) {{for the design of}} a large (scaled-up) unit, of commercial size. Scaling up is a crucial part of commercializing a process. For example, insulin produced by genetically modified Escherichia coli bacteria was initialized on a lab-scale, but to be made commercially viable had to be scaled up to an industrial level. In order to achieve this scale-up a lot of lab data had to be used to design commercial sized units. For example, one of the steps in insulin production involves the crystallization of high purity glargin insulin. In order to achieve this process on a large scale we want to keep the Power/Volume ratio of both the lab-scale and large-scale crystallizers the same in order to achieve homogeneous mixing.

50|$|To {{determine}} whether isometry or allometry is present, an expected relationship between variables {{needs to be}} determined to compare data to. This is important in determining if the scaling relationship in a dataset deviates from an expected relationship (such as those that follow isometry). The use of tools such as dimensional analysis is very helpful in determining expected slope. This ‘expected’ slope, as it is known, is essential for detecting allometry because scaling variables are comparisons to other things. Saying that mass scales with a slope of 5 in relation to length doesn’t have much meaning unless knowing the isometric slope is 3, meaning in this case, the mass is increasing extremely fast. For example, different sized frogs {{should be able to}} jump the same distance according to the <b>geometric</b> <b>similarity</b> model proposed by Hill 1950 and interpreted by Wilson 2000, but in actuality larger frogs do jump longer distances.

5000|$|Three-dimensionality in {{turbomachine}} increases {{complexity in}} flow field so, determination of losses becomes difficult unlike two-dimensional losses where equation complexity is little. Three-dimensionality includes large pressure gradients in every direction, design/curvature of blade, shock wave, heat transfer, cavitation and viscous effects, which generates secondary flow, vortices, tip leakage vortices and other losses. Viscous effects in turbomachinery causes blockage to the flow by formation of viscous layers around blade profile which effect pressure rise/fall and reduce effective area of flow field. Interaction between these losses in rotor increase instability and decreases in efficiency of turbomachinery. In calculation of three-dimensional losses every parameter comes into picture of flow path like axial spacing between vane and blade rows, end wall curvature, radial distribution of pressure gradient, hup/tip ratio, dihedral, lean, tip clearance, flare, aspect ratio, skew, sweep, platform cooling holes, surface roughness, off take bleeds.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel feature {{matching}} algorithm that systematically utilizes the geometric properties of {{features such as}} position, scale, and orientation, {{in addition to the}} conventional descriptor vectors. In challenging scenes with the presence of repetitive patterns or with a large viewpoint change, it is hard to find the correct correspondences using feature descriptors only, since the descriptor distances of the correct matches may not be the least among the candidates due to appearance changes. Assuming that the layout of the nearby features does not changed much, we propose the bidirectional transfer measure to gauge the geometric consistency of a pair of feature correspondences. The feature matching problem is formulated as a Markov random field (MRF) which uses descriptor distances and relative <b>geometric</b> <b>similarities</b> together. The unmatched features are explicitly modeled in the MRF to minimize its negative impact. For speed and stability, instead of solving the MRF on the entire features at once, we start with a small set of confident feature matches, and then progressively search the candidates in nearby features and expand the MRF with them. Experimental comparisons show that the proposed algorithm finds better feature correspondences, i. e. more matches with higher inlier ratio, in many challenging scenes with much lower computational cost than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

The model simulates a system that {{consists}} of a 13 -protofilament microtubule with “five-start” helical structure and a motor protein-coated bead that moves along one of the protofilaments of the microtubule, as in in vitro experiments. The microtubule is simulated using the lateral cap model, with substantial generalizations. For the new terminal configurations {{in the presence of}} the bead, rate constants for association and dissociation events of tubulin molecules are calculated by exploring the <b>geometric</b> <b>similarities</b> between different patterns of terminal configurations and by decomposing complex patterns into simpler patterns whose corresponding rate constants are known. In comparison with a previous model, in which simplifications are made about the structure of the microtubule and in which the microtubule can only depolymerize, the detailed structure of the microtubule is taken into account in the present model. Furthermore, the microtubule can be either polymerizing or depolymerizing. Force-velocity curves are obtained for both zero and non-zero tubulin guanosine 5 ′-triphosphate (GTP) concentrations. By analyzing the trajectory of the bead under different parameters, the condition for “run and pause” is analyzed, and the time scale of “run” and “pause” is found to be different for different motor proteins.
