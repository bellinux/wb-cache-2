For example, a program that implements a patented invention can be written in many available programming languages, using different function names and variable names and performing operations in different sequences. There are so many combinations of ways to implement inventions in software {{that even the most}} powerful modern computers cannot consider all combinations of code that might infringe a patent. This work is still left to human experts using their knowledge and experience, but it is a problem that many in software forensics are trying to automate by finding an algorithm or simplifying process.|$|E
50|$|With only 10 Articles, the Rules {{have the}} virtue of brevity, but they have several faults. When, after 44 years of experience, the 1924 Rules were updated with a single minor amendment, they still covered only {{carriage}} wholly by sea (thereby ignoring multi-modal transport), and they barely acknowledged the container revolution of the 1950s. Also, the United Nations body UNCTAD felt that the Rules had actually diluted the protection to shippers once provided by English common law, and proposed instead the more modern Hamburg Rules of 1978. These were embraced by many developing countries, but largely ignored by ship-operating nations. The modern Rotterdam Rules, with some 96 articles, have far more scope and cover multi-modal transport; but these Rules remain far from <b>general</b> <b>implementation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} decision is {{in the choice of}} the base of arithmetic, here ten. There are many considerations. The scratchpad variable [...] must be able to hold the result of a single-digit multiply plus the carry from the prior digit's multiply. In base ten, a sixteen-bit integer is certainly adequate as it allows up to 32767. However, this example cheats, in that the value of [...] is not itself limited to a single digit. This has the consequence that the method will fail for [...] or so. In a more <b>general</b> <b>implementation,</b> [...] would also use a multi-digit representation. A second consequence of the shortcut is that after the multi-digit multiply has been completed, the last value of carry may need to be carried into multiple higher-order digits, not just one.|$|E

40|$|Abstract | This paper {{demonstrates}} that, in <b>general,</b> <b>implementations</b> of circuit reduction {{methods can}} produce unstable and non-passive models even when such outcomes are theoretically {{proven to be}} impossible. The reason for this apparent contradiction is the numeric roundo inherent inany nite-precision computer implementation. This paper introduces a new variant of the symmetric, multiport, Pade via Lanczos algorithm (SyMPVL) that, even in practice, is guaranteed to produce stable and passive models for all the circuits characterized by pairs of symmetric, positive semide nite matrices. The algorithm is based by a new band Lanczos process with coupled recurrences. A number of circuit examples are used to illustrate the results...|$|R
