Our manufacturer class was, of course, originally an insurgent class. It was a class of distended craftsmen. It had the craftsman's natural enterprise and natural radicalism. As soon as it prospered and sent its boys to Oxford it was lost. Our manufacturing class was assimilated in no time to the conservative classes, whose education {{has always had a}} mandarin quality--very, very little of it, and very cold and choice. In America you have so far had no real conservative class at all. Fortunate continent! You cast out your Tories, and you were left with nothing but Whigs and Radicals. But our peculiar bad luck has been to get a sort of revolutionary who is a Tory mandarin too. Ruskin and Morris, for example, were as reactionary and anti-scientific as the dukes and the bishops. Machine haters. Science haters. Rule of Thumbites to the bone. So are our current Socialists. They've filled this country with the idea that the ideal automobile ought to be made entirely by the hand labour of traditional craftsmen, quite individually, out of beaten copper, wrought iron and seasoned oak. All this electric-starter business and this electric lighting outfit I have here, is perfectly hateful to the English mind.... It isn't that we are simply backward in these things, we are antagonistic. The British mind has never really tolerated electricity; at least, not that sort of electricity that runs through wires. Too slippery and glib for it. Associates it with Italians and fluency generally, with Volta, Galvani, Marconi and so on. The proper British electricity is that high-grade useless long-sparking stuff you get by turning round a glass machine; stuff we used to call <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity.</b> Keep it in Leyden jars.... At Claverings here they still refuse to have electric bells. There was a row when the Solomonsons, who were tenants here for a time, tried to put them in...." ...|$|E
50|$|The era of {{galvanic}} or voltaic electricity {{represented a}} revolutionary {{break from the}} historical focus on <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity.</b> Alessandro Volta discovered that chemical reactions {{could be used to}} create positively charged anodes and negatively charged cathodes. When a conductor was attached between these, the difference in the electrical potential (also known as voltage) drove a current between them through the conductor. The potential difference between two points is measured in units of volts in recognition of Voltas work.|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} of {{pulverized coal}} {{with a mixture}} of pure oxygen and recirculated flue gases (CO 2, H 2 O) offers a big potential for economic CO 2 capture and storage. The reason for this is the absence of nitrogen in the flue gases and the fact that pure CO 2 comes out of the chimney. Oxy-coal combustion is currently at the forefront of EC-supported research as, for instance, China opens a new coal fired power plant every two weeks. The KULeuven is partner in a big EU project on oxy-coal and our task is to determine the limits of save operation on the cold side. Cold side means, from the mills that pulverize the coal to the burner, including the transport of the coal with the oxy-flue-gas mixture. Several mechanisms exist at which the diluted coal-O 2 mixture could ignite prematurely. Static <b>electricity,</b> <b>frictional</b> heating and, most importantly, the radiation from the flame to the supply duct upstream of the burner. This thesis is on the safety aspects on the cold side of a coal fired power plant. The objective is to determine, based upon existing literature data, the limits on stoichiometry of coal/O 2 mixtures for save operation. If the literature data are insufficient, new experiments togethe...|$|R
5000|$|Up to {{the time}} of Franklins {{historic}} kite experiment, the identity of the electricity developed by rubbing and by electrostatic machines (<b>frictional</b> <b>electricity)</b> with lightning had not been generally established. Dr. Wall, Abbot Nollet, Hauksbee, Stephen Gray and John Henry Winkler had indeed suggested the resemblance between the phenomena of [...] "electricity" [...] and [...] "lightning", Gray having intimated that they only differed in degree. It was doubtless Franklin, however, who first proposed tests to determine the sameness of the phenomena. In a letter to Peter Comlinson of London, on 19 October 1752, Franklin, referring to his kite experiment, wrote, [...] "At this key the phial (Leyden jar) may be charged; and from the electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all the other electric experiments be formed which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning be completely demonstrated." [...] On 10 May 1742 Thomas-François Dalibard, at Marley (near Paris), using a vertical iron rod 40 feet long, obtained results corresponding to those recorded by Franklin and somewhat prior to the date of Franklins experiment. Franklins important demonstration of the sameness of <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity</b> and lightning doubtless added zest to the efforts of the many experimenters in this field in {{the last half of the}} 18th century, to advance the progress of the science.|$|E
5000|$|His work on {{lightning}} conductors for ships gained him {{a government}} annuity of £300 [...] "in consideration of {{services in the}} cultivation of science", and to overcome continued objections to his proposals he published an 1843 work on Thunderstorms, as well as contributing papers to The Nautical Magazine on lightning damage. He was knighted in 1847 after the system had been adopted and shown successful, and was given a grant of £5,000. Though his continued research did not find new discoveries, his manuals of Electricity, Galvanism and Magnetism were published between 1848 and 1856 and went through several editions. When he died in Plymouth on 22 January 1867 he had a Treatise on <b>Frictional</b> <b>Electricity</b> in preparation, and it was published later that year.|$|E
50|$|Through the {{experiments}} of William Watson and others proving that electricity could be transmitted to a distance, {{the idea of}} making practical use of this phenomenon began, around 1753, to engross the minds of inquisitive people. To this end, suggestions as to the employment of electricity in the transmission of intelligence were made. The first of the methods devised for this purpose was probably that of Georges Lesage in 1774. This method consisted of 24 wires, insulated from one another and each having had a pith ball connected to its distant end. Each wire represented a letter of the alphabet. To send a message, a desired wire was charged momentarily with electricity from an electric machine, whereupon the pith ball connected to that wire would fly out. Other methods of telegraphing in which <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity</b> was employed were also tried, some of which are described in the history on the telegraph.|$|E
5000|$|Somewhat {{important}} to note, {{it was not}} until many years after the discovery of the voltaic pile that the sameness of annual and <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity</b> with voltaic electricity was clearly recognized and demonstrated. Thus as late as January 1833 we find Faraday writing in a paper on the electricity of the electric ray. [...] "After an examination of the experiments of Walsh, Ingenhousz, Henry Cavendish, Sir H. Davy, and Dr. Davy, no doubt remains on my mind as to the identity of the electricity of the torpedo with common (frictional) and voltaic electricity; and I presume that so little will remain on the mind of others as to justify my refraining from entering at length into the philosophical proof of that identity. The doubts raised by Sir Humphry Davy have been removed by his brother, Dr. Davy; the results of the latter being the reverse of those of the former. ... The general conclusion which must, I think, be drawn from this collection of facts (a table showing the similarity, of properties of the diversely named electricities) is, that electricity, whatever may be its source, is identical in its nature." ...|$|E

To implement an intelligent CPS, sensors are being applied to various fields such as measuring instruments, automobiles, mobile devices, home appliances, medical devices, and defense/security devices. In particular, as the interaction between humans and devices increases, the need for smart sensors that combine data-processing, decision-making, and communication functions with sensing functions 1 are also rising. Therefore, we need to increasingly invest in devices for precise sensing, components that can generate the power of a sensor by themselves (piezoelectric elements, thermoelements, nanogenerators using <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity),</b> and embedded software.|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} H 2 and O 2 evolutions can {{be achieved}} by just stirring a powder of a p-type semiconductor, such as Cu 2 O, NiO, Co 3 O 4 or Fe 3 O 4 in distilled water at room temperature. Frictional rubbing of the stirring rod onto the bottom of the glass vessel is an important condition. The friction between the stirring rod and the glass surface generates an electrostatic field to make a field emission of positive holes from the semiconductor-powder, which is fixed in the micro crack spaces on the glass surface. The emitted positive holes react with water molecules to evolve O 2 and protons, which go to the glass surface and combine with the electrons there to evolve H 2. The energy conversion mechanism, the generation of <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity,</b> the effect of the water, the carrier-tunnelling emission probability, the hopping conduction in the semiconductor, and the effects of fluid dynamics, are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that the {{phenomenon}} {{which led to the}} discovery of electric charges, namely the production of electricity by friction, is even now one of the least investigated and least under-stood fields of physics. We know practically nothing about the exact mechanism producing <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity.</b> We know, however, that friction is not at all required to produce these charges. The mere contact of two materials gives rise to a potential difference. Friction does not create, but only increases, these potentials. Con-tact potentials exist on every boundary between two different phases, independent of whether one or both phases are electric conductors or insula-tors. The two phases need not even be chemical-ly different, they may only differ in temperature or in cristallographie orientation. According to the laws of electrostatics a po-tential drop in a surface is always connected with the existence of an electric double layer. A po-tential drop creates an electric field, and, accord-ing to Gauss's law, electric lines of force can only originate from positive electric charges, and they can only disappear at the seat of negative charges. Hence in Fig. la we must have positive charges where the potential begins to drop, and negative charges where the potential gradient vanishes. Mathematically this relation between potential r and charge density O is expressed by Poisson's equation d 2 r 4,rp [...] , (i) dx 2 D where x is the normal distance to the surface and D the dielectric onstant.

40|$|FINAL REPORT ON : NON-LINEAR WAVES IN CONTINUOUS MEDIA Doe DE FG 03 - 87 ER 13686 (001312 - 001) Submitted January 10, 2006 by Seth J. Putterman 310 - 8252269 Physics Department University of California Los Angeles, CA 90095 puherman@ritva. physics. ucla. edu NON-LINEAR WAVES IN CONTINUOUS MEDIA I {{am happy}} to report that this project {{has been a big}} success. For over 10 years the DOE [Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering] has funded our {{research}} program on the overarching theme of spontaneous energy focusing phenomena. These effects occur when a nonlinear macroscopic system is excited so as to drive it far from equilibrium. The subsequent relaxation to equilibrium does not occur smoothly but instead is accompanied by the formation of structured domains where the energy density is highly concentrated. A signature example is picosecond sonoluminescence [1] wherein a smooth sound wave has its energy density focused by 12 orders of magnitude to generate a clock-like string of picosecond flashes of ultraviolet light. Our earlier work on solitons [2] demonstrated how uniform surface waves break up into stable localized structures. Our experimental work on turbulence produced photos of localized structures lying many standard deviations outside the range of gaussian statistics[3]. This effect is referred to as intermittency. Our recent work on friction finds its motivation in those theories of sonoluminescence which invoke <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity.</b> In its most common form this is the generation of a spark when we touch a doorknob after walking over a carpet. Our reading of the literature on this subject indicated that <b>frictional</b> <b>electricity</b> like sonoluminescence is not understood. So to probe triboelectrification we set up a modern version of an experiment performed by Bernoulli in 1700. Here sparking is caused by the rubbing of glass against mercury. We indeed observed flashes of light which were accompanied by events of stick-slip friction at the interface between the mercury and glass. Furthermore, we found that a very slow relative motion of 1 mm/second created repetitive macroscopic picosecond discharges wherein electrons are accelerated to at least 1 % of the speed of light[4]. Following up on the Bernoulli-Picard effect we wondered if electrification played a role in ordinary friction and if friction itself might be another example of an energy focusing effect. Indeed we found that dry friction is due to the spontaneous formation of atomic/molecular bonds at the interface of two materials brought into contact. Bond formation provides for the stick in stick-slip friction. When the external force is great enough to rupture the bonds the interface slips. Thus the averaged normal force applied to an interface is focused down to the level of individual bonds where quantum mechanics comes into play in determining the properties of friction in macroscopic systems[5, 6, 7]. A typical applied stress is about 1 bar whereas the focused stress at the bonds which spontaneously form at the interface is about 1 Megabar. This stress is so great that it locally distorts the interface and leads to spot cold welding between surfaces in contact. And as these cold welds grow the change in stiffness of the junction displays quantum jumps which we have observed even when the bodies in contact have macroscopic dimensions [7]. The intellectual thrust for all the advances mentioned above has been seeded by the Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering. We believe that our efforts have generated favorable science based publicity for Basic Energy Science. The Principal Investigator has been invited to give colloquia at each of the top 20 universities at least once. The New York Times has written 3 science articles based on our effort on sonoluminescence and the mercury light. Nature has written a news-story about our work on solitons [8] and more recently a news-story about our work on cold welding [9]. Our recent success in scaling up sonoluminescence to pulses with a peak power of 1 / 2 Watt [10] has just been reported by Physics Today[11], and a presentation to the Acoustical Society of America [12] about megakelvin sonoluminescing bubbles has been picked up by Business Week [13].
