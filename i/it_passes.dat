5|$|Following the interchange, US30 enters Waterford Township, as <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> {{near the}} {{community}} of Atco. The road turns south as <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> Atco Lake and continues into more wooded areas with some development, eventually heading south-southeast again. New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line runs a short distance to the northeast of the route at this point. US30 continues through Chesilhurst before it enters Winslow Township. Here, the route intersects CR536 and forms a short concurrency with that route before it heads to the east. From this point, the road continues into a mix of woodland, farmland, and development. US30 intersects Route143 and passes over the Atlantic City Line as it turns southeast. The road makes another turn to the south as it crosses CR723.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
