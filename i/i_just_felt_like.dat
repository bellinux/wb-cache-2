500|$|During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles {{tried to}} work out a new contract. Several times {{throughout}} the season, Ripken endured batting slumps. He said after the season, [...] "I don't like to make excuses for the fact that I wasn't hitting, but I was distracted... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether that was right or wrong, it was bothering me." [...] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' fans late in the season. He finished the year batting [...]251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBI (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.|$|E

What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E

In California, Swank enrolled in South Pasadena High School, later dropping out because of her ADHD and lack of interest. She described her time at South Pasadena High School, [...] "I felt like such an outsider. I didn't feel like I fit in. I didn't belong in any way. I didn't even feel like the teachers wanted me there. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I wasn't seen or understood." [...] She explained that she became an actor because she felt an outsider, [...] "As a kid I felt that I belonged only when I read a book or saw a movie, and could get involved with a character.

2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s the day I was born, and each year, I evolve and change with time. It also has {{a whole new meaning}} to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there and I just think it best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title was nothing but a homage, “I need for everybody to know that, if it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for me. She was the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E

She has characterised [...] "Haters" [...] as [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] and said people would {{know what it is}} about when they heard it, and it {{attracted}} substantial publicity when rumors circulated that it was about actress Lindsay Lohan, with whom Duff was alleged to have been feuding. The Scoop, a gossip section of the website MSNBC, quoted an insider who had said, [...] "Hilary thinks that Lindsay has been directing negativity at her for too long." [...] Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying she did not know Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it she was feeling she had to openly discuss her personal life because [...] "people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. They love to read what's coming out next on Page Six [...] and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was appropriate."

I'm actually very thankful that it is the tiny little small town that it IS, because it made me wanna get the heck OUTTA there! You know, from a very young age I always knew that I wanted to go somewhere else!

5000|$|Although Moorer had {{initially}} {{claimed that the}} score consisted of about 20,000 lines of code, he subsequently corrected the statement and elaborated: The original 30-year-old C program is 325 lines, and the “patch” file for the synthesizer was 298 more lines. <b>I</b> guess it <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> 20,000 lines when I did it.Given that it was written and debugged in 4 days, I can’t claim the programming chops to make 20,000 lines of working code that quickly. But, to synthesize it in real time, in 1983, took 2 years to design and build a 19” rack full of digital hardware and 200,000 lines of system code to run the synthesizer. All that was already done, so I was building on a large foundation of audio processing horsepower, both hardware and software. Consequently, a mere 325 lines of C code and 298 lines of audio patching setup for the 30 voices was enough to invoke the audio horsepower to make the piece.|$|R

His Concert for Bangladesh aid project had then united the couple, according to their friend Chris O'Dell, who recalls Harrison as [...] "attentive and affectionate" [...] towards Boyd while planning the concerts that summer. The project's subsequent business and legal issues became a source of frustration for Harrison, as {{he spent much of}} 1972 negotiating with government departments for the release of the funds raised for the refugees. In February 1972, Harrison and Boyd were injured in an automobile accident in England, after which, author Alan Clayson writes, [...] "her recovery was impaired by George's pounding on a drum-kit that he'd set up in the next room." ...|$|R
