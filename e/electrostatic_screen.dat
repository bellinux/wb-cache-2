The first true screen-grid valve, with a screen grid designed for this purpose, was patented by Hiroshi Ando in 1919, and the first practical versions were built by N. H.

The coaxial format was developed during World War II for use in radar. It was originally constructed from rigid copper pipes, but the usual form today is a flexible cable with a braided screen. The advantages of coax are a theoretically perfect <b>electrostatic</b> <b>screen</b> and highly predictable transmission parameters. The latter {{is a result of}} the fixed geometry of the format which leads to a precision not found with loose wires. Open wire systems are also affected by nearby objects altering the field pattern around the conductor. Coax does not suffer from this since the field is entirely contained within the cable due to the surrounding screen.|$|E

Martian dust can be transported and deposited by Aeolian processes, including "Dust Devils". Due to the ultra high vacuum (10 e- 12 Torr), transport of dust on the Moon is solely a result of collision/ballistic motion. Dust obscuration of solar cells {{is one of the}} primary factors limiting the duration of Martian missions, including the Mars Exploration Rovers. Dust contamination in vacuum seals is one of the primarily factors that limited lunar excursions during the Apollo missions. Controlled transportation of dust on Mars and the Moon is important for many reasons, including both contamination mitigation and in situ resource utilization (ISRU). Since both the monopole and dipole electrostatic moments result in non-trivial forces on particles in an electrostatic field, dust particles, whether charged or not, can be transported by electrostatic fields. In the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>screen,</b> alternating waveforms of voltage applied to patterned grids of electrodes will transport dust. The authors will show that the canonical methods for transporting dust via <b>electrostatic</b> <b>screen</b> can be readily applied to transport of Martian and Lunar regolith. Experiments have been performed in ambient, low humidity, Martian, and Lunar conditions. Screen parameters have been examined for application to each regolith, such as grid spacing, trace width, grid voltage, pulse pattern, pulse frequency, and coating type.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} nature of the counterion on the thermodynamics of aggregation of an ionic perfluorosurfactant on poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) of varying molecular weight in aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of micellization and aggregation on PEG of lithium perfluorooctanoate (LiPFO) were investigated at 298. 15 K by microcalorimetry, electrical conductivity, and viscosity. They were then compared with the same properties measured for the CsPFO/PEG system. As in the latter system, when wrapping around LiPFO micellar clusters the PEG polymers undergo a conformational change and form a compact complex. This complex reaches a constant thermodynamic behaviour for molecular weights larger than ∼ 2400 Da, which nicely matches the value ∼ 2600 Da found for CsPFO-PEG aggregates. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>screen</b> provided by the polymer chain practically cancels the differences in the thermodynamic properties of the free micelles.

40|$|Based on {{preliminary}} voltammetric investigations at unmodified {{and modified}} electrodes in aqueous solutions buffered at different pHs, a profitable thin layer dual-electrode detector {{was developed for}} the selective and simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide present in the same samples. It consists of a small thickness (0. 1 mm) cell, used as a detector for a flow injection system, in which a glassy carbon (GC) and a polyeugenol coated Pt electrode are encased. The GC electrode is selective for AA, thanks to the potential applied (0. 3 V vs. Ag/AgCl,Cl- sat), while H 2 O 2 alone can be oxidized at the Pt electrode (0. 75 V), thanks to the size selectivity and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>screen</b> properties displayed by the polyeugenol coating layer which prevents oxidation of ascorbate anions. Repeatable sharp peaks (± 4. 5 %) were detected for both analytes over wide linear ranges (0. 005 - 1. 000 mM) and detection limits of about 10 - 6 M (176 ppb) and 5 × 10 - 7 M (16 ppb) were inferred for AA and H 2 O 2 respectively.

40|$|We {{have used}} atomistic {{simulations}} {{to study the}} role of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>screening</b> and charge correlation effects in self-assembly processes of ionic surfactants into micelles. Specifically, we employed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the critical micelle concentration (cmc), aggregation number, and micellar shape {{in the presence of}} explicit sodium chloride (NaCl). The two systems investigated are cationic dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactants. Our explicit-salt results, obtained from a previously developed potential model with no further adjustment of its parameters, are in good agreement with experimental data for structural and thermodynamic micellar properties. We illustrate the importance of ion correlation effects by comparing these results with a Yukawa-type surfactant model that incorporates <b>electrostatic</b> <b>screening</b> implicitly. While the effect of salt on the cmc is well-reproduced even with the implicit Yukawa model, the aggregate size predictions deviate significantly from experimental observations at low salt concentrations. We attribute this discrepancy to the neglect of ion correlations in the implicit-salt model. At higher salt concentrations, we find reasonable agreement of the Yukawa model with experimental data.

The self-consistent field equations for the configurational probability of the chain are solved numerically for different parameter values of the system including the surface and polymer charge density, the amount of adsorption and the Debye-Hückel screening length. The effect of intramolecular long range Coulombic forces on the segment density profile is examined. By coupling the numerical results with simple thermodynamic arguments, we reach exact analytical expressions for the layer thickness and define critical adsorption conditions.
