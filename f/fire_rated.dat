25|$|The {{original}} {{nursing home}} complex was a 1,906sqft(177m²) brick building {{consisting of two}} floors. In 1959, a second building {{was added to the}} rear which includes a garden. The addition increased the size of the complex to 5,179sqft(481m²). The addition was built with precast concrete floor and roof slabs connected to steel beams and columns. In 1966, the brick building was removed and was replaced by a three story building; at the same time, a third floor was added to the original building constructed in 1959. Overall, the second addition expanded the complex to 9,466sqft(879m²). In 1973, a third building was added with a 10ft(3m) corridor connecting to the existing building complex. The third building also consisted of three floors and had a floor area of 3,613sqft(336m²). The construction of the third building, consisted of precast concrete floor slabs, metal roof deck on steel bar joists. All of the buildings were covered with a 5/8inch <b>fire</b> <b>rated</b> plasterboard.|$|E

40|$|In most {{skeletal}} muscles, {{force is}} generated {{by a combination of}} motor unit (MU) recruitment and increases in the <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of previously active MUs. Two contrasting patterns of <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> organization have been reported. In the first pattern, the earliest recruited MUs reach the highest <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> as force is increased, and later recruited MUs <b>fire</b> at lower <b>rates.</b> When <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of multiple MUs are superimposed, these rate trajectories form a concentric layered profile termed ‘onion skin’. In the second pattern, called ‘reverse onion skin’, later recruited MUs reach higher <b>firing</b> <b>rates,</b> and crossing of <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> trajectories for recorded MUs is common (although such trajectories are assembled routinely from different trials). Our present study examined the <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> organization of concurrently active MUs of the first dorsal interosseous muscle during serial, step-like increases in isometric abduction forces. We used a surface sensor array coupled with MU discrimination algorithms to characterize MU firing patterns. Our objective was to determine whether ‘onion skin’ profiles are contingent upon the force trajectory of the motor task, examined here using step-like increases of force output, and also whether they are manifested at different force levels. Our results revealed that the overall ‘onion skin’ <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> profile was retained as the force level increased with each force step up to 15 % MVC. However, the distribution of <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> across MUs was compressed with increasing force, and overlapping <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of units were observed. This rate compression was largely due to rate saturation of the relatively high frequency discharging MUs. Our results reflect flexible firing patterns across MUs at different levels of excitation drive. It is also evident that many units did not follow all the step increases consistently. This failure to track <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> increases at higher forces could be due to an intrinsically mediated saturation of firing rat...|$|R
30|$|Our {{results have}} special {{implications}} for neuronal integrators that maintain a steady <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> through recurrent excitation. We {{have found that}} the precise additive and multiplicative tuning necessary to maintain the delicate balance of excitatory feedback can be performed by a dual control system within the framework we study here if the target <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> are set far enough apart to achieve a large characteristic <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> variance. The integrator maintained by dual homeostasis is robust to variation of its target <b>firing</b> <b>rates.</b> This occurs because the circuit is best able to achieve a large <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> variance when it is tuned to eliminate any bias toward a particular <b>firing</b> <b>rate,</b> exactly the condition necessary for integration.

40|$|Changes in the EMG power {{spectrum}} during static fatiguing contractions are often attributed {{to changes in}} muscle fibre action potential conduction velocity. Mathematical models of the EMG {{power spectrum}}, which have been empirically confirmed, predict that under certain conditions a distinct maximum occurs in the low-frequency part of the spectrum, indicating the dominant <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of the motor units. The present study investigated the influence of this <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peak on the spectral changes during a static fatiguing contraction at 50 % of maximum EMG amplitude in the frontalis and corrugator supercilii muscles. An exponential decrease of the median frequency (MF) of the EMG power spectrum was observed when the <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peak was absent. When the <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peak was present, an exaggerated decrease of MF {{in the beginning of}} the contraction was found, which was associated with an increase in <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peak magnitude. In later stages of the contraction, a partial recovery of MF occurred, concomitant with a decrease in <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peak magnitude. The influence of the <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peak on MF was also investigated during nonfatiguing contractions of the frontalis muscle at 20, 40, 60, and 80 % of maximum EMG amplitude. A curvilinear relationship between MF and contraction strength was found, whether <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peaks were present or absent. The presence of <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peaks, however, was associated with a decrease in MF which was inversely related to contraction strength, due to the inverse relationship between <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> peak magnitude and contraction strength...|$|R

40|$|How are <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> in a spiking network {{related to}} neural input, {{connectivity}} and network function? This {{is an important}} problem because <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> are a key measure of network activity, in both the study of neural computation and neural network dynamics. However, {{it is a difficult}} problem, because the spiking mech-anism of individual neurons is highly non-linear, and these individual neurons interact strongly through connectivity. We develop a new technique for calculat-ing <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> in optimal balanced networks. These are particularly interesting networks because they provide an optimal spike-based signal representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. We can calculate <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> by treating balanced network dynamics as an algorithm for optimising signal representation. We identify this algorithm and then calculate <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> by finding the solution to the algorithm. Our <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> calculation relates network <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> directly to network input, connectivity and function.
