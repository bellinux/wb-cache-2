Daughter Edith Lennon was born that year and then Charles (21 November 1918 – 26 May 2002). The Lennons moved back to Toxteth Park, and Jack died in 1921, at 57 Copperfield Street. He was buried on 6th August 1921 at Allerton Cemetery. His grave, number 206 in Roman Catholic section 4, is an unmarked public grave. Polly could not read or write, but {{was reported to be}} very humorous and supposedly had psychic abilities. After Jack died, Polly did not have enough money to keep the whole Lennon family together, so she placed two of her children, Alf and Edith, in the Blue Coat School Orphanage. It was situated <b>just</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner from Newcastle Road (where Julia Stanley lived). Polly died on 30 January 1949.|$|E

When the Manitoba Legislature was built, it was expected that Manitoba would have a population of 3 million quite soon. <b>Just</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> time of World War I, the quickly growing city began to cool down as the large amounts of money were no longer invested to the same degree as before the war.

25|$|With the semi {{final week}} <b>just</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner, Week 13 saw some close matches {{including}} the opener between the Highlanders and the Hurricanes at the cake tin.

Nick Evans {{needed to get the}} kick over to win the game but was unsuccessful allowing the Hurricanes to win the game lucky to not have the same situation when the Hurricanes lost to the Force in week 6. The force continued their up and down season by comfortably beating the cheetahs. The Waratahs narrowly lost going down to the chiefs. The Brumbies pulled an upset win over the Crusaders to keep their semi final hopes alive. The Sharks dominated the lions to make sure they would at least get a home semi final. The Blues lost their third game in a row going down to the Bulls which slimmed the chances of the Blues securing a semi final spot and helped the Bulls secure a semi final spot.

25|$|At about 07:50 the {{southern}} outskirts of Haderslev, a Danish 37mm anti-tank gun {{with a crew}} of five attacked the approaching armour. Two tanks lined up adjacent {{to one another and}} opened fire. The Danes landed all three of their shots -one in a tank's tracks- but two of the gun crew were killed and the rest wounded. One tank then drove over the gun. <b>Just</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bend the wagon roadblock on Sønderbro Street covered by two 20mm cannon and a machine gun put up resistance. The Germans laid down heavy fire and a Danish soldier was killed and two more wounded, but the Germans were effectively pinned down. The fighting continued for ten more minutes until the order to surrender was received from Copenhagen by telephone. The Germans were then allowed to proceed into the town of Haderslev, but the Danish garrison stationed there had not received the order to surrender and fired on the Germans. Two German tanks and a motorcycle proceeded unsuspecting towards the barracks, which were defended by the anti-tank unit from Lundtoftbjerg. They opened fire, killing the motorcyclist and blowing the tracks off one tank, sending it crashing into a house. However, the Danish garrison capitulated at 08:15 when the order to surrender from Copenhagen finally came through. One Danish soldier was killed while defending the barracks; three Danish civilians were killed in the crossfire.|$|E

500|$|Etruscan cities, {{which often}} sat on hill-tops, became walled from about the 8th century, first in mud-brick, then often in stone.

500|$|It's {{closing time}} at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a last-minute call from a customer. Just as {{he is about to}} tell them that the {{restaurant}} is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches the phone from Squidward's hands. The customer wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, an order Mr. Krabs happily accepts knowing he could get extra money. Squidward protests this by saying the restaurant doesn't serve pizza nor do they do deliveries, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it. After SpongeBob does a few [...] "safety checks" [...] of the delivery boat, Squidward forces him to drive. However, SpongeBob cannot drive as he is still in boating school, but Squidward insists saying [...] "it's <b>just</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner".

500|$|The engine's nozzle is [...] {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of [...] at its throat and [...] at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, {{referred to as a}} de Laval nozzle. The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77.5:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure <b>just</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around [...] or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed stainless steel tube wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} <b>just</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner, {{and it was}} a big one. The 1990 Xerox Challenge was {{organised}} by Robin Judkins as one of the sporting events to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. It was by far the hardest; the 22-day multi-sport event covered the length of the country—from Cape Reinga to Bluff—and included road cycling, kayaking, running, and mountain biking. There were 67 competitors, including 6 women, who embarked on the [...] challenge. While Lynch was the favourite for the women, she soon developed severe tendonitis and the race doctor threatened to pull her from the race if she refused to take an anti-inflammatory. She had no option but to take the medication if she wanted to remain in the race, and promptly ended up in Wellington Hospital from the reaction to the medication. Fortunately for her, the fellow competitors were stuck in nearby Makara Beach, waiting for the weather in Cook Strait to settle enough to enable the kayak section. After two days, organisers abandoned the plan for the kayak section and Lynch was well enough to rejoin the race. The event featured every night on prime time TV {{and by the end of}} it, the two winners had become household names in New Zealand: Lynch, and Steve Gurney. It was Lynch's hardest race over her entire career and contributes to her being regarded as a [...] "legend" [...] of the New Zealand mountain bikers.|$|E
