5|$|In February 1959, Hawker had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design work to the company's Experimental <b>Design</b> <b>Office</b> at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for {{the completion of a}} pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of maximum effort to complete the development of the P.1127.|$|E

5|$|As {{the series}} {{production}} of the PS-2 gun was delayed, the Main Artillery Agency of the RKKA gave preference to a new gun. It {{was developed by the}} Artillery <b>Design</b> <b>Office</b> of the Bolshevik Factory, constructed from parts taken from the previously purchased German 37mm anti-tank gun developed by Rheinmetall and the PS-2 gun. This system was successfully tested and the Artillery Factory No. 8 named after M. Kalinin started its series production under the designator B-3 (5K). The B-3 gun had less recoil and a smaller breech compared to the PS-2, so it could be easily mounted in the normal machine gun turret of the T-26. The first twin-turreted T-26 was armed with a B-3 gun in the right turret in late 1931. Unfortunately, series {{production of the}} B-3 gun proceeded slowly due to poor production standards (none of 225 guns produced in 1931 were accepted by army representatives; it took until 1933 to complete the original order for 300 guns placed in August 1931). Completed B-3 guns were mounted on BT-2 light tanks after mid-1932. This meant that twin-turreted T-26 tanks continued to be equipped with old 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) guns. As production of the PS-1 gun had ended, some guns were taken from military supply depots and scrapped MS-1(T-18) tanks.|$|E

25|$|There was an {{interruption}} {{in design}} {{due to the}} necessity of moving the Supermarine <b>design</b> <b>office,</b> after {{the bombing of the}} facility at Woolston. Further delays were caused by the extensive wind tunnel testing that was needed and the change from a Rolls-Royce Merlin to the more powerful Rolls-Royce Griffon. Also, the design specification was changed in 1944 to a new requirement, S.14/44 (later S.14/44/2) - the role of the aircraft being changed from ship-based reconnaissance and gunnery spotting to land-based Air-sea rescue. This change removed the four-gun turret the design had featured.|$|E

At this point, work was undertaken by a team of 45 draughtsmen at Hawker's wartime experimental <b>design</b> <b>office</b> at Claremont, Esher to convert the proposal into technical schematics from which to commence manufacture. In March 1941, the Air Ministry issued specification F.10/41 that had been written to fit the aircraft.

While working for Slingsby Sailplanes from 1939–1942, he met his future wife, Joan, who had worked in the Slingsby <b>Design</b> <b>Office</b> as a technical artist. Frost designed the Slingsby Hengist, a troop-carrying glider to be used for the Normandy landings. It was not a success and only a few were built but it included an ingenious innovation: the use of a rubber bag undercarriage.|$|E

President Kennedy {{was so impressed with}} his work, he suggested that the entire Federal Government needed his make-over and suggested that he start with the Coast Guard. First used and placed into official usage as of April 6, 1967, it consists of a narrow blue stripe, a narrow white stripe between, and a broad CG red bar with the Coast Guard shield centered. The stripes are canted at a 64 degree angle, coincidentally the year the Racing Stripe was designed.|$|E

500|$|Even {{before the}} {{prototype}} of the CF-100 had flown, Avro Canada was conducting studies of potential advanced variations of the aircraft, as the RCAF was seeking an interceptor with greater high-speed performance.

In December 1950, the Avro Aircraft <b>Design</b> <b>Office</b> decided to proceed with a redesign, primarily incorporating the early series CF-100 fuselage structure with a new swept wing and tail surfaces {{as part of the}} C-100S design study.|$|E

Unlike the A-43 turret, the turret by Factory No. 174 was much more convenient for the crew. The turret of the T-26-4 was quite similar to main turret of the T-28 medium tank.|$|E
