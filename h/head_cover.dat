500|$|The limited series Infinite Crisis (2005), {{written as}} {{a sequel to}} the 1985 maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths, altered DC Comics continuity. Subsequently, all comic book titles {{published}} by DC Comics skip forward one year and a new maxi-series entitled 52 retroactively chronicles the 52 weeks which directly followed Infinite Crisis. When DC editors called for a redesign of Batwoman, comic book artist Alex Ross drew inspiration from the modified Batgirl costume he designed for Barbara Gordon, seven years prior to Kate Kane's debut in the limited comic book series 52. Ross and comic book author Paul Dini initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using {{an updated version of}} the character's original costume, with red accents in place of the traditional yellow. However, since Gordon served as one of {{a very small number of}} disabled superheroes of DC Comics as Oracle, DC's editorial staff decided to revitalize the original Batwoman instead. In an interview with Newsarama, Ross states [...] "They had me change the mask and hair to make it a bit more Batwoman, rather than Batgirl...I pointed out to them that the mask makes her look like the Huntress a little overall—but there weren't many options. The original mask that I had in there when it was to be a Batgirl design was the complete <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> that we've seen, so they did need something different from that." ...|$|E

In addition to the basic garments that were mostly universal within the movement, additional measures of modesty could be taken depending on how conservative the followers wished to be. Some women choose to also utilize a face covering (al-niqāb) that leaves only eye slits for sight, as well as both gloves and socks in order to reveal no visible skin.|$|E
2500|$|According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony {{heard a voice}} {{telling him}} [...] "Go out and see." [...] He went out and saw an angel who wore a girdle with a cross, one {{resembling}} the holy Eskiem (Tonsure or Schema), and on his head was a <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, [...] "Anthony, do this and you will rest." [...] Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution {{that was about to}} happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, {{and the end of the}} age. When Saint Macarius visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew near of the departure of Saint Paul the First Hermit in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from St Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th Patriarch of Alexandria.|$|E
60|$|General Hildyard, {{with whom}} was Prince Christian Victor, {{spent the night}} in {{improving}} the defences of the hill and in building new traverses and <b>head</b> <b>cover.</b> At midnight the Boers made a fresh effort to regain the position, and the sudden roar of musketry awakened the sleeping army. The attack, however, was easily repulsed. At daybreak the shelling began again, only now the Boers had brought up several new guns, and the bombardment was much heavier. Owing, however, to the excellent cover which had been arranged the casualties during the day did not exceed forty. The Cavalry and Transport, who were sheltering in the hollows underneath Zwartkop, were also shelled, and it was thought desirable to move them back to a safer position.|$|E
