50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>water-rat</b> (Xeromys myoides) is {{a species}} of rodent native to {{waterways}} of Australia and Papua New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|Fifty-six {{species of}} fish have been recorded. Fifty mammals are known {{to occur in the}} area, {{including}} a number not found elsewhere in New Guinea, such as the spectacled hare-wallaby, <b>false</b> <b>water-rat,</b> bronze quoll and chestnut dunnart. Reptiles include saltwater crocodile and New Guinea crocodile.|$|E
50|$|Wetlands of {{national}} {{importance in the}} Noosa region, such as Lake Weyba and Noosa River Wetlands, are threatened by sea level rise, further flooding, and climate change. This directly affects and threatens the habitat of the <b>false</b> <b>water-rat</b> (Xeromys myoides). Fish species, such as the oxleyan pygmy perch (Nannoperca oxleyana) have had their abundance reduced in Noosa due to man-made stream contaminants, lack of stream flow, and introduced species.|$|E
50|$|The {{common name}} of this species has long been <b>false</b> <b>water-rat.</b> During the 1990s there was a push for such {{descriptive}} English common names to be replaced with indigenous names. In 1995 the Australian Nature Conservation Agency released a document in which were recorded two indigenous names for H. chrysogaster, the Murrinh-Patha name manngay and the Mayali and Gunwinjgu name yirrku. They recommended that the latter name be adopted as the common name, but with the orthography yirrkoo. However, this recommendation was not prescriptive, and {{it remains to be}} seen to what extent it will be adopted.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{species in}} the reserve include the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis), false water rat (Xeromys myoides), {{humpback}} whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and the dugong (Dugong dugon). Both the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) are flagship species in Australia, receiving {{a great deal of}} conservation attention from the public. In comparison, species like the greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis) and the <b>false</b> <b>water-rat</b> (Xeromys myoides) are unknown to most of the public, but are nationally vulnerable species, with current studies indicating both require the same level of conservation attention to prevent further decline in abundance and distribution. Even megafauna species dugong (Dugong dugon) numbers are also in steady decline, with extinction forecast for this vulnerable species within this century.|$|E
