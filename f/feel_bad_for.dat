5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

500|$|Greg Kot, {{writer for}} the Chicago Tribune, stated that the track [...] "seduces like a drug dealer", with Ocean crooning over a laid-back rhythm. Prefix Magazines David Padula commented that it [...] "centers around a jazzy {{keyboard}} lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings. The crisp percussion is a highlight, but the winning point is the soulful croons and general smoothness of Ocean." [...] Mike Powell's Spin praised Ocean's writing abilities, musing [...] "my 'TV ain't HD, that's too real', the narrator of 'Sweet Life' complains, then returns to his swimming-pool floatie. If the song wasn't so pretty — Ocean's velvety voice, soft jazzy accompaniment — you might even <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> him." [...] Killian Fox of The Observer reported that the song {{was one of the}} few times on the album when Ocean was actively courting heavy radio play, describing Sweet Life as a [...] "near-perfect distillation of every blissed-out summer jam from Stevie Wonder onwards." [...] Amy Dawson, critic for Metro, called the composition [...] "an irresistibly warm slice of old-school funk." ...|$|E
500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, and we needed the audience to <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Addicted to You" [...] {{was mostly}} positive. Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily {{commented that the}} song prevents the listener from getting [...] "lulled" [...] and [...] "hurries back to the hip-swaying dance beat". Michelle Morgante from The Boston Globe picked the song {{as an example of}} Shakira's [...] "new merengue-rock hybrid that lays down bare horn riffs over a driving beat in a groove that is irresistible". Carlos Macias from Terra USA, however, gave it a negative review and criticized its use of a [...] "cheap keyboard that drives the tune reminds us of music played at weddings and quinceañeras". In 2013, Latina included [...] "Addicted to You" [...] on their list of [...] "The 13 Best Songs in Spanglish" [...] and commented that [...] "If non-Spanish speakers can’t pick up the language after listening to this track, then we <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> you, son". At the 28th International Dance Music Awards held in 2013, [...] "Addicted to You" [...] was nominated for [...] "Best Latin Dance Track". It was also nominated at the 2013 Billboard Latin Music Awards for Latin Pop Song of the Year. El Cata received an ASCAP Latin award at the Pop category for his composition of the song.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E

It's a shame, and I <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> them when they face God on Judgment Day." [...] Although four members who claimed to be born-again Christians remained on the Board, she believed that the new board would waste no time adopting new science standards, expecting that in the following January, when the new members were sworn in, the Board would rescind existing standards and adopt new ones that [...] "let government schools teach children that we are no more than chaotic, random mutants." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl {{began his}} season on a low-note, {{wrecking}} in {{the ending of}} the Daytona 500 and losing the draft late in the race in Atlanta. He rebounded at Las Vegas with a terrific run. While running close to the lead and leading a couple laps, Edwards tangled with Kasey Kahne with less than 20 laps to go. Edwards — while moving under Kahne —knocked Kahne into the SAFER barrier. In an apparent act of retaliation, Kahne forced Edwards out of the draft, wrecking Edwards and himself. Despite the payback, Edwards took responsibility for the collision stating: [...] "I was just racing as hard as I can. It's completely my fault, Kasey did a good job.

[...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone called The Mighty B! a show that he admires more than what he [...] "truly love", stating: [...] "There is prodigious talent behind it and its wonderfully energetic, boisterous comedy. It's clearly trying very, very hard to be entertaining and largely succeeds [...] I almost <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> not liking The Mighty B! more than I do, and I'm still not sure why I don't enjoy it more". He noted it was worth pointing out that more recent episodes of the show seem [...] "more assured and funnier" [...] than the eight episodes on the We Got the Bee DVD.|$|E

[...] Lewis revealed that she had recorded the song [...] "We Found Love" [...] but because she wanted to release [...] "Trouble" [...] as her first single, Harris subsequently offered the song to Rihanna while touring with her.
