5|$|The book {{begins with}} Arthur Penhaligon and Leaf {{attempting}} {{to return to}} Earth after their adventures in the Border Sea. While Leaf is able {{to pass through the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> return to Earth, the presence of a Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him from doing so, and he is forced to remain in the Lower House.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts through the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Maggie's baby monitor {{receives}} transmissions {{from the}} cellular tower. Rather than report this to Omnitouch, Marge becomes obsessed with eavesdropping on private calls. Eventually Bart and Milhouse play a prank on Marge by making her think that an escaped convict {{was attempting to}} break into the house. When Milhouse opens the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> tries to tell Marge that it was just a prank, Marge smashes the baby monitor on Milhouse's head and knocks him out and Bart rebukes that it was a fair punishment for eavesdropping, to which Marge reluctantly agrees.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which he put on the wall just outside the <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied the American troops and led them in a {{successful}} charge against the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. Then some Americans rushed the <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers {{walked out of the}} building and laid down their arms, thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E

5|$|Emma Silver is a radio {{personality}} who relocated from New York City {{to establish}} {{her career in}} Seattle. After hearing of her grandfather Walt's death, Emma returns to her childhood home in Valleyville, Washington. After meeting with the attorney Bobby Ellis, Emma discovers that she has inherited Walt's farm and pumpkin seeds. Bobby suggests that Walt wanted Emma to enter the local pumpkin growing contest to keep up a family tradition. In his last letter, Walt instructs his granddaughter {{to find someone to}} take care of the farm. Emma's new neighbor Seth Cullen contemplates asking Emma for Walt's seeds so that he can enter the contest and win its grand prize, which would allow him to open his own automobile repair shop. Emma and Seth first meet when he is repairing her <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> she mistakes him for a burglar. During Walt's funeral, Emma learns that Walt was in debt. Bobby tells her that the entire debt must be paid by the end of the year or the farm will be foreclosed. Mayor Kyle Finster informs Emma that he intends to develop the land following its foreclosure.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} was expanded and largely rebuilt from 2012 to 2014, re-opening on September 14, 2014 {{just in time}} for the High Holydays. The architects were Acton/Ostry of Vancouver. The {{building was}} completely rebuilt except for part of the foundation and three exterior walls. The <b>front</b> <b>door</b> (<b>and</b> address) are now at 989 West 28th Avenue although the building occupies the same site.|$|E

25|$|All {{other local}} bus {{services}} are now operated by modern low-floor buses, {{which may be}} single-deck or double-deck. Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors, and passengers board the bus using the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> alight using the rear door, whilst some buses on less busy routes have only one door. All these buses conform to the Disability discrimination act, and can accept passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers.|$|E
25|$|Nathaniel Gilman House {{was built}} in 1740. The Gilman House is a large colonial white {{clapboard}} home with a gambrel roof hipped at one end, a leaded fanlight over the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> a wide panelled entry hall. This home, {{as well as the}} Benjamin Clark Gilman House which is also owned by the Academy, were built for members of Exeter's Gilman family, who donated the Nathaniel Gilman House to the academy in 1905. The home now houses the academy's Alumni and Alumnae Affairs and Development Office.|$|E
25|$|The MBTA's {{solution}} was to turn the surface portion of the Green Line into a proof-of-payment system {{to increase the efficiency}} of boarding at peak times on surface Green Line stops. All doors on all trolleys open at some or all stations, depending on the branch. Passengers can pay their fare in several ways, depending on their payment method. Passengers paying with cash must enter through the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> pay at the farebox, where they may receive a proof-of-payment receipt. Stored-value CharlieCard or CharlieTicket holders may also need to pay at the farebox.|$|E
50|$|The synagogue {{was built}} by a Reform Jewish {{congregation}} in 1898. It is a wood-frame building, with clapboard siding, keyhole windows in the <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> a pair of octagonal towers topped by onion domes.|$|R

25|$|When {{the film}} ended, Purvis {{stood by the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{signaled}} Dillinger's exit by lighting a cigar. Both {{he and the other}} agents reported that Dillinger turned his head and looked directly at the agent as he walked by, glanced across the street, then moved ahead of his female companions, reached into his pocket but failed to extract his gun, and ran into a nearby alley. Other accounts stated Dillinger ignored a command to surrender, whipped out his gun, then headed for the alley. Agents already had the alley closed off, but Dillinger was determined to shoot it out.|$|E
25|$|The current Hubbard House {{is mostly}} a typical I-house design but the two-story front (west) section {{of the house was}} not {{constructed}} until 1872. Until that time the Hubbard family was confined to the smaller, one-story portion of the house. Quarters were cramped during this time. The two-story portion of the house features windows {{on both sides of the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> three windows on the second-floor, representing the typical I-house design. Sometime after both sections were completed a bay window was added in the angle between the wings. Elbert's room was in the attic, a room which still existed when the building was nominated to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|All {{the shelters}} are adapted {{to suit the}} local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are {{versatile}} enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> several layers of coverings. A berber tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – {{and because of the}} climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.|$|E

They were originally painted dark blue, with {{white on the}} <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> top (see image at right), showing the department logo on the <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> A blue, rotating code-3 light bar was mounted on the roof. Unmarked vehicles used a single rotating light inside the car.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the bodies}} of the four men were found in the {{vicinity}} of Port's flat in just over a year from late summer 2014, Walgate (the first) outside his <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the other three in a graveyard, the Metropolitan Police neglected to link the deaths. The first three victims (Kovari and Whitworth being the others) were initially thought not to have died in suspicious circumstances, and despite the PinkNews website and the force's LGBT independent advisory group correctly believing there was a serial murderer at large, the police had told them the crimes were not linked. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is now investigating whether 17 police officers in the Met should face disciplinary action.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous crimes in the city took place in March 1953, when elderly widow Mabel Monahan was killed in her Burbank home. When Monahan, 64, {{opened the door to}} her house on West Parkside Avenue, she found herself confronted by a stranger, Barbara Graham (also {{sometimes}} referred to as Barbara Wood). Graham, along with some other accomplices, had heard rumors of a Las Vegas gambling fortune hidden in Monahan's house. The crime scene was discovered by a gardener, who went to Monahan's <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> looked in to find a ransacked home and a grisly trail of blood. The gardener immediately called the Burbank Police, who discovered Monahan's badly beaten body, half in and half out of a closet.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 2008, Anthony Limon {{had agreed}} {{as a favor}} to Torres to drive four men in his Hummer {{limousine}} that night, picking up the first three and taking them to the Elephant Bar restaurant in suburban Lakewood, where they picked up Saenz. Later, he ordered Limon to drive to Montebello, then at 5 a.m. ordered him to drive to the limo owner's home in Whittier. Saenz was filmed on a home surveillance system arriving at Torres' house, chasing him out of his <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> then shooting Torres four times in the head, possibly due to lost money. The DVD disc that had captured the shooting was removed from the surveillance system. However, shortly after the investigation of the homicide, video of the murder was retrieved from the security equipment's hard drive, leading investigators to identify Saenz as the shooter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{houses to}} the north of the area (north of the Beeches Road between the Walsall and M6 were by {{contrast}} privately owned.
