5|$|June 12: Marshall <b>intentionally</b> consumes H. pylori {{and becomes}} ill. He takes {{antibiotics}} and is relieved of his symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Misconduct penalty (10 minutes; second {{misconduct}} {{penalty in}} one game means automatic ejection) for a player who <b>intentionally</b> takes off his gloves in fisticuffs.|$|E
5|$|Morris <b>intentionally</b> consumes H. pylori. Like Marshall, {{he becomes}} ill, but unlike Marshall, {{he is not}} {{completely}} cured by antibiotics. The infection will remain with him for three years.|$|E
5|$|A. Alain Baxter, {{representing}} Great Britain, originally placed {{third and}} {{was awarded the}} bronze medal. However, Baxter tested positive for methamphetamine, and was stripped of his medal. Baxter was later cleared of <b>intentionally</b> doping by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but was not re-awarded his medal. Benjamin Raich was promoted to bronze.|$|E
5|$|Africa Check, a {{non-profit}} organisation that checks facts in claims made about Africa, and the Centre for the Study of Democracy have criticised polls by market research companies as unscientific. Africa Check warned that some polls are <b>intentionally</b> misleading {{and some are}} essentially conjecture.|$|E
5|$|After Scott Cawthon's {{previous}} game (Chipper & Sons Lumber Co.) received bad {{reception for}} the unsettling {{appearance of the}} supposedly kid-friendly characters, Cawthon decided to use these ideas to create an <b>intentionally</b> scary game, Five Nights at Freddy's.|$|E
5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server <b>intentionally</b> set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an <b>intentionally</b> vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|At age ten Balzac {{was sent}} to the Oratorian grammar school in Vendôme, where he studied for seven years. His father, seeking to instill the same hardscrabble work ethic which had gained him the esteem of society, <b>intentionally</b> gave little {{spending}} money to the boy. This made him the object of ridicule among his much wealthier schoolmates.|$|E
5|$|Because HBO {{does not}} break {{individual}} episodes with commercials, Carnivàle music is paced {{similar to a}} movie, with character-specific leitmotifs from {{as early as the}} first episode. Characters are musically identified by solo instruments chosen for the character's ethnic background or nature. Some characters whose connections are only disclosed later in the series have <b>intentionally</b> similar themes.|$|E
5|$|CFPS' barn in Maresfield, {{where an}} all-night vigil was held; those invited {{included}} Ralph Harvey, and Ronald Hutton. After this Pagan rite was completed, her coffin was cremated at Brighton's Woodvale crematorium, in an <b>intentionally</b> low-key service with John Belham-Payne, Doreen's last High priest as celebrant for the funeral.|$|E
5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the fragment appears to have been <b>intentionally</b> cut, most likely in modern times. They further suggest that this leads to the possibility that in context Jesus may not have even been speaking of a literal wife.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise was <b>intentionally</b> {{equipped}} with less advanced versions of technologies seen in previous series. For example, {{it has no}} tractor beam, uses missiles instead of photon torpedoes, and has only limited means of synthesizing foods and other consumable items. Communications Officer Linguist Hoshi Sato's expertise in linguistics helps compensate {{for the lack of}} advanced universal translators.|$|E
5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This is because Opera Mini <b>intentionally</b> reformats web pages to try to make them more suitable for devices with small screens.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, several {{independent}} {{groups of}} experimenters in the mid-60s {{realized that the}} fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes occurring in the subject, and began <b>intentionally</b> producing holographic double exposures. The main Holographic interferometry article covers the disputes over priority of discovery {{that occurred during the}} issuance of the patent for this method.|$|E
5|$|He was ejected for {{the first}} time in his MLB career on August 17, 2013 by umpire Marvin Hudson for <b>intentionally</b> {{pitching}} at Braves batter Andrelton Simmons in the second inning of a Nationals-Braves game. Prior to the ejection, Hudson warned both teams after Strasburg hit Justin Upton with a first-pitch fastball following a Braves home run.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, the SCLC began a {{campaign}} against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but <b>intentionally</b> confrontational tactics, developed in part by Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the war, Göring was {{repeatedly}} ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots <b>intentionally</b> crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of the show's animation style, Stan is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an <b>intentionally</b> jerky fashion.|$|E
5|$|Medical experiments, {{many of them}} pseudoscientific, were {{performed}} on concentration camp inmates beginning in 1941. The most notorious doctor to perform medical experiments was SS-Hauptsturmführer Dr. Josef Mengele, camp doctor at Auschwitz. Many of his victims died or were <b>intentionally</b> killed. Concentration camp inmates were made available for purchase by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing and other experiments.|$|E
5|$|Mercury, as thiomersal, {{is widely}} used in the {{manufacture}} of mascara. In 2008, Minnesota became the first state in the United States to ban <b>intentionally</b> added mercury in cosmetics, giving it a tougher standard than the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{processes}} {{can also}} introduce toxic substances into nontoxic honey produced from nontoxic nectar. Microorganisms in honey can convert {{some of the}} sugars in honey to ethanol. This process of ethanol fermentation is <b>intentionally</b> harnessed to produce the alcoholic beverage called mead from fermented honey.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapon designs could <b>intentionally</b> {{incorporate}} 59Co, some {{of which}} would be activated in a nuclear explosion to produce 60Co. The 60Co, dispersed as nuclear fallout, creates what is sometimes called a cobalt bomb.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February {{the third}} Progress {{spacecraft}} {{to visit the}} ISS, Progress M-44, docked to the Zvezda module. It brought air, food, rocket fuel and other equipment. It remained docked until Expedition 2, when it was <b>intentionally</b> burnt up during atmospheric reentry, like all Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, 1918, Grant was {{expelled}} from Fairfield. Several explanations were given, including being discovered in the girls' lavatory, and assisting two other classmates with theft {{in the nearby town}} of Almondsbury. Wansell claims that Grant had set out to <b>intentionally</b> get himself expelled from school to pursue a career in entertainment with the troupe.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{the five}} types of living beings, a householder is {{forbidden}} to kill, or destroy, <b>intentionally,</b> all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch). But, the ascetic is required to avoid even injuring the one-sensed form of life {{to the best of}} his ability.|$|E
5|$|Phallic {{architecture}} {{consciously or}} unconsciously creates a symbolic representation of the phallus. Buildings <b>intentionally</b> or unintentionally resembling the human penis {{are a source of}} amusement to locals and tourists in various places around the world. Deliberate phallic imagery is found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Proposals from shipbuilders for two dreadnoughts (along with a {{possible}} third, to match Brazil should a third ship be ordered) and twelve destroyers were solicited in 1908 by open tender. In {{order to ensure that}} the designs reflected the most modern practices, the requirements were <b>intentionally</b> vague.|$|E
5|$|The Awahnechee {{and other}} {{aboriginal}} groups changed {{the environment of}} the Yosemite area. Parts of valley floors were <b>intentionally</b> burned each year to encourage the growth of acorn-bearing black oaks. Fire kept forests open, reducing the risk of ambush, and the open areas helped to expand and maintain meadows.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} (28 November), the French Emperor {{requested}} a personal interview with Alexander I {{and received a}} visit from the Tsar's most impetuous aide, Count Dolgorouki. The meeting was another part of the trap, as Napoleon <b>intentionally</b> expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents. Dolgorouki reported to the Tsar an additional indication of French weakness.|$|E
5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had <b>intentionally</b> caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E
5|$|After Batista won the WWE Championship from John Cena at Elimination Chamber, Cena {{requested}} a rematch. Mr. McMahon agreed, {{on the condition}} that Cena must defeat Batista in a non-title match that night on Raw. Batista <b>intentionally</b> low-blowed Cena during the match to get disqualified and set up their match at WrestleMania. To build up their match, Batista interfered in several of Cena's matches in the weeks prior to WrestleMania, both attacking Cena or distracting him so that his opponent could gain the advantage.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, Perry's {{two largest}} ships were badly damaged, and the US Brig Lawrence was <b>intentionally</b> sunk in Misery Bay. The Lawrence {{was raised in}} 1875 but was burned while {{on display at the}} 1876 Centennial Exposition. The US Brig Niagara was {{initially}} repaired, then sunk for preservation in 1820 and raised in 1913, and parts of it were eventually used in the current Niagara, based across Presque Isle Bay in Erie.|$|E
