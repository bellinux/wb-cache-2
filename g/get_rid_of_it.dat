500|$|By 1949 the Irish Free State {{had evolved}} into the Republic of Ireland and left the British Commonwealth, but not all Irish opinion favoured {{the removal of the}} Pillar.

500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether.

[...] There are six core processes in ACT interventions: Acceptance, Cognitive Defusion, Self as Context, Being Present, Values, and Committed Action. [...] Acceptance is taught in order to teach people to embrace their emotions, {{rather than trying to}} get rid of them. [...] An example of acceptance would be when people feel angry and then choose to focus on the anger and accept that they are angry, rather than trying to unleash their anger to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Cognitive defusion teaches people to not take their thoughts as literal in order to decrease the believability of negative thoughts and increase flexibility to behave as they want. [...] An example of cognitive defusion would be when someone thinks “I am the worst,” and then defuses the thought by thinking of things in which he or she excels.|$|E

2500|$|Manhattan Valley has gentrified {{significantly}} {{since the}} 1980s. With this gentrification, rents {{in the area}} rose. The population of estimated Latino residents was fast dwindling by 1987. Meanwhile, nonprofit groups started to renovate many structures that were owned by the city, as well as build housing on previously vacant tracts of land. Reactions to this gentrification were mixed.
