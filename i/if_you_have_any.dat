In defense of these accusations, Tyahnybok has stated [...] "I have {{repeatedly}} said that Svoboda is not an anti-Semitic organization. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> comments on our views, go to court.

However poor Inayat Khan 's jumping or even her encoding, Vera knew that those agents who did well were those who knew before they set off that they could do the job. Her intention was to let Inayat Khan feel that she had an opportunity to back out gracefully should she so wish. Vera began by asking if she was happy in what she was doing. Inayat Khan looked startled and said: [...] "Yes, of course." [...] Vera then told her about the letter and its contents. Inayat Khan was upset that anybody should think she was not fit for the job.

2500|$|Milošević {{denounced the}} {{declaration}} of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia in 1992, and said that [...] "Bosnia and Herzegovina was illegally proclaimed as an independent state and recognized. That recognition was like when the Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. But please, we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis." [...] A telephone conversation between Milošević and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzić in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Marković, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milošević.

Don't worry about Herzegovina. Momir [...] said to his men: 'Whoever is not ready to die in Bosnia, step forward five paces.' No one did so."
