5|$|Only {{three people}} besides the reigning monarch {{at the time}} <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> both Houses {{together}} {{on more than one}} occasion. Nelson Mandela addressed Members of the Commons and the Lords in 1993 and in 1996 as President of South Africa. Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the Houses as a foreign delegate of the Soviet Union in 1984 and again, in 1993, on behalf of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Shimon Peres addressed the Houses as Prime Minister of Israel in 1986 and as President in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Project 86 is an American {{rock band}} from Orange County, California, formed in 1996. The band has {{released}} eight albums, which have collectively sold nearly 500,000 units worldwide, two EPs, two DVDs, and one live album. Their music {{is considered by}} most to be a rock/post-hardcore/alternative style. Frontman Andrew Schwab's poetic and introspective lyrics <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> {{a wide variety of}} topics such as conformity and emptiness.|$|E
5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{competing}} theories that <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> the early colonisation process, {{although it is}} clear that the Northern Isles were the first to be conquered by Vikings and the last to be relinquished by the Norwegian crown. Thorfinn Sigurdsson's rule in the 11th century included expansion well into north mainland Scotland and this may have been the zenith of Scandinavian influence. The obliteration of pre-Norse names in the Hebrides and Northern Isles, and their replacement with Norse ones was almost total although the emergence of alliances with the native Gaelic speakers produced a powerful Norse-Gael culture that had wide influence in Argyll, Galloway and beyond.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of people}} who <b>have</b> <b>{{addressed}}</b> both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament at the same time. Although English and later British monarchs have jointly addressed the House of Commons and the House of Lords on several occasions since the 16th century, the first foreign dignitary to do so was French President Albert Lebrun in March 1939. The list excludes the speeches given by (or on behalf of) the Sovereign at the State Opening of Parliament and at the close of each parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|As Co-Freemasonry {{spread in}} England from 1902, some members became alarmed by {{decisions}} {{taken by the}} governing body in Paris. There was a perceived threat to the ancient form of masonic ritual. Resignations resulted, in 1908, {{in the formation of}} a new Grand Lodge, which became the Honourable Fraternity of Antient Masonry, under a clergyman, the Rev. Dr. William Frederick Cobb, as Grand Master. His retirement after four years led to the election of a female Grand Master. Reverting to the original legal meaning of Brotherhood, the members <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> each other as Brother since 1908. A further split occurred in 1913, when those wishing to include higher degrees, specifically the Royal Arch, left to form the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons. Both societies are now exclusively female. The Honourable Fraternity of Antient Masonry restricted initiation to women and stopped admitting male visitors. The last male member left in 1935. The older society, having started working higher degrees, changed its name in 1958, appending the Order of Women Freemasons, as they are known today. Both bodies have lodges throughout the United Kingdom, and the Order of Women Freemasons also has lodges in Australasia, Zimbabwe, and Spain.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Wasp Jr {{radial engine}} of the Beaver is long out of production, so repair parts are getting harder to find.

25|$|However, {{these figures}} do not {{distinguish}} between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct.

25|$|Compatibilists {{maintain}} that mental reality {{is not of}} itself causally effective.

Modern compatibilists make a distinction between freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.|$|E
