5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, {{as well as the}} transfer of electrons.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects {{membranes}} from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This {{is in line with}} findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E

Although originally valuable minerals such as gold and silver were unearthed, today coal is the primary resource extracted from underground.

The East Kootenay <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> coal-producing area of British Columbia, has since 1898 produced over 500 million tons, and about 25 percent of the world's steel-making coal comes from the region.|$|E

A retrospective, case-control, clinic based study was chosen to perform this research. Vaginal, cervical and urethral swabs and smears were taken.
