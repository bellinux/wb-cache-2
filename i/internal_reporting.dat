Over the 1993-97 period, one regulatory agency, the Federal Reserve Board, actually approved more applications than the average percentages of those without a detailed CRA review taking place. Of the 1,100 merger or acquisition cases the FRB reviewed on average per year where the relevant institutions were subject to CRA, only 70 instances on average were identified with potential CRA problems regardless of public opposition or <b>internal</b> <b>reporting</b> raising the concern. On average, 22 of these were ultimately identified as CRA compliance being the primary reason for both application withdrawal or FRB denial.|$|E

40|$|Managers rely on {{receiving}} data {{or information}} to make critical decisions. One way that a manager receives this information is by reading and interpreting <b>internal</b> <b>reports.</b> Managers, from the shift supervisor {{to the president of}} the company, are able to use the information provided by <b>internal</b> <b>reports</b> to plan for the future or analyze past decisions. It is imperative that each <b>internal</b> <b>report</b> be understandable by every manager who uses it. A wrong decision could result from misinterpreting the data in a report. It is also important for each report to touch on the issues of the company that are key to its success. The purpose of this paper is to compare the Critical Success Factors (CSF) to the <b>internal</b> <b>reports</b> of The Ford Meter Box Company. Critical Success Factors are those things that make the company successful. The paper will also show how managers that work with the reports feel about using them.

While both budgets and <b>internal</b> <b>reports</b> are widely used, empirical evidence concerning their influence on the prediction of future performance is extremely limited. Consistent with the availability of formal accounting information improving predictive performance, we observe that <b>internal</b> accounting <b>report</b> preparation significantly improves forecast accuracy. However, partitioning firms by forecasting difficulty reveals that the accuracy benefits from <b>internal</b> <b>reports</b> preparation are only observed for firms with high uncertainty. Further, the results provide limited support for linkages between budget preparation and forecast accuracy.

50|$|In August 1940, Robert and Klara Döpel, {{working in}} Leipzig, showed {{the utility of}} using heavy water as a {{moderator}} in a nuclear reactor.

There is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality. [...] "Big data very often means `dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth." [...] Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed. While extensive information in healthcare is now electronic, it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach - Using indexes, the quality of the financial disclosure and the <b>internal</b> <b>reporting</b> systems are measured, and analyzed with a view to finding some links between them. It is expected that the quality of disclosure is dependent on the quality of the <b>internal</b> <b>reporting.</b> Findings - Complex interactions between <b>internal</b> <b>reporting</b> and financial disclosure are revealed, which leads to the identification of a typology of practices. The dependence of the relationship may be troubled by the willingness of the firm to communicate, or by the internal methods of control. According to the various cases, different levels of usefulness of the information for the investor are expected. Originality/value - This paper is a first attempt to analyse information disclosed by firms with regards to the internal information at their disposal...|$|E
