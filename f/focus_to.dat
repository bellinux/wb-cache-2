5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Ehlers' arrival, {{the main}} {{research}} of Jordan's group had been {{dedicated to a}} scalar-tensor modification of general relativity that later became known as Jordan–Brans–Dicke theory.

Ehlers was instrumental in changing the group's <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> the structure and interpretation of Einstein's original theory. Other members of the group included Wolfgang Kundt, Rainer K.

5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E
5|$|Social {{anthropology}} is {{the branch}} of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E
25|$|Spherical concave and convex mirrors do not <b>focus</b> {{parallel}} rays <b>to</b> {{a single}} point due to spherical aberration. However, the ideal of <b>focusing</b> <b>to</b> a point is a commonly used approximation. Parabolic reflectors resolve this, allowing incoming parallel rays (for example, light from a distant star) <b>to</b> be <b>focused</b> <b>to</b> a small spot; almost an ideal point. Parabolic reflectors are not suitable for imaging nearby objects because the light rays are not parallel.|$|R

5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} {{that focused on the}} possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E

5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E

For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> an emotional one.|$|E

During the last week of September the JNA returned its <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> Zadar, stepping up its artillery bombardment of the city and ending its naval blockade on 23 September.
