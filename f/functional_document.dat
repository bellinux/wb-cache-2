It is the author's job to design the document so that the information it contains can be interpreted accurately and efficiently. To do this, the author can make use {{of a set of}} stylistic tools. In this paper we introduce the concept of document functionality, which attempts to describe the roles of documents and their components in the process of transferring information. A functional description of a document provides insight into the type of the document, into its intended uses, and into strategies for automatic document interpretation and retrieval. To demonstrate these ideas, we define a taxonomy of <b>functional</b> <b>document</b> components and show how functional descriptions can be used to reverse-engineer the intentions of the author, to navigate in document space, and to provide important contextual information to aid in interpretation.

This {{project was}} created {{because the company}} EDICA Ltda. had the {{necessity}} to establish guidelines and documentation in order to incorporate new environmental policies within the constructive processes. "Overall Plan for Construction Waste Management, as it is called, was developed in order to generate a simple and <b>functional</b> <b>document</b> in the field. With this tool, not only people {{in charge of the}} project, but also those involved in the constructive process may know and have information for the handling and disposal of waste generated within the construction activities. It was also developed the Construction and Offices Waste Management Manual and other environmental practices. " With this book, people responsible for the execution of works will manage information to plan and implement methodologies regarding the waste management produced within the construction site, project offices and headquarters. Both documents are the result of the ISO 14001 analysis and national legislation, aimed at waste management and environmental practices, as well as some bibliographic research and consultation to various professionals.

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{detection method}} {{is based on}} the analysis of hierarchical document structure and is henceforth abbreviated as Hidost. It is an extension of previous work published by Šrndić and Laskov in [26], herein referred to as SL 2013. The novelty introduced in SL 2013 was the use of logical structure for characterization of malicious and benign PDF files. PDF logical structure is a high-level construct defined by the PDF Standard that organizes basic PDF building blocks into a <b>functional</b> <b>document.</b> Results published in [26] show that properties of malicious files such as the presence of JavaScript and minimal use of benign content can be accurately determined from their logical structure. As a deep static method, SL 2013 is less affected by PDF obfuscation and physical structure falsification that plague shallow methods. Evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising 660, 000 PDF files, SL 2013 has demonstrated a combination of detection performance and throughput that remains unrivaled among antivirus engines and published scientific work. Nevertheless, in a realistic sliding window experiment on timestamped data, the detection performance of SL 2013 was shown to be inconsistent. Its feature definition created a blind spot exploitable by evaders and its oversized feature set created difficulties for more memory-intensive machine learning classifiers than the employed support vector machine.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} examine the socio-economic assessment of the impacts of the community Framework Programmes and to improve understanding of how such impacts might be designated, defined and measured. The rationale for the work lies in the mounting appreciation of the importance of research and technological development (RTD) for economic growth and the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. The study follows earlier actions to promote the assessment of socio-economic impact of the Framework Programmes and in particular the reflections of the ETAN group in 1999. The study was conceived both as a means of delivering a rigorous and defensible academic statement on the justifications for RTD support and best available means of its evaluation, and as a <b>functional</b> <b>document</b> which could give help to policy makers who were directly concerned with the delivery and evaluation of policy in the field of RTD. The study has four major parts: Justification of the role of RTD and its benefits through an examination of the academic and policy literature; An examination of the evaluation practice of the Framework Programmes and other relevant RTD activities with the aim of delivering lessons and suitable practical principles to which to apply to evaluation; Case studies chosen to exemplify approaches to evaluation; Observations about future evaluation strategy in the light of recent developments {{at the level of the}} European research system...|$|E
40|$|There was a time, {{when the}} ability to sign and do a bit of reading, was {{sufficient}} {{for a person to}} be able to successfully function within the society. Today however, that is not nearly enough. To be able to work, a person has to master flexible reading of diverse materials encountered on daily basis, be able to locate information in a variety of sources on her/his own, and poses sufficient knowledge for working with computers. In this thesis, I take a look at reading, <b>functional,</b> <b>document,</b> and computer literacy of preschool teachers, including their attitude towards reading, their ability to think critically, ability to work with computers, their opinion on their own grammar skills, and their ability to tackle new ways of composing preparations and analyses. The results, acquired through the means of a questioner, have been accordingly processed and interpreted. I have also compared the results of preschool teachers with the results of preschool assistants. Their attitude towards reading is mostly positive, they do contemplate the texts, but only a third of them do so critically. They consider their document literacy as adequate, but encounter a number of limitations when it comes to computers. Functional literacy enables the teachers to do their job smoothly and independently. In order for their work to be up to date, they have to follow innovations, regularly educate themselves, and take care of their own personal development. ...|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{are usually}} {{overloaded}} {{with a lot}} of research papers and material that they have to efficiently organised to allow fast and efficient access. Over and above this, the process that these researchers have to go through to find the research material is often very tedious, sometimes involving many hours of searching on the World Wide Web. This report discusses a case study that was done to investigate ways {{that can be used to}} build a system for assisting individuals to organise documents in an electronic "work-bench". One of the key elements of this system is its ability to allow users to collaborate through simplifying the process of searching and downloading documents on a Local Area Network. By design this system would then eventually reduce external Internet traffic, and increase the efficiency of its users by eventually reducing the amount of time they spend on the World Wide Web locating research material. The project was aimed at using the latest open standards as the basic building blocks for its framework. The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) was selected as the protocol that would be used for the collaboration aspect of the project. OAI-PMH provides a low cost approach to interoperability. It is one of latest standards that are aimed at simplifying the dissemination of content. This project was implemented in the form of components that operate independently. These components are then interfaced to form a bigger system. This project was implemented using Java 2 ̆ 122, to allowing easy portability between operating systems. From the project it was discovered that the success of peer-to-peer downloading software relies heavily on popularity as users are the ones sharing the information. The time that was available for this project was not enough to fully explore and establish a large user base, thus experiments involving big volumes of users could not be conducted. The project did however, result in the construction of a <b>functional</b> <b>document</b> manager, and also established a sound framework that could be further developed for future work...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 162 - 170). xi, 170 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis [thesis discusses] {{the apparent}} disjuncture of {{both students and}} community members in regards to Vanuatu's formal school program. The curriculum, medium of instruction (English or French), and school structure have little connection to {{the daily lives of}} primary age students, who are citizens {{of one of the most}} linguistically diverse countries in the world and live primarily in rural villages (Crowley 2000, 47). Importantly, there has been no clear policy designed and implemented by the Vanuatu Ministry of Education (VMOE) to incorporate indigenous language, epistemology, knowledge, and culture into formal education. However, over the past ten years, the Vanuatu Ministry of Education has made some effort to include indigenous language into the curriculum by implementing vernacular education in approximately sixteen primary schools as a pilot program 3 (interview with Gambetta 2007). Currently, the VMOE, struggling to obtain vital resources to implement such programs, has begun to rely more on local community support (interview with Laan 2007). Yet traditionally and today, Ni-. Vanuatu community members have been excluded from the planning process. In fact, they are seldom given an opportunity to express their concerns, ideas, and desires, regarding formal education. At the same time, community members are concerned about the loss of their heritage languages and ways of life, which, according to some, is being accelerated by formal education. Indeed, such dialogue has been taking place for well over thirty decades. In the early 1970 s, Francis Bugotu, Solomon Islander educator and indigenous activist, led a team of researchers into rural villages throughout the then British Solomon Islands Protectorate to gather local community concerns regarding the state of formal education and whether or not it was meeting the needs of the communities. In the same way, this project aims to present a community perspective of the formal school program, particularly focused on vernacular and cultural education. However, Bugotu and his team went a step further and, based on the responses of community members, made recommendations to the protectorate government (Bugotu 1975, 44). During the first stages of research planning, I, too, aspired to present the VMOE with a <b>functional</b> <b>document</b> which could provide insight into community involvement in formal education and be used to further the vernacular education program on a national level. Yet, my findings from conducting research with Ni-Vanuatu community members brings to light issues which further complicate the process and purpose of education in Vanuatu. Therefore, this project does not include recommendations, but invites the VMOE, local community members, and other stakeholders to explore ways in which to bridge the growing gap between the national and local levels in regards to formal education...|$|E
