40|$|Based {{initially}} on Canadian practice, {{research on}} the production and use of tubed seedlings in Britain has been in progress for 3 years (1968 - 70), and was begun because of their potential advantages as planting stock. Polythene greenhouses are used to produce pine and spruce seedlings grown in small plastic tubes filled with fertilized peat-sand compost, and planting is possible 8 weeks after sowing. On ploughed peat-land, step-planted seedlings are capable of high survival and vigorous early growth, with an effective planting season from mid April to late August. Animal browsing is the main adverse factor encountered, but has been less serious than expected. Very high planting rates are possible with a special tool. Seedling use could lead to large savings in peatland afforestation costs, and large-scale trials are planned. In contrast, seedling performance on ploughed mineral soil has been unsatisfactory due to severe <b>frost</b> <b>lifting</b> and poor height growth. Results in reafforestation trials have not been very promising...|$|E
