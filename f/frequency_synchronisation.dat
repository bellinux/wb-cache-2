It has also been shown that attention modulates the gamma-frequency synchronisation. In electrophysiologi-cal experiments, these modulations have been found in layer V 4 [1] but not in layer V 1 [2]. In this modelling work, we study how selective attention modulates neuro-nal activity in different layers of the visual system. We use a two-layer model of integrate-and-fire neurons, model-ling attention as an external input biasing the competi-tion. We study the influence of the attentional bias on both the modulation of the firing rates and the gamma <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronisation</b> in both layers.

Time synchronisation is also particularly critical in time division duplexing (TDD) systems to avoid interference between the downlink and uplink of adjacent cells and enable enhanced features such as enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{can be used to}} provide accurate <b>frequency</b> and time <b>synchronisation</b> outdoors, but it may not work well indoors or outdoors where there is limited or no view of the sky [3]. In this case, achieving <b>frequency</b> and time <b>synchronisation</b> may require the support of backhaul based techniques, which rely on a well performing backhaul solution. The development of new synchronisation solutions such as local deployment of a synchronisation server, over-the-air synchronisation techniques or hybrid solutions can ease the requirements on the backhaul for synchronisation purposes [11].|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Data-aided {{multi-user}} burst {{frequency synchronization}} under interference limited conditions is analyzed. It {{is assumed that}} a unique-word based synchronization mechanism is used to achieve synchronization. In a first approach this unique-word {{is assumed to be}} located {{at the beginning of the}} burst structure. The interference represents frequency-adjacent bursts that are coarsely time synchronous. This corresponds to a typical multi frequency (MF) TDMA system with adjacent channel interference (ACI) limited minimal frequency separation. A novel approach is analyzed to reduce the interference impact of the carrier offset estimation, applying interference cancellation iteratively to increase the estimation accuracy. We demonstrate improved frequency synchronization with this novel approach of iterative burst synchronization.

40|$|The {{design of}} a 500 MHz {{oscillator}} in a 65 nm CMOS process using a 2 GHz bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonator is presented. A digital frequency control is implemented using a switched capacitor bank in parallel to the resonator. The tuning range is up to 500 kHz with a minimum step of 200 Hz. The oscillator core uses a differential topology and is designed for low phase noise (2128 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset) at low power consumption (0. 9 mW).

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{associated}} with exaggerated oscillatory synchrony in the basal ganglia at frequencies over 8 - 35 Hz. Studies have demonstrated a suppression of local field potential (LFP) activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) upon treatment with the dopamine prodrug, levodopa, with the degree of suppression {{of power in the}} 8 - 35 Hz band correlating with the improvement in combined measures of bradykinesia and rigidity. However, these studies do not explicitly address the question of what is more important in predicting clinical change - synchronisation of neuronal activity or the specific frequency within the 8 - 35 Hz band over which the latter occurs. In addition, they have not demonstrated a relationship between treatment-induced changes in synchronisation and changes in bradykinesia or rigidity on their own. To this end, we collected and analysed LFP and clinical data in 30 patients with PD. We found significant correlations between levodopa-induced power suppression and rigidity and bradykinesia, when these clinical features were considered separately, but only when power suppression profiles were re-aligned to the <b>frequency</b> of peak <b>synchronisation.</b> Under these circumstances correlations with rigidity persisted despite partialising out the effect of bradykinesia and vice versa. These data suggest that levodopa-induced improvements in both rigidity and bradykinesia scale with the degree of suppression of oscillatory power in the STN LFP, and that this is true irrespective of the <b>frequency</b> at which <b>synchronisation</b> occurs across a broad band from 8 - 35 Hz...|$|R

The master solution embodies all particular solutions of the finite-size Kuramoto model for any frequency distribution and coupling strength larger than the critical one.

40|$|Abstract — White LEDs {{are set to}} {{penetrate}} many areas of everyday life. An interesting property of these devices (in addition to their lightening capabilities) {{is that they can}} be utilised for data transmission. In the past, primarily OOK (on-off keying) has been used for digital data modulation of such devices. OOK imposes limitations on the achievable data rates. Therefore, in this paper OFDM is considered in combination with higher order modulation schemes. A hardware demonstrator with an entire link chain (transmitter and receiver) is developed and measured BER (bit error ratio) results are reported. The system uses pilot sub-carriers to correct <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronisation</b> errors, training sequences for channel estimation and time synchronisation routines.

40|$|<b>Frequency</b> {{specific}} <b>synchronisation</b> of neuronal firing {{within the}} gamma-band (30 - 70 Hz) {{appears to be}} a fundamental correlate of both basic sensory and higher cognitive processing. In-vitro studies suggest that the neurochemical basis of gamma-band oscillatory activity is based on interactions between excitatory (i. e. glutamate) and inhibitory (i. e. GABA) neurotransmitter concentrations. However, {{the nature of the relationship}} between excitatory neurotransmitter concentration and changes in gamma band activity in humans remains undetermined. Here, we examine the links between dynamic glutamate concentration and the formation of functional gamma-band oscillatory networks. Using concurrently acquired event-related magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electroencephalography, during a repetition-priming paradigm, we demonstrate an interaction between stimulus type (object vs. abstract pictures) and repetition in evoked gamma-band oscillatory activity, and find that glutamate levels within the lateral occipital cortex, differ in response to these distinct stimulus categories. Importantly, we show that dynamic glutamate levels are related to the amplitude of stimulus evoked gamma-band (but not to beta, alpha or theta or ERP) activity. These results highlight the specific connection between excitatory neurotransmitter concentration and amplitude of oscillatory response, providing a novel insight into the relationship between the neurochemical and neurophysiological processes underlying cognition...|$|R
40|$|Interest in beta {{activity}} in the basal ganglia has mushroomed since it was first identified in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease in Jonathan Dostrovsky's landmark paper (Levy et al., 2000). Here we consider a less explored phenomenon; namely gamma <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronisation</b> of neurons in the basal ganglia. Gamma oscillations {{have been reported in}} a distributed network involving the basal ganglia, thalamus and motor cortex, and have been described {{in a wide range of}} diseases as well as during increased arousal and voluntary movement. In Parkinson's disease, gamma activity is promoted by dopaminergic therapy.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. A ring laser gyroscope is a device which employs a ring laser to measure rotation. A ring laser supports two beams propagating in opposite directions around the ring resonator. When the gyroscope is rotated, the frequencies of the two beams split by an amount proportional to the rate of rotation: the device works by measuring this frequency splitting. The main problem of ring laser gyroscope design is the <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronisation</b> - lock-in - of the two beams at low rates of rotation. Lock-in arises from weak mutual coupling caused by backscattering at the mirrors and results in a dead band around zero. One of the possible solutions to this problem is a two-mode ring laser in which two modes oscillate simultaneously and interact to reduce the dead band. The present work reviews the theory of lock-in and offers a theoretical basis for this approach, {{as well as providing}} experimental evidence to support it...|$|E
30|$|In most {{nonlinear}} systems, where sub-systems {{exist that}} are coupled {{together by the}} transfer of energy or mass, some form of synchronisation develops if the coupling strength is large enough (Romano Blasco 2004; Marwan et al. 2007 a). Synchronisation in seismic systems has been discussed by Perez et al. (1996), Sammis and Smith (2013), Scholz (2010) and Bendick and Bilham (2017). Synchronisation develops because the coupling inhibits some frequencies and enhances others so that a particular range of frequencies survives in {{the system as a}} whole. Phase and/or <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronisation</b> are the commonly envisaged forms of synchronisation but these are actually relatively rare and the more common form is generalised synchronisation where the behaviour of one sub-system is a (generally nonlinear) function of the behaviour of other sub-systems. Generalised synchronisation is difficult to detect but cross and joint recurrence plots offer fast and efficient means of detection and investigation. In cross recurrent plots lines of synchronisation (LOSs) develop and the slope of these lines is tan− 1 (T 1 /T 2) where T 1 and T 2 are the characteristic times of processes operating in two synchronised sub-systems.|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{neuronal}} discharge within the basal ganglia is disturbed in Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, {{there is a}} tendency for neuronal elements to synchronise at around 20 Hz in the absence of dopaminergic treatment, whereas this activity can be replaced by spontaneous synchronisation at much higher frequencies (> 70 Hz) following dopaminergic treatment [J. Neurosci. 21 (2001) 1033; Brain 126 (2003) 2153]. In two PD patients (3 sides), we show that stimulating the subthalamic area at around 20 Hz exacerbates <b>synchronisation</b> at similar <b>frequencies</b> in the globus pallidus interna, the major output structure of the human basal ganglia. In contrast, stimulating the subthalamic area at > 70 Hz suppresses pallidal activity at about 20 Hz. Clinically, stimulation of the subthalamic area at similar high frequencies reverses parkinsonism and forms the basis of therapeutic deep brain stimulation in PD. The results point to a possible common mechanism by which both dopaminergic treatment associated synchronisation of subthalamic activity at very high <b>frequency</b> and <b>synchronisation</b> imposed by therapeutic stimulation of the subthalamic area inhibit an abnormal and potentially deleterious synchronisation of basal ganglia output at around 20 Hz.

40|$|Otrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) system {{performance}} remains acceptable under timing synchronisation errors {{as long as}} the start of each symbol is determined to lie within a certain length into the Cyclie Prefix (CP). The Schmidl and Cox Algorithm (SCA) is quite robust in estimating the timing and <b>frequency</b> offset <b>synchronisation</b> for systems with large OFDM symbol lengths. It uses two OFDM symbols for training with the first one having two identical halves. The start of the frame is estimated by correlating a received sequence of samples equal to half the OFDM symbol length with the following received samples. The effect of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) in the estimation process is mitigated only if the number of samples used in the correlation, and hence the OFDM symbol size is large. However to be successfully applied to Broadband Fixed Wireless Access (BFWA) systems, OFDM should perform well even with smaller symbol lengths. In this paper we present the Iterative Symbol Offset Correction Algorithm (ISOCA), which uses the SCA for initial coarse timing synchronisation and follows it with a two stage symbol offset correction algorithm by tracking the phase of the second training symbol.
