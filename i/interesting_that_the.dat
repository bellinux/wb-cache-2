5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be found}} <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{specific}} speed coefficient {{may be used in}} place of speed to define the y-axis of Figure 1.2, while at the same time, the specific diameter coefficient may be in place of diameter to define the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|The blossoming of {{literature}} in the Ardalan principality was accompanied by an intense cultivation of music. Music is {{an essential element of}} the cultural tradition of the Yarsan religious community. In connection with this, it is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kurds in East and South Kurdistan, where to the Gorani culture was spread, call songs 'Gorani'.|$|E

25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} bonding factors in Assyrian tribes and it's <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribes {{adjacent}} to the Nochiyaye; Urmijnaye to the east, Gawarnaye to the north, Jilwaye to the west and Barwarnayeh to the southwest, all have completely different accents, to the point that some are almost unintelligible to the Nochiyaye.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court of Chancery was acting, here, in {{its most}} ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} {{wrongdoer}} through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for specific performance, which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{distinction}} between the first two rules and the latter rule {{can also be found}} in early treatises on music, introducing the terms metrum and rhythmus. As it could also be demonstrated by Van Kampen that melodic peaks often coincide with the word accent (see also), the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).|$|E

25|$|Turbomachinery analysts gain {{tremendous}} {{insight into}} performance by comparisons of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients {{which are also}} dimensionless. In general application, the flow coefficient and head coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> speed coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, {{while at the same}} time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|The {{diameter}} of the orifice and cavity is d, the distance between orifice and cavity is h, and the orifice pressure P was given in kilograms per meter squared. At the lower limit of h the second term disappears. In this case, the equation could have been reformatted {{in terms of the}} acoustical Strouhal number as shown in the second equation above. The characteristic speed U at the nozzle is the sound speed c0. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number is very close to that found by Strouhal for flow over a cylinder. There are two characteristic length scales. Nozzle diameter d characterizes the sound power while the separation distance h characterizes the frequency.|$|E

500|$|Moynahan {{made her}} feature-film {{debut in the}} 2000 comedy-drama Coyote Ugly as Rachel, a bartender/dancer in a wild New York bar, a role that is {{considered}} Moynahan's breakthrough. She had accepted the role because she [...] "thought it was <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole movie revolved around five women…and my character was so strong and independent". The film garnered generally unfavorable critical reviews, but was a box-office success, earning $133million worldwide. Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fiancée of John Cusack's character.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers at Famitsu {{commented on}} the {{user-friendliness}} of the game system, with its quick save function and shortcuts, {{and said that the}} game has enough to pull the player in until the end. Neal Chandran at RPGFan said that the Infinity series had become more and more interesting with each game. He called the character designs [...] "excellent" [...] and distinct from those in previous games in the series; he found it <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character designs in previous games, which took place in [...] "watery" [...] settings, had brighter and less earthy colors, while Remember 11, which takes place in the mountains, makes more use of earthy colors.|$|E
500|$|Connor {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared with other}} male characters of the series {{in terms of the}} presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction. His sexual relation with his surrogate mother, coupled with his struggles to kill his father, led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the character. and references to Arthurian Legend were also made. In Erin B. Waggoner's book Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon, he found it <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancient Oedipus complex continues {{to be used as a}} way to underscore one's masculinity, but he added that [...] "Connor is not the only one [...] Angel, Wes, Spike and even Fred (through Gunn) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals." [...] Further citing Gwen's role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle, he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up.|$|E
30|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that,</b> since <b>the</b> {{function}} h_a,b;c(x) defined by (28) originates {{from the}} coding gain (see Lee and Tepedelenlioğlu 2011; Qi and Li 2015), Theorem  6 and its proof imply some connections and relations among the Catalan numbers, the coding gain, and {{the ratio of}} two gamma functions.|$|R

5000|$|I {{found it}} <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> tape Iraq was mentioned, {{which is a}} {{reminder}} that Iraq is part of the war against extremists. If Al-Qaeda bothers to mention Iraq, it's because they want to achieve their objectives in Iraq, which is to drive us out.|$|R
500|$|Moffat {{found it}} <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Doctor {{regularly}} experienced {{time out of}} order and was used to a whole different kind of causality. He believed that the Doctor would attempt to cheat and break his own rules to save the universe from collapsing. The time travel used in the episode {{is compatible with the}} theory of time travel. As the episode features many [...] "time-jumps" [...] when the Doctor travels back to do things seen in the opening credits, Moffat decided to make it less complicated by allowing the audience to figure things out before they occurred. He did this by calling attention to the future-Doctor in the opening scenes by having him wearing a fez and holding a mop, and as the viewers saw the Doctor later acquire these items they would begin to connect the events. Moffat mentioned the fez to fellow executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis; they both were worried that Smith would become too attached to the hat and want to incorporate it into his costume, but Moffat assured him that he was planning on destroying the fez. Wenger later stated that Smith was [...] "one {{of the few people who}} can pull off a fez".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, McAdams starred {{opposite}} Channing Tatum in {{the romantic}} drama The Vow, {{based on a}} true story. McAdams and Tatum played a newlywed couple who try to rebuild their relationship after a car crash leaves the wife with no recollections of who he is or their marriage. McAdams was drawn to the [...] "roller coaster" [...] faced by her character and found it <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> story was told [...] "through the guy's eyes". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that [...] "the dimply and adorable Rachel McAdams" [...] brings [...] "enough physical charm and emotional warmth to distract from the threadbare setting and the paper-thin plot". Joseph Amodio of Newsday felt that McAdams, [...] "exuding her usual uncanny warmth on-screen", [...] "is the real draw". However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she was [...] "wasted" [...] in the role: [...] "She is such an appealing actress that it's hard not to wish someone could make better use" [...] of her. Mary Pols of Time found the film an example of McAdams [...] "coasting" [...] in [...] "unabashedly romantic" [...] movies and asserted that [...] "she's a much more versatile and clever actress" [...] than such projects would suggest. The film, financed for $30 million, was a major commercial success and became her biggest box-office hit in a leading role. It topped the U.S. box office and has grossed over $196 million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CRS {{reduction}} {{value is}} the same as the 2005 Montana CSRS study that indicated a 14% reduction in accidents on Interstate highways.

2500|$|Xenophon {{describes}} Persian (lit.: [...] "barbarian", meaning: non-Greek) carpets as precious, {{and worthy}} {{to be used}} as diplomatic gifts. It is unknown if these carpets were pile-woven, or produced by another technique, e.g., flat-weaving, or embroidery, but it is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very first reference to Persian carpets in the world literature already puts them into a context of luxury, prestige, and diplomacy.|$|E
2500|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{first known}} {{codification}} of the Laws of Cricket, {{created by the}} London Cricket Club in 1744, {{makes no mention of}} prescribed bowling action and does not say the ball must be delivered at ground level, which suggests a pitched delivery would not be illegal. [...] The rules for bowlers in the 1744 Laws focus on the position of the hind foot during delivery (i.e., it had to be behind the bowling crease) and overstepping is the only specified cause for calling a no ball. [...] The umpires were granted [...] "discretion" [...] and so presumably would call no ball if, say, a ball was thrown by the bowler.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping to find something that was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found it <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil yourself if you don't stop once what's been necessary is done. So I also found it intriguing that we're just seeing these wonderful, perfect people but the father comes back and goes out of his way to do this." ...|$|E
