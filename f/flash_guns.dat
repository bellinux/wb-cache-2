2500|$|After World War II, {{production}} of the Minox II began in 1948 at a new company, Minox GmbH, in Giessen/Heuchelheim near Wetzlar, West Germany. The new camera very much resembled the original, but was made with a plastic chassis covered by an aluminum shell. This greatly reduced its weight and, to an extent, cost. The camera continued {{to appeal to a}} luxury [...] "gadget" [...] market which broadened during the 1950s and early 1960s. It also continued to see use as an espionage camera by both sides during the Cold War. During this time, the Minox company continued to develop the camera, working with Gossen to develop a companion miniature exposure meter, as well as improved models such as the Minox B, which incorporated an even smaller Gossen-designed meter into the camera itself. The Minox B became the most popular and widely produced model of the line. Further developments included autoexposure, and the company developed an extensive line of accessories. These included <b>flash</b> <b>guns,</b> viewfinder attachments, tripod mounts, and copying stands, all increasing the camera utility in a variety of applications. One accessory even allowed the camera to use a pair of binoculars as a telephoto lens (see illustration). Limited editions of the camera were also produced in a variety of luxury finishes, such as gold plating. Standard cameras were also available in an optional black anodized finish.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{external}} <b>flash</b> <b>guns</b> have integrated autofocus assist lamps that {{replace the}} stroboscopic on-camera flash. Another way to assist contrast based AF systems in low light is to beam a laser pattern {{on to the}} subject. The laser method is commercially called Hologram AF Laser and was used in Sony Cybershot cameras around the year 2003, including Sony's F707, F717 and F828 models.|$|E

5000|$|The Truvelo {{camera is}} usually a front-facing camera (it can also be rear-facing) taking {{pictures}} using a <b>flash</b> <b>gun</b> fitted with a magenta filter [...] (the driver {{is less likely to}} be dazzled by the flash light). The reflected light provides the film with the correct exposure resulting in a clear picture of the driver committing the offence (considered as incriminating evidence).|$|R
50|$|Electronic flash was {{developed}} in the late 1950s while flashbulbs were still in general use. Early units were expensive and often large and heavy as the power unit was a separate unit to the flash gun head and was powered by a large lead-acid battery, and usually carried by the photographer by means of a shoulder strap. Towards the end of the 1960s, the size had dropped {{to the point where they}} were matching the size of conventional bulb <b>flash</b> <b>guns</b> (though the price, having dropped, was still an obstacle). The electronic flash system eventually superseded bulb guns as prices came down, rendering flashbulbs virtually obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|SQ-Ai: Introduced December 1990, {{production}} discontinued December 2003. Added the following functionality to the SQ-A. Ability {{to add the}} motor drive SQ-i and off the film (TTL-OTF) metering with select <b>flash</b> <b>guns.</b> These changes required {{the addition of a}} circuit board which also required the battery compartment to be [...] "flattened." [...] The single 6v cell was replaced with four 1.5 volt [...] "button" [...] cells. A bulb 'B' setting was added to the shutter speed selector. The film-back was also modified again with the introduction of the SQ-Ai, relocating the ISO dial {{to the rear of the}} film-back (rather than on top) to allow the speed setting to be seen better with a prism attached. Exposure compensation control was also added to the new SQ-Ai film-back, with the ISO range extended to 6400.|$|E
5000|$|The all-glass PF1 bulb was {{introduced}} in 1954. [...] Eliminating both the metal base, and the multiple manufacturing steps needed to attach it to the glass bulb, cut the cost substantially compared to the larger M series bulbs. The design required a fibre ring around the base to hold the contact wires {{against the side of}} the glass base. An adapter was available allowing the bulb to fit into <b>flash</b> <b>guns</b> that accepted the bayonet capped bulbs. The PF1 (along with the M2) had a faster ignition time (less delay between shutter contact and peak output), so it could be used with X synch below 1/30 of a secondâ€”while most bulbs require a shutter speed of 1/15 on X synch to keep the shutter open long enough for the bulb to ignite and burn. A smaller version, the AG-1 {{was introduced}} in 1958 which did not require the fibre ring. Though it was smaller and had reduced light output, it was cheaper to manufacture and rapidly supplanted the PF1.|$|E

50|$|For the 1997 River Taw series {{she worked}} at night, placing {{photographic}} paper on the river bed and allowing the images to be exposed through ambient light, aided {{by the use of}} a <b>flash</b> <b>gun.</b> Her technique involved a very direct and unmediated physical relationship with the landscape, while her Under The Moon series involved working with photographs of the moon and combining these with water and branch patterns exposed to sound vibrations in the darkroom.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the many}} {{features}} the OM-2 boasted, {{the most commonly}} advertised feature {{was that it was}} the first camera to offer a TTL direct metering system for film, named Auto Dynamic Metering (ADM). This [...] "off the film metering" [...] was the first ever. Another feature of the OM-2 was the integration of two available electronic <b>flash</b> <b>guns</b> into the system. The camera set the duration and intensity of the flash during exposure using its inbuilt sensors by measuring the amount of light reflected off the film. This ensured excellent results under difficult conditions. Exposure calculation was unique thanks to the twin [...] "silicon blue cell" [...] sensors which, for shutter speeds of 1/60s and above, measured light reflected off a graduated patterned surface on the lens side of the shutter. For shutter speeds below 1/60s, exposure was calculated from the amount of light reflected off the film surface during the exposure. The shutter was a horizontal-running cloth type. In auto-exposure mode the camera was capable of giving exposures from 60s-1/1000s (OM-2N, 120s-1/1000s). The camera also offered a metered manual-exposure mode, with speeds of 1s-1/1000s, plus B.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s color had started {{replacing}} {{black and white}} for shooting weddings, and electronic <b>flash</b> <b>guns</b> replaced flash bulbs. A technical shortcoming of color was a much shorter range on the prints which could not reproduce {{the full range of}} detail in a photograph containing a bride in white dress standing with the groom in a black suit when a single flash on camera was used. Familiar with conventional studio lighting, thanks in part to training with New Jersey photographer Joe Zeltsman, Monte understood that the solution to the shorter range film was to control the range of the scene with two lights; one off camera for modeling (key light), over a foundation of even centered light (fill) to control the tone of the shadows. With the invention of the photo-cell trigger which allowed wireless firing of the off-camera [...] "key" [...] flash, Monte utilized the technology to create studio-like lighting [...] "on the fly" [...] at wedding receptions using two identical direct flash units, one mounted over the camera as fill to control the shadow tone and a second optically triggered key light for 3D modeling which he mounted on a rolling converted medical IV stand, a clever solution to the logistics of working with the off-camera light.|$|E

Clues for this example set might be: WILD, RED, <b>FLASH,</b> <b>GUN,</b> ANTS, SIDE, TRUCK, HYDRANT, and finally FIGHTER. The good word, of course, is FIRE.|$|R

'Doc' Coombs was notable for a facial 'tic', which gave him something of the appearance of the 'mad professor', and these days would probably be classed under Tourette's syndrome.|$|R

Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revoltâ€“no matter how achieved.|$|R
