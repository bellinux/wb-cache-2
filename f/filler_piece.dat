5000|$|Cartoon Network {{also created}} a 2-minute <b>filler</b> <b>piece</b> {{featuring}} Marvin, entitled [...] "Mars Forever" [...] by Fantastic Plastic Machine. It's a disco-style video combining clips of Marvin and Bugs Bunny from their encounters in [...] "Haredevil Hare", [...] "Hare-Way to the Stars", as well as bits of [...] "Duck Dodgers in the 24th-and-a-half Century" [...] and [...] "Rocket-bye Baby".|$|E
5000|$|The {{magazine}} also {{publishes a}} print anthology series. Luke Rhinehart touted their first anthology as an impetus for inspiring him {{to want to}} write short stories again. In Examiner.com, Mary Beth Magee praised the variety {{and quality of the}} writing in Lowestoft Chronicles 2015 anthology Other Places and Frank Mundo said of the 2013 anthology, Intrepid Travelers: [...] "Without a single stinker or <b>filler</b> <b>piece</b> in the bunch, this wonderful 160-page 'little' anthology definitely bids well for the strength of work the online magazine version must regularly publish.” The Lancashire Evening Post, called Intrepid Travelers [...] "a coruscating cornucopia of humour, drama and big, beautiful adventures", and Other Places [...] "a mouth-watering feast", noting: [...] "Packed into the pages are stories to entice, enthral, and entertain...incisive and enlightening interviews...and a tasty blend of pleasing and deftly prepared poems." ...|$|E
5000|$|Venturo House is a modular, {{insulated}} and transportable building system. The {{walls and}} top {{are made of}} double-layer fiberglass with two inches thick polyurethane foam and the floor is made of plywood. The floor area is 45 m² and the house weighs four tons. It was shipped in two modules, one containing the bathroom, kitchen and sauna and the other including the <b>filler</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1926, 1, 2, 10, 20 and 50 fillér and 1 pengő coins were introduced. The 1 and 2 <b>fillér</b> <b>pieces</b> were bronze, the 10, 20 and 50 fillér were {{cupro-nickel}} and the 1 pengő coins were 64% silver. In 1929, 2 pengő coins were introduced, also in 64% silver. Commemorative 2 and 5 pengő coins {{were also}} issued on anniversaries, with a non-commemorative 5 pengő coin issued in 1939.|$|R
5000|$|The D-10 '8' had finish checks, {{shrunken}} end <b>pieces,</b> <b>filler</b> discolorations, dents {{and/or a}} very thin finish.|$|R
5000|$|Vasquez's first comic, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, ran {{for seven}} issues and was {{collected}} as a hardcover and a trade paperback book, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut. The cover features the logo [...] "Z?", meaning [...] "question sleep", which appears frequently throughout Vasquez's work and relates to his characters' insomnia {{and his own}} hypnophobia. The series follows Johnny as he searches for meaning in his life, a quest that frequently leads to the violent deaths of those around him as well as, briefly, his own. A photograph of one of Vasquez's friends, Leah England, serves as {{the middle of a}} portrait collection on the cover for the second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a filler strip about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the notorious [...] "Meanwhile" [...] <b>filler</b> <b>piece</b> in the second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. Vasquez's next project was The Bad Art Collection, a 16-page one-shot comic. He stated that he did the book's art while {{he was in high school}} to discourage classmates from asking him to draw for them.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewer Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} C+ {{and said}} [...] "much of this episode felt like <b>filler,</b> a {{transitional}} <b>piece</b> {{before we get to}} the big hit." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{becoming}} {{an editor at}} Lev Gleason and revamping Jack Binder's original Golden Age Daredevil in 1940, Cole was hired at Quality Comics. He worked with Will Eisner, assisting on the writer-artist's signature hero The Spirit—a masked crime-fighter created for a weekly syndicated newspaper Sunday supplement and reprinted in Quality Comics. At the behest of Quality publisher Everett [...] "Busy" [...] Arnold, Cole later created his own satiric, Spirit-style hero, Midnight, for Smash Comics No. 18 (Jan. 1941). Midnight, the alter ego of radio announcer Dave Clark, wore a similar fedora hat and domino mask, and partnered with a talking monkey—questionably {{in place of the}} Spirit's young African-American sidekick, Ebony White. During Eisner's World War II military service, Cole and Lou Fine were the primary Spirit ghost artists; their stories were reprinted in DC Comics' hardcover collections The Spirit Archives Vols. 5 to 9 (2001-2003), spanning July 1942 - Dec. 1944. In addition, Cole continued to draw one and two-page <b>filler</b> <b>pieces,</b> sometimes under the pseudonym Ralph Johns, and a memorable autobiographical appearance in [...] "Inki," [...] which appeared in Crack Comics #34.|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} of the results for a Station Black-Out analysis for Atucha 2 Nuclear Power Plant is presented here. Calculations were performed with MELCOR 1. 8. 6 YV 3165 Code. Atucha 2 is a pressurized heavy water reactor, cooled and moderated with heavy water, by two separate systems, presently under final construction in Argentina. The initiating event is loss of power, accompanied {{by the failure of}} four out of four diesel generators. All remaining plant safety systems are supposed to be available. It is assumed that during the Station Black-Out sequence the first pressurizer safety valve fails stuck open after 3 cycles of water release, respectively, 17 cycles in total. During the transient, the water in the fuel channels evaporates first while the moderator tank is still partially full. The moderator tank inventory acts as a temporary heat sink for the decay heat, which is evacuated through conduction and radiation heat transfer, delaying core degradation. This feature, together with the large volume of the steel <b>filler</b> <b>pieces</b> in the lower plenum and a high primary system volume to thermal power ratio, derives in a very slow transient in which RPV failure time is four to five times larger than that of other German PWRs...|$|R
2500|$|Soldering is a joining {{process that}} occurs at {{temperatures}} below [...] It {{is similar to}} brazing {{in the way that}} a filler is melted and drawn into a capillary to form a join, although at a lower temperature. Because of this lower temperature and different alloys used as fillers, the metallurgical reaction between <b>filler</b> and work <b>piece</b> is minimal, resulting in a weaker joint.|$|R

It then presents the experimental {{results of the}} adhesive strength deterrminarea the tensile load and resistance to {{the movement of the}} shear adherence, achieving an increase in the adhesive strength of 8 - 15...|$|R
50|$|Flash welding {{is a type}} of {{resistance}} welding that does not use any <b>filler</b> metals. The <b>pieces</b> of metal to be welded are set apart at a predetermined distance based on material thickness, material composition, and desired properties of the finished weld. Current is applied to the metal, and the gap between the two pieces creates resistance and produces the arc required to melt the metal. Once the pieces of metal reach the proper temperature, they are pressed together, effectively forge welding them together.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the case study}} to find the design optimization for special purpose MIG welding operation. The MIG Welding parameters {{are the most important}} factors affecting the quality, productivity and cost of welding. This paper {{presents the}} effect of welding parameters like welding current, welding voltage, welding speed, gas flow rate, rotational speed of work <b>piece,</b> <b>filler</b> wire feed rate on MIG welding. Experiments are conducted based on Taguchi Technique to achieve the required data. An Orthogonal Array, Signal to Noise (S/N) ratio and analysis of varience (ANOVA) are used to find out the welding characteristics and optimization parameters. Finally the confirmations tests have been carried out to compare the predicted values with the experimental values...|$|R
