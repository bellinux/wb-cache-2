5|$|It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a feel-good record {{but when}} you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E
5000|$|We hadn't {{thought at}} all about the Nazi implications. It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a very anarchic, stylish thing to do.|$|R

500|$|... "It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a great adventure—{{something}} I {{wanted to}} do. Why? I'm not certain, other than {{we both knew}} we would be doing something that hadn't been done before." ...|$|R
2500|$|Einziger noted, [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a very {{appropriate}} {{name for the}} album because we've been {{in the spirit of}} taking risk, stepping up and making a leap. For us, it's a very common theme for us to take chances, to do things differently. There's something exciting and equally scary about that idea. Now we've nothing left to lose, really. We've kind of accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish as a band; at this point we're just living our dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the album on Punknews.org was far more {{critical}} of the album, stating [...] "there is [...] "substance" [...] here—there are guitar solos, tempo changes, gang vocals—but there isn't substance. There's no authenticity; it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the songs were built from a collection of [...] "brutal" [...] ideas written on pieces of paper, put together in a hat, and splashed out on the floor." [...] The album received a 1.5 out of 5 rating. A review on AbsolutePunk was also critical of the album, stating that while some songs were [...] "heavy, but catchy" [...] and [...] "sounds like {{it would have a}} room full of people moshing until they drop", at some points it feels like the band is [...] "half-arseing it", going on to say [...] "Sometimes you wish they would throw in some thrash beats, and fast riffing. This can disappoint and I feel like a few solo's wouldn't go amiss." [...] However, the reviewer concludes by saying [...] "All in all, Suicide Season has impressed me. The boys from BMTH have come back and shown they aren't just a generic haircuts band." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{collaborating with}} American female rapper Nicki Minaj on the song [...] "I'm Legit" [...] for Minaj's album , Minaj agreed {{to appear on}} Ciara's album in return. Originally, the duo had worked on just one {{collaboration}} for Ciara called [...] "I'm Out". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that thing that she does that's so special. She went in." [...] Having enjoyed the process Minaj said [...] "I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm {{going to end up}} doing two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it." [...] In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; in an interview with MTV News, Ciara said, [...] "She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see she and I rock together." [...] In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned [...] "Livin' It Up". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, [...] "Where You Go", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, [...] "She's like, 'I need this song. It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> it was just speaking to me. Give it to me, give it to me.' I was like, 'Man cool, you can have it." ...|$|E

3000|$|It didn’t feel {{directed}} enough … I {{was kind}} of like why are we doing this, it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a random fun activity… I mean it’s fun but there’s not point to it {{in the grand scheme of}} things. (Student 6) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|In August 17, 2015, Chalupny {{announced}} that she was retiring from international soccer after Celebration Tour. She said: [...] "there is {{no better way to}} go out than as a world champion and this <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the right time to put a cap on my international career" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd be awful sorry {{myself if}} Pat died. But if he DID, we'd {{have to give}} him the right kind of a funeral," [...] he protested. [...] "Why, Paddy <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> one of the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} laughed over it so happily if I had my baby," [...] she sobbed to Marilla. [...] "But when I haven't it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> wanton cruelty--though I know Phil wouldn't hurt me for the world. Oh, Marilla, I don't see how I can EVER be happy again--EVERYTHING will hurt me {{all the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
5000|$|As Alex Story {{describes}} it:When he puts that makeup on, that's like warpaint or something. It's like he's {{going into}} battle. He literally transforms himself. ... He <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an animal, like a monster.|$|E
5000|$|Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 5/5. [...] "I bet {{this was an}} {{incredible}} episode to film. The {{last part of the}} half hour with all the clips of their adventures really <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> we were watching the actors on a real life vacation. It must've been amazing!" ...|$|R
25|$|Because Siegel and Shuster {{were both}} Jewish, some {{religious}} commentators and pop-culture {{scholars such as}} Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist Howard Jacobson suggest that Superman's creation was partly influenced by Moses and other Jewish elements. However, Siegel and Shuster claim that having Superman {{drop out of the}} sky <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good idea.|$|R
500|$|Linda McCartney died {{of cancer}} at age 56 on April 17, 1998. The Simpsons season nine episode [...] "Trash of the Titans", which aired on April 26, 1998, was {{dedicated}} to her memory.

5000|$|In 2006, {{the band}} {{reformed}} and recorded a new album. Helmkamp {{said of the}} reunion: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the planets realigned. It's not like we didn't get along or that there were any bridges to mend." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork was critical, writing, [...] "Beyond the melodies that dont {{stick in}} my head and the beats that dont make me want to dance, the only real problem with Souljacker ... is that it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an underachievement." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tarantino used {{an eclectic}} {{assortment}} of songs by various artists. Notable songs include Dick Dale's now-iconic rendition of [...] "Misirlou", which is played {{during the opening}} credits.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with CNN in 2005, Hubert explained: [...] "In the book, by Jeff Brown, Stanley gets squashed flat by a falling bulletin board.

I've never met people who have kids who haven't {{looked me in the}} eye and been like, [...] "It's the {{greatest}} thing that's ever happened." ... I think it's biological. I'm 30.

50|$|Remembering his {{childhood}} Dave said: “It was tougher back then; I’ve {{had a rough}} life. But I can remember everything. From horse and cart days right up until today; jet planes and computers. When I was a boy there weren’t even any fences. No electricity lines or phone lines. No roads, nothing. You could just head out across country and you wouldn’t have to open any gates or anything like that. All just open prairie. The world has changed so quickly in just one lifetime.
