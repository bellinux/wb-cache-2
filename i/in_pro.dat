30|$|For {{the first}} time, the PROMs Conference {{was awarded the}} ‘Patients Included’ Chartermark. Patient/public {{partners}} were valued members of the Conference Organising Committee and their contributions influenced the content and delivery of the event. In particular, patient/public partners wanted the Conference to be an opportunity to underline the importance of involving patients <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> development, share best practice, and explore new ideas/strategies. This was achieved through: Plenary Discussions, which offered both patient and academic perspectives on patient involvement <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> research; a dedicated panel on ‘Pushing the Boundaries of Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> research’; and presenting an award to the research team demonstrating the ‘Best PPI’. The Conference was co-chaired by patient partner, Gary Price, which underlined the clear commitment from the Conference Organisers to public involvement <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> research.|$|R

5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best <b>in</b> <b>pro</b> football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 season, the Giants, who had {{previously}} been renting the Polo Grounds from baseball's Giants {{at a rate of}} $75,000 a year, began playing their home games at Yankee Stadium. The Giants run of championship game appearances in their late 1950s and early 1960s combined with their large market location translated into financial success. In 1958 they set a new home attendance record when 71,163 fans attended their November 8 game against Baltimore. And in 1959 they established their next four highest home game totals by drawing between 66,000 and 68,000 fans for games versus the Eagles, Packers, Browns, and Steelers. By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract with CBS—four times as much as small-market Green Bay, {{which was one of the}} most successful teams of the era. However, in the league's new contract, the Maras convinced the other owners that it would be in the best interest of the NFL to share television revenue equally, a practice which is still current, and is credited with strengthening the NFL. The Giants and professional football as a whole, were helped financially by their contest versus the Baltimore Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship game. The televised game became the first professional football game to go into overtime, and is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the US. The explosion in interest <b>in</b> <b>pro</b> football was evidenced in the Giants financials: in 1956 they had less than 8,000 season ticket holders and by 1963 that number had increased to over 50,000. They sold out every home game in 1962 and 1963. Additionally, while scalpers hardly existed in 1956, by 1963 they regularly received $25 for a $5 ticket.|$|E

5|$|The game {{offers several}} {{gameplay}} modes. Career mode is broken into six tiers of five tracks, each {{based on a}} period in Aerosmith's history. Furthermore, within each tier, there are two Opening Acts, featuring non-Aerosmith songs, that must be completed before the Aerosmith songs can be played; the final song in each tier is an encore once the other four songs are completed. As the player completes this mode, they will also be presented with video clips talking about the band and other trivia about the band. The Career mode features one Boss Battle (against Joe Perry) as introduced in Guitar Hero III. Any unlocked song can be played in Quick Play mode, Co-operative mode, with one player on lead guitar {{and the other on}} bass, and Competitive mode, including the Battle modes. Unlike Guitar Hero III, there is no Co-Operative Career mode. One significant upgrade from Guitar Hero III is the addition of score balancing <b>in</b> <b>Pro</b> Face Off multiplayer mode, which allows each player to choose their own difficulty while still allowing each side to play the full note chart, instead of switching back and forth within regular Face Off.|$|E

40|$|As {{observed}} {{from the}} reviewed literature, {{the execution of}} research and development (R and D) projects in Nigeria is challenged by many social, political and economic factors interacting in complex and dynamic ways. This interaction is reflected in the history of science and technology in Nigeria, its culture, legal systems, institutional frameworks and social capital. The economic and social development of Nigeria is critically dependent upon the ability to establish a competitive, productive and efficient industrial sector built on a strong technology base. This implies that her natural resources must be developed and utilised as inputs to industrial production and as direct products to improve the life of the population. Public research organisations (PROs) are considered to be critical to the survival of industries and to the achievement of self-reliance through the use of locally available raw materials. This thesis explores the application of strategic project management (SPM) practices in the execution of R and D projects <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. The research employed a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative research in order to capture the experiences of project management practitioners with SPM practices <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. Although areas of variations in practice were identified, the major findings highlighted that there was a gap in the practical implementation of SPM. The findings also revealed key determinants associated with the implementation of SPM and the factors that affected its application <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. The research findings were further synthesised into a framework, capturing ten key dimensions that {{must be taken into account}} in the execution {{of research and development}} projects. The determinants include having a project-based organisational structure, top management involvement in the project execution, strategic project leadership style, the appointment of a project team, the project team's competence, project alignment with organisational strategy, project prioritisation and selection, maximising R and D strategy, the project management process, and the SPM process. The framework validation was a follow-up discussion, which was conducted with project management practitioners in the selected research organisations in Nigeria. Reflecting on their experiences in the management of R and D projects, the participants acknowledged that the proposed SPM framework and its ten key variables were fundamental to the effective execution of R and D projects <b>in</b> <b>PROs</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. It was concluded that the use of such a framework would highlight areas that needed to be addressed in order to achieve effective execution of R and D projects in these organisations...|$|R
