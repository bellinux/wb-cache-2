50|$|Because the {{umbilical}} cord—the baby’s oxygen supply—is significantly compressed while {{the head is}} in the pelvis during a breech birth, {{it is important that}} the delivery of the aftercoming fetal head not be delayed. If the arm is extended alongside the head, delivery will not occur. If this occurs, the Løvset manoeuvre may be employed, or the arm may be manually brought to a position in front of the chest. The Løvset manoeuvre involves rotating the fetal body by holding the <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvis.</b> Twisting the body such that an arm trails behind the shoulder, it will tend to cross down over the face to a position where it can be reached by the obstetrician's finger, and brought to a position below the head. A similar rotation in the opposite direction is made to deliver the other arm. In order to present the smallest diameter (9.5 cm) to the pelvis, the baby’s head must be flexed (chin to chest). If the head is in a deflexed position, the risk of entrapment is increased. Uterine contractions and maternal muscle tone encourage the head to flex.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of the fetal iliac wing angle measurements in the detection of trisomy 21 during the second trimester and the impact of the fetal position on this measurement. During a 43 -month period, the iliac wing angle was prospectively measured in 695 fetuses at genetic ultrasonography performed before amniocentesis. The iliac wing angle measurements were performed in a true axial section of the <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvis</b> and the relative position of the fetal spine was recorded (decubitus, lateral). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio (LR) were computed for multiple cutoff angles. The prevalence of trisomy 21 was 1. 4 %; 447 fetuses were in lateral position, 240 fetuses were in decubitus position, including, respectively, 2 and 8 fetuses with trisomy 21 (8 fetuses with other chromosomal anomalies were excluded). In euploid fetuses, the mean iliac wing angle was 83. 7 ° in decubitus and 68. 7 ° in lateral position; in fetuses with trisomy 21 the respective mean angles were 104. 9 ° and 102. 5 °. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve provided an absolute cutoff angle of 90 °, predicting trisomy 21 with a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 72. 4 %, an NPV of 100 %, a PPV value of 11. 1 %, and an LR of 3. 6. The measurement of iliac wing angles in an axial section of the <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvis</b> is dependent on spine orientation and provides an efficient cutoff angle for the exclusion of trisomy 21 in patients at risk.

40|$|The {{detection}} of fetal anomalies has improved {{in the last}} years {{as a result of the}} generalization of ultrasound pregnancy screening exams. The presence of a cystic imaging in the <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvis</b> is a relatively common finding, which can correspond to a real congenital cystic lesion or result from the anomalous liquid accumulation in a whole pelvic organ, mainly the urinary bladder, the uterus, or the vagina. In selected cases with poor prognosis and/or inconclusive echographic findings, magnetic resonance may bring additional information in terms of the characterization, anatomical location, and real extension of the pathology. This pictorial essay describes the normal pelvic fetal anatomy, as well as the most common pelvic cysts. It also describes the causes of an anomalous distension of the whole pelvic organs detected in utero, with emphasis on prenatal magnetic resonance imaging exams. Moreover, it proposes practical teaching points to reduce the differential diagnosis of these lesions based on the sex of the fetus, the division of the pelvis in anatomical spaces, and the imaging findings of the pathology. Finally, it discusses the real utility of complementary MRI...|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To {{ascertain}} the outcome associated with antenatal renal pelvis dilatation; to recommend guidelines for postnatal investigation and determine an upper limit of normal for the anterioposterior {{dimensions of the}} <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis.</b>  METHODS—Infants whose antenatal ultrasound scan showed a <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> of 5 mm or greater were investigated using postnatal renal tract ultrasound and a micturating cystogram. Isotope studies were also performed, where appropriate.  RESULTS—Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), the most common diagnosis, was evident in 23 / 104 (22 %). In 14 infants with VUR the postnatal ultrasound scan was normal. There {{was no evidence of}} renal scarring or dysplasia in any of the refluxing kidneys. Other diagnoses were pelviureteric junction obstruction, renal dysplasia, and idiopathic dilatation. Antenatal counselling and parental information facilitated postnatal assessment.  CONCLUSIONS—Infants with antenatal renal pelvis measurements of 5 mm or greater should be investigated postnatally, as a significant percentage will have VUR. A normal postnatal ultrasound scan does not preclude the presence of VUR. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} a threshold value for <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> dilatation measured by automatic volume calculation (SonoAVC) {{in the third}} trimester of pregnancy to predict neonatal uropathies, and to compare these results with conventional antero-posterior (AP) measurement, fetal kidney 3 D volume and renal parenchymal thickness. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 125 fetuses with renal pelvis AP diameter of 5 mm both at 20 weeks of gestation and in the third trimester, underwent an additional 3 D volume measurement of the fetal kidney in the third trimester. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for establishing threshold values for <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> volume, AP measurement, fetal kidney volume and renal parenchymal thickness to predict neonatal uropathies were analyzed. Also, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC) and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results: A cut-off point of 1. 58 cm(3) was identified in the third trimester of pregnancy (AUC 0. 865 (95 % CI 0. 789 - 0. 940), sensitivity 76. 3 %, specificity 87. 4 %, LR+ 6. 06, LR- 0. 27) for measurements with SonoAVC. A cut-off value of 11. 5 mm {{was established in the}} third trimester of pregnancy (AUC 0. 828 (95 % CI 0. 737 - 0. 918), sensitivity 71. 1 %, specificity 85. 1 %, LR+ 4. 77, LR- 0. 34) for the conventional AP measurement. A cut-off point for fetal kidney volume was calculated at 13. 29 cm(3) (AUC 0. 769 (95 % CI 0. 657 - 0. 881), sensitivity 71 %, specificity 66 %, LR+ 2. 09, LR- 0. 44). For renal parenchymal thickness, a cut-off point of 8. 4 mm was established (AUC 0. 216 (95 % CI 0. 117 - 0. 315), sensitivity 31. 6 %, specificity 32. 6 %, LR+ 0. 47, LR- 2. 10).

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the possible association between single umbilical artery (SUA) at 11 – 14 weeks of gestation and {{the incidence of}} chromosomal abnormalities. Methods Color flow imaging of the <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvis</b> was used to {{determine the}} number of umbilical arteries in 717 fetuses immediately before chorionic villus sampling for karyotyping at 11 – 14 weeks ’ gestation. Results Single umbilical artery (SUA) was diagnosed in 21 / 634 (3. 3 %) chromosomally normal fetuses, in 5 / 44 (11. 4 %) with trisomy 21, 14 / 18 (77. 8 %) with trisomy 18 and 2 / 21 (9. 5 %) with other chromosomal defects. In the chromosomally normal group {{there was no significant difference}} in median fetal crown–rump length or nuchal translucency (NT) between those with a single and those with two umbilical arteries. In the 42 fetuses with SUA the expected number of cases of trisomy 21, estimated on the basis of maternal age, gestational age and fetal NT, was 4. 7, which was not significantly different from the observed 5. The corresponding numbers for trisomy 18 were 2. 0 for expected and 14 for observed (Fisher’s exact test P = 0. 0016).

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} {{vascular}} and nervous relationships of the uterosacral ligament and to analyze histologically its content {{for a better}} description of this structure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three fresh fetal cadavers, three embalmed and one fresh adult cadavers were used. The anatomical relationships of the uterosacral ligament were studied by dissecting one fresh <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvis</b> and two embalmed adult pelves. By histological and immunohistological examinations, eight biopsies of the cervical origin of the complexe ligamentaire utérosacral (USLC) were analyzed: four from fresh fetuses, two from a fresh adult cadaver and two from an embalmed adult cadaver. The specimens were stained with haematoxylin eosin safran (HES) coloration, with antinervous cell specific antibodies (PS 100) and with antismooth muscle actine antibodies (to visualize vessel walls) before examination under optical microscope. RESULTS: On anatomic examination, the uterosacral ligament was covered by the visceral pelvic fascia. By removing this fascia, the uterosacral ligament {{appeared to be a}} condensation of nervous fibers made up of hypogastric and pelvic nerves forming the hypogastric plexus. Histologically, the uterosacral ligament contained connective tissue, nervous fibers, sympathetic nodes, vessels and fatty tissue. No structured ligamentous organization was identified. CONCLUSION: The uterosacral "ligament" is in fact a "ligament complex" integrating connective tissue as well as nervous and vascular elements. Radical wide excisions of the USLC during cancer or endometriosis surgery and uterosacral suspension during pelvic floor reconstructive surgery should be performed with caution in order to preserve pelvic innervation...|$|E
40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 50 -year-old male with no past medical history {{presented}} to the emergency department with a chief complaint of right flank pain after stretching. His vital signs were within normal limits and physical exam was significant for tenderness to palpation over the right lateral chest wall. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Due to the patient’s uncertainty of the exact mechanism of injury, additional trauma could {{not be ruled out}} and a bedside focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) scan was performed, which was negative for free fluid, but notable for an absence of a right kidney. The patient was sent for a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis to evaluate the etiology of symptoms and to address the absence of visualized kidney on ultrasound. Significant findings: CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a normal left kidney and an ectopic, malrotated right kidney located in the pelvis (see white arrow). Discussion: Renal ectopia is described as a malposition of the kidney, due to faulty migration from the <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvis</b> during early embryonic development. Evidence suggests an incidence ranging from 1 : 900 to 1 : 12, 000. 1 - 3 While most cases are asymptomatic and do not require intervention, complications include vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infections, hydronephrosis, and renal calculi. 4, 5 Ultrasonography is indicated for the evaluation of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis in the setting of trauma. In this case, the right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for both free fluid and a right kidney, even with appropriate repositioning techniques. 7 The absence of the right kidney on ultrasound in the setting of pain prompted the decision for further diagnostic imaging, which revealed an ectopic right kidney. The absence of a kidney on FAST exam should prompt the clinician to consider surgical (eg, nephrectomy) or congenital (eg, renal ectopy) explanations. Furthermore, pathophysiologic processes (eg, pyelonephritis) that may occur in an ectopic right kidney can masquerade as disease entities which cause right lower quadrant pain such as acute appendicitis. ...|$|E
40|$|Radical {{hysterectomy}} with pelvic lymphadenectomy (RHL) is {{the preferred}} treatment for early-stage cervical cancer. Although oncological outcome is good with regard to recurrence and survival rates, {{it is well known}} that RHL might result in postoperative bladder impairments due to autonomic nerve disruption. The pelvic autonomic network has been extensively studied, but the anatomy of nerve fibers branching off the inferior hypogastric plexus to innervate the bladder is less known. Besides, the pathogenesis of bladder dysfunction after RHL is multifactorial but remains unclear. We studied the 3 -dimensional anatomy and neuroanatomical composition of the vesical plexus and describe implications for RHL. Six female adult cadaveric pelvises were macroscopically dissected. Additionally, a series of 10 female <b>fetal</b> <b>pelvises</b> (embryonic age, 10 - 22 weeks) was studied. Paraffin-embedded blocks were transversely sliced in 8 -μm sections. (Immuno) histological analysis was performed with hematoxylin and eosin, azan, and antibodies against S- 100 (Schwann cells), tyrosine hydroxylase (postganglionic sympathetic fibers), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (postganglionic parasympathetic fibers). The results were 3 -dimensionally visualized. The vesical plexus formed a group of nerve fibers branching off the ventral part of the inferior hypogastric plexus to innervate the bladder. In all adult and fetal specimens, the vesical plexus was closely related to the distal ureter and located in both the superficial and deep layers of the vesicouterine ligament. Efferent nerve fibers belonging to the vesical plexus predominantly expressed tyrosine hydroxylase and little vasoactive intestinal peptide. The vesical plexus is located in both layers of the vesicouterine ligament and has a very close relationship with the distal ureter. Complete mobilization of the ureter in RHL might cause bladder dysfunction due to sympathetic and parasympathetic denervation. Hence, the distal ureter should be regarded as a risk zone in which the vesical plexus can be damage...|$|R

Case-control study {{in children with}} pyelectasis (anteroposterior diameter of the <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> of 5 - 10 mm). A validated questionnaire {{was sent to the}} parents of 208 cases and 416 matched controls. The questionnaire was returned by 146 cases and 250 controls. There was a male predominance in the case group (p = < 0. 0001). There was no difference in voiding habits or in prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTI). The prevalence of UTI was high: 11. 6 % in cases and 10. 0 % in controls. The only difference was a higher prevalence of constipation in the case group (p = 0. 003). Postnatally, 41 children had an ultrasound examination and 16 were referred to a paediatrician or urologist: 3 had persisting pyelectasis, 3 had a recurrent UTI and 1 required surgery (a pyeloplasty).

40|$|To {{analyze the}} current {{management}} recommendations among French-speaking physicians treating infants with antenatal renal pelvis dilatation, we surveyed 83 pediatric nephrologists and 68 pediatric urologists by questionnaire. A total of 45 (54 %) pediatric nephrologists and 38 (56 %) pediatric urologists responded. The threshold for {{the diagnosis of}} abnormal <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> dilatation was significantly higher among pediatric urologists than nephrologists. All responders perform renal ultrasound examinations after birth. Postnatal renal pelvis dilatation was considered abnormal if the anteroposterior diameter was ≥ 11 ± 1. 9 mm by the pediatric urologists and ≥ 9 ± 2. 9 mm by the pediatric nephrologists (P= 0. 003). Pediatric urologists {{were more likely than}} nephrologists to recommend routine voiding cystourethrography [41 % versus 20 % (P= 0. 04) ]. Mercaptoacetyl-triglycine renography was the most routinely used tool to achieve functional evaluation during follow-up among the responders. Pediatric urologists were more likely to recommend surgical treatment in dilated kidneys with initial function < 40 %. In conclusion, pediatric urologists had significantly higher thresholds for the detection of prenatal and neonatal renal pelvis dilatation. They also more frequently recommended routine voiding cystourethrography and surgical therapy of dilated kidneys with low function than pediatric nephrologists. The variability in attitudes is most probably due to the absence of clear guidelines based on prospective and controlled trials. © IPNA 2004. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} outcome and imaging features of neonatal primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Study design: We prospectively followed 43 infants with primary VUR identified from among {{a cohort of}} 497 infants with <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> dilatation. Postnatal renal ultrasound (US) examinations were performed at 5 days and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of life. Voiding cystourethrography was performed in the neonatal period and repeated at 12 and 24 months when VUR was persistent. Two radioisotopic examinations, including a 99 mTc-MAG 3 renogram and a plasma clearance of Cr- 51 EDTA, were performed in all children with high-grade reflux. Results: The incidence of primary VUR in our study group was 9 %. Among the 43 patients followed, 11 (26 %) had high-grade (IV-V) VUR and 32 (74 %) had low-grade VUR. Resolution of reflux occurred in 2 of 11 (18 %) patients with high-grade VUR and in 29 of 32 (90. 6 %) patients with low-grade VUR at age 2 years (P <. 001). At age 2 years, 91 % of the low-grade refluxing kidneys were normal on US, compared with only 35 % of the high-grade refluxing kidneys. Split renal function was within normal range and single-kidney GFR was significantly increased in 13 of the 17 high-grade refluxing kidneys during follow-up. Furthermore, a strong association between dysplasia on US and poor renal function outcome was found. Conclusions: In most infants with VUR, the reflux is of low grade and resolves rapidly. In those children with high-grade VUR, spontaneous resolution is rare at age 2 years, but persistent reflux rarely impairs the maturation of renal function. Copyright © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the variation in}} {{the dimensions of the}} <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> in relation to the degree of bladder filling in fetuses with mild pyelectasis. Eighteen third-trimester pregnant women with mild uni- or bilateral fetal pyelectasis, defined as an anteroposterior (A-P) diameter of the renal pelvis between 5 and 10 mm, were recruited for the study. The women were examined for 2 - 3 h by ultrasound. The A-P and transverse dilatation of the renal pelvis and the bladder dimensions (to calculate fetal bladder volume) were measured at 2 - 3 -min intervals. Postnatally, all infants were investigated by ultrasound at 3 - 4 months. In 6 / 18 fetuses a consistent relationship between the size of the renal pelvis and bladder filling was found, with a mean difference in renal pelvic diameter before and after voiding of 6. 7 mm and a largest observed difference of 14. 3 mm. In 12 / 18 fetuses no such relationship was found. Postnatally, five infants were referred to a pediatric urologist. The investigations in these five infants could not confirm the hypothesis that variation in renal pelvic size in relation to bladder size may predict prenatal vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). In mild pyelectasis the size of the renal pelvis is highly variable in one-third of cases. The association with bladder volume and micturition suggests evidence of VUR, but this could not be proven. If cut-off values are used to differentiate between normal and abnormal renal pelvic size then not only gestational age but also the degree of bladder filling at the time of measurement should be taken into account. Caution should be expressed when the diagnosis of a possible urological anomaly is based on a single measurement during just one investigatio...|$|R

Methods: Three systems were used for deep (abdomen, <b>pelvis,</b> <b>fetal)</b> and superficial (muscle, thyroid, carotid artery) examinations: (a) a robotic arm (RA) holding an echographic probe; (b) an echograph with a motorized probe (MP); and (c) remote guidance (RG) where the patient site operator performed the examination assisted by an expert via videoconference. All systems were tested in the same medical center located 60 km away from the university hospital. Results: A total of 340 remote echography examinations were performed (41 % RA and MP, 59 % RG). MP and RA allowed full control of the probe orientation by the expert, and provided diagnoses in 97 % of cases. The use of RG was sufficient for superficial vessel examinations and provided diagnoses in 98 % of cases but was not suited for deep or superficial organs. Assessment of superficial organs was best accomplished using the MP.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{correlation}} of the average antero-posterior, transverse and longitudinal diameters of the <b>fetal</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> to neonatal outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluates the neonatal outcome of all fetuses with suspected pyelectasis on ultrasonographic examination between May 1997 and March 2006. During this time, 764 fetuses with pyelectasis and 1285 renal units were scanned. We defined fetal pyelectasis as mild if the ARP was >/= 5 -/= 10 -/= 15 mm. A total of 612 fetuses met the inclusion criteria. The Corteville criteria in the third trimester (antero-posterior diameter >/= 7 mm) and an antero-posterior diameter (AP) of >/= 10 mm were compared with the ARP and likelihood ratio's calculated. Ultrasonographic evaluation took place in the third trimester if fetal pyelectasis was diagnosed as an isolated finding in the second trimester. This last ultrasonographic examination was used for final analysis and as a guideline for postnatal follow-up. Neonatal outcome was assessed by reviewing medical records, ultrasonographic, renographic and voiding cysto-urethrographic results. RESULTS: Of all the fetuses diagnosed with renal pelvis dilatation in the third trimester of pregnancy, 73 (11. 9 %) infants needed postnatal surgery. The majority of the postnatal surgery was performed in the group of fetuses with severe hydronephrosis (8. 2 %). This resulted in a LR of 5. 81 and a post-test probability of 61. 3 %. In total, 78. 8 % of the fetuses with hydronephrosis had spontaneous resolution across all grades of severity on the first postnatal ultrasonogaphic investigation or during their follow-up. In 9. 3 % of the cases, uropathies were diagnosed, but no surgical intervention had taken place during the follow-up period. Using the Corteville criteria as gold standard for the third trimester (AP >/= 7 mm), 11 (1. 8 %) patients would not have been diagnosed with uropathies. And in the case of AP >/= 10 mm, 5. 1 % of the cases would have been missed. CONCLUSION: An ARP of >/= 5 mm in the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy enables a better detection of patients with uropathies and indication for surgery as compared with AP >/= 10 mm, but renders almost similar results compared with the Cortville criteria (AP >/= 7 mm) in the third trimester...|$|R

40|$|The first {{chapters}} of this thesis {{focus on the}} prenatal development of the kidney, with a particular focus {{on the development of}} a CSFK. We aim to unravel the process of compensatory enlargement in a CSFK. In Chapter 2, a prospective longitudinal study of normal human fetuses is described, focussing on size and growth of the <b>fetal</b> kidney, renal <b>pelvis</b> and adrenal gland. We constructed size charts with multilevel statistical analysis. In Chapter 3, we examinined timing and extent of compensatory enlargement in human fetuses with a CSFK without any other anomaly by comparing CSFK size with charts of normal kidney size. In Chapter 4, we determined glomerular size and volume of pigs with a CSFK with a 3 -dimensional stereologic technique and compared this to the nephron volume and size of pigs with two kidneys. Currently, protocol biopsies or crude surrogate markers like longitudinal measurements of the glomerular filtration rate are the only clinical tools available to detect early signs of chronic allograft injury. Therefore, in Chapter 5, we studied the association between urinary CCN- 2 levels and renal allograft fibrosis during the first 2 years after transplantation. Histological and biochemical data were collected from 315 kidney transplant recipients enrolled in a protocol biopsy-based clinical program. Emerging evidence also indicates a role for CCN- 2 in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. While being expressed only minimally in healthy tissue, CCN- 2 is strongly upregulated in atherosclerotic plaques, in cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction, in cardiac fibrosis and in vascular and cardiac tissues in experimental hypertension. In Chapter 6, we investigated the association of plasma CCN- 2 with cardiovascular risk and mortality in a high-risk population of patients with manifest atherosclerotic vascular disease. In Chapter 7, we administered microspheres loaded with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin under the renal capsule and compared this with systemic delivery of rapamycin. In a wide variety of animal models, mTOR inhibitors inhibit interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of renal function associated with CKD. Although rapamycin has great potential, the use of rapamycin and other mTOR inhibitors is associated with many systemic effects. We hypothesise that a local dose of rapamycin leads to a local therapeutic dose with little systemic consequences and explored the therapeutic potential of this local drug delivery system...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of mechanical loading upon bone growth and remodelling {{has been widely}} studied. It {{has been suggested that}} functional bone growth is evident within the human adult pelvis, where the internal trabecular structure is purported to align to the principal strain trajectories induced during bipedal locomotion. Ontogenetic studies of the juvenile pelvis have observed that trabecular bone growth becomes progressively ordered from an initial randomised patterning. This has lead to theories linking the gradual structural optimisation of trabecular bone to the mechanical forces associated with the development of juvenile locomotion. However, recent studies have observed partially optimised trabecular structures within the human <b>fetal</b> and neonatal <b>pelvis,</b> in contrast to previous observations. The possible genetic and mechanical factors which cause the in utero formation of these trabecular structures, which are usually associated with a weight bearing function, remains unknown. Therefore, this thesis aimed to investigate the {{influence of}} the mechanical strains associated with juvenile movements, upon the growth of pelvic trabecular bone. Biomechanical analyses were performed on digitised models of juvenile pelvic specimens belonging to the Scheuer collection. Digitised models of a prenatal, 1 year, 8 year and 19 year old pelvis were constructed through processing mircocomputed tomography scan data. A geometric morphometric reconstruction technique was devised which enabled the creation of hemi-pelvic models from originally disarticulated bone specimens. This reconstruction technique was validated through a close morphological comparison between a reconstructed hemi-pelvis, and its originally articulated CT data. The muscular and joint forces associated with in utero movements and bipedal locomotion, were computed through musculoskeletal simulations. A prenatal musculoskeletal model was constructed to replicate the in utero mechanical environment, and simulated interactions between the fetal leg and the womb wall. The forces associated with bipedal locomotion were evaluated through analysis of a pre-defined subject-specific musculoskeletal model. An attempt was made to validate the modelling technique of altering generic musculoskeletal models to create subject-specific representations. However, comparisons between computed and experimentally recorded muscle activities proved inclusive, although this was attributed to uncertainties in the accuracy of the experimental data. A series of finite element analyses computed the strain distributions associated with the predicted musculoskeletal loading. A range of load regimes were applied to each juvenile pelves, and were based upon the computed musculoskeletal forces and the maximum isometric force capabilities of the pelvic muscles. However, despite the differences between the applied load regimes, the predicted von Mises and compressive strain distributions displayed similarities for all the ages analysed. All the predicted distributions were characterised by high strains within the inferior ilium, which correlated to a region of high trabecular organisation. The high strain magnitudes then travelled superiorly in either a gradual or rapid dissipation, both of which did not produce a distribution which correlated to the pelvic trabecular histomorphometry. Therefore, no strain distribution was predicted with divergence of the inferior strains to the anterior and posterior regions of the ilium, as observed with the trabecular trajectories within the pelvis. As the predicted von Mises and compressive strain distributions failed to match the complete iliac trabecular histomorphometry, it was suggested that the in utero formation of partially optimised trabecular growth is possibly due to generic factors. This thesis provided initial investigations into the musculoskeletal and mechanical loading of the juvenile pelvis, although future work is required to develop the applied modelling techniques to fully determine the influence of the mechanical strains.
