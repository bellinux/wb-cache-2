She was initially reluctant {{to participate in}} the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. Beyoncé's choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: [...] "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies [...] just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, that means it must be big time. So in that respect, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> hat off to them for doing it." [...] Later, Joe Jonas of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo Jedward parodied Beyoncé's dance moves for the video of their cover version of [...] "All the Small Things". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by Beyoncé performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote Trident Unwrapped gum. On November 20, 2009, BBC Newsreaders including Fiona Bruce, Sophie Raworth, Kate Silverton, and Susanna Reid performed [...] "Single Ladies" [...] in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues Bill Turnbull, Ben Brown, Nicholas Owen, and Charlie Stayt before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of Britain's Got Talent, in a dance-off. They performed the choreography to raise funds for the UK campaign, Children In Need.|$|E

2500|$|Every episode {{featured}} a different book, often narrated by a celebrity. Celebrity readers included Philip Bosco (Barbara Bash's Desert Giant: The World of the Saguaro Cactus), Michael Ansara (Paul Goble's The Gift of the Sacred Dog, Sheila MacGill Callahan's And Still the Turtle Watched), Josie de Guzman (Leyla Torres's Saturday Sancocho), Jason Robards (Francine Jacobs' Sam the Sea Cow), Bill Cosby (Marc Brown's Arthur's Eyes), Eartha Kitt (Megan McDonald's Is This a House for Hermit Crab?), and Charles Kimbrough (David Wiesner's June 29, 1999). After the featured story, {{at least one}} {{as well as two}} segments featured Burton in diverse places, showing interviews of people to talk about their work and other contributions, focusing on the episode's theme. In one episode, Burton took the show behind-the-scenes on the set of [...] The final segment of each show, called Book Reviews, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, [...] "But you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> word for it," [...] and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. At the end of nearly each episode, Burton signs off by saying: [...] "I'll see you next time." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{track was}} {{recorded}} using Spector's [...] "Wall of Sound" [...] production technique, cost a then-unheard-of $22,000, and required 21 session musicians and 21 background vocalists. Due to Spector's perfectionism in the studio, he made Turner sing the song {{over and over}} for several hours until {{he felt he had}} the perfect vocal take for the song. Turner recalled, [...] "I must have sung that 500,000 times. I was drenched with sweat. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> shirt off and stand there in my bra to sing." ...|$|R
60|$|We had an {{abundance}} of fruit in Honolulu, of course. Oranges, pine-apples, bananas, strawberries, lemons, limes, mangoes, guavas, melons, and a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya, which is deliciousness itself. Then there is the tamarind. I thought tamarinds were made to eat, but that was probably not the idea. I ate several, {{and it seemed to}} me that they were rather sour that year. They pursed up my lips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours.|$|R

60|$|I {{looked on}} the carvings, the statues, the broken arches, where bluebells and wild flowers were waving, {{and it seemed}} inexpressibly {{beautiful}}.

But I felt myself very ill even while there, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> sofa again as soon as I returned. There lying, I <b>took</b> <b>my</b> pencil, and drew just the view of the castle which I could see from my window, as a souvenir of the happiness I had felt at Heidelberg.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will," [...] said Sewell, [...] "when I {{consider}} {{the time is}} ripe--they may count on that, but in the meanwhile you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> word for it.

60|$|Louis appeared, as ever, {{punctual}} to the moment. He {{carried a}} menu card in his hand. He had {{the air of}} <b>having</b> come <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> orders for some projected feast. I closed {{the door of the}} outer hall and the door of my sitting-room.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{remembered that}} I <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> dose of magic seed, and I hastened to do it, although I {{was beginning to}} lose faith in it. I had not grown a single bit, by the merciless testimony of the hall door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, you can't. Look here!" [...] He {{showed a}} handful of letters. [...] "All from people who <b>had</b> promised <b>to</b> stay with me, taking it back, since that infernal {{interview}} of yours, or from people who hadn't answered before, saying they can't come. Of course they make all sorts of civil excuses. I shouldn't {{know what to do}} with these people if any of them came. There isn't a servant left on the place, except the gardener who lives in his own house, and the groom who sleeps in the stable. For the last three days I've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> meals at that infernal inn where you got your coffee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{warn you}} about the company Nat is keeping. The two boys he is going with, Nick Jasniff and Link Merwell, are bad characters. You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> word for it--write to Doctor Clay {{and see what he}} says. Nick Jasniff ran away from school and he got hold of some money that didn't belong to him and used it. Link Merwell got mixed up with some horse-thieves, on his father's ranch out West, and his father had to foot the bill to hush the matter up. I feel it my duty to tell you this, so that you can warn Nat. That's all." [...] And Dave caught Ben by the arm and started to walk away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{come back}} to you," [...] he continued. [...] "I {{want you to come}} to me. This is the part of my story which will sound miraculous, if not ridiculous to you, but you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> word for it. Try and {{remember}} for a moment that there are things in life beyond the pale of our knowledge, things which we must accept simply by faith. The change which came to me came through eating a sort of bean, grown by an old man who was brought home from Asia by a great scholar. These beans are supposed to contain the germ of Truth. I have 'two here--one for you and one for Alfred. I want you to eat them, and afterwards, what I hope and believe is that we shall see things more the same way and come together again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{allowance}} must be {{made for}} the feelings of a young man new to responsibility. I thought of my crew. Half of them were ill, and I really began to think that some of them would end by dying on board if I couldn't get them out to sea soon. Obviously I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> ship down the river, either working under canvas or dredging with the anchor down; operations which, in common with many modern sailors, I only knew theoretically. And I almost shrank from undertaking them shorthanded and without local knowledge of the river bed, which is so necessary for the confident handling of the ship. There were no pilots, no beacons, no buoys of any sort; but there was a very devil of a current for anybody to see, no end of shoal places, and at least two obviously awkward turns of the channel between me and the sea. But how dangerous these turns were I would not tell. I didn't even know what my ship was capable of! I had never handled her in my life. A misunderstanding between a man and his ship in a difficult river with no room to make it up, is bound to end in trouble for the man. On the other hand, it must be owned I had not much reason to count upon a general run of good luck. And suppose I had the misfortune to pile her up high and dry on some beastly shoal? That would have been the final undoing of that voyage. It was plain that if Falk refused to tow me out he would also refuse to pull me off. This meant--what? A day lost at the very best; but more likely a whole fortnight of frizzling on some pestilential mud-flat, of desperate work, of discharging cargo; more than likely it meant borrowing money at an exorbitant rate of interest--from the Siegers' gang too at that. They were a power in the port. And that elderly seaman of mine, Gambril, had looked pretty ghastly when I went forward to dose him with quinine that morning. He would certainly die--not to speak of two or three others that seemed nearly as bad, and of the rest of them just ready to catch any tropical disease going. Horror, ruin and everlasting remorse. And no help. None. I had fallen amongst a lot of unfriendly lunatics! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Archie. [...] "If he had refused, {{it would}} not <b>have</b> been easy <b>to</b> bring him to the point, I suppose I must <b>have</b> {{surrendered}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> trial, but after so many years, and with so many deaths, {{it would have been}} awkward." ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>have</b> chosen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> life. It's an {{appropriate}} {{end to the}} present situation.

6000|$|... "The {{last time}} they {{came to see me}} {{was in the middle of}} the summer. They {{threatened}} all sorts of things, and they got me so mad that I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> down <b>my</b> shotgun and warn them away. Then they left in a big hurry." ...|$|R
