25|$|To enlist Stalin's support, Zhou and a Chinese {{delegation}} {{arrived in}} Moscow on 10 October, {{at which point}} they flew to Stalin's home at the Black Sea. There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria and Georgi Malenkov. Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union's air force would need {{two or three months}} to prepare any operations. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951. Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> {{on the south side of}} the Yalu. Soviet shipments of matériel, when they did arrive, were limited to small quantities of trucks, grenades, machine guns, and the like.|$|E

500|$|As late as July 1997, U2 were {{pressured}} {{to accept an}} offer of approximately $4million to perform in Basel, Switzerland on the date scheduled for the Sarajevo show. At the time, rumours about the region's instability persisted. To ensure the Sarajevo show was not canceled, Sacirbey appeared at many of the band's preceding shows to lobby {{on behalf of the}} city. For the stage to reach Sarajevo, the road crew had to drive the equipment and stage through war-torn Bosnia. Although the trip was without incident, they had to pass through towns such as Mostar, which had been [...] "obliterated" [...] during the war. Stage and lighting designer Willie Williams commented that [...] "when the truck drivers arrived you could see that they were changed men". The only trouble in transporting the stage came when a border control agent prevented them from crossing the border for hours. The trucks reached Sarajevo two days prior to the concert, arriving to the cheers and applause of the city's residents; their arrival was the first concrete evidence that the band were keeping their promise to play there. McGuinness explained, [...] "This is a city that's been disappointed so many times {{there were a lot of}} people who weren't prepared to believe the gig was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> until they saw the stage going up." [...] Until then, tickets had sold very slowly, but within 24 hours of the trucks' arrival, another 8,000tickets were sold. Despite this, a day before the concert, 15,000tickets remained unsold.
