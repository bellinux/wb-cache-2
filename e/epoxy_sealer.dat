5000|$|Polyurethane {{varnishes}} {{are typically}} hard, abrasion-resistant, and durable coatings. They are popular for hardwood floors but are {{considered by some}} wood finishers to be difficult or unsuitable for finishing furniture or other detailed pieces. Polyurethanes are comparable in hardness to certain alkyds but generally form a tougher film. Compared to simple oil or shellac varnishes, polyurethane varnish forms a harder, decidedly tougher and more waterproof film. However, a thick film of ordinary polyurethane may de-laminate if subjected to heat or shock, fracturing the film and leaving white patches. This tendency increases with long exposure to sunlight or when it is applied over soft woods like pine. This is also {{in part due to}} polyurethane's lesser penetration into the wood. Various priming techniques are employed to overcome this problem, including the use of certain oil varnishes, specified [...] "dewaxed" [...] shellac, clear penetrating <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer,</b> or [...] "oil-modified" [...] polyurethane designed for the purpose. Polyurethane varnish may also lack the [...] "hand-rubbed" [...] lustre of drying oils such as linseed or tung oil; in contrast, however, it is capable of a much faster and higher [...] "build" [...] of film, accomplishing in two coats what may require multiple applications of oil. Polyurethane may also be applied over a straight oil finish, but because of the relatively slow curing time of oils, the emission of certain chemical byproducts, and the need for exposure to oxygen from the air, care must be taken that the oils are sufficiently cured to accept the polyurethane.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether {{the placement of}} a methacrylate root canal sealer or a conventional epoxy root canal sealer in two steps increases their dislocation resistance when compared to a one-step placement procedure. Materials and Methods: Eighty single-rooted teeth were randomly allocated to 4 groups (n = 20). All canals were instrumented to size 40, 0. 06 taper and irrigated according to a standardized protocol. Root canal filling was conducted as follows: group 1 : methacrylate sealer placed in two steps; group 2 : methacrylate sealer placed in one step; group 3 : <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer</b> placed in two steps; group 4 : <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer</b> placed in one step. After setting, thin slices at different root levels were obtained and submitted to push-out testing. Results were analyzed with non-parametric tests to compare the two-step procedures to their one-step counterparts. Failure modes were determined by stereomicroscopy. Random untested methacrylate sealer specimens were also examined with scanning electron microscopy. Results: At each root level, dislocation resistance was significantly higher for the two-step procedure than for the one-step procedure using the methacrylate sealer (p = 0. 003, p = 0. 005, p < 0. 001) but not the <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer</b> (p = 0. 83, p = 0. 1, p = 0. 06).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} interactions between root filling materials and root dentin and to investigate if root canal irrigating solutions had an impact on these interactions. The following outcomes were assessed in the studies encompassed in this thesis: (i) dislocation resistance of an epoxy resin based root canal sealer and tricalcium silicate based root canal sealers, (ii) the influence of irrigation protocols on the sealing ability and chemical interactions with dentin of an <b>epoxy</b> resin based <b>sealer,</b> (iii) retreatability of mineral trioxide aggregate based sealers, (iv) characterization of a mineral trioxide aggregate based sealer following exposure to irrigation regimens. The results showed that irrigation protocols diﬀerentially influenced the sealer materials. The use of continuous chelation (sodium hypochlorite + etidronic acid) enhanced the bond strength of epoxy resin as well as mineral trioxide aggregate based sealers. This irrigation regimen also positively influenced the hydration characteristics of the tricalcium silicate materials. The bond strength of tricalcium silicate sealers improved with time. The <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer</b> AH Plus chemically bonds to root dentin and irrigation protocols employing a final rinse of a proteolytic irrigant reduced the bond strength.

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the sealing {{efficacy}} of root fillings made by a single-cone technique with three different sealers and a cold lateral compaction technique with an <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer.</b> Materials and methods Eighty extracted single-rooted human teeth were assigned to four experimental groups: group 1, single-cone and epoxy sealer; group 2, single-cone and calcium silicate-based sealer; group 3, single-cone and methacrylate resin-based sealer; and group 4, cold lateral compaction and <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer.</b> Twenty extra teeth served as negative and positive controls. After preparation of a coronal post space, the sealing efficacy of the root fillings was assessed on a fluid transport setup. The results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test. Results No fluid transport was detected for the negative controls whereas all the positive controls showed rapid fluid transport. No significant difference was detected between groups 1, 3, and 4 whereas group 2 demonstrated significantly more fluid transport than all the other experimental groups.

30|$|The {{majority}} of DOTs replied {{that they do}} not coat the ends of concrete beams. Among all the respondents, 77  % indicated that their state either does not coat (or rarely coats) the beam ends. The Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) shared that with new concrete structures, the outside fascia of exterior girders is sealed with a siloxane or an acrylic sealer, but there is no special treatment of girder ends. The agencies that do use coating systems and provided product descriptions were Florida DOT, Illinois DOT, and Iowa DOT. Protective coatings, concrete sealers, latex acrylic primer, and an <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer</b> were products reported by these DOTs. These systems all require frequent or periodic inspection and are estimated to last up to 10  years. It {{is interesting to note that}} a previous survey performed in 2001 (Ahlborn et al. 2002) also revealed that most states do not repair prestressed I-beams for end deterioration, and if they were to perform one, the state DOT specification would be used in the rehabilitation process.|$|E
40|$|Durability of {{reinforced}} concrete infrastructure is severely affected by corrosion of reinforcing steel. Conventional patch repair techniques {{are unable to}} stop this corrosion due to electrochemical incompatibility between the "repaired" concrete and the original "chloride-infested" concrete. This research was undertaken to compare the performance of different patch repair strategies of corroded concrete bridge deck slabs, proposed by different industrial partners, {{with respect to the}} conventional patch repair. The results show that the potential difference between the "repaired-patch" concrete and the "existing" concrete accelerates local corrosion around the patch, and gradually progresses towards the repaired zone. Beneficial effect of sacrificial anodes and corrosion inhibitors in a KCl and a NaCl environment, are evaluated {{at the beginning of the}} repair, however, their effectiveness decreases with time. Corrosion penetration rate obtained from Tafel Test, overestimated the actual rebar mass loss, indicating the need for more research in this area. It is recommended that for new construction, concrete must have low diffusivity to avoid premature deterioration, and for repair, electrochemical protection systems such as cathodic protection, embedded sacrificial anode, corrosion inhibitor, and chloride extraction should be considered to increase the service life of the repaired system. Surface coatings such as zinc, <b>epoxy,</b> <b>sealer</b> or membrane can be used as additional line of defence. In addition, the existing cracks must be treated, and the bridge deck drainage system and expansion joints must be designed properly to avoid ingress of chloride-contaminated water into the concrete...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the quality of root {{fillings}} in small and curved root canals using bidirectional radiographs and fluid transport (FT) measurements. Study design: Root canals in eighty 38 °-curved mesial roots of mandibular molars were prepared using a balanced force technique. Samples were divided into 4 groups of 20 each and obturated by either the cold lateral compaction (LC) or the single cone (SC) technique, using either epoxy resin-based or zinc oxide-eugenol sealers. Bidirectional (buccolingual and mesiodistal) radiographs were acquired from each root. The voids along the root filling were assessed. The FT along the root filling was measured using an FT monitoring device. The differences between the groups regarding FT and the bidirectional radiographic score were analyzed by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test. The correlation between the FT values and the radiographic scores were analyzed using a Spearman test.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the cracking of concrete bridge decks and the sealants used in repairing transverse cracks. Cracking could occur in both hardened mature concrete and early age concrete. Several factors affect concrete cracking, such as age-dependent material properties, thermal- and moisture-related stresses and strains, material viscoelastic behavior, restraints, concrete expansion and contraction, casting sequence, formwork, material characteristics, and environmental exposure. The causes of early age cracking are primarily attributed to effects such as plastic shrinkage, temperature effects, autogenous shrinkage, and drying shrinkage. This deck cracking could greatly reduce durability, lead to a loss of functionality, loss of stiffness, and ultimately the loss of structural safety. The study investigates the deck cracking in general and also the transverse cracks developed in hardened concrete at early ages before service loads application. Both experimental and analytical investigations were performed. The experimental study included testing of 9 reinforced concrete slab specimens (18 ”x 48 ”x 5. 5 ”). Cracks were induced in the slabs with different crack widths and lengths, sealed with 4 different materials of sealants, and tested under static loading. The study also included tensile testing of dry hardened samples of sealants. In addition, field application was performed on a bridge, where transverse deck cracks were sealed using 4 different sealant materials; cores were taken and tested according to ASTM-C 496. The results of the testing showed that the 3 -part HMWM was the best performing sealer for cracks between 0. 01 and 0. 019 inches of width with the <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer</b> performing the best for cracks wider than 0. 02 inches...|$|E

METHODS: 30 human premolars were endodontically prepared and obturated with an <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer</b> and vertically condensed gutta-percha. Thereafter the entire clinical crown was removed. The teeth {{were randomly assigned}} to five different composite core groups, all using the same fiber reinforced radicular post (DT White). Gr. 1 : Optibond solo plus/Nexus II/Prodigy; Gr. 2 : Scotchbond 1 /Rely X Arc/Filtek P 60; Gr. 3 : EBS multi/Compolute applicap/Pertac II; Gr. 4 : ART Bond/Parapost cement/Synergy; Gr. 5 : Superbond C&B catalyst S+polymer/Metafil CX. Polyvinyl-siloxane impressions of the external margins of the cores were readied before and after 1, 200, 000 cycles of mechanical loading with max. 100 N at 45 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the tooth. After loading, 5 of the 6 samples of each group were cut longitudinally and the sixth sample was cut transversally {{to be able to take}} replicas for evaluation of internal adaptation after loading. RESULTS: Percentages of external "continuous margins" ranged from 97. 9 +- 4. 6 to 66. 5 +- 7. 8 before and from 87. 4 +- 25. 0 to 5. 8 +- 12. 5 after loading.

40|$|AbstractAmong the technologies, CCS (Carbon dioxide {{capture and}} storage) {{technology}} is assumed and arising as crucial technology for reducing anthropogenic {{carbon dioxide and}} bridging to hydrogen economy. CCS technology includes carbon dioxide capture on the large point source, transport of captured carbon dioxide stream and storage of carbon into safe geological formations. Among the CCS processes, capture side is developing with many demonstration projects, focusing on the efficiency improvement of wet and dry absorbents, material improvement for membrane, construction cost down, etc. But in transport side, the technology is in the initial stage. In Korea, site surveys are mainly focused and operated on the offshore saline aquifers in the east sea of Korea and rather few surveys are processed in the on land side. For the offshore carbon dioxide geological storage, there are two options for transportation, using pipeline or ship. To utilize the offshore pipeline {{it is possible to}} use high chrome steel alloy to response to seawater corrosion, though the cost for construction might take huge budget for installation mainly cause of material cost. Otherwise, we considered {{it might be possible to}} apply the anti-corrosion coating outside of the carbon steel pipeline to mitigate seawater corrosion and to reduce the cost, so to secure steady and robust operation of offshore carbon dioxide transportation with little concern of corrosion issue. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using carbon steel pipeline with internal phosphate coating and external thermal spray coating as candidate for the offshore carbon dioxide transportation pipeline material. The base material for this study is carbon steel. The pipe internal corrosion test was conducted with fluids of CO 2 mixture with additives of water and SO 2 gas, and the external corrosion was carried out with 3. 5 %w NaCl solution. In the case of internal corrosion, all the specimens resulted in corroded surface with rust covered when SO 2 was injected over 175 ppmv. In the case of external corrosion, zinc thermal spray with epoxy coating showed that more <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealer</b> is remained than aluminum thermal spray coating.

Methodology Single-rooted teeth (n= 100) were divided into five groups (n= 20) based on the irrigation protocol and their root canals instrumented using a rotary Ni-Ti system: 2. 5 % NaOCl during instrumentation followed by bi-distilled water (G 1) or 17 % EDTA (G 2) as final rinse; 1 : 1 mixture of 5 % NaOCl and 18 % HEBP during instrumentation, and the same mixture (G 3), 17 % EDTA (G 4) or bi-distilled water (G 5) as final rinse. Canals were filled with AH Plus. Roots were sectioned, and push-out tests were performed in coronal, middle and apical root thirds. Results were analysed using analysis of variance (anova) and Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. The alpha-type error was set at 0. 05 for all the analyses. Results Push-out bond strength was highest in coronal and lowest in apical root thirds (P< 0. 05). Groups that used NaOCl+HEBP irrigation during instrumentation had significantly higher bond strengths than groups following the NaOCl-EDTA irrigation in all root thirds (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background/purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} early versus delayed post space preparation and cementation {{and the types of}} cement on the retention of fiber posts in canals obturated using an <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer.</b> Materials and methods: Seventy-two extracted single-rooted teeth with straight root canals were decoronated and obturated with gutta-percha and an <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer</b> (AH 26). Post spaces were prepared to a depth of 8  mm and 1. 5  mm diameter. Parallel-sided, prefabricated fiber posts were used. The teeth were distributed into two groups (36 in each), according to the period elapsed between canal obturation and post cementation (Group 1 : cementation after 24 hours and Group 2 : cementation after 2 weeks). Each group was further subdivided into three groups (n =  12) according to the cement types (RelyX Unicem, ParaCore and Variolink II). Each specimen was vertically secured in the universal testing machine and was subjected to a pull-out test. Data were statistically analyzed using two-way analysis of variance.

Two commonly used sealers namely: epoxy-resin (AH- 26) and calcium hydroxide based root-canal sealers; in addition to two newly formulated sealers of different concentration of Calcium hydroxide root canal sealer and epoxy-resin, were used (Formula I: Epoxy resin 48 %, Calcium Hydroxide 39 %, Formula II : Epoxy resin 37 %,+ Calcium Hydroxide 46 %). Setting time, working time and radio-opacity were evaluated for calcium hydroxide root canal <b>sealer</b> with <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer.</b> Histopathological reactions were evaluated using 60 healthy rabbits of comparable weight. Each material was subcutaneously injected at two sites in each animal. The tissue was removed after 3, 14 and 28 days and the inflammatory response was assessed. Antimicrobial effects were assessed for the test sealers. Ten patients with necrotic pulp were included in this study. Ten microbial samples were obtained from the patients and were cultured. The experimental materials were investigated for their antimicrobial effects on a blood agar plate. Concerning the physical properties, Formula I provided the longest working and setting time among the test materials. Pure calcium hydroxide sealer provided significantly higher radiopacity compared to the other materials (p < 0. 05). No significant difference in radio-opacity was observed among the other test <b>sealers.</b> Histopatologically, pure <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer</b> showed the severest inflammatory reaction initially, both Calcium hydroxide and the experimental sealers showed mild to moderate inflammatory reaction however the inflammatory reaction was more prolonged for the Calcium hydroxide sealer.

E. faecalis bacteria that penetrate the dentinal tubules can {{be the source of}} intracanal infection and endodontic disease. Quaternary ammonium polyethyleneimine (QPEI) nanopolymers were shown to have long lasting antibacterial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The present study evaluated the intratubular antibacterial effect of an <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer</b> incorporating 1 % QPEI against E. faecalis in a human dentin model. Root canals of extracted teeth were inoculated with E. faecalis for 7 days prior to standard endodontic treatment. The antibacterial effect of an epoxy-amine resin endodontic sealer was tested at concentration of 0 % or 1 % (wt/wt) added QPEI nanoparticles. Reduction in bacterial viability p< 0. 01 was depicted in the dentinal tubules of the root canals obturated with the sealer incorporating QPEI nanoparticles. In conclusion, QPEI nanoparticles when incorporated in a small percentage into epoxy-resin based sealer may target E. faecalis in the dentinal tubules, producing a potent antibacterial effect that reduces significantly bacterial viability...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} two gutta percha solvents on the bond strength of two resin-based sealers to root canal dentin. Materials and methods. Root canals of extracted single rooted human mandibular premolars (n = 60) were decoronated and instrumented with a rotary NiTi system to an apical size of 40 and randomly divided into three groups (n = 20) based on the chemical treatment: Group I, saline (control); group II, Xylene and group III, Endosolv E. All groups {{were divided into two}} sub-groups (n = 10) based on the root filling material: sub-group A, <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer</b> (AH Plus); sub-group B, methacrylate resin sealer (Epiphany). Roots were then sectioned and push-out tests were performed. The data was analysed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a multiple comparison test (p = 0. 05). Results. There was a significant difference in bond strength of both sealers between the control and test groups (p 0. 05). Conclusions. Gutta Percha solvents had an adverse effect on bond strengths of resin sealers to root canal dentin. This was dependent on the chemistry of the solvent and the sealer. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} the infJuence of three <b>epoxy</b> resin-based <b>sealers</b> with distinct radiopacities on the observers' {{ability to detect}} root canal filling voids during radiographic analysis. Material and methods: The root canais of 48 extracted maxillary canines were prepared and divided into three groups. Each group was laterally condensed with one sea/er (AH P/us™, Acrosea/® o r a non-radiopaque sealer), and a longitudinal void was simulated in half of the specimens from each group (n=S). Buccolingual radiographs were obtained and randomly interpreted for voids by a radiologist and an endodontist in a blinded fashion. Teeth were cut and inspected under a microscope to confirm the position of void. Differences in sensitivity and specificity between groups and examiners were compared using the Fisher's Exact and McNemar tests, respectively (a=O. OS). Results: Significantly lower sensitivity leveis (p<O. OS) were observed in the coronal portion of fillings performed with both radiopaque sealers. Specificity va/ues for Acroseal® were significantly higher (p<O. OS) in the coronal and apical portions of fillings.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} and compare the pushout bond strengths of Resilon with two different sealers: Resilon/MetaSEAL (methacrylate based) and Resilon/AH Plus (an <b>epoxy</b> resin-based <b>sealer).</b> Materials and Methods: Forty single canal anterior teeth were decoronated at cementoenamel junction and standardized to 10 ± 1 mm length. Working length was determined followed by biomechanical preparation. Then, the specimens were randomly assigned into two groups of 20 teeth each based on the sealer used with Resilon. All canals were obturated using single-cone obturation technique. Root samples were prepared for pushout testing. The universal testing machine gave the debonding force for individual specimen. This was done for all the specimens. Statistical Analysis: This was done by using unpaired Student's t- test. Results: The roots filled with Resilon/MetaSEAL had higher bond strength (1. 49 ± 0. 09 MPa) compared to Resilon/AH Plus (0. 90 ± 0. 04 MPa) group. The difference in bond strength was statistically significant (P = 0. 0000).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{laboratory}} study was to compare the interfacial adaptation of an epoxy-resin and a self-etch sealer in mesial root canals of mandibular molars filled using the System-B/Elements Obturation Unit. Sixty mesial root canals of mandibular molars were prepared using the K 3 rotary system up to 35. 04 instrument and then filled {{with the aid of}} the System-B/Elements Obturation Unit using either gutta-percha/ThermaSeal Plus (n= 15) or Resilon/Real Seal SE (n= 15). The single cone technique using both materials was used as control. The sealers were stained with Rhodamine B dye and the teeth were filled and sectioned at 2, 4 and 6 mm from the apex. The interfacial marginal adaptation of sealers was evaluated using confocal microscopy. Statistical analyses were performed by the Kruskall-Wallis test (&# 945;= 0. 05). In general, microscopic analysis showed a quite regular gap distribution pattern at sealer-dentin interfaces, mainly for the two groups filled with Real Seal SE. This means that both nonbonding root-filling groups (ThermaSeal Plus) showed significantly higher amount of gap-free regions regardless of the filling technique (p< 0. 05). Better marginal adaptation was obtained with gutta-percha and <b>epoxy</b> resin-based <b>sealer</b> using either the system B or the single cone technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of various chelating solutions on the radicular push-out bond strength of calcium silicate-based and resin-based root canal sealers. Root canals of freshly-extracted single-rooted teeth (n = 80) were instrumented by using rotary instruments. The specimens were randomly divided into 4 groups according to the chelating solutions being tested: (1) 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); (2) 9 % etidronic acid; (3) 1 % peracetic acid (PAA); and (4) distilled water (control). In each group, the roots were further assigned into 2 subgroups according to the sealer used: (1) an <b>epoxy</b> resin-based <b>sealer</b> (AH Plus) and (2) a calcium silicate-based sealer (iRoot SP).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the sealing ability of three root canal sealers, RSA (polydimethylsiloxane sealer), Endion (glass-ionomer <b>sealer)</b> and Topseal (<b>epoxy</b> resin <b>sealer),</b> with and without smear layer removal. Ninety {{extracted}} human teeth were selected and assigned to 6 groups (n= 15), according to the following protocols: in 3 groups, the smear layer was left intact and the root canals were obturated with gutta-percha points and RSA, Endion and Topseal, respectively; in the other 3 groups, the smear layer was removed and the root canals were obturated in the same way as described above. Microleakage was measured at 7 days, 1 month and 2 months, using the fluid transport model. The results were expressed in µL/ 24 h. Data were analyzed statistically by Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests. The results showed that the Topseal group without smear layer leaked significantly less (p 0. 05) were found among the other groups, at the established evaluation intervals. The findings of this study showed that the polydimethylsiloxane sealer (RSA) did not yield better sealing ability than the other sealers, either in the presence or in the absence of smear layer.

40|$|Objective: Our aim was {{to analyze}} the effect of laser {{phototherapy}} on the secretory activity of macrophages activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and stimulated by substances leached from an <b>epoxy</b> resin-based <b>sealer</b> (AH-Plus) and a calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). Background Data: Laser phototherapy can modulate the inflammatory process, improving wound healing. This type of therapy could be useful for modulating postoperative symptoms seen after endodontic treatment. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity was indirectly assessed by measuring mitochondrial activity. Macrophages were stimulated by the leached substances or not (controls), and the groups were then irradiated or not. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and MMP- 1) was analyzed using ELISA. Two irradiations at 6 -h intervals were done with an As-Ga-Al diode laser (780 nm, 70 mW, spot size 4. 0 mm(2), 3 J/cm(2), for 1. 5 sec) in contact mode. Results: The sealers were non-cytotoxic to macrophages. The production of TNF-alpha was significantly decreased by laser phototherapy, regardless of experimental group. The level of secretion of MMP- 1 was similar in all groups. Conclusion: Based on the conditions of this study we concluded that in activated macrophages, laser phototherapy impairs the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, but has no influence on MMP- 1 secretion.
