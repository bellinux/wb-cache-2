5|$|Air Vice Marshal Henry Neilson Wrigley, CBE, DFC, AFC (21April 1892– 14September 1987) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A pioneering flyer and aviation scholar, he piloted the first trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, and afterwards laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RAAF's air power doctrine. During World WarI, Wrigley joined the Australian Flying Corps and saw combat with No.3 Squadron on the Western Front, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross; he later commanded the unit and published a history of its wartime exploits. He was awarded the Air Force Cross for his 1919 cross-country flight.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court {{laid the}} <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{incorporation}} {{of many of}} the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v.

Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E

5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which {{laid the groundwork for}} underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E

5|$|Eric Harrison (10 August 1886– 5September 1945) was an Australian aviator {{who made}} the country's first {{military}} flight, and helped lay the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Born in Victoria, he was a flying instructor in Britain when, in 1912, he answered the Australian Defence Department's call for pilots to form an aviation school. Along with Henry Petre, he established Australia's first air base at Point Cook, Victoria, and its inaugural training unit, the Central Flying School (CFS), before making his historic flight in March 1914. Following the outbreak of World WarI, when Petre went on active service with the Mesopotamian Half Flight, Harrison took charge of instructing student pilots of the Australian Flying Corps at CFS.|$|E
5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome {{can be divided into}} three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E

5|$|On January 16, 1946, Novikov {{submitted}} to Stalin plans that would lay the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> modern Soviet {{air force and}} the industry that would supply it. On April 22, 1946, however, before these could be enacted, Novikov was stripped of his rank and titles and then arrested. The reason for this was that at the Potsdam conference {{it was discovered that}} the United States had better spy planes than the Soviet Union. He was interrogated and tortured the next day and again between May 4 and May 8, 1946 by Lavrentiy Beria before being forced to read a confession to the Politburo implicating Marshal Zhukov. Novikov was tried by the Military Collegium and sentenced to fifteen years in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E

He remained at this post until 1929, {{when he returned to}} Bavaria as commander of Wehrkreis VII in Munich. In his time with the Reichswehr Ministry, Kesselring was involved in the organisation of the army, trimming staff overheads to produce the best possible army with the limited resources available. He helped reorganise the Ordnance Department, laying the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> research and development efforts that would produce new weapons. He was involved in secret military manoeuvres held in the Soviet Union in 1924 and in the so-called Great Plan for a 102-division army, which was prepared in 1923 and 1924. After another brief stint at the Ministry of the Reichswehr, Kesselring was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) in 1930 and spent two years in Dresden with the 4th Artillery Regiment.|$|E
