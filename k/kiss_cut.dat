5000|$|Hendrickson {{said her}} only {{issue with the}} role was {{with the fact that}} the show would not let them use tongue during Bianca and Maggie's kissing scenes. There was a kissing scene that two of them [...] "got so into", but the {{directors}} told them to [...] "cut" [...] and that they were [...] "going to have to do it again because they saw tongue". McManus questioned whether heterosexual characters on the series show tongue. Hendrickson said, [...] "Um, try ménage à trois... In the shower. Or a man with a brother and sister... And a sister? God, no. Two brothers and one woman.... We had this lame little <b>kiss,</b> then <b>cut</b> to Kendall and, um, Ryan mauling each other," [...] she said. Riegel agreed with Hendrickson's assessment that the scene [...] "literally" [...] went from their kiss to the more detailed Ryan and Kendall's, and stated that it was as if Ryan was [...] "devouring Kendall's face".|$|R

[...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij <b>kiss</b> was <b>cut</b> from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant."

6000|$|Summerhay had not {{realized}} {{the extent of}} the danger, but he had known that it existed, especially since Scotland. It would be interesting--as the historians say--to speculate on what he would have done, if he could have foretold what would happen. But he had certainly not foretold the crisis of yesterday evening. He had received a telegram from her at lunch-time, suggesting the fulfilment of a jesting promise, made in Scotland, that she should have tea with him and see his chambers--a small and harmless matter. Only, why had he dismissed his clerk so early? That is the worst of gamblers--they will put a polish on the risks they run. He had not reckoned, perhaps, that she would look so pretty, lying back in his big Oxford chair, with furs thrown open so that her white throat showed, her hair gleaming, a smile coming and going on her lips; her white hand, with polished nails, holding that cigarette; her brown eyes, so unlike Gyp's, fixed on him; her slim foot with high instep thrust forward in transparent stocking. Not reckoned that, when he bent to take her cup, she would put out her hands, draw his head down, press her lips to his, and say: [...] "Now you know!" [...] His head had gone round, still went round, thinking of it! That was all. A little matter--except that, in an hour, he would be meeting the eyes of one he loved much more. And yet--the poison was in his blood; a <b>kiss</b> so <b>cut</b> short--by what--what counter impulse?--leaving him gazing at her without a sound, inhaling that scent of hers--something like a pine wood's scent, only sweeter, while she gathered up her gloves, fastened her furs, {{as if it had been}} he, not she, who had snatched that kiss. But her hand had pressed his arm against her as they went down the stairs. And getting into her cab at the Temple Station, she had looked back at him with a little half-mocking smile of challenge and comradeship and promise. The link would be hard to break--even if he wanted to. And yet nothing would come of it! Heavens, no! He had never thought! Marriage! Impossible! Anything else--even more impossible! When he got back to his chambers, he had found in the box the letter, which her telegram had repeated, readdressed by Gyp from the Red House. And a faint uneasiness at its having gone down there passed through him. He spent a restless evening at the club, playing cards and losing; sat up late in his chambers over a case; had a hard morning's work, and only now that he was nearing Gyp, realized how utterly he had lost the straightforward simplicity of things.|$|R
