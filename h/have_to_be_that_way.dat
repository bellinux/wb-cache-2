However, the latter term can also refer to systems that do not unproven computational hardness assumptions. Today, such systems are {{essentially the same as}} those that are information-theoretically secure. Nevertheless, it does not always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> One day, RSA might be proved secure, as it relies on the assertion that factoring large numbers is hard, thus becoming unconditionally secure, but it will never be information-theoretically secure because even if no efficient algorithms for factoring large primes exist, it could still be done in principle with unlimited computational power.|$|E
50|$|Philosophers also {{distinguish}} the manifest {{image from the}} scientific image. These phrases are due to the American 20th century philosopher Wilfrid Sellars. This is one angle on the ancient philosophical distinction between appearance and reality which is particularly pertinent to everyday contemporary living. Indeed, many believe that the scientific image, with its reductionist methodology, will undermine our sense of individual freedom and responsibility. So, many worry that as science advances, particularly cognitive neuroscience, we will be dehumanized. This certainly has powerful Nietzschean undertones. When our immediately given, manifest (sc. obvious) self-conception is shaken, what is lost for the individual and society? And does it <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way?</b> Some questions well worth working on, then, are those concerning the refinement of the manifest view of such centrally important concepts such as free will, the self and individuality, {{and the possibility of}} real or lived meaning.|$|E

5000|$|Born in Phillips, Maine on November 4, 1883 to Marshall and Aura (Prescott) Davenport, Minnie Davenport was {{a bright}} student. After graduating from the Farmington State Normal School she {{attended}} the New England Conservatory of Music and became a school teacher.

Both Craig and her husband {{became involved in the}} Nonpartisan League, and in 1923, just three years after women won the right to vote, she was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives. She became known by the affectionate nickname, [...] "Min", but also had a reputation as a serious and meticulous legislator. A 1927 report noted, [...] "Mrs. M. Craig watches every move that is made and is ready to blast any presumptuous member with that cold, withering glance that the members know so well and dread so much." [...] Craig served six consecutive sessions in the State legislature. During this time she also held the position of state president of the Non-Partisan League, and was a Republican National Committee woman from 1928 to 1932. In addition to forging her own political career, Craig encouraged other women to become politically active: [...] “There’s a field - a grand one for women - in politics, but women must...play politics as women and not as weak imitations of their ‘lords and masters.’ Men are all to inclined to ‘stuff’ a lady full of nonsense, treat her with not to much respect for her intellect and be far happier when she’s nicely tucked away in some corner where she can do them no harm - and herself no good.

40|$|A {{paradigm}} shift is producing alarming symptoms. As readers turn to ebooks {{the book as}} we know it is dead. Hence, library exhibits of ancient sacred texts, early printing, literary, historical and scientific works from over the centuries remain mere decoration either stored in the mass grave of closed stacks or displayed in showcases as dusty fossils in rigor mortis. It doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Behind every unique rare book, there is an even greater dramatic story that makes for great theatre. By the example of Bernhard of Breydenbach’s Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam (1483 / 4) we uncover the intangible cultural heritage (UNESCO) through (un) scripted historical character interpretation. The au-thentic embodiment of Breydenbach and the reconstruction of his memories which lie behind his work lead to understand what motivated him. The interpretation gives a voice to, and celebrates, the experiences of the author who is excluded from the grander narratives of conventional history. It enhances the visitor’s appreciation and understanding of the book itself. Hence, library exhibitions are not really about books, they are ultimately about the people who created or where affected by those books.

40|$|The {{demolition}} of highly contaminated plutonium buildings usually {{is a long}} and expensive process that involves decontaminating the building to near free- release standards and then using conventional methods to remove the structure.

By removing the select source term and fixing the remaining contamination on the walls, ceilings, floors, and equipment surfaces; open-air demolition is not only feasible, {{but it can be}} done cheaper, better (safer), and faster. Open-air demolition techniques were used to demolish two highly contaminated buildings to slab-on-grade. These facilities on the Department of Energy's Hanford Site were located in, or very near, compounds of operating nuclear facilities that housed hundreds of people working on a daily basis. To keep the facilities operating and the personnel safe, the projects had to be creative in demolishing the structures. Several key techniques were used to control contamination and keep it {{within the confines of the}} demolition area: spraying fixatives before demolition; applying fixative and misting with a fine spray of water as the buildings were being taken down; and demolishing the buildings in a controlled and methodical manner. In addition, detailed air-dispersion modeling was done to establish necessary building and meteorological conditions and to confirm the adequacy of the proposed methods. Both demolition projects were accomplished without any spread of contamination outside the modest buffer areas established for contamination control. Furthermore, personnel exposure to radiological and physical hazards was significantly reduced by using heavy equipment rather than ''hands on'' techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn a {{new global}} environment, {{characterized}} by rapid change, intense information flows and increasing competition because of the reduction of barriers to trade and exchange. Organizations’ leaders face new and hard threats which oblige them to be innovative, {{it is obvious that}} innovation has always been at the heart of business, but until now not {{at the top of the}} management agenda. Competition turns into a game of who can generate the best and greatest number of ideas with strategic perspective. However many organizations spend most of their time reacting to unexpected changes instead of anticipating and preparing for them. Organizations caught off guard may spend a great deal of time and energy “playing catch up”. They use up their energy coping with immediate problems with little energy left to anticipate and prepare for the next challenges. This vicious cycle locks many organizations into a reactive posture. It does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> A sensible alternative is a well tested process called strategic planning which is a step by step process with definite objectives and end products that can be implemented and evaluated. Very simply, it is a process by which we look into the future, paint a picture of that future based on current trends, and influence the forces that will affect us. Strategic Planning is a technical fix that gets at only part of the question of organizational effectiveness and only deals with some of the dilemmas of organizations. In the face of such realities, the notion of strategic thinking emerges to fill the gaps and overcome the limitations that experience with strategic planning has proven to exhibit. This paper presents an integration of leadership roles for innovation by focus on strategic thinking and planning in an effort to make important connections and important distinctions...|$|E
40|$|All of {{the life}} that is known, all organisms that exist on Earth today or {{are known to have}} existed on Earth in the past, are of the same life form: a life form based on DNA and protein. It does not {{necessarily}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Why not have two competing life forms on this planet? Why not have biology as we know it and some other biology that occupies its own distinct niche? Yet that is not how evolution has played out. From microbes living on the surface of antarctic ice to tube worms lying near the deep-sea hydrothermal vents, all known organisms on this planet are of the same biology. Looking at the single known biology on Earth, it is clear that this biology could not have simply sprung forth from the primordial soup. The biological system that is the basis for all known. life is far too complicated to have arisen spontaneously. This brings us to the notion that something else something simpler, must have preceded life based on DNA and protein. One suggestion that has gained considerable acceptance over the past decade is that DNA and protein-based life was preceded by RNA-based life in a period referred to as the 'RNA world'. Even an RNA-based life form would have been fairly complicated - not as complicated as our own DNA- and protein-based life form - but far too complicated, according to prevailing scientific thinking, to have arisen spontaneously from the primordial soup. Thus, {{it has been argued that}} something else must have preceded RNA-based life, or even that there was a succession of life forms leading from the primordial soup to RNA-based life. The experimental evidence to support this conjecture is not strong because, after all, the origin of life was a historical event that left no direct physical record. However, based on indirect evidence in both the geological record and the phylogenetic record of evolutionary history on earth, it is possible to reconstruct a rough picture of what life was like before DNA and protein...|$|E
