5000|$|Ioanna-Maria Gertsou {{was born}} on January 20, 1979 in Athens Greece and she is {{visually}} impaired due to retinopathy of prematurity. She is mostly known as representative of the guide dog movement, through [...] "Lara Guide-Dog School Hellas" [...] a non - profit organisation that she co-founded in 2008. She is an activist, promoting human diversity, guide dog access, physical and electronic accessibility and animal rights. She is also a scientist with superior studies in experimental psychology and cognitive science. From 2006 to 2012, {{she worked as a}} researcher in the Human/computer Interaction Laboratory, located at the Foundation of Research and Technology Hellas (F.O.R.T.H.) which {{is considered to be a}} major scientific center worldwide. In 2008, during a visit at F.O.R.T.H the President of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias was moved by her presentation and did something extraordinary: he bowed and kissed her hand to show his respect. Ioanna-Maria is one among the very few visually impaired / disabled researchers around the world and the only one, employed in Greece. Additionally, she is considered to be a rare case of a person who is blind since birth to exhibit visual synaesthesia. That is why, she is being asked to contribute to experiments, studies and projects regarding perception and the crossing of the senses. Every year, she is invited and participates in numerous conferences, arising matters varying from psychological research to guide dogs and contemporary issues as youth unemployment., Her knoweledge in psychology is often shared on newspapers and blogs. She was the first person to enter with her guide dog (and a dog in general), into the Hellenic Parliament and the European Parliament. In 2009, she protested through the web because her guide dog was denied in two reustaurants. She wrote a letter which went viral and caused great awareness. Following this incident, one year later a Spanish tourist named Antonia Pons Losada was not permitted into the new Acropolis Museum with her guide dog. As a result of local and international outcry regarding issues of guide dog access in Greece on August 2010, Ioanna contributed to the voting of the first national law, related to guide dogs. As soon as the law was approved by the Hellenic Parliament, she took her guide dog [...] "May" [...] and a Television crew for a visit to the Acropolis Museum. Today on the Museum's website we are informed that [...] "guide and assistance dogs, are welcome". According to the law 3868/2010, guide, assistance and therapy dogs are allowed practically everywhere in Greece. The law was recently reviewed, including guide/assistance/therapy dogs who are still in training and claryfing that they can enter into transportation means, without a muzzle. While transforming Greece into a role model for guide dog access, she joined the board of directors of the <b>European</b> <b>Guide</b> Dog Federation to defend the rights and access of guide dog teams, throughout the European Union. In 2013 at the European Parliament, she and former MEP Jorgo Chatzimarkakis were the main rapporteurs for the voting of an E.U. direction, aiming to promote e-accessibility on governmental websites. The direction was approved in 2014. Ioanna-Maria, was two times a political candidate.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} that examines sign language interpreting provisions and practices in legal contexts in various countries (e. g., Brennan & Brown, 1997; McCay & Miller, 2005; Miller, 2001; Napier, 2011, 2012, 2013; Roberson, Russell & Shaw, 2011; Russell, 2002; Turner, 1995; Turner & Brown, 2001). The common theme in the results of all these studies is the limitations faced by deaf sign language users in gaining access to justice, either through inadequate interpreting provision, poor quality interpreting services, or lack of training, accreditation and standards for legal signed language interpreters and translators. The Justisigns project (2013 - 2016) conducted by a consortium of hearing and deaf researchers and signed language interpreter practitioners represents a ground-breaking initiative focussing on providing qualified and qualifying sign language interpreters new competencies in interpreting within a legal setting. The remit of the project was to develop training courses to be made available to sign language interpreters, legal professionals and deaf sign language users in Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, and the UK. In addition the project developed: a <b>European</b> <b>guide</b> for interpreters practicing in legal settings; a <b>European</b> <b>guide</b> for legal professionals working with Deaf communities and signed language interpreters to improve their communication skills; an information tool-kit for deaf people in the national sign language to better understand the legal framework in each country; European outreach seminars and awareness sessions; project information leaflets; training posters with practical legal/sign language/Deaf culture & communication tips; and case studies of best practice and experiences from deaf users. This mixed-methods study involved surveying deaf people, interpreters and legal professionals through questionnaires, focus groups and interviews, as well as conducting a qualitative linguistic case study analyses of signed language interpretermediated legal communication, with a view to informing the development of the training courses and other deliverables in the project. This presentation will provide an overview of the data that was collected, and some of the challenges reported by deaf people, interpreters and police officers in ensuring that police interviews go smoothly. We will make recommendations to ensure best practice in sign language interpreting provision in police settings in Europe, and a summary of the training materials developed, which will go some way towards future proofing legal sign language interpreting standards and access to justice for deaf sign language users. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} <b>European</b> <b>guide</b> to science, technology, and {{innovation}} (STI) studies. It aims to facilitate public access to these relatively young specialties of academic and strategic research. STI studies study the development of scientific knowledge, the process of technology creation, and the way these interact to innovate the economy and society as a whole. Because of this, the way they formulate the important questions about future social and economic developments, and the answers they have provisionally given, are relevant to {{a large number of}} people. Yet, many people who might profit from the knowledge developed in STI studies are unaware of these valuable sources. This is the main reason this guide has been written. The results have also surprised the authors. This guide comprises more institutions than expected, and these are also more diverse than foreseen. Apparently, European society has become so complex that nobody has a clear overview. For example, academic institutions no longer have the monopoly on knowledge creation. The increasing specialization in science has moreover made it virtually impossible to know one's intellectual neighbours. On top of this, the guide ties together three different intellectual traditions: the sociology of science, the history of technology, and evolutionary economics. As a result, this guide brings together centres and institutions that never were on one podium before. In general terms, the guide should be useful to anyone interested in knowledge creation, technology development, or innovation. The guide is especially meant for: * students who wish to complement their education in one of the sciences, social sciences, or humanities with one or more courses in STI studies, * journalists, public relations experts, or communication specialists who are confronted in their daily practice with the complex issues arising out of socio-technical innovation, * teachers and lecturers in secondary and tertiary education who either wish to update their knowledge about science, technology, or innovation, or who wish to acquire new teaching skills in these areas, * managers and decision makers in the private sector who need to develop knowledge based strategies, or face the task of managing technology development or innovation processes, and therefore wish to update their capabilities, * policy makers in the public sector who are confronted by the complexities of policy development and risk management in European technological culture, and therefore wish to refresh their window on the world. The guide consists of three chapters: 1. The first chapter gives a general introduction to the topics in STI studies. This should give the reader a quick overview and a bit of the flavour of the field. The second part of this chapter is divided in different sections meant for the different target audiences: * students, * communicators, * teachers, * managers, * decision-makers. 2. The second chapter is {{the main body of the}} guide, and gives practical information about the institutions, arranged on a per country basis. The information is based on documentation provided by the institutions themselves. The first type of entries give the institutional address, phone numbers, and WWW and Email addresses; the second type of entries describe the general profile of the institution; and the third type of entries give detailed course information. 3. The third chapter gives a topical entry to the STI studies in this guide. To give the reader a feel of the different types of approach in the STI centres in Europe, the chapter provides a tentative overview of the most important topics, without pretending to be complete. In each topical section, one project is described in more detail. This should give the reader more in-depth information than would be possible by a listing of all projects relevant to the topic. Yet, it often means a rather arbitrary choice among many equally interesting projects. Therefore, each section is ended by a index of European STI centres which are actively engaged with the topic involved. Effectively, this third chapter is a topical index to practical information in the guide. Taken together, the three chapters should facilitate searching through this guide to European STI centres both an a per country basis, and per topical interest. If one is mostly interested in studying in a certain region, chapter 2 can be used as the main entry into the guide. If on the contrary a certain topic is the perspective regardless of where the STI centres are located, chapter 3 is the best starting point. As will be clear upon reading, the information about the different institutions is very diverse. This is not a coincidence, nor only a practical matter. To be sure, the fact that this guide {{is the first}} of its kind certainly contributes to a rather varying format of presentation. But more important is the nature of science, technology, and innovation studies. It is a quite heterogenous field of studies, coming from diverse academic and policy related traditions. The object of study is moreover itself heterogenous, due to the complex nature of present-day European society. We have chosen not to try to reduce this variety for the sake of a more coherent presentation. We think on the contrary that the variety in the way the institutions are represented may itself be an additional source of relevant and useful information. Practical information such as telephone numbers and course data tend to have a high turnover rate. This is the reason this guide has been published both in printed form and as a World Wide Web document. The WWW-version contains recently updated information. This is the first time a guide like this on STI studies has been published. Although we have done our utmost best to collect as much information as possible, we are certain that some institutions may have been missed. This is, unfortunately, inevitable in a first-time experiment. (Size of guide: 246 pages approx.) ...|$|E
