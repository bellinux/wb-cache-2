25|$|Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or {{weakness}} {{should be}} treated {{with the addition of}} <b>hematin,</b> heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The best-understood {{examples}} of such <b>hematin</b> biocrystallization inhibitors are quinoline drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine. These drugs bind to both free heme and hemozoin crystals, and therefore block the addition of new heme units onto the growing crystals. The small, most rapidly growing face is the face to which inhibitors are believed to bind.|$|E
25|$|The malaria parasite, therefore, detoxifies the <b>hematin,</b> {{which it}} does by biocrystallization—converting it into {{insoluble}} and chemically inert β-hematin crystals (called hemozoin). In Plasmodium the food vacuole fills with hemozoin crystals, which are about 100-200 nanometres long and each contain about 80,000 heme molecules. Detoxification through biocrystallization {{is distinct from}} the detoxification process in mammals, where an enzyme called heme oxygenase instead breaks excess heme into biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide.|$|E
25|$|Hemozoin {{formation}} {{is an excellent}} drug target, since {{it is a process}} that is essential to the survival of the malaria parasite and absent from the human host. The drug target <b>hematin</b> is host-derived and largely outside the genetic control of the parasite, which makes the development of drug resistance more difficult. Many clinically used drugs are thought to act by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin in the food vacuole. This prevents the detoxification of the heme released in this compartment, and kills the parasite.|$|E
25|$|The pathway is {{initiated}} by the synthesis of D-aminolevulinic acid (dALA or δALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is negatively regulated by glucose and heme concentration. Mechanism of inhibition of ALAs by heme or hemin is by decreasing stability of mRNA synthesis and by decreasing the intake of mRNA in the mitochondria. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or <b>hematin</b> and glucose can abort attacks of acute intermittent porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hematin</b> (trade name Panhematin) and heme arginate (trade name NormoSang) are {{the drugs}} {{of choice in}} acute porphyria, in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective; {{effectiveness}} varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of NormoSang are kept at two national centers; emergency supply is available from St Thomas's Hospital, London. In the United States, Lundbeck manufactures and supplies Panhematin for infusion.|$|E
25|$|As it was {{believed}} that the folkloric vampire could move about freely in daylight hours, as opposed to the 20th century variant, congenital erythropoietic porphyria cannot readily explain the folkloric vampire but may be an explanation of the vampire as we know it in the 20th century. In addition, the folkloric vampire, when unearthed, was always described as looking quite healthy ("as they were in life"), while due to disfiguring aspects of the disease, sufferers would not have passed the exhumation test. Individuals with congenital erythropoietic porphyria do not crave blood. The enzyme (<b>hematin)</b> necessary to alleviate symptoms is not absorbed intact on oral ingestion, and drinking blood would have no beneficial effect on the sufferer. Finally, and most important, the fact that vampire reports were literally rampant in the 18th century, and that congenital erythropoietic porphyria is an extremely rare manifestation of a rare disease, makes it an unlikely explanation of the folkloric vampire.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{cure for}} HCP caused by the {{deficient}} activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase. [...] Treatment of the acute symptoms of HCP {{is the same as}} for other acute porphyrias. [...] Intravenous hemin (as heme arginate or <b>hematin)</b> is the recommended therapy for acute attacks. [...] Acute attacks can be severe enough to cause death if not treated quickly and correctly. [...] Hospitalization is typically required for administration of hemin, and appropriate drug selection is key to avoid exacerbating symptoms with drugs that interact poorly with porphyrias. [...] Proper drug selection is most difficult when it comes to treatment of the seizures that can accompany HCP, as most anti-seizure medications can make the symptoms worse. [...] Gabapentin and levetiracetam are two anti-seizure drugs that are thought to be safe.|$|E

2500|$|Later, in 1891, T. Carbone and W.H. Brown (1911) {{published}} papers {{linking the}} degradation of hemoglobin with the production of pigment, describing the malaria pigment {{as a form of}} <b>hematin</b> and disproving the widely held idea that it is related to melanin. Brown observed that all melanins were bleaching rapidly with potassium permanganate, while with this reagent malarial pigment manifests not the slightest sign of a true bleach reaction. The name [...] "hemozoin" [...] was proposed by Louis Westenra Sambon. In the 1930s several authors identified hemozoin as a pure crystalline form of α-hematin and showed that the substance did not contain proteins within the crystals, but no explanation for the solubility differences between malaria pigment and α-hematin crystals was given.|$|E
2500|$|Pathology of F. magna {{infection}} varies {{according to}} host type but some features are shared by all three types. Primary lesions usually occur in the liver and are associated with mechanical damage due to migrating juvenile flukes or fibrous encapsulation of sedentary adult flukes. The most common feature of F. magna infection is black pigmentation in abdominal or thoracic organs, especially in the liver. The <b>hematin</b> pigment is produced by flukes as a byproduct of feeding on blood. Pigment within tissues {{is a result of}} migrating of juvenile flukes and it accumulates within hepatic cells without resorption. F. magna has also been associated with Red Water disease in bovine. F. magna causes liver damage, which allows the bacteria Clostridium haemolyticum to cause secondary infection in hepatic tissue. The infection will decrease the livers function, and the host's urine will become red, hence the name [...] "Red Water" [...] disease.|$|E

Vanadium compounds in its low oxidation state tends to perform dehalogenation reaction via one electron reduction.

Lithium chromium(I) dihydride has also {{been used as a}} versatile reducing agent to dehalogenate various alkyl or aryl halides as shown in scheme 3: [...] Other than these metals, iron is the most studied metal for the dehalogenation reaction. Cahiez and his co-workers reported reduction of bromo-alkenes using manganese(II) halide in presence of Fe(acac)3. Inspired by this work, Mohammed and coworkers also performed hydrobromination of 1,1,-dibromo-1-alkenes in presence of Grignard agents and transition metals such as Fe and Cobalt. Macromolecules such as <b>Hematin,</b> cobalamin, vitamin B12, and coenzyme F430 are also used for dichlorination of polychlorinated ethylenes and benzenes.
