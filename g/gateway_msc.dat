40|$|Facies {{analysis}} and sequence-stratigraphic techniques allow {{to define a}} chronostratigraphic framework for the Messinian successions of the Northern Apennine and Sicilian-Maghrebian foredeep basins based on the recognition and correlation of a hierarchy of stratal units recording {{in time and space}} the evolution of shallow to deep-water evaporitic and siliciclastic depositional systems during the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC). The evolution of Mediterranean depositional systems during the different MSC stages was controlled by a complex interplay between tectonics and orbitally-forced climate changes. Precession-modulated climate changes, likely due to amplification effects in a strongly restricted Mediterranean basin, control the development of elementary depositional sequences (EDS) whose key surfaces are the most prominent stratigraphic features at the outcrop scale. EDS are arranged into higher-rank stratal units which form the systems tracts of two large-scale depositional sequences separated by a sequence boundary corresponding to the subaerial Messinian erosional surface (MES); such surface can be traced downbasin into a correlative conformity at the base of deep-water evaporite-bearing turbidite systems. These large-scale depositional sequences appear mainly controlled by tectonics and its side-effects on the hydrologic balance of the Mediterranean basin, modulating the water exchanges at the Atlantic gateways and modifying the internal physiography. Timing and organization of higher-rank systems tracts appear to be influenced by climate changes at the obliquity and eccentricity scale. The resulting stratigraphic scenario has important implications for the general MSC evolution. Lower Gypsum evaporites actually comprise both primary (PLG) and resedimented (RLG) facies which accumulated in different depocenters and at different times. PLG deposits formed within shallow-water, restricted sub-basins during the HST of the lower depositional sequence between 5. 96 and 5. 61 Ma; RLG, associated in Sicily with Calcare di Base limestones and Halite, accumulated in deep-water settings during the subsequent base-level fall associated with an important evaporative drawdown culminating at around 5. 55 Ma with local salt basin fill and desiccation. The Sicilian Upper Gypsum was deposited in shallow-water settings during the lowstand and transgressive systems tracts marking the gradual refill of the Mediterranean basin with oligohaline to mesohaline waters. The sudden re-opening of the Atlantic <b>gateways</b> marks the <b>MSC</b> end at the Pliocene base (5. 33 Ma) and the maximum flooding surface of the upper depositional sequence...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLocated on {{the margin}} of the west Alboran basin, the Gibraltar Arc (Betic-Rif {{mountain}} belt) displays post-Pliocene vertical movements evidenced by uplifted marine sedimentary basins and marine terraces. Quantification of vertical movements is an important clue to understand the origin of present-day relief generation in the Betic-Rif mountain chain together with the causes of the Messinian Salinity Crisis. In this paper, we present the results of a pluridisciplinary study combining an analysis of low temperature thermochronology and Pliocene basins evolution to constrain the exhumation history and surface uplift of internals units of the Rif belt (Northern Morocco). The mean (U-Th) /He apatite ages obtained from 11 samples are comprised between 14. 1 and 17. 8 Ma and display a wide dispersion, which could be explained by a great variability of apatite chemistries in the analyzed samples. No correlations between altitude and age have been found along altitudinal profile suggesting a rapid exhumation during this period. Thermal modeling using our (U-Th) /He apatite ages and geochronological data previously obtained in the same area (40 Ar/ 39 Ar and K/Ar data on biotite, zircon and apatite fission track) allow us to propose a cooling history. The rocks suffered a rapid cooling at 60 - 100 °C/Ma between 22. 5 and 19 Ma, then cooled to temperatures around 40 °C between 19 and 18 Ma. They were re-heated at around 110 °C between 18 and 15 Ma then rapidly cooled and exhumed to reach the surface temperature at around 13 Ma. The re-heating could be related to a renewal in thrusting and burying of the inner zones. Between 15 and 13 Ma the cooling resumed at a rate of 50 °C/Ma indicating an exhumation rate of 0. 8 mm/y considering an average 40 °C/km geothermal gradient. This exhumation may be linked to the extension in the Alboran Sea. Otherwise biostratigraphic and sedimentological analysis of Pliocene basins of the internal Rif provided informations on the more recent events and vertical movements. Pliocene deposits of the Rifian coast represent the passive infilling of palaeo-rias between 5. 33 and 3. 8 Ma. The whole coastal area was uplifted at slow average rates (0. 01 - 0. 03 mm/y) in relation with a northeastward tilting of 0. 2 - 0. 3 ° since the Lower-Pliocene. A late Pliocene to present extensional tectonics associated to uplift has been identified all along the coastal ranges of the Internal Zone of the Rif chain. This extension was coeval with the major late Pliocene to Pleistocene extensional episode of the Alboran Sea and appears to be still active nowadays. No significant late Messinian uplift was evidenced, thus calling into question the geodynamic models relating the closure of the marine <b>gateways</b> and the <b>MSC</b> to slab roll back...|$|R

40|$|During the Messinian {{salinity}} crisis (MSC, 5. 96 - 5. 33 {{million years}} ago (Ma)), Atlantic–Mediterranean connections became stepwise restricted and interrupted. Massive evaporites were deposited in the Mediterranean Basin, which - after water levels dropped ~ 1 km (5. 59 - 5. 5 Ma) - was partially refilled with non-marine waters. The MSC deposits are subdivided into Lower Evaporites of the marine phase (5. 96 - 5. 59 Ma) and Upper Evaporites of the shallow water environment (5. 5 - 5. 33 Ma), which is especially characterized by non-marine (Lago Mare) beds. Inflow of oceanic water through the Gibraltar gateway {{at the onset of}} the Pliocene restored marine conditions. This Ph. D. study focussed on the paleoceanographic and environmental response of the circum-Mediterranean to deteriorating Atlantic–Mediterranean and intra-Mediterranean connections and to possible opening of a Mediterranean–Paratethys <b>gateway</b> in the <b>MSC</b> interval. To constrain the timing of the latter, correlation between Mediterranean and Paratethys was achieved through establishing reliable age models on both sides of the gateway. Magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data from the Dacic Basin (Romania) show that the upper half of the Messinian corresponds to the Pontian of the Paratethys. Data from the Strimon Basin (Greece) indicate that a shallow marine to brackish-lacustrine transition occurred at 6. 3 Ma. Along the adjacent Orphanic Gulf, shallow marine clastics and gypsum beds (correlated to the Lower Evaporites) are followed by a brackish/fresh water unit that may reflect the desiccation event and Upper Evaporites. The Miocene–Pliocene boundary is locally marked by a transition to marine conditions in a relatively deep basin; in the Strimon Basin a shallow marine interval interrupted fluvio-lacustrine conditions. Reconstruction of the early Pliocene paleobathymetry of Milos and Aegina (Greece) shows that rapid subsidence occurred associated with late-orogenic extension in the Southern Aegean, 1 - 1. 5 million years before the onset of volcanism that formed these islands. The relative sea level rise post-dated the MSC by 0. 3 million years. Upper Miocene and lowermost Pliocene sediments on Milos and Aegina possibly represent the paleoenvironment of a Mediterranean–Agean threshold region, which possibly was too shallow to record the MSC events. An integrated, high-resolution stratigraphy study of the Loulja sections (Atlantic coast, Morocco) results in a tuned open ocean benthic isotope record that permits comparison of the glacial history to Mediterranean paleoenvironmental events of the MSC. Analyses of nannofossils and dinoflagellates from the Lower and Upper Evaporites and from the Orphanic Gulf, Strimon, and Dacic basins reveal that Atlantic water entered the Mediterranean during the Lower Evaporite interval, but that the Mediterranean and tributary Paratethys remained isolated throughout the desiccation and Upper Evaporite interval. The MSC onset had no direct glacio-eustatic origin, but resulted from the climatic effect of the eccentricity cycle superimposed on the regional tectonic trend of restriction of the Atlantic gateway; two successive glacials controlled the isolation and desiccation phase. Subsequent deglaciation corresponded to the onset of the Upper Evaporites. The Miocene–Pliocene boundary concurred with a minor precession-related shift to lighter benthic isotope values; the Mediterranean flooding was therefore related to tectonics or headward fluvial erosion rather than to a major glacio-eustatic sea level rise...|$|R
5000|$|When the SMSC determines {{it needs}} to attempt to deliver a Short Message to its destination, it will send the SMS-PP APDU {{containing}} the text message, the [...] "B-Party" [...] (destination phone number) and other details to the <b>Gateway</b> <b>MSC</b> (GMSC) logical component on the SMSC.

To do this, the GMSC invokes the MAP service package MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM, which sends a sendRoutingInfoForSM (SRI-for-SM) MAP message to the destination number's HLR, requesting their present location. This SRI-for-SM message may be sent to an HLR in the same network as the SMSC, or via an interconnect to an HLR in a foreign PLMN, depending on which network the destination subscriber belongs to.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, {{the phone}} is free to roam {{anywhere}} in the operator's network or on the networks of roaming partners, including in other countries.

5000|$|If {{the mobile}} phone is not {{currently}} {{associated with a}} Visited Location Register (because the phone has been turned off) then the Home Location Register returns a number known as the Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number to the <b>Gateway</b> <b>MSC,</b> and the call is forwarded there.
