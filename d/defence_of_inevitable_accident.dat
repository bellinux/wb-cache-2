50|$|Wake-Walker v SS Colin W Ltd is a Canadian {{admiralty}} law case concerning the issue <b>of</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident.</b> The case was {{decided by the}} Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in an appeal affirming a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a novel three-level sensor fusion {{approach}} in order to detect and track cars and pedestrians. The underlying perception system is composed of a far infrared imaging device, a laser scanner and several radar sensors, which operate integrated into a BMW sedan. At three different levels fusion is applied to approach the generation of a robust and accurate description of the area {{in front of the}} vehicle. Based on this environment perception a preventive safety application is outlined, which autonomously brakes in case <b>of</b> an <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{preventive}} safety {{application is}} presented in principle, which autonomously brakes in case <b>of</b> an <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident</b> {{in order to reduce}} the consequences of a collision. For an effective mitigation of collisions with preceding vehicles and vulnerable road users an efficient system for the perception of the environment combined with reliable decision measures for the activation of the actuator is required. Therefore, the potential of a sensor data fusion approach is examined since current off-the-shelf single sensor systems are far from the generation of a robust and accurate description of the area in front of the vehicle. Based on this environment description, a novel situation analysis algorithm evaluates the probability of a crash by computing the trajectories of the host vehicle and the obstacles. In case <b>of</b> an <b>inevitable</b> collision the concept application autonomously triggers the brakes {{in order to reduce the}} impact of the crash...|$|R
25|$|Conclusion: The {{flight was}} {{substantially}} safe up to 19,500 meters; 20,500 meters {{was on the}} edge but presented no imminent danger; ascent to 22,000 meters led to an <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{admiralty}} action was heard by Mr. Justice Demers of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Quebec Admiralty District), assisted by two nautical assessors. The plaintiffs {{alleged that the}} collision was caused solely by the improper and negligent navigation and mismanagement of Dragon by Wake-Walker. In his defence, Wake-Walker pleaded <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident,</b> said {{to be caused by}} the maneuvering of the Saguenay Trader, which Wake-Walker was trying to avoid hitting. On 21 June 1935, Demers J. held that Wake-Walker was liable.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> <b>inevitable</b> evil, the {{emergency}} situation {{is the result}} of non-human intervention, such as an act of nature (a flood, for example) or some other chance circumstance like a shipwreck. If a fire breaks out in Y's house, and X, in order to escape, has to break through a window, he may reply to a charge of malicious damage to property with a <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> necessity. If X's baby gets hold of a bottle of pills and swallows all of them, and X in rushing her to hospital exceeds the speed limit, he may also rely on necessity.|$|R
50|$|On 13 August 1934, Dragon under Wake-Walker's command was {{entering}} the Market (or Victoria) Basin in the harbour of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, {{when the ship}} collided with an oil bunkering steamer, Maplebranch, which was securely moored {{at the time of}} the collision. Maplebranch sank. The steamer's owners sued Wake-Walker for the damages to Maplebranch and its cargo, alleged to have been caused solely by the improper and negligent navigation and mismanagement of Dragon by Wake-Walker. In his defence, Wake-Walker pleaded <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident,</b> caused by the maneuvering of a third vessel, Saguenay Trader, which Wake-Walker was trying to avoid hitting.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the law {{governing}} recovery in automobile cases began long before {{the time of the}} automobile. The older doctrine of liability for causing bodily injury directly, even by accident, was strict; the individual acted at his peril. There were suggestions that he might escape liability by showing 2 ̆ 2 <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident,</b> 2 ̆ 2 or that the cause of the injury was 2 ̆ 2 utterly without his fault. 2 ̆ 2 But it was the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s burden to make such a showing, and this was never successfully done in any reported case before the nineteenth century...|$|R
5|$|While {{head of the}} Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended {{construction}} of the Moscow Metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and {{spent much of his}} time down in the tunnels. When the <b>inevitable</b> <b>accidents</b> did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the Order of Lenin for his role in its construction. Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee which was responsible for Moscow oblast, a province with a population of 11million.|$|R

"Now, you see," [...] {{continued}} Rollo's father, [...] "that {{if these}} watches should get lost or injured in any way, {{the question whether}} the watchmaker {{would have to pay}} for them or not, would depend upon the degree of care it would have required to save them. For instance, if he locked them all up with special care, and particularly the repeater, and then the building were struck with lightning and the watches all destroyed, he would not have to pay for any of them; for this would be an <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident,</b> which all his care could not guard against. It would have been as likely to have happened to my repeater, if I had kept it at home.|$|R

40|$|My first {{proposition}} is {{a simple}} one, {{and if it is}} accepted it is certainly broad enough to require an affirmative answer to the question put in the title. The proposition is this: Strict liability is to be preferred over a system of liability based on fault wherever you have an enterprise or activity, beneficial to many, which takes a more or less <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident</b> toll <b>of</b> human life and limb. This is true at least where the accident victims are as a class economically ill-equipped to carry the burden of serious accident losses. The impact of such losses on the individual in terms of human hardship is often crushing and the repercussions of this blow reach far beyond the individual and pose a significant social problem...|$|R
