25|$|In {{their efforts}} to gather further evidence, police and social {{services}} also spoke with Mae, who, having spoken with her 13-year-old sister and learned the <b>girl</b> <b>did</b> not wish to see her father charged, initially denied she had endured any molestation as an adolescent. Police then focused their attentions on tracing Heather in efforts to corroborate Anna Marie's claims of sexual abuse, although enquiries conducted with the Inland Revenue and the Social Security department held no records attesting to Heather being alive. Two months later, Gloucester social services also contacted police to stress their concern over the whereabouts of Heather.|$|E
500|$|According to {{animation}} director Yoo Jae-myung, Nickelodeon {{was initially}} reluctant {{to approve the}} series and suspended production because, unlike in almost all American animated series, the protagonist was a girl. Conventional wisdom, according to Konietzko, had it that [...] "girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls". The creators eventually persuaded the channel's executives to change their mind. Konietzko related that in test screenings, boys said that Korra being a <b>girl</b> <b>did</b> not matter to them: [...] "They just said she was awesome." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at {{a picnic}} on Chartiers Creek that {{attracted}} many young people from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another <b>girl,</b> <b>did</b> not spot Roselle until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como's turn to sing, he chose [...] "More Than You Know", with his eyes on Roselle for the entire song. The teenage sweethearts were married July 31, 1933. They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri, with traditional, non-show-business values. Because Perry Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, the British media {{reported}} that she was anorexic, labelling her [...] "Kylie Thinogue". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track [...] "Did It Again". Interviewed by Company magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever <b>Girl</b> (<b>Did</b> It Again)".|$|E
2500|$|By 1957, Fred and {{his brother}} John would socialise at a youth club in nearby Ledbury, though his {{distinct}} and guttural Herefordshire accent marked him as a [...] "country bumpkin". He aggressively pestered women and girls, whom he objectified as sources of pleasure {{to be used as}} he saw fit, and would abruptly approach and fondle them. When a <b>girl</b> <b>did</b> acquiesce to his advances, she would find his sexual performance unsatisfying, as his primary objective was his own gratification.|$|E
2500|$|Rose would {{occasionally}} sexually abuse the girl herself, and would later take extreme gratification in degrading {{the child with}} acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt. From the age of 13, both Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Nonetheless, Rose was always present {{in the room when}} these acts occurred, to ensure the <b>girl</b> <b>did</b> not reveal her true age. On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged either 13 or 14, Rose took the girl to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of barley wine. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once the trio had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father's van and beaten by Rose, who asked the girl the question: [...] "Do you think you could be my friend?" [...] before she was sexually abused by both her father and stepmother.|$|E
