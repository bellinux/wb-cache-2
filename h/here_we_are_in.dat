2500|$|In 1949, Arthur Godfrey and His Friends, {{a weekly}} {{informal}} variety show, began on CBS-TV in prime time. His affable personality combined warmth, heart, and occasional bits of double entendre repartee, {{such as his}} remark when the show went on location: [...] "Well, <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> Miami Bitch. Hehheh." [...] Godfrey received adulation from fans who felt that despite his considerable wealth, he was really [...] "one of them," [...] his personality that of a friendly next-door-neighbor. His ability to sell products, insisting he would not promote any in {{which he did not}} personally believe, gave him a level of trust from his audience, a belief that [...] "if Godfrey said it, it must be so." [...] When he quit smoking after his 1953 hip surgery, he began speaking out against smoking on the air, to the displeasure of longtime sponsor Chesterfield. When he stood his ground, the company withdrew as a sponsor. Godfrey shrugged off their departure since he knew other sponsors would easily fill the vacancy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bless me!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I did {{not know}} that I had been asleep. It seems but an instant ago that I was listening"--and here he checked himself--"that is, that I was wide awake, and <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> broad daylight." ...|$|E

"Well spoken, Master Richard," [...] {{said the}} outlaw; [...] "it was {{excellently}} well spoken, and, for my part, I thank you cordially. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> good hands; {{we shall be}} justly tried, and some time this evening decently hanged on the same tree." ...|$|E

60|$|I nodded. It seemed strange, indeed, to {{be talking}} thus at such a place. Life has taught me since {{that it was not}} so strange, for however a man may strive and suffer for an object, he usually sits quiet at the consummation. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the door-yard of a {{peaceful}} cabin, the ground frozen in lumps under our feet, {{and it seemed to me}} that the wind had something to do with the lightness of the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, friend," [...] {{said the}} Independent, [...] "thou riskest nothing by thy freedom {{and trust in}} me. I can be bon camarado to a good soldier, {{although}} I have striven with him even to the going down of the sun.--But <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> front of the Lodge." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "See, now!" [...] said Bratti, triumphantly; [...] "I've {{made a good}} {{bargain with}} mere words. I've made you tell me something, young man, though you're as hard to hold as a lamprey. San Giovanni be praised! a blind Florentine is a match for two one-eyed men.

6000|$|... 'The fact is, brother,' {{said the}} hangman, {{in a tone}} of greater confidence, 'that you got into bad company. The man that was with you was looked after more than you, and it was him I wanted. As to me, what have I got by it? <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> one and the same plight.' ...|$|E

"We {{had breakfast}} while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{waiting for the}} rain to stop, and I can still {{envision}} sitting with the Clowns in a restaurant behind Griffith Stadium and hearing them break all the plates in the kitchen after we finished eating. What a horrible sound. Even as a kid, the irony of it hit me: <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the capital {{in the land of}} freedom and equality, and they had to destroy the plates that had touched the forks that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the mouths of black men. If dogs had eaten off those plates, they'd have washed them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, I {{remembered what}} a good joke you all {{considered}} Uncle Laurie's marriage, and I thought I'd give you another nice little surprise,' laughed Emil. 'I'm off duty, and it seemed best {{to take advantage of}} wind and tide, and come along as convoy to the old boy here.

The Marquis cannot deny {{that he is}} a gentleman. He cannot deny that I am a gentleman. And in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt, I propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off.
