40|$|Aberrant DNA {{methylation}} is {{a frequent}} epigenetic alteration in cancer cells that {{has emerged as a}} pivotal mechanism for tumorigenesis. Accordingly, novel therapies targeting the epigenome are being explored with the aim to restore normal DNA methylation patterns on oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. A limited number of studies indicate that dietary compound resveratrol modulates DNA methylation of several cancer-related genes; however a complete view of changes in methylome by resveratrol has not been reported yet. In this study we performed a genome-wide survey of DNA methylation signatures in triple negative breast cancer cells exposed to resveratrol. Our data showed that resveratrol treatment for 24 h and 48 h decreased gene promoter hypermethylation and increased DNA hypomethylation. Of 2476 hypermethylated genes in control cells, 1, 459 and 1, 547 were differentially hypomethylated after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Remarkably, resveratrol did not induce widespread non-specific DNA hyper- or hypomethylation as changes in methylation were found in only 12. 5 % of 27, 728 CpG loci. Moreover, resveratrol restores the hypomethylated and hypermethylated status of key tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively. Importantly, the integrative analysis of methylome and transcriptome profiles in response to resveratrol showed that methylation alterations were concordant with changes in mRNA expression. Our findings reveal {{for the first time the}} impact of resveratrol on the methylome of breast cancer cells and identify novel potential targets for epigenetic therapy. We propose that resveratrol may be considered as a dietary <b>epidrug</b> as it may exert its anti-tumor activities by modifying the methylation status of cancer -related genes which deserves further in vivo characterization...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice overexpressing {{the high}} {{mobility}} group A (HMGA) genes, Hmga 1 or Hmga 2 develop pituitary tumours and their overexpression {{is also a}} frequent finding in human pituitary adenomas. In some cases, increased expression of HMGA 2 but not that of HMGA 1 is consequent to genetic perturbations. However, recent studies show that down-regulation of microRNA (miRNA), that contemporaneously target the HMGA 1 and HMGA 2 transcripts, are associated with their overexpression. In a cohort of primary pituitary adenoma we determine the impact of epigenetic modifications on the expression of HMGA-targeting miRNA. For these miRNAs, chromatin immunoprecipitations showed that transcript down-regulation is correlated with histone tail modifications associated with condensed silenced genes. The functional impact of epigenetic modification on miRNA expression was determined in the rodent pituitary cell line, GH 3. In these cells, histone tail, miRNA-associated, modifications {{were similar to those}} apparent in human adenoma and likely account for their repression. Indeed, challenge of GH 3 cells with the epidrugs, zebularine and TSA, led to enrichment of the histone modification, H 3 K 9 Ac, associated with active genes, and depletion of the modification, H 3 K 27 me 3, associated with silent genes and re-expression of HMGA-targeting miRNA. Moreover, epidrugs challenges were also associated with a concomitant decrease in hmga 1 transcript and protein levels and concurrent increase in bmp- 4 expression. These findings show that the inverse relationship between HMGA expression and targeting miRNA is reversible through <b>epidrug</b> interventions. In addition to showing a mechanistic link between epigenetic modifications and miRNA expression these findings underscore their potential as therapeutic targets in this and other diseases...|$|E

The growing field of epigenetics has contributed {{to our understanding of}} oncogenesis and tumor progression, and has allowed the development of novel therapeutic drugs. First-generation epigenetic inhibitor drugs have obtained modest clinical results in two types of hematological malignancy. Second-generation epigenetic inhibitors are in development, and have intrinsically greater selectivity for their molecular targets. Solid tumors are more genetic and epigenetically complex than hematological malignancies, but the transcriptome and epigenome biomarkers have been identified for many of these malignancies. This solid tumor molecular aberration profile may be modified using specific or quasi-specific <b>epidrugs</b> together with conventional and innovative anticancer treatments. In this critical review, we briefly analyze the strategies to select the targeted epigenetic changes, enumerate the second-generation epigenetic inhibitors, and describe the main signs indicating the potential of epigenetic therapies in the management of solid tumors. We also highlight the work of consortia or academic organizations that support the undertaking of human epigenetic therapeutic projects as well as some examples of transcriptome/epigenome profile determination in clinical assessment of cancer patients treated with <b>epidrugs.</b> There is a good chance that epigenetic therapies will be able to be used in patients with solid tumors in the future. This may happen soon through collaboration of diverse scientific groups, making the selection of targeted epigenetic aberration(s) more rapid, the design and probe of drug candidates, accelerating in vitro and in vivo assays, and undertaking new cancer epigenetic-therapy clinical trails.

40|$|Histone lysine {{acetylation}} {{is a key}} regulator of gene expression. Cancer manifests {{because of}} both genetic and epigenetic alterations. In several solid tumours and haematological malignancies the histone acetylation patterns are distorted {{as a result of}} various genetic or epigenetic changes. Reduced activity of histone lysine acetyltransferases (HATs) and/or increased activity on the wrong targets contribute to the development and progression of oncogenic transformation. Bromodomain containing proteins which recognize the histone acetylation marks are mistargeted or overexpressed in some cancer types. So far, a number of <b>epidrugs</b> has been designed to target the epigenetic modulators of histone lysine acetylation. Further investigation of the histone lysine acetylation and deacetylation pathways and their involvement in tumorigenesis will allow the development of more efficient epigenetic therapeutic approaches for specific cancer type...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{underlying}} molecular mechanisms of defined cancers {{is crucial for}} effective personalized therapies. Translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene produce fusion proteins such as MLL-AF 4 that disrupt epigenetic pathways and cause poor-prognosis leukemias. Here, we find that at a subset of gene targets, MLL-AF 4 binding spreads into the gene body and is associated with the spreading of Menin binding, increased transcription, increased H 3 K 79 methylation (H 3 K 79 me 2 / 3), a disruption of normal H 3 K 36 me 3 patterns, and unmethylated CpG regions in the gene body. Compared to other H 3 K 79 me 2 / 3 marked genes, MLL-AF 4 spreading gene expression is downregulated by inhibitors of the H 3 K 79 methyltransferase DOT 1 L. This sensitivity mediates synergistic interactions with additional targeted drug treatments. Therefore, epigenetic spreading and enhanced susceptibility to <b>epidrugs</b> provides a potential marker for better understanding combination therapies in humans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Research {{on cancer}} epigenetics has {{flourished in the}} last decade. Nevertheless growing {{evidence}} point on the importance to understand the mechanisms by which epigenetic changes regulate the genesis and progression of cancer growth. Several epigenetic tar-gets have been discovered and are currently under validation for new anticancer therapies. Drug discovery approaches aiming to target these epigenetic enzymes with small-molecules inhibitors have produced the first pre-clinical and clinical outcomes and many other compounds are now entering the pipeline as new candidate <b>epidrugs.</b> The most studied targets can be ascribed to histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases, although several other classes of enzymes are able to operate post-translational modifications to histone tails {{are also likely to}} represent new frontiers for therapeutic interventions. By acknowledging that the field of cancer epigenetics is evolving with an impressive rate of new findings, with this review we aim to provide a current overview of pre-clinical applications of small-molecules for cancer pathologies, combining them with the current knowledge of epigenetic targets in terms of available structural data and drug design perspectives...|$|R
40|$|In cardiac fibrosis, {{following}} an injury or a stress, non-functional fibrotic tissue substitutes normal myocardium, thus leading to progressive heart failure. Activated fibroblasts are principal determinants of cardiac fibrosis by producing excessive fibrotic extracellular matrix and causing hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNAs {{have been involved}} in these mechanisms. Therefore, there is a strong interest in reverting such epigenetic transformations in order to arrest myocardial fibrotic degeneration. Demethylating agents, such as 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine, 5 -azacytidine, some selective histone deacetylase inhibitors, including mocetinostat, trichostatin A, and MPT 0 E 014, have a direct action on important inducers of cardiac fibrosis. Also dietary compounds, such as resveratrol, can suppress the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Although in vivo and in vitro studies suggest specific epigenetic therapies to treat cardiac fibrosis, the related clinical trials are still lacking. A better understanding of the epigenetic effects of dietary compounds (e. g. curcumin and green tea catechins) on the onset and progression of cardiac fibrosis, will allow the identification of protective dietary patterns and/or the generation of novel potential <b>epidrugs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Colorectal cancer {{results from}} the {{progressive}} accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. IFN signaling defects {{play an important role}} in the carcinogenesis process, in which the inability of IFN transcription regulatory factors (IRF) to access regulatory sequences in IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in tumors and in immune cells may be pivotal. We reported that low-dose combination of two FDA-approved <b>epidrugs,</b> azacytidine (A) and romidepsin (R), with IFNα 2 (ARI) hampers the aggressiveness of both colorectal cancer metastatic and stem cells in vivo and triggers immunogenic cell death signals that stimulate dendritic cell (DC) function. Here, we investigated the molecular signals induced by ARI treatment and found that this drug combination increased the accessibility to regulatory sequences of ISGs and IRFs that were epigenetically silenced in both colorectal cancer cells and DCs. Likewise, specific ARI-induced histone methylation and acetylation changes marked epigenetically affected ISG promoters in both metastatic cancer cells and DCs. Analysis by ChIPseq confirmed such ARI-induced epigenetically regulated IFN signature. The activation of this signal endowed DCs with a marked migratory capability. Our results establish a direct correlation between reexpression of silenced ISGs by epigenetic control and ARI anticancer activity and provide new knowledge for the development of innovative combined therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adaptive {{evolution}} {{is not possible}} without the generation of phenotypic variants. The origin of these variations has been a central topic in evolutionary biology. Up to now, it was commonly accepted that standing genetic variation is the only cause of phenotypic variants. However, epigenetic information is emerging as a complementary source of heritable phenotypic variation that contributes to evolution. The relative importance of genetics and epigenetics in generating heritable phenotypic variation is nevertheless a matter of debate. Results: We used a host-parasite system to address this question. The human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni can adapt rapidly to new intermediate snail hosts. The interaction between parasite and mollusk {{is characterized by a}} compatibility polymorphism illustrating the evolutionary dynamics in this system. The principal molecular marker for compatibility (infection success) is the expression pattern of a group of polymorphic mucins (SmPoMuc) in the parasite. We show here that chromatin structure changes as the SmPoMuc promoters are the cause for SmPoMuc transcription polymorphism leading to phenotypic novelty and increase in infection success, i. e., fitness. Conclusion: We establish that epigenetic changes can be the major if not only cause of adaptive phenotypic variants in Schistosoma mansoni, suggesting that epimutations can provide material for adaptive evolution in the absence of genetic variation in other systems. In addition, our results indicate that <b>epidrugs</b> can be used to control parasite development but also parasite evolution...|$|R
40|$|High-throughput {{next-generation}} sequencing methods have recently provided a detailed {{picture of the}} genetic landscape of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), revealing recurrent mutations of chromatin-remodeling genes and little-to-no pathogenetic role for oncogenes commonly mutated in cancer. Concurrently, multiple epigenetic modifications have been described across the whole spectrum of NETs, and their putative function as tumorigenic drivers has been envisaged. As result, it is still unclear whether or not NETs are epigenetically-driven, rather than genetically-induced malignancies. Although the NET epigenome profiling {{has led to the}} identification of molecularly-distinct tumor subsets, validation studies in larger cohorts of patients are needed to translate the use of NET epitypes in clinical practice. In the precision medicine era, recognition of subpopulations of patients more likely to respond to therapeutic agents is critical, and future studies testing epigenetic biomarkers are therefore awaited. Restoration of the aberrant chromatin remodeling machinery is an attractive approach for future treatment of cancer and in several hematological malignancies a few epigenetic agents have been already approved. Although clinical outcomes of epigenetic therapies in NETs have been disappointing so far, further clinical trials are required to investigate the efficacy of these drugs. In this context, given the immune-stimulating effects of <b>epidrugs,</b> combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors should be tested. In this review, we provide an overview of the epigenetic changes in both hereditary and sporadic NETs of the gastroenteropancreatic and bronchial tract, focusing on their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} form of male {{infertility}} is a low sperm count, known as oligozoospermia. Studies suggest that oligozoospermia is associated with epigenetic alterations. Epigenetic alterations in sperm, which may arise due to the exposure of gametes to environmental factors or those that pre-exist in the sperm of infertile individuals, may contribute to the increased incidence of normally rare imprinting disorders in babies conceived after assisted reproductive technology using the sperm of infertile men. Genomic imprinting is an important developmental process whereby the allelic activity of certain genes is regulated by DNA methylation established during gametogenesis. The aberrant expression of several imprinted genes has been linked to various diseases, malignant tumors, lifestyle and mental disorders in humans. Understanding how infertility and environmental factors such as reproductive toxicants, certain foods, and drug exposures during gametogenesis contribute to the origins of these disorders via defects in sperm is of paramount importance. In this review, we discuss the association of epigenetic alterations with abnormal spermatogenesis and the evidence that epigenetic processes, including those required for genomic imprinting, may be sensitive to environmental exposures during gametogenesis, fertilization and early embryonic development. In addition, we review imprinting diseases and their relationships with environmental factors. While the plasticity of epigenetic marks may make these more susceptible to modification by the environment, this also suggests that aberrant epigenetic marks may be reversible. A greater understanding of this process and the function of <b>epidrugs</b> may lead to the development of new treatment methods for many adult diseases in the future...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} questions in neuroscience is to dissect how learning and memory, the foundational pillars of cognition, are grounded in stable, yet plastic, gene expression states. All known epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodelling, and noncoding RNAs regulate brain gene expression, both during neurodevelopment and in the adult brain in processes related to cognition. On the other hand, alterations in the various components of the epigenetic machinery have been linked to well-known causes of intellectual disability disorders (IDDs). Two examples are Down Syndrome (DS) and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), where global and local epigenetic alterations lead to impairments in synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning. Since epigenetic modifications are reversible, it is theoretically possible to use epigenetic drugs as cognitive enhancers for the treatment of IDDs. Epigenetic treatments act in a context specific manner, targeting different regions based on cell and state specific chromatin accessibility, facilitating the establishment of the lost balance. Here, we discuss epigenetic studies of IDDs, focusing on DS and FXS, and the use of <b>epidrugs</b> in combinatorial therapies for IDDs.
