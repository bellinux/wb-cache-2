Addition of <b>hydrocolloids</b> or <b>hydrocolloids</b> and non-muscle proteins to a mince of high gel-forming capacity with 2. 5 % NaCl caused a significant drop in gel strength and hardness but not in elasticity or cohesiveness. In low-salt gels, addition of these ingredients significantly improved folding test scores with respect to control. Low-salt gels with <b>hydrocolloids</b> proved harder but less elastic and cohesive than high-salt gels. Where <b>hydrocolloids</b> were added along with non-muscle proteins in low-salt samples, gels exhibited the same or less hardness, elasticity and cohesiveness as high-salt samples.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{effect of}} <b>hydrocolloids</b> – namely Arabic (AR), guar (GR), xanthan (XN), {{carrageenan}} (CG) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) – on the rheological, microstructural and quality characteristics of south Indian parotta was studied separately {{at the level}} of 0. 5. Addition of <b>hydrocolloids</b> increased farinograph water absorption. The extensograph resistance to extension at 135 min increased with the addition of <b>hydrocolloids.</b> Addition of XN, GR and CG decreased extensibility, while AR and HPMC increased extensibility. The alveograph maximum over pressure increased, with the exception of AR, and average abscissa at rupture decreased with different <b>hydrocolloids.</b> The amylograph peak viscosity increased with all the <b>hydrocolloids.</b> In the micrographs of dough treated with different <b>hydrocolloids,</b> the starch granules appeared coated with gum, and the coating appeared prominent in the case of dough treated with GR and HPMC. Among the <b>hydrocolloids</b> tried, GR brought about the greatest improvement in the quality of parotta, followed in decreasing order by HPMC, XN, CG and AR. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSIn India, demand for the large-scale manufacture of packed parottas is increasing. The beneficial effects of <b>hydrocolloids</b> in parotta-making have not yet been explored.

30|$|The results {{described}} above together reflected that different <b>hydrocolloids</b> show different effects on wheat dough, noodle and CSB quality properties due, probably to their distinctly different molecular structures. It is supposed that <b>hydrocolloids</b> may form higher molecular weight aggregation via the interactions with protein and starch, {{and which were}} {{closely related to the}} type, ratio and content of the incorporated <b>hydrocolloids.</b> The incorporation of <b>hydrocolloids</b> always shows positive effects on the overall quality of noodles. In noodle making, higher dosage of <b>hydrocolloids</b> is required for the dough with weaker gluten strength, and composite <b>hydrocolloids</b> shows better performance in noodle quality improvement. The effects of <b>hydrocolloids</b> on CSB quality are largely dependant on their molecular structure and addition quantity. In dough matrix, entanglement coupling between glutenin molecules is responsible to maintain the elasticity of the dough, while the extensibility of the dough are governed by the breaking of secondary valence bonds and slippage of entangled chains under deformation. Therefore, low resistance and high extensibility are observed when the rate of chain slippage is much greater than the rate of elongation of the chain. However, if the rate of chain slippage is relatively low, meaning chains slippage occur insufficiently rapidly in response to the applied stress, the chains will break resulting very short distance of elongation. The <b>hydrocolloids</b> differ in structures and additional levels are supposed to change the rate ratio of the chain slippage and chain elongation uncertainly due to their different interaction patterns with the glutenin entanglement. These different interactions are prone to affect the gas-holding capacity of dough and lead to a good or poor CSB quality consequently. As for the anti-staling activity of <b>hydrocolloids,</b> it can be explained by their interactions with starch. The <b>hydrocolloids</b> present in CSB or noodles could hinder the development of macromolecular entanglement and retard the starch recrystallization, thus delaying the staling of CSB and noodles.|$|R

30|$|Although some enzymes, esters and <b>hydrocolloids</b> {{show the}} anti-staling {{property}} in the production and storage of CSB and noodles, but they interact with starch in different patterns. In terms of esters, they can form complexion with the helical amylose via hydrophobic bonds, thus reducing the recrystallization of starch. Meanwhile, the interaction between external branch of amylopectin and esters via hydrogen bonds also impedes the starch staling. The anti-staling mechanism of <b>hydrocolloids</b> is as follows: (1) the good film-forming property of <b>hydrocolloids</b> reduces the moisture loss; (2) the hydrogen bonds formed between <b>hydrocolloids</b> and starch impeding the recrystallization of starch; (3) the high water-holding capacity of <b>hydrocolloids</b> improves the moisture of noodles and CSB. As for the enzymes, α-amylase could hydrolyse the starch to dextrin, which interfering the crystallization of starch; lipase could hydrolyse the lipid into a mixture of fatty acids, monoglycerides and diglycerides, which reducing the starch staling like the role of esters.|$|R
