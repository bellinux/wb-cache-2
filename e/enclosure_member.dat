50|$|As {{usual in}} Dutch Protestant churches, the pulpit stands within a {{rectangular}} <b>enclosure.</b> Here, the <b>members</b> {{of the church}} council sat during services and here, baptism was administered. The stained-glass windows in the choir represent the six days of Creation. It has a 44-bell carillon but the oldest bell, which was cast in 1464, is cracked and is now {{on display in the}} church.|$|R
50|$|The stadium {{facilities}} {{included two}} <b>enclosures</b> both featuring <b>members</b> clubs, {{one on the}} home straight and another slightly larger one on the back straight. Between {{the first and second}} bends was the hare control and between the third and fourth bends was the tote control which opened later in 1936. The stewards box and offices were situated on the home straight before the first bend.|$|R
2500|$|The Stewards' Enclosure as {{understood}} today, an <b>enclosure</b> open to <b>members</b> (elected by the Committee of Management of the Regatta) {{and their}} guests, {{came into being}} in 1919 with a membership of 300. [...] This grew to 704 in 1939 and 1,500 in 1956. [...] In 1980 the Stewards set a ceiling of 5,000. [...] The waiting list for membership of the Stewards Enclosure is now several years long, although preference is given {{to people who have}} previously competed at the regatta. The waiting list has grown rapidly since the 1970s, when membership could be applied for and granted on the same day.|$|R
25|$|The South Australia Test always {{coincides with}} the Australia day week-end. Without fail the South Australian Cricket Association celebrates January 27 with a {{stirring}} flag-raising ceremony {{before the start of}} play. The flag-pole before the <b>member's</b> <b>enclosure</b> is erected and both teams, together with the officials and umpires, troop out to form a guard of honour on each flank of the President of the Cricket Association as he raises the flag. To a man, and woman, the crowd rise to their feet to sing the national song...the men placing their hats and hands over their hearts. Equally there was no doubting the sincere determination of the Australian team as they took the field with their caps set in a resolute angle over their eyes.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 210 - 216. This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} expose comparatively the ideological, institutional and economic underpinnings which {{have contributed to}} evolving nationalisms within two dual societies, those being Canada and South Africa. It attempts to explain the parallel historical development of Afrikaner and French Canadian nationalisms as they contend with a hostile and dominant English element beholden to the Empire. Expansion and rebellion coincides {{with the advent of}} British colonialism as French Canadian and Afrikaner segments find their previously dominant positions reversed. Their rural, agrarianist, peripheral culture evolves in isolation from the increasingly metropolitan British core culture. Demographics are here determined in conjunction with the interplay of alien cultures including that of the indigenes. Ethnic pre-nationalist consciousness is assessed according to intergroup contact. Religion and its institutional accessories are then looked at as they contribute to an evolving consciousness. Fragmented cultures are firmly imbued with a religious character, and religioideological development adapts to new circumstances by preaching messianism, pre-destination as well as analogising the plight of their respective disciples with that of the ancient Israelites. The lines between temporal and heavenly matters are here smudged as Dutch Reformed and Catholic churches promote group <b>enclosure</b> mobilising <b>members</b> around core cultural and language issues so as to preserve clerical power...|$|R
5000|$|After the Roadblock, {{the clue}} advised teams that their next clue was [...] "underneath the fourth {{president}} of the Republic of the Philippines" [...] and were left {{to figure out that}} their next clue was at the Carlos P. Garcia Memorial Park, {{at the foot of a}} statue of the park's namesake. At the Bohol Wildlife Park, teams had to retrieve their next clue at a snake <b>enclosure.</b> One team <b>member</b> had to grab the clue from underneath a python while the other team member assisted by lifting the python. The next clue was this leg's Detour, a choice between [...] "Paddle" [...] or [...] "Ice". In Paddle, teams had to travel to Loboc River and paddle for 2.3 kilometers while standing on a paddle board to get their next clue hanging from a tree. In Ice, teams had to travel to CDO Ice Plant andretrieve their next clue encased within a large block of ice. Teams were given an assortment of unusual tools to accomplish this. If they were unsuccessful in retrieving their clue in under forty minutes, they were given an ice pick to help them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, at {{a meeting}} held in London, the Taunton Racecourse Company was founded, and agreed {{to create a new}} course on land granted for the purpose by Viscount Portman. The site had housed Orchard Portman House, the seat of the Portman family, but the house was {{destroyed}} in 1840. A small church, which was part of the estate is still visible on the backstretch. The first meeting was held on 21 September 1927, and the first race, the [...] "Shoreditch Selling Hurdle" [...] was won by Baalbek, owned by Mr Rayson. Initially, spectators were housed in nothing more than a wooden stand, which was commonly surrounded by huge puddles of mud, but the ground has been heavily outgraded, and include the Orchard Stand and the Paddock Stand (which is the <b>members</b> <b>enclosure)</b> and the newer AP McCoy stand, which provide catering facilities and are used for meetings and conferences on days when racing is not taking place. The course was the last racecourse to be opened in Britain for 81 years, until Great Leighs hosted its first race in 2008, followed the subsequent year by Ffos Las.|$|R
40|$|In December 2000, an {{infectious}} disease spread through a captive breeding group of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Tanzania, killing 49 of 52 animals within 2 months. The causative agent {{was identified as}} Canine distemper virus (CDV) by means of histologic examination, virus isolation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. This report {{emphasizes the importance of}} adequate protection against infectious diseases for the successful outcome of captive breeding programs of endangered species. T he African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) is a highly endangered carnivore found in Africa south of the Sahara. Its population, estimated at < 5, 500, has declined dramatically in recent decades. Suggested causes for this decline include habitat loss, killing by humans, reduced prey availability, competition with other carnivores, and infectious diseases, including rabies and canine distemper (1). As part of a conservation plan for the African wild dog, a captive breeding program was established in 1995 at Mkomazi Game Reserve, Tanzania, {{under the auspices of the}} Government of Tanzania. A founder group of 25 animals was divided into four breeding packs, each housed in a separate fenced <b>enclosure.</b> The founder <b>members</b> and captive-born pups were vaccinated against canine distemper with a vaccine successfully used in seals (2), rabies (Rabdomun, Schering-Plough Animal Health, Brussels, Belgium), and parvoviral disease and leptospirosis (combination vaccine: Dohyvac I-LP, Solvay Duphar, Weesp, the Netherlands). The vaccination schedule consisted of three consecutive vaccinations at 2 - to 4 -week intervals and annual revaccination, most recently in November 1999. Blood samples from a proportion of the vaccinated animals were collected at the time of vaccination to monitor immune response...|$|R
40|$|In the wild, primate {{foraging}} {{behaviors are}} related to the diversity and nutritional properties of food, which are affected by seasonal variation. The goal of environmental enrichment is to stimulate captive animals to exhibit similar foraging behavior of their wild counterparts, e. g. to extend foraging time. We conducted a 12 -month study on the foraging behavior of Japanese macaques in a semi-naturally forested enclosure to understand how they use both provisioned foods and naturally available plant foods and what are the nutritional criteria of their consumption of natural plants. We recorded time spent feeding on provisioned and natural plant foods and collected the plant parts ingested of their major plant food species monthly, when available. We conducted nutritional analysis (crude protein, crude lipid, neutral detergent fiber-‘NDF’, ash) and calculated total non-structural carbohydrate – ‘TNC’ and total energy of those food items. Monkeys spent 47 % of their feeding time foraging on natural plant species. The consumption of plant parts varied significantly across seasons. We found that leaf items were consumed in months when crude protein, crude protein-to-NDF ratio, TNC and total energy were significantly higher and NDF was significantly lower, fruit/nut items in months when crude protein and TNC were significantly higher and crude lipid content was significantly lower, and bark items in months when TNC and total energy were higher and crude lipid content was lower. This preliminary investigation showed that the forested <b>enclosure</b> allowed troop <b>members</b> to more fully express their species typical flexible behavior by challenging them to adjust their foraging behavior to seasonal changes of plant item diversity and nutritional content, also providing the possibility for individuals to nutritionally enhance their diet [Current Zoology 56 (2) : 198 – 208, 2010]...|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{previous}} (and subsequent) tours {{they did}} not face a match against a local Country XI, but went straight into a First Class game against Western Australia. Bush games were unpopular with the touring sides, although the Australian Board of Control saw them as a good advertisement for cricket and to be fair they were good practice. The home captain Ken Meuleman won the toss and put the tourists in on a fast wicket, covered with grass and freshened by the rain, though it proved less problematic than it looked. The batting was dominated by Tom Graveney, who had made 111 in his last innings in Australia and now hit 177 not out. He carefully played himself in on the first day, but struck the ball in fine form on the second. Only Peter May kept him company for long, cracking his first ball through the covers for four and nearly decapitating a spectator with a six into the <b>member's</b> <b>enclosure.</b> They added 91 for the third wicket and Graveney and Colin Cowdrey (28) 97 for the fourth. Jack Rutherford was brought on as seventh bowler and took 3/12 with his leg-spin to wrap up the innings as England collapsed from 345/7 to 351 all out. Graveney struck again in the Western Australian innings, catching Rutherford off the first ball from Fred Trueman (3/42). While his luck was in he visited the Gloucester Park Trotting Meeting that evening and was not disappointed with his wagers. With Peter Loader (3/40), Frank Tyson (2/59) and Tony Lock (2/46) all chipping in with wickets the hosts were out for 221 on the third morning, Bobby Simpson making 60 despite a bad start and Meuleman 42. In their second innings the MCC again had trouble with Keith Slater who took 4/33 - his best bowling in First Class cricket - and they collapsed to 44/4, with May out for a duck. [...] Although Slater was bowling with a bent arm no complaint was made. Cowdrey (65 not out) and Trevor Bailey (34 not out) made an unbeaten stand of 102 and May declared on 146/4, 276 runs ahead. In a three-day game there was little chance of a win as the state players tried to impress the selectors with a responsible innings and the tourists could not afford a demoralising loss. Jack Rutherford was left unbeaten on 77 and Lock took 2/26, conceding only 72 runs off his 42 eight-ball overs in the match, leaving Western Australia on 124/3. After the complaints about Len Hutton's time wasting on the previous tour May was determined to keep the overs ticking over and succeeded in doing so.|$|R
