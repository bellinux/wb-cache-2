5|$|In 1928, {{an officer}} {{working at the}} station was sacked after it was {{revealed}} he had been gathering bribes from local nightclubs and brothels, acquiring over £17,000 (now £) in the process. The officer subsequently committed suicide and the station {{is believed to be}} haunted by his ghost. Related incidents include reports of papers being inexplicably moved, and an officer hearing footsteps despite <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{the only one in the}} station.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} ill, he was imprisoned—after {{struggling}} with debts and haunted {{by the threat of}} ruin and imprisonment all his life—"for a wretched debt of 150 Rdr". The rumour was that a former Customs colleague, E. G. Nobelius, had had his advances to Louise Bellman rejected, and in revenge had sued Bellman for the debt, <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> penniless: he owed a total of almost 4,000 Riksdaler. On 11February 1795, he died in his sleep in his house in Gamla Kungsholmsbrogatan. He was buried in Klara churchyard with no gravestone, its location now unknown. The Swedish Academy belatedly placed a memorial in the churchyard in 1851, complete with a bronze medallion by Johan Tobias Sergel.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} McCudden was {{suffering}} from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in his decisions, of late, to seek a victory at any price, which was alien to his normal, calculated approach to combat. <b>Knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to soon be sent home, he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen's score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden's pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall then struck Edrich on {{the hand}} with a short ball, {{provoking}} angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton {{found it difficult to}} position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} for the Junta, {{he led the}} ill-fated Paraguay campaign. His troops were defeated by Bernardo de Velasco at the battles of Campichuelo and Paraguarí. Though he was defeated, the campaign initiated the {{chain of events that}} led to the Independence of Paraguay in May 1811. He retreated to the vicinity of Rosario, to fortify it against a possible royalist attack from the Eastern Band of the Uruguay River. While there, he created the flag of Argentina. The First Triumvirate did not approve the flag, but because of slow communications, Belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later, while reinforcing the Army of the North at Jujuy. There, <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at a strategic disadvantage against the royalist armies coming from Upper Peru, Belgrano ordered the Jujuy Exodus, which evacuated the entire population of Jujuy Province to San Miguel de Tucumán. His counter-offensive at the Battle of Tucumán resulted in a key strategic victory, and it was soon followed by a complete victory over the royalist army of Pío Tristán at the Battle of Salta. However, his deeper incursions into Upper Perú led to defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, leading the Second Triumvirate to order his replacement as Commander of the Army of the North by the newly arrived José de San Martín. By then, the Asamblea del Año XIII had approved the use of Belgrano's flag as the national war flag.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Elías Alippi, {{who would}} {{star in the}} role of captain Del Carril, fell ill with cancer (he would die on May 3, 1942). The company, <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not in {{physical}} condition to survive the tough filming schedule and not wishing to replace him for another actor while he was alive, postponed the filming with an excuse and started to film El viejo Hucha ("Old Man Hucha"), in which he had no role.|$|E

25|$|King Laius of Thebes hears of a prophecy {{that his}} infant son {{will one day}} kill him. He pierces Oedipus' feet and leaves him out to die, but a {{herdsman}} finds him and carries him away. Years later, Oedipus, not <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> adopted, leaves home in fear of the same prophecy that he will kill his father and marry his mother. Laius journeys out to seek {{a solution to the}} Sphinx's mysterious riddle. As prophesied, Oedipus and Laius cross paths, but they do not recognize each other. A fight ensues, and Oedipus kills Laius and most of his guards. Oedipus goes on to defeat the Sphinx by solving a riddle to become king. He marries the widow queen Jocasta, unaware that she is his mother. A plague falls on the people of Thebes. Upon discovering the truth, Oedipus blinds himself, and Jocasta hangs herself. After Oedipus is no longer king, Oedipus' brother-sons kill each other.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} the Army War College, and was then stationed in Bangkok. Having concluded {{that he would}} never be promoted to chief of station anywhere, and <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> tagged as a Thai/Lao specialist within the CIA, he settled into bureaucracy in his wife's hometown. His title was assistant chief of station, and special operations naturally became his beat. When Leka, the exiled monarch of Albania arrived to buy weaponry, Lair prompted the Thai quashing of the arms deal. Most of Lair's duties, though, required him {{to keep track of the}} drug trade in the area. For the most part, the Thai senior officers involved in the opium trade had been trained by Lair. They knew him well enough to know his skepticism about banning drugs, and that he would not retaliate on them. They also knew the king favored him, and that Lair's in-laws were politically influential. Lair would simply ask these officers for needed information, bypassing all the rigamarole of tasking undercover agents to spy upon the drug trade.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Abu Simbel the heroes {{are joined by}} Iggy, a Boston Terrier and the user of The Fool, a simple but powerful Stand of sand. They are immediately attacked by the blind Stand user N'Doul, who attacks with Geb, a Stand of water and {{the first of the}} nine Egyptian god Stands; he is able to slash through Kakyoin's corneas before he is defeated by Jotaro and Iggy. Afterwards, Kakyoin is taken to a hospital to recuperate. Oingo and Boingo, users of the face-altering Stand Khnum and the future-predicting comic book Thoth respectively, attempt to defeat the heroes, but Oingo (in disguise as Jotaro) is incapacitated without the heroes even <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> there. Anubis, a sword with a Stand, possesses a farmer named Chaka, a barber named Khan, and then Polnareff, nearly killing Jotaro before being thrown in a river to rust away. Mariah, the user of Bast, magnetizes Joseph and Avdol causing problems for them before they overcome her attacks and crush her between themselves. Meanwhile, Polnareff and Silver Chariot are reduced to children by Seth, the shadow Stand of the sadistic child-abuser Alessi. Polnareff outsmarts Alessi before he is attacked by a de-aged Jotaro; Polnareff and Jotaro return to their old selves before beating up Alessi. Later, the group encounters Daniel J. D'Arby, who offers information if they gamble with him, but when Polnareff and Joseph lose, D'Arby's Stand Osiris transforms their souls into poker chips. Only by betting everyone's souls and bluffing his way through D'Arby's rigged game can Jotaro defeat him. In Cairo the group meets Hol Horse again, who has partnered himself with Boingo, but the duo are defeated through their own incompetence. Later, Iggy battles Pet Shop, DIO's pet falcon and the user of the ice-slinging Stand Horus. Kakyoin returns soon afterwards, his eyesight mostly recovered.|$|E

In regards to Wozniak's relationship with Jobs, Rogen stated that [...] "his feelings towards Jobs were very complex and interesting.

500|$|He did not leave, and in February, Clark {{publicly}} criticised him {{for producing}} [...] "possibly the worst training session {{in terms of}} a professional footballer I have ever come across", despite <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> due to start the upcoming game against Watford. Up until this incident, he had scored six league goals at a rate of one every 165 minutes, and been sent off twice. Clark said that Žigić would not be involved against Watford, but that it was [...] "in his hands" [...] as to whether he would prepare properly for the Sheffield Wednesday fixture three days later. His response must have been acceptable, because he played the whole of the goalless draw against Wednesday, started all the remaining matches– the longest run of starts of his Birmingham career– and ended the season with nine league goals, second only to King.|$|E
500|$|In the 200-meter {{butterfly}} semi-finals, Tarwater {{turned in}} the second-fastest time behind Bobby Bollier as Phelps conserved energy.

Tarwater led the field for the first 100 meters. [...] Phelps passed him in the third 50-meter stretch, but Tarwater held off the rest of the field until the final 25 meters when both Bollier and Tyler Clary surged ahead, dropping Tarwater to fourth. His split on the final 50 meters was three seconds slower than his third 50, and two seconds slower than his final lap in 2008. A couple days later, Tarwater advanced to the 100-meter butterfly final, but finished fifth. [...] Afterwards, he called it [...] "the last race I'll ever swim." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in October, Hughes quelled speculation the band was splitting up. Accepting responsibility for the initial spread of the rumours, he cited {{the speed at which}} the band had produced and released music as the cause for the stress on the group. On the possibility of the band touring together again, the frontman responded positively but warned that nothing was confirmed. Bonamassa, however, later revealed his anger at Hughes, condemning his [...] "bullying" [...] of the guitarist to complete the planned 2013 show despite <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not able to, as well as the way in which he publicly revealed the tensions in the band and his claim of being the sole songwriter on Afterglow. Bonham also revealed his frustration with the situation, while manager Roy Weisman admitted that it was his decision to cancel the Wolverhampton gig, based on Hughes's actions. Bonamassa sought to end the situation positively, praising Hughes as a musician and proposing that the band would continue to make music for the foreseeable future, although Bonham proposed that the band might tour with a different guitarist.|$|E

500|$|Hall also {{enacted a}} {{complete}} {{reform of the}} electoral system. [...] He was embarrassed that the LCL {{was in a position}} to win government despite having clearly lost the first-preference vote, and was committed to a fairer electoral system. [...] The reforms were significant, but did not go as far as the change to [...] "one vote one value" [...] that Labor and Dunstan had demanded. The lower house formerly had 39 seats—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Now, 47 seats were to be contested: 28 in Adelaide and 19 in the country. [...] While there was still a slight rural weighting (since Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state's population), with Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, historical results made a Labor win at the next election likely. [...] Under the Playmander, Labor usually dominated Adelaide. [...] In most years, the LCL won almost no seats in the capital outside of the wealthy eastern crescent and around Holdfast Bay. [...] Under the circumstances, conventional wisdom was that Hall undertook electoral reform <b>knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election.|$|E
