When an application requests a system service which <b>is</b> <b>naturally</b> asynchronous, such as input/output processing, a mechanism for synchronizing the application and {{the operating system}} must be employed. This essential mechanism is through functions which are built into the operating system, or are specifically supported by it, including: WAIT (temporarily halt application processing until an external event has occurred); POST (indicate occurrence of an external event so application processing may continue); and SYNCH (change system processing modes (supervisor to user), while preserving system integrity, and synchronously perform a function {{on behalf of the}} application, after which application processing may continue).|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the natural susceptibility to 71 antimicrobial agents of 103 Listeria strains belonging to all known Listeria species (L. monocytogenes (N = 21), L. innocua (N = 21), L. seeligeri (N = 21), L. ivanovii (N = 19), L. welshimeri (N = 11), and L. grayi (N = 10)). MethodsMICs were determined using a microdilution procedure in H-Medium. ResultsAll listeriae <b>were</b> <b>naturally</b> sensitive or intermediate to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, penicillins (except oxacillin), loracarbef, cefazoline, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefoperazone, carbapenems, macrolides, lincosamides, glycopeptides, dalfopristin/quinupristin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin (probably except L. grayi). Listeria spp. <b>were</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant or intermediate to most ‘modern’ cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefixime, ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime), aztreonam, pipemidic acid, dalfopristin quinupristin and sulfamethoxazole. Significant differences in natural susceptibility among the species were {{seen with the}} quinolones, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, rifampicin, fosfomycin and fusidic acid. It seems likely that L. grayi <b>is</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant to all antifolates; the species was least susceptible to rifampicin and most susceptible to quinolones, whereas L. ivanovii <b>was</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant to most quinolones. L. ivanovii <b>was</b> <b>naturally</b> sensitive to fosfomycin, whereas L. innocua and L. monocytogenes <b>were</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant. L. ivanovii was also the most susceptible species to fusidic acid. ConclusionsThe present study describes a database on the natural susceptibility of Listeria spp. {{to a wide range}} of antibiotics, which can be used to validate susceptibility testing results of these microorganisms...|$|R
