6000|$|And {{you will}} not forget the Dwarf. For he stood over her, and did the work of any six of the others. He swung his ax with both hands; {{whenever}} it came down, he said those two words, [...] "For France!" [...] and a splintered helmet flew like <b>eggshells,</b> and the <b>skull</b> that carried it had learned its manners and would offend the French no more. He piled a bulwark of iron-clad dead {{in front of him}} and fought from behind it; and at last when the victory was ours we closed about him, shielding him, and he ran up a ladder with Joan as easily as another man would carry a child, and bore her out of the battle, a great crowd following and anxious, for she was drenched with blood to her feet, half of it her own and the other half English, for bodies had fallen across her as she lay and had poured their red life-streams over her. One couldn't see the white armor now, with that awful dressing over it.|$|R
40|$|Background: The Late Cretaceous Nemegt Formation, Gobi Desert, Mongolia {{has already}} yielded {{abundant}} and complete skeletons of the hadrosaur Saurolophus angustirostris, from half-grown to adult individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings: Herein we describe perinatal specimens of Saurolophus angustirostris, associated with fragmentary <b>eggshell</b> fragments. The <b>skull</b> length of these babies is around 5 % {{that of the}} largest known S. angustirostris specimens, so these specimens document the earliest development stages of this giant hadrosaur and bridge a large hiatus in {{our knowledge of the}} ontogeny of S. angustirostris. Conclusions/Significance: The studied specimens are likely part of a nest originally located on a riverbank point bar. The perinatal specimens were buried by sediment carried by the river current presumably during the wet summer season. Perinatal bones already displayed diagnostic characters for Saurolophus angustirostris, including premaxillae with a strongly reflected oral margin and upturned premaxillary body in lateral aspect. The absence of a supracranial crest and unfused halves of the cervical neural arches characterize the earliest stages in the ontogeny of S. angustirostris. The eggshell fragments associated with the perinatal individuals can be referred to the Spheroolithus oogenus and closely resemble those found in older formations (e. g. Barun Goyot Fm in Mongolia) or associated with more basal hadrosauroids (Bactrosaurus-Gilmoreosaurus in the Iren Dabasu Fm, Inner Mongolia, China). Thisobservation suggests that the egg microstructure was similar in basal hadrosauroids and more advanced saurolophines...|$|R

5000|$|Vosburg v. Putney {{exemplifies the}} common law <b>Eggshell</b> <b>skull</b> rule.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eggshell</b> <b>skull</b> rule (or thin skull rule) is a {{well-established}} legal doctrine in common law, {{used in some}} tort law systems, with a similar doctrine applicable to criminal law. The rule states that, in a tort case, the unexpected frailty of the injured person is not a valid defense.|$|E
50|$|Smith v Leech Brain & Co 1962 2 QB 405 is a {{landmark}} English tort law case in negligence, concerning {{remoteness of damage}} or causation in law. It marked {{the establishment of the}} <b>eggshell</b> <b>skull</b> rule, the idea that an individual is held responsible for the full consequences of his negligence, regardless of extra, or special damage caused to others.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} how {{foreseeability}} {{does not apply to}} the extent of an injury is the <b>eggshell</b> <b>skull</b> rule. If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will {{need to go to the}} hospital for. However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment. Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of direct victims, their Lordships said the {{following}} test should be applied: [...] "Could the defendant reasonably foresee that his conduct would expose the plaintiff {{to the risk of}} personal injury, psychological or physical?" [...] If the answer was yes, it would be irrelevant that the extent of the damage was unforeseeable because the plaintiff had special sensitivities - the rule founded in other nervous shock cases that the plaintiff should be of reasonable fortitude was found to be irrelevant. This is based on the <b>eggshell</b> <b>skull</b> rule, that is, one [...] "takes the plaintiff as one finds him". Consequently, the defendant was found liable for the nervous shock suffered by Mr Page.|$|E
5000|$|This rule {{holds that}} a {{tortfeasor}} is liable for all consequences resulting {{from his or}} her tortious (usually negligent) activities leading to an injury to another person, even if the victim suffers an unusually high level of damage (e.g. due to a pre-existing vulnerability or medical condition). The <b>eggshell</b> <b>skull</b> rule takes into account the physical, social and economic attributes of the plaintiff which might make him more susceptible to injury. [...] It may also take into account the family and cultural environment. The term implies that if a person had a skull as delicate as that of the shell of an egg, and a tortfeasor who was unaware of the condition injured that person's head, causing the skull unexpectedly to break, the defendant would be held liable for all damages resulting from the wrongful contact, even if the tortfeasor did not intend to cause such a severe injury.|$|E
40|$|In the {{now famous}} case of Vosburg v. Putney, the Wisconsin Court enunciated {{the common law}} {{doctrine}} since known as the 2 ̆ 2 <b>eggshell</b> <b>skull</b> 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 thin skull 2 ̆ 2 rule: you take your victim as you find him. The thin skull rule is a productive starting point for a dialogue on the place of law in any effort to control (or reverse) the cumulative damage to the planet 2 ̆ 7 s ecosystem. Any such dialogue requires a global perspective that fuses international and domestic approaches to law. Environmental law must assess not only the level of assault against the earth, but also {{the risk of the}} planet 2 ̆ 7 s hypervulnerability to further injury. As in Vosburg v. Putney, some of the insult to the planet has been the result of unintended consequences, whose significance we are only now beginning to understand. The planet has become an eggshell victim of industrialization, population growth and the expansion of the consumer society. The purpose of this essay is three-fold: (1) to link the relationship of international trade and domestic environmental regulation to a broader global discourse; (2) to outline this global discourse, which includes both international and domestic elements; and (3) to articulate some additional factors (beyond trade) that are now integral to the relationship between domestic environmental law and the global regulatory discourse...|$|E
