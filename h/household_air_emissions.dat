40|$|Today {{one of the}} {{emerging}} issues in aviation is the assessment, control and reduction of <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> In particular airports are increasingly scrutinized for accountability of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> contributions to the local and regional air quality. The tasks associated with quantifying <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> contributions are difficult due to the inconsistency of airport sizes, geographic locations, variables in airport processes and air quality monitoring capabilities. Additionally, many airport executives or local officials do not comprehend <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> and are reluctant to engage resources to address the related issues. This practice paper examines air quality from the airport perspective by briefly examining the overarching federal and state regulations, exploring the contributing <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> sources located at most airports, and best management practices for <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reductions.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of air quality to develop meaningful air programs and policies {{has been an}} on-going initiative {{in the province of}} Ontario, Canada. Ontario has been monitoring and reporting on air quality throughout the province since the 1970 s. In 1993 the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) embarked on its first effort to inventory Ontario’s point source emissions {{through the use of a}} voluntary survey. This survey was distributed annually to industrial facilities throughout the province, requesting annual activity data for the estimation of Ontario facility <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> This exercise consistently yielded a low response from Ontario point sources. In January of 2000, the MOE proposed an air quality initiative that would consist of a regulation requiring the mandatory monitoring and reporting of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from point sources. This proposal became reality when Ontario Regulation 227 (O. Reg. 227 / 00 - "Electricity Generation- Monitoring and Reporting") came into effect in May of 2000. This regulation applied to certain Ontario electricity generation facilities and regulated 28 airborne contaminants. The goal of a regulated <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> inventory program applicable to a wide spectrum facilities was realized when the MOE promulgated Ontario Regulation 127 (O. Reg. 127 / 01) regulating <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from industrial, commercial, institutional, and municipal point sources in the province. Facilities are able to report their <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> under O. Reg. 127 / 01 via the MOE’s web-based reporting and registration site titled “OnAIR”. This study will chronicle the evolution of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> inventories in the province of Ontario, describing the progression from voluntary to mandatory point source <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reporting, provide observations of the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reports submitted by Ontario point sources, and discuss the future direction of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reporting in the province...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the reduction of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships. Ships are large contributors to air pollution with implications for climate change and human health. Regulations have entered into force or will in the near future, which will force shipowners to reduce the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from their vessels. Multiple technologies or operational measures reducing these main pollutants are available and the term <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> control has here been defined as any effort made by ship-owners, operators or designers {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>emission</b> to <b>air</b> from a vessel. Knowing which <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> control to install and when to do so to comply with regulations is a challenging decision problem. This thesis develops optimization models for selecting <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> controls enabling a ship to comply with <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> regulations. This work consists of four papers. The first one establishes the <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> reduction problem in shipping and presents a deterministic optimization problem solving it. The three following papers are extensions of this model adding different aspects to the problem, respectively: Design phase, uncertainty and non-financial decision criteria. The thesis aims to answer the four following research questions: RQ 1 : Can the real-life problem of selecting <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> controls be efficiently captured in an optimization model? RQ 2 : Which specific problem aspects that are not currently being taken into account, such as interaction effects, should be part of this model?

The aims of this study are to calculate <b>air</b> <b>emissions,</b> modeling of <b>air</b> quality and discuss emission abatement strategies for Saigon port, Vietnam. Saigon Port within the port system of the Vietnam Maritime sector is one the port having the highest throughput and productivity in the country. The air quality in the area around the port is polluted. Then the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> results are used for modelling air quality in Saigon Port. The results of air quality modelling are used to design emissions abatement strategies. The results of <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> inventories show that total emissions of all pollutants are dominated by OGVs and harbor cranes. Emissions from OGVs are mainly during hotelling due to the long times spent at berth, while harbor cranes emissions are high because of the extended usage and high power rating. The results of air quality modeling using only <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> inventories from the port as input parameter show that concentration of air pollutants is lower than the Vietnamese technical regulation on ambient air quality.

40|$|A {{third of}} the world's {{population}} uses solid fuel derived from plant material (biomass) or coal for cooking, heating, or lighting. These fuels are smoky, often used in an open fire or simple stove with incomplete combustion, and result in {{a large amount of}} <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution when smoke is poorly vented. Air pollution is the biggest environmental cause of death worldwide, with <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution accounting for about 3 · 5 - 4 million deaths every year. Women and children living in severe poverty have the greatest exposures to <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution. In this Commission, we review evidence for the association between <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution and respiratory infections, respiratory tract cancers, and chronic lung diseases. Respiratory infections (comprising both upper and lower respiratory tract infections with viruses, bacteria, and mycobacteria) have all been associated with exposure to <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution. Respiratory tract cancers, including both nasopharyngeal cancer and lung cancer, are strongly associated with pollution from coal burning and further data are needed about other solid fuels. Chronic lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis in women, are associated with solid fuel use for cooking, and the damaging effects of exposure to <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution in early life on lung development are yet to be fully described. We also review appropriate ways to measure exposure to <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution, as well as study design issues and potential effective interventions to prevent these disease burdens. Measurement of <b>household</b> <b>air</b> pollution needs individual, rather than fixed in place, monitoring because exposure varies by age, gender, location, and household role. Women and children are particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of pollution and are exposed to the highest concentrations. Interventions should target these high-risk groups and be of sufficient quality to make the air clean.

The test results indicate that only unidirectional causal relationships exist between GDP and <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> For CO 2 and CO, we find long run causal relationships running from GDP to emissions, whereas for SO 2 and NOx, only the short run causal relationships are found from emissions to GDP.

40|$|Advanced {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas production technologies are increasingly used to help meet the demand for energy in both the United States and globally. As conventional resources become more scarce, research and innovation by {{the oil and gas}} industry has resulted in techniques for tapping unconventional resources, including hydrocarbons trapped in shale formations found in a number of locations throughout the United States. A key technology for accessing such resources is hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which has transformed natural gas production over the past several years and is also being applied for oil production. These new energy supply technologies also bring new environmental management challenges. Among the issues of concern are the <b>air</b> pollution <b>emissions</b> from fracking operations and whether they can potentially impact air quality at well sites and in surrounding communities. A significant opportunity exists to improve the sustainability of energy production by reducing the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from fracking operations. This Master’s Project focuses on the characterization and modeling of these <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> to help improve environmental management efforts by the industry and to inform the application of regulations for guiding efforts to reduce emissions. The emissions addressed include criteria air pollutants and their precursors. The work involved identifying major sources of emissions during fracking operations, evaluating current models used for <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> characterization, and developing refinements to the models to enable better emissions management. The project team travelled to a well site and to testing facilities to learn about operations in two different shale formations and to gather data needed to improve emissions characterization. These visits enabled the team to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of fracking equipment, operations and <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> test protocols.
