500|$|... "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] was {{produced}} by Eric Foster White. Described by Spears as a [...] "soulful" [...] ballad, it draws influence from teen pop and lasts for five minutes and ten seconds. Chuck Taylor of Billboard noted that the singer [...] "turn toward the sad side" [...] on the track, with its lyrics talking {{about the loss of}} a first love and how breaking up can be hard. As the song begins, Spears declares, [...] "'Never look back', we said / <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to know I'd miss you so? / Loneliness up ahead, emptyness behind / Where do I go?" [...] During the chorus, she realizes that she has lost her true love, stating, [...] "From the bottom of my broken heart, even though time may find me somebody new / You were my real love, I never knew love, till there was you." [...] According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] is composed in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a slowly tempo of 76 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E
