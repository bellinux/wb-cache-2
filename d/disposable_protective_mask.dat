40|$|The {{results of}} {{comparative}} experimental testing of different filtrating type masks {{are presented in}} this study.

Using of the standardized testing methods, mask models have been tested on protection factor, dynamic resistance of the exhaust valve and its static permeability, the overall inhalation resistance of <b>protective</b> <b>masks,</b> field of view and optical properties. Based on experimental results obtained, it can be concluded that the Serbian mask M 3 is on approximately same quality level as tested foreign masks, and above Serbian <b>protective</b> <b>masks</b> of the previous generation marked M 2 F and M 2 FV.
