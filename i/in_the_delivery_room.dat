500|$|Eastwood and Locke {{went on to}} star in The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Bronco Billy, Any Which Way You Can and Sudden Impact. According {{to former}} {{longtime}} associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several [...] "maintenance relationships" [...] (such as with Tunis) during that period. McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his [...] "habitual womanizing" [...] in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose, actress Jamie Rose (who played a bit part in Tightrope), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s) and Jacelyn Reeves, a stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves: a son Scott Eastwood (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988), whose birth certificates both said [...] "Father declined." [...] The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article {{was published in the}} Star tabloid in 1990. It quoted Reeves as saying [...] "Some family members tell me to file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to." [...] The children continued to be unacknowledged by mainstream news sources {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. Eastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time unaware of his infidelities) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for years. Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, Impulse. In court, Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a [...] "roommate" [...] before quickly redescribing her as a [...] "part-time roommate." [...] Locke's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her [...] "addiction" [...] to husband Gordon Anderson. Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to. [...] "In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation." [...] During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. [...] "I spoke with the nurse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>room,</b> and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them," [...] Locke quotes the informant. [...] "My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years of our relationship, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and having children with her. Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine." [...] As the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. She dropped her suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package which included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros., but sued him again for fraud in 1995 when she became convinced the deal with Warner was a sham, finally settling out of court in September 1996. Since then, Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood.|$|E

A quantitative method was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research. Data were collected by the technique of anonymous questionnare. The research corpus comprised of 82 women after spontaneous delivery. Three working hypothese were tested. H 1 : women in labour are satisfied with nursing provided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rooms.</b> H 2 : women in labour are satisfied with <b>the</b> equipment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rooms.</b> H 3 : empathetic attitude of midwives is found {{to be the most important}} element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of giving birth by women in labour.

There was a significant improvement in resuscitation scores in all levels of resuscitation from before to after the course: for "initial steps", the score increased from 33 % (IQR 28 - 39) to 44 % (IQR 39 - 56), p< 0. 0001; for BMV, from 20 % (20 - 40) to 40 % (40 - 60), p = 0. 001; and for CC, from 0 % (0 - 10) to 20 % (0 - 50), p = 0. 01.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 In India, globalized {{flows of}} bio-medical discourse, {{practices}} and technologies are reshaping {{the field of}} reproductive healthcare, {{and the performance of}} childbirth more specifically. These projects aim to produce institutional <b>delivery</b> <b>rooms</b> that are "safe and modernized" by equating the utilization of westernized, obstetric techniques for managing delivery with better birth outcomes. Yet, these projects often evoke dynamic tensions between the imagined labor rooms NGOs seek to produce and the lived realties of labor in a local context. In this thesis, I examine the ways NGOs market and disseminate state and global discourses around safe, institutional delivers to local communities through a case study of one NGO working in rural southern Rajasthan. Drawing on data from participant observation and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with NGO staff and skilled-birth attendants employed by community health centers, I argue that at the interface of NGO, state, and global relations of power, a commodified discourse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Evidenced-based Delivery (EBD) practices is emerging. This discourse is marketed through a political economy of hope that promotes EBDs as essential for safe delivery. In this system, NGOs function as conduits for transmitting idealized notions of the safe and modern <b>delivery</b> <b>room,</b> and thereby affect a shift in what skilled-birth attendants and communities come to expect from their childbirth experiences [...] expectations that I argue are often difficult to meet given current training levels, limited economic resources, and a diverse set of cultural values around childbirth. My findings indicate that while Evidence-based Delivery practices may improve birth outcomes in some contexts, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rooms</b> of rural Rajasthan, they are functioning essentially as technologies that capitalize on the political economy of hope by evoking the medical imaginary...|$|R
