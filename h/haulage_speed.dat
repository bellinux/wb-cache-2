40|$|Abstract. In the {{wrapping}} process of magnet wire, as the <b>haulage</b> <b>speed</b> of master motor varies periodically, {{it is difficult}} for slave wrapping motor to track master motor due to the mechanical resonance, which destabilizes {{the wrapping}} pitch. In the proposed system, the synchronization speed control scheme of master-slave motor based on repetitive control compensation is employed. In the process of control, real-time spectrum analysis of the <b>haulage</b> <b>speed</b> is given, which can be used to adjust the parameters of wrapping speed controller adaptively with the acquired characteristic information of the mechanical resonant. Simulation shows that wrapping speed can track <b>haulage</b> <b>speed</b> well in the proposed system, and the maximum tracking synchronous deviation can be reduced to 56 % of that in the system without repetitive control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} suit better for {{variations}} of coal and rock with different properties, {{solve the problem}} of big fluctuation of a cutting motor power, and ensure the durable high-efficient, high-energetic working of a shearer, a constant power speed-adjusting system of shearer cutting motor is designed based on the theory and the method of single neuron self-adaptive PID controlling, the system effects constant power function of shearer cutting motor by adjusting continually the shearer’s <b>haulage</b> <b>speed.</b> A systematic simulation model is build by using the Matlab/Simulink, and the experiment shows: the speed-adjusting system of single neuron self-adaptive PID controlling has following advantages by comparing it with a traditional controlling method: adjustment time of <b>haulage</b> <b>speed</b> decreases by 0. 6 s, overshoot and adjustment time of the cutting motor power lower by 2. 4 % and 0. 27 s respectively, which improves the working efficiency of the shearer by a rapid reaction speed and a good controlling property...|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1920s and 1930s {{successive}} governments placed tighter {{restrictions on}} road steam <b>haulage,</b> including <b>speed,</b> smoke and vapour limits, and a 'wetted tax', where the tax due was {{proportional to the}} size of the wetted area of the boiler; this made steam engines less competitive against domestically produced internal combustion engined units (although imports were subject to taxes of up to 33%).|$|R
50|$|The two M {{class engines}} {{were the only}} eight-cylinder Garratt {{locomotives}} in the world. They were difficult to maintain and, despite their <b>haulage</b> abilities and <b>speed,</b> both were withdrawn from service some time after {{the arrival of the}} R class 4-6-2 Pacific types in 1924. Both locomotives were scrapped and cut up in the late 1940s.|$|R
40|$|Haulage {{tractors}} {{have been}} tested by the South African Sugar Association Experiment Station for a number ofyears. These tests, consisting ofa pto dynamometer test for engine performance and a road <b>haulage</b> test monitoring <b>speed,</b> load and fuel consumption over a known route, are timeconsuming and expensive. In this paper a computer model is outlined, using various tractor parameters and traction mechanics to simulate these tests. The predicted results from the computer model are compared with the results obtained from the pto and road haulage tests...|$|R
30|$|A high {{efficiency}} and high reliability electric traction shearer has been developed, its specifications are: coal cutting height 2.8 – 5.5  m, total installed power 1945  kW, coal cutting power 750  kW, maximum <b>haulage</b> <b>speed</b> 15 – 25  m/min, and maximum traction force 2  ×  570 kN.

40|$|Abstract. An {{improved}} quantum {{neural network}} model and its learning algorithm are proposed for fault diagnosis of the coal electrical haulage shearer in order to on line monitor working states of the large mining rotating machines. Based on traditional BP neural network, the three- layer quantum neural network is constructed to combine quantum calculation and neural network for the error correction learning algorithm. According to the information processing mode of the biology neuron and the quantum computing theory, the improved quantum {{neural network model}} has the ability of identifying uncertainty in fault data classifications and approximating the nonlinear function for different fault types to monitor the electrical motor voltage, current, temperature, shearer location, boom inclination, <b>haulage</b> <b>speed</b> and direction in the coal electrical cutting machines. The theory analysis and simulation experiment {{results show that the}} control performances and the safety reliability of the coal shearer are obviously improved, while the quantum neural network model is applied to the nonlinear feature fault diagnosis of the coal electrical haulage shearer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} cutting {{efficiency}} and the lump coal {{percentage of the}} shearer drum, a new shearer drum with variable diameter vanes was developed according to the characteristic (good at compression resisting, not good at tension resisting) of coal and similarity theory. At the same time, the analogy coal wall was developed according to the similarity theory. And then, the cutting tests were carried out on the cutting testbed of coal and rock for the new shearer drum and an existed drum. To understand both {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the two drums, test parameters such as the cutting specific consumption, the load fluctuation, and the lump coal percentage of the drums were compared based on the same rotary speed and the initial <b>haulage</b> <b>speed.</b> And the two drums had the same vane starts, the same pick arrangement, and the number of total picks. The results indicate that the cutting lump coal percentage of the new drum is better than the existed drum and the lump percentage of the new drum increases by 3 % over the existed drum. At the same time, the cutting specific consumption of the drums is nearly the same, but the load fluctuation of the new drum is bigger...|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1920s and 1930s {{there were}} tighter {{restrictions}} on road steam <b>haulage,</b> including <b>speed,</b> smoke and vapour limits and a 'wetted tax', where the tax due was {{proportional to the}} size of the wetted area of the boiler; this made steam engines less competitive against domestically produced internal combustion engined units (although imports were subject to taxes of up to 33%). As a result of the Salter Report on road funding, an 'axle weight tax' was introduced in 1933 in order to charge commercial motor vehicles more for the costs of maintaining the road system and to do away with the perception that the free use of roads was subsidising the competitors of rail freight. The tax was payable by all road hauliers in proportion to the axle load and was particularly restrictive on steam propulsion, which was heavier than its petrol equivalent.|$|R
50|$|Haulage trolley or car in Jogindernagar is India's highest {{funicular}} railway track that takes rides up to 2500 metres above sea level. It is a 4 stage network of funicular and horizontal track and has six haulage car stations starting at Buffer Stop as base station at Shanan. Next is Adit Junction {{set up at}} higher altitude of 1770 metres. It is widely called '18 Number' because of having 18 divisions along way the pipes carrying water to turbines from Adit Junction to Buffer Stop. The water rushes down from the reservoir at Barot in the Uhl river through penstock pipes going down nearly a thousand meters. The loading capacity of haulage way cars are 15, 10, 5 tons. Higher the capacity, lower the <b>speed.</b> <b>Haulage</b> Way Car or Trolley at Jogindernagar {{is one of a}} few {{funicular railway}}s all over the globe due to geographical and technological challenges faced to construct them and is considered as an engineering marvel of the 20th century.|$|R
40|$|The various modifications, differing in {{cost and}} complexity, {{available}} to adapt diesel engines for operation on hydrous ethanol, are presented. Of these, one option {{is a complete}} conversion to sparkignitionand another is a modification of the ethanol {{to allow it to}} be used in slightly adapted compression ignition engines. The practical implications of the use of both of these modifications were evaluated at the South African Sugar Association Experiment Stationby adaptingtwo tractorsdifferently for operationon ethanol. Their performances were then determined and comparedwith that of a standard dieseltractor of the same make and model. Dynamometer tests, road haulage tests, and general evaluations ofthe ratesofperforming field work, were carried out to make these comparisons. It was found that the powerand torque outputs, <b>speed,</b> <b>haulage</b> capacity, and rates of performing field operations of the tractors operatingon ethanol were similarto those of the diesel tractor, but the fuel consumption of the former was about twice as high...|$|R
