5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> would allow a {{take-off}} under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice {{for the type of}} launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|E
5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> {{worked on}} the same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E

5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics {{for their new}} lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience because they {{make it easier for}} players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game look better than its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> were released at the time. Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> had already been delivered to customers.|$|E

5|$|Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, {{along with}} John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to {{establish}} their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue {{the development of a}} viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other company with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E

5|$|The Atlantis {{crew had}} two Florida return {{opportunities}} for the day, {{as well as two}} for a California landing, giving the managers time to evaluate the weather and use California if necessary. After choosing to pass on the first opportunity for KSC and evaluate the second, managers on the ground decided that the weather in Florida was too dynamic to risk bringing the orbiter in, and opted to land at Edwards Air Force Base instead. The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, a burn of the shuttle's <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Atlantis successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2million miles.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 that it was {{possible}} to artificially chill water with mechanical equipment and attempts were made in the late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's diethyl ether vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; <b>engines</b> <b>that</b> used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. Producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than the natural product.|$|E
