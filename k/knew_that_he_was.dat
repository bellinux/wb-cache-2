5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, but by that time the studio already <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{eventually}} {{decided the}} Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He {{had done what}} many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, {{with no more than}} two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E
5|$|Although Lochry <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in hostile territory, {{he landed}} his little {{flotilla}} {{after two days}} of nonstop travel because he needed to feed his men and horses. After landing, the Americans cooked fresh buffalo meat for breakfast and cut grass for their horses, apparently not taking proper security precautions. Concealed in the nearby woods, Brant repositioned his men and then opened fire, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Some Americans fought until their ammunition ran out, although others apparently did not have their weapons ready when the attack began. Some of the Americans attempted to escape by boat, but Brant had anticipated this and had positioned men in canoes to cut off any retreat. Seeing that he was hopelessly trapped, Lochry called for his men to surrender.|$|E

25|$|On 17 October, Napoleon {{dispatched}} {{orders to}} Louis and Mortier. The King of Holland {{was supposed to}} capture Paderborn and Münster, while the marshal was to seize Fulda and {{come into contact with}} General of Division Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke at Erfurt. Once, Louis and Mortier were in position, Napoleon wanted them to converge on Kassel where they would extinguish the state of Hesse-Kassel. Though William I, Elector of Hesse maintained an official neutrality, Napoleon <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hostile to France and decided to depose him.|$|E

In fact, Golos {{was one of the}} Soviet Union's most {{important}} intelligence agents in the United States. At the time when he and Bentley met, Golos was involved in planning the assassination of Leon Trotsky, which would take place in Mexico in 1940. Bentley and Golos soon became lovers, although it would be {{more than a year before}} she learned his true name, and, according to her later testimony, two years before she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working for Soviet intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of tawhid, {{in the words}} of the prominent Mu’tazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: [...] the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares with Him. This is explained by the fact <b>that</b> you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the world has a creator who created it and that: He existed eternally in the past and He cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> and is eternally all-powerful and that impotence is not possible for Him. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> omniscient of the past and present and that ignorance is not possible for Him. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> everything <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> everything that is, and how things that are not would be if they <b>were.</b> And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> eternally in the past and future living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for Him. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and <b>that</b> <b>He</b> does not have need of sense organs. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> eternally past and in future sufficient and it is not possible for Him to be in need. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not like physical bodies, and that it is not possible for Him to get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and body members. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not like the accidents of motion, rest, color, food or smells. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> One throughout eternity and there is no second beside Him, and that everything other than <b>He</b> <b>is</b> contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. Thus, if you <b>know</b> all of <b>that</b> you <b>know</b> the oneness of God.|$|R

25|$|On July 19, 1810, the {{precursors}} {{of the independence}} - Camilo Torres Tenorio, José Acevedo Gómez, José Miguel Pey and Jorge Tadeo Lozano, among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of Francisco José de Caldas. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; {{the precursors}} were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution. They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, Antonio Villavicencio and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in Cartagena de Indias. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had {{to come from the}} Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from doing something about it. Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy and ask him to allow a Junta to take place: they <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something they knew he would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.|$|E
25|$|Kathy returns a {{few days}} later and meets with Ben, who is furious to see her again after several years of believing she was dead. He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E

When Epstein first saw the Beatles perform he noticed their stage attire first, saying, [...] "They were rather scruffily dressed, in the nicest possible way, or I should say in the most attractive way— black leather jackets, jeans, long hair of course." [...] McCartney said that when Epstein started to manage the Beatles they <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> homosexual but did not care, because he encouraged them professionally and offered them access to previously off-limits social circles.|$|E
500|$|Rae was {{involved}} in a relationship storyline with Ethan Scott (Craig Vye), who was already romancing both Liberty Savage (Abi Phillips) and Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter). Viewers were initially unaware that Rae was seeing Ethan, but <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> cheating on Theresa and Liberty with an unknown third woman. Porter said Theresa, her character, was incredulous when she saw Ethan kissing Rae. Barlow was also surprised by the twist; she had not expected Rae to be involved. Once the three women discovered the truth about Ethan's infidelity, they decided that [...] "the best revenge is humiliation", exposed Ethan's lies and poured gunge over him in front of the entire village. Vye described the storyline as a [...] "classic case of wanting what you can't have". He explained that Ethan was not ready to settle down and would end up alone.|$|E

500|$|In {{his closing}} speech, defence counsel {{said that the}} key to the case was whether the Orsborne {{brothers}} intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel. The evidence, he said, was more suggestive of a [...] "joy-ride half-way round the world", than of theft or anything more sinister. Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month's joy-ride was the innocent explanation, why had it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud [...] "against men whose reputations were above suspicion?". In his summing up, the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story. This was unwarranted and undesirable: [...] "Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent , the property of someone else was being used by them without permission...George Orsborne clearly <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> acting directly against his employer's interests". The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants. On 22 October George Orsborne was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and James to 12 months.|$|E
500|$|Disney's {{public persona}} was very {{different}} from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described him as [...] "almost painfully shy... diffident" [...] and self-deprecating. According to his biographer Richard Schickel, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney [...] "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" [...] and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing so. Disney acknowledged the façade, and told a friend that [...] "I'm not Walt Disney. I {{do a lot of things}} Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink." [...] Critic Otis Ferguson, in The New Republic, called the private Disney: [...] "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney." [...] Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said [...] "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.|$|E
500|$|Rae {{ultimately}} learnt of the affair; Richardson characterised {{her response}} as being [...] "shocked and angry", and Barlow told Inside Soap magazine that the revelation left her character [...] "more torn than ever." [...] The discovery prompted Rae to consider having an abortion, but Brendan convinced her not to, and {{revealed that he}} once lost his own child. Barlow called the scenes [...] "really heartfelt stuff", and explained that Ste saw no problem with Rae having the baby, as he already had a son and considered himself a good father, whereas it was [...] "a bigger deal" [...] for Rae, who was childless. Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, {{and that they had}} a special connection formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. Barlow said that her character could not return to Ste because she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gay, that Rae was [...] "determined to keep the baby" [...] and wanted to prove that she could be a good single mother. However, during an argument with Brendan, Rae suffered a miscarriage. Barlow found the filming of these scenes difficult.|$|E
