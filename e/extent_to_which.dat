What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
