50|$|A <b>honey</b> <b>extractor</b> is a {{mechanical}} device {{used in the}} extraction of honey from honeycombs. A <b>honey</b> <b>extractor</b> extracts the honey from the honey comb without destroying the comb. Extractors work by centrifugal force. A drum or container holds a frame basket which spins, flinging the honey out. With this method the wax comb stays intact within the frame and can be reused by the bees.|$|E

50|$|In prehistoric Greece (Crete and Mycenae), {{there existed}} {{a system of}} high-status apiculture, as can be {{concluded}} from the finds of hives, smoking pots, <b>honey</b> <b>extractors</b> and other beekeeping paraphernalia in Knossos. Beekeeping was considered a highly valued industry controlled by beekeeping overseers—owners of gold rings depicting apiculture scenes rather than religious ones {{as they have been}} reinterpreted recently, contra Sir Arthur Evans.|$|R
50|$|During the {{extraction}} process the honey is {{forced out of}} the uncapped wax cells, runs down the walls of the extractor and pools at the bottom. A tap or honey pump allows for the removal of <b>honey</b> from the <b>extractor.</b> <b>Honey</b> must be removed in time and always stay below the rotating frames as otherwise it prevents extractor from spinning with sufficient speed.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} cooperatives in Tigray, The survey {{conducted}} by the Agricultural Transformation Agency of Ethiopia has indicated that there were no cooperatives before 1991 (Bernard et al. 2008). Farmer cooperatives in the honey sector were launched once private beekeeping and honey processing company (Dimma) transferred its own apiary sites to selected farmers who were living closer to the apiary sites. These cooperatives are operating in the production and marketing of honey. Farmer cooperatives possess common apiary sites and individual beehives and obligate members to commit themselves to take care of apiary cites. They also have common processing technology such as <b>honey</b> <b>extractors,</b> masks and smokers that are provided by government or other development partners (e.g. ARDO, REST, and World Vision). The marketing cooperatives not only collect honey from farmers but provide different processing technology to honey producers. They also facilitate access to credit to acquire modern beehives for their members. These cooperatives also supply honey for the other processing companies (Wukiro Mar and Wolela Mar) that are operating at small-scale level.|$|R

50|$|In the 1990s, Vietnamese {{agricultural}} technicians {{began to}} arrive in Senegal under the sponsorship of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, through an initiative to promote cooperation between {{the nations of the}} global South. By 2001, their numbers had risen from 40 to 100. Most technicians come to Senegal on two year stints, unaccompanied by their spouses, and live in group housing with other Vietnamese. They aim to promote small-scale technologies and techniques suitable to Senegal's level of economic development; for example, Vietnamese beekeepers introduced Senegalese farmers to manually driven centrifugal <b>honey</b> <b>extractors</b> and Vietnamese-style concrete beehives. Others attempted to familiarise Senegalese people to the representative Vietnamese fish sauce nước mắm. Though as of 2001, it was only produced and used by the restaurants in Dakar, Vietnamese technicians in the seaside town of M'Bour trained a women's group in its preparation, and produced roughly 20 tanks of the sauce. Most of the technicians speak only Vietnamese, though they typically learn some Wolof language agricultural vocabulary during their time in the country.|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the impact of using multiple technologies or practices {{on the quality of}} honey. The theoretical part includes a summary of the main methods currently used for assessing the quality of honey and/or establishing its origin. The suitability of the selected apicultural (beekeeping) technology, apiary placement, handling bee honeycombs and facilities for extraction of honey present the first condition for obtaining quality honey without pesticides, air pollutant microparticles, hazardous elements, microorganisms, volatile pollutants of coating substances, antibiotics, drugs used against varroa destructor parasites and their residues. There are mentioned all the known bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties of honey to help preserve its natural quality features without degrading changes. In the practical part there are two groups of honey samples collected from own hives in 2015. Those were sent for analysis to the Institute of beekeeping in Dol (Czech Republic). In 2016, ten samples from beekeepers and ten from retail markets were used. Their partial analysis was carried out at the Department of Agricultural Product Quality. The samples were obtained in a conventional manner using modern <b>honey</b> <b>extractors</b> and in the second case by pressing. The above mentioned samples were tested for water content, HMF, conductivity, glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch and caramel colorants, titration factor, Fiehe´s honey violation by starch sugar or sweetener...|$|R
50|$|Once uncapped, {{the frames}} are then {{placed in a}} <b>honey</b> <b>extractor,</b> which spins them so {{that most of the}} honey is removed by {{centrifugal}} force. Care must be taken to ensure that all frames are loaded correctly, as the comb is angled slightly upwards to prevent the honey flowing out; if loaded incorrectly, this can also prevent the honey flowing out during extraction. Once extracted, the resulting honey will contain bits of wax and must be passed through a screen so that clean liquid honey results.|$|E
50|$|Beekeepers may {{remove the}} entire {{honeycomb}} to harvest honey. Honey bees consume about 8.4 lb (3.8 kg) of honey to secrete 1 lb (454 g) of wax, {{so it makes}} economic sense to return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey. The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal machine—the <b>honey</b> <b>extractor.</b> If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused {{in a number of}} ways, including making sheets of comb foundation with hexagonal pattern. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the <b>honey</b> <b>extractor</b> almost all honey produced was in the form of comb honey. Today, most honey is produced for extraction but comb honey remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and for combining with extracted honey to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing comb honey, which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of extracted honey. Because of the more demanding labor involved, comb honey has greater retail value than extracted honey. ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] Comb honey production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and yellow clover. Wooded areas are not as suitable for comb honey production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of comb honey more difficult. This problem has been largely circumvented with the adoption of specialized frames, such as the Ross Round frame, which prevent accumulation of propolis on saleable units.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess beekeeping management practices and challenges in eastern zone of Tigray. A semi-structured questionnaire, field observation and focal group discussion were employed to collect primary data. Randomly selected three districts were used for the study. A total of 120 respondents were selected from the zone and 40 beekeepers from each district for the study. Both primary and secondary data were collected. Beekeepers indicated that frame hive technology was most preferred. Even though, some equipments such as casting mold and <b>honey</b> <b>extractor</b> were not durable and available as required. Study reveals frame hive was more productive than tradition in the study area. Trees, shrubs and herbs were major honey bee flora identified in the study area. Accordingly, honey produced specially from Leucas abyssinica is a special white and highly demanded honey in Tigray. Beekeepers indicated large amount of honey was harvested in September and October. However, low amount of honey harvested in July and August of the year. Bee forage and absconding due to pestes are major constraint honey bee production in the study area. Honey bees required feed supplementation during dry season; higher supplements were made during February to March and followed by December to January. The commonly used supplements were sugar, shuro and barely flour (besso). The study suggests that bee forage, absconding and pests and predators were the most constraints in the study area...|$|E
40|$|Goma is {{endowed with}} {{different}} flora and adequate moisture which favors honey production. As a result, bee farmers started producing honey since time immemorial using traditional hives, mostly made of bamboo. Improved hive {{production in the}} Woreda started in 1987 among cooperatives formed during the military regime. In 2007, apiculture was identified {{as one of the}} priority commodity for Goma PLW through participatory priority commodities identification. Major constraints identified were shortage and/or substandard inputs supply, poor quality honey, lack of market, skill and knowledge limitations of bee farmers and technical staff. To address the challenges, value-chain development approach was exercised and in this regard the following developments were recorded. One interested honey shop was upgraded to become an apiculture input shop in Agaro town with financial assistance from OCSSCo/IPMS and technical assistance from the District Livestock Development and Production Agency (LDPA) and IPMS. This input shop supplied considerable inputs to bee farmers who also provide commercial services for their neighbours. One of the important inputs delivered to bee farmers was imported <b>honey</b> <b>extractor</b> but less demand was observed due to its high price. Moreover, one interested honey producers association named Wojin Gudina Honey Producers Association was formed and got legal identity. The association is expected to play market regulatory role, quality assurance, do bulking of member produce as well as non members to maintain bargaining power. About 44 interested farmers and 12 technical staff received skill and knowledge upgrading training and in this regard Jima University (JU) played a big role. More focus was given to transforming traditional to transitional hives (Kenya Top Bar), which was a change for the frame hives (modern hives) which had been introduced before. Twenty interested farmers received 123 transitional hives in Acha Afeta PA through credit and also transitional hive use has shown significant increase within and outside interested farmers in the last two years. To address market constraints, an effort was made to link honey producer with honey processing and export enterprises and in this regard Beza Mar honey processing and exporting enterprise has already started the process to buy Goma honey. Prior to this, an attempt was also made with another commercial processor but was not successful. The effects of various interventions are just emerging and are expected to come to full fruition over time. A household (HH) survey conducted by the project indicated however that adopters of improved apiculture technologies produced in 2008, on average, about birr 3, 400 of honey per year compared to birr 225 by traditional bee keepers. Major lessons learned include that the intervention stimulated increased demand for improved hives and better use of existing hives. As compared to other Districts, involvement of private sector in the sale of accessories for improved bee hives and honey processing is emerging. Most of the honey produced from framed hives is extracted using locally made crude extractors with less or no food graded approval and also less quality honey. These extractors are operated commercially by private individuals, but require further technical support to improve quality. The development of a quality honey market is just emerging, however as indicated in the prices, no clear price incentive for quality honey is observed yet, probably because of the still relatively small volume entering into this market segment. Another indication of the still limited demand for clear honey is the increase in the numbers of traditional hives in the last two to three years. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E
