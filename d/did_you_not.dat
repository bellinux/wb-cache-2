During a trip to Lake Biel, Hański went to arrange lunch, leaving his wife and Balzac alone. In the shade of a large oak tree, they kissed and exchanged vows of patience and fidelity. She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit {{before the end of the}} year. Before he left Nauchâtel, she sent a passionate letter to his hotel: [...] "Villain! <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> see in my eyes all that I longed for? But have no fear, I felt all the desire that a woman in love seeks to provoke".|$|E

"committed an unforgivable foul in {{the penalty}} box; the harsh blast of the referee's whistle, his finger {{pointing}} {{to one of}} the most calamitous places in the purgatory of this life; the penalty spot. The heavy odour of death hung over the fateful spot: <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> hear a crowd of thousands suddenly become dumb mutes, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> see the players standing in a half circle as if they were at a graveside... Everyone holding his breath. I have always believed that Roose grew to his full height as a man in the purgatorial crisis of a penalty, drying off the clay around his feet, washing away the dross which entered his character with the gold... Arthur's sword against the bare fist. Then came the signal; the ball travelled like a bolt from the foot of the penalty taking forward, and in the blink of an eyelid, revolution, a thump, and the ball landed in the heather and gorse of the Buarth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Margit Sandemo {{never had}} a good {{relationship}} with her father. He was a strict man, punishing his children by locking them in a closet. During the German occupation of Norway in World War II he supported the Nazis openly - a thing Margit never could forgive him for. [...] When he was absent from home, his children would dream about his death. [...] His obituary read: [...] "Thank you God, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> let this happen sooner.." [...] Margit Sandemo tried to interact with her father as little as possible, that way she didn't have to speak bad about him afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|After he had {{completed}} the batteries, Latouche received authorization to cruise off Long Island and intercept shipping to New York City. He quickly captured two prizes, before spotting four sails on 7 June 1780: these were the frigate Iris and three lesser warships. In the ensuing Action of 7 June 1780, Latouche was himself {{shot in the arm}} by a musket ball, and Hermione suffered ten deaths and 37 wounded. His opponent, Captain James Hawker, later accused him of fleeing the scene, to which Latouche replied [...] "In my poor state, I could not pursue you.

2500|$|What is {{the meaning}} of [...] "Acher {{destroyed}} the plants"? Of him scripture says: [...] "Do not let your mouth make your flesh sin". What does this mean? Acher saw that Metatron happened to be granted authority to sit while he record the merits of Israel, and he said: [...] "We have been taught that in heaven there is no sitting.... Perhaps there are — God forbid! — two supreme powers". They brought him to Metatron and they smote him with sixty bands of fire. They said to Metatron: [...] "When you saw him, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> stand up before him?" [...] Then authority was granted Metatron to erase the merits of Acher. Then a heavenly voice was heard: [...] "'Repent, O backsliding children!' except for Acher." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> tell {{me that she was}} your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E

When she initially goes to the Israeli embassy to report their deaths, which she witnessed, Mossad Officer Michael Bashan asks her directly, [...] "Did you or <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> sleep with him?"

[...] God heard and called Moses, Aaron, and Miriam {{to come to}} the Tent of Meeting. God came down in cloud and called out to Aaron and Miriam: [...] "When a prophet of the Lord arises among you, I make Myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with My servant Moses; he is trusted {{throughout}} My household. With him I speak mouth to mouth, plainly and not in riddles, and he beholds the likeness of the Lord. How then <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> shrink from speaking against My servant Moses!" [...] As the cloud withdrew, Miriam was stricken with snow-white scales. Moses cried out to God, [...] "O God, pray heal her!" [...] But God said to Moses, [...] "If her father spat in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days?

2500|$|Ibn Qutaybah, a 9th-century Sunni Islamic scholar narrates of Ali:I am {{the servant}} of God and {{the brother of}} the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give {{allegiance}} to you [...] when it is more proper for you to give bay’ah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) – and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument…It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, [...] "O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.Ali's wife, and daughter of Muhammad, Fatimah, refused to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of Fadak and her inheritance from her father and the situation of Umar at Fatimah's house. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Fatimah did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of Abu Bakr. Almost all of Banu Hashim, Muhammad's clan and many of the sahaba, had supported Ali's cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported Abu Bakr.|$|E
