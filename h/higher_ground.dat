5|$|As {{a result}} of timely {{warnings}} issued by the IMD, the Indian government was able to launch an evacuation campaign and order that all fisherman return to shore. This led to more than 150,000 people being evacuated to relief camps which {{had been set up}} on <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> Due to the thorough preparations, there was fewer deaths than in the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and moving it to <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became {{the capital city of}} British Honduras in 1970.|$|E
5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with <b>higher</b> <b>ground</b> in the Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment {{to the surrounding}} basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the system, {{officials}} issued storm warnings for coastal areas of Alabama and western Florida, and residents in low-lying areas were advised to seek <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> Damage associated with the cyclone was generally minor, and only one life was lost when a boy fell into the swollen waters of a river and drowned.|$|E
5|$|NESCo {{also argued}} that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by <b>higher</b> <b>ground,</b> and in the lee of prevailing winds. They also said that much could be done architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings.|$|E

5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear valleys of moderate relief. These bedrock surfaces are typically covered with colluvium from erosion of stratigraphically higher and more erosion-resistant strata that form the surrounding <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> The soils formed from the Marcellus and the overlying Hamilton shales are deep, free of stones, and well suited for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|By Hattie's {{one year}} anniversary, {{private and public}} workers {{repaired}} and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided £20millionin loans. In {{the days after the}} storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> Work on the new capital, Belmopan, was completed in 1970. On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Despite never moving onto land, Nina's {{proximity}} to Hawaii and the forecasts for an imminent landfall resulted in massive evacuations. An estimated 300people living in Hanapepe and Hanalei {{were forced to}} evacuate when the Hanalei River overflowed its banks. An estimated 1,500people on Kauai were evacuated to <b>higher</b> <b>ground,</b> where the Red Cross had established seven evacuation centers for these people to evacuate to. In addition, thirteen members of the United States Coast Guard were evacuated from low-lying islands and harbors when they were threatened by rising tides triggered by the hurricane {{and the threat of}} flooding forced 420military personnel and families in Waikiki's Ft. Derussy and Ft. Armstrong as well as those living in Ft. Kamehameha, near Pearl Harbor to leave for <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> 270 were housed in Tripler Army Hospital and a temporary shelter was opened in Ft. Shafter, both of which were on high ground. In anticipation of Nina, 85 planes were flown away from Barber's Point Naval Air Base to Midway and several commercial flights were cancelled until the storm had passed. There was also concern for the residents of the privately owned Niihau, the closest landmass to the center of Nina and 20miles closer than Kauai. The island's only communications was by boat and most attempts at reaching the island failed due to high surf.|$|E

50|$|<b>High</b> <b>ground</b> {{is an area}} of {{elevated}} terrain, {{which can}} be useful in combat. The military importance of <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> has been recognized for over 2,000 years, for example in Sun Tzu's The Art of War, in which military leaders are advised to take <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> and let the enemy try to attack from a lower position. Fighting from an elevated position is easier for a number of reasons. Holding <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> offers an elevated vantage point with a wide field of view, enabling surveillance of the surrounding landscape, in contrast to valleys which offer a limited field of view. General Ji Ling of the late Eastern Han Dynasty used this principle to his advantage by sending lookouts to positions of <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> to scout for and provide early warning about enemy troops. In addition, soldiers fighting uphill will tire more quickly and will move more slowly, while soldiers fighting downhill may not get tired as quickly, and may be able to move faster. Furthermore, soldiers who are elevated above their enemies can get greater range out of low-speed projectiles like rocks, javelins, and grenades. Likewise, low-speed projectiles will have less range when thrown uphill.|$|R

5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as {{it would have been easy}} to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by <b>higher</b> <b>ground,</b> which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|Ewiniar {{hammered}} Okinawa {{with heavy}} rain, creating mass confusion and troubles for tourists. Flights and ferries out of Okinawa to neighbouring islands were cancelled, {{and as many}} as 3,500 tourists were left stranded at various airports because most hotels were already near full capacity. Other tourists reportedly stayed in the homes of some Okinawa residents, while some residents in landslide-prone areas evacuated to <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> Seven people were injured in Nanjo from a fallen signboard, while an elderly woman in Nago City and a young girl in Yaese suffered wind-related injuries.|$|E
5|$|For {{three hours}} the {{battalion}} fought, pinned in a crossfire by North Korean soldiers on <b>higher</b> <b>ground.</b> North Korean forces {{were able to}} divide the American force and kill most of its commanders, further disorganizing the men. Following the failed operation, the wounded US commander ordered a withdrawal, which quickly became disorganized, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Destroyed after its first engagement, the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment was disbanded and merged with other units as the North Korean forces advanced through the pass and attacked US positions to the east.|$|E

5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on <b>higher</b> <b>ground,</b> which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first {{studied in the}} eighteenth century and the first serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were put}} in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20inches (500mm) across the mountainous south was expected {{as the center of}} Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba.

Cattle were moved to <b>higher</b> <b>ground,</b> tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day.
