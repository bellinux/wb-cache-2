25|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} artistic technique in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> (unlike wood engraving where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe beechwood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of cherry wood was popular.|$|E
25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood.</b> In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideal working}} stock has the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> running {{parallel}} to the shaving horse, and perpendicular to the blade of the drawknife, so that the drawknife shaves away the entire wood fibre and does not cut against it. [...] It is best not pulled with blade perfectly perpendicular to the wood stock, but pulled slightly upward toward them in a skewed (blade at a slight diagonal) or slithering fashion, aiming not to take off as much wood as possible, but gradually [...] "shave" [...] the work. The operator gently levers the blade to [...] "bite" [...] into the wood and then controls {{the depth of the}} cut by raising or lowering the handles as they pull the drawknife towards them.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1981 and 1987, Dunham worked {{directly}} on wood veneer, employing multiple types of plywood and various, ever more exotic veneers, including elm, oak, pine, and rosewood. Often responding to <b>the</b> natural <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> Dunham created vibrant compositions that frequently combine geometric and organic, anthropomorphic forms.In discussing {{this body of}} work, Ken Johnson writes, [...] "What these paintings add up to {{is a kind of}} delirious, barely contained psychic pluralism. Various dualities and contradictions play out: between wood and pain; abstraction and representation; geometry and biology; the phallic and the vaginal; body and mind; nature and culture."Towards the late 1980s, Dunham began to work with more singular motifs. Among the recurring figures in his work are wave-like forms, hatted male figures in a variety of settings, trees set in pastoral landscapes, and nude female bathers. Kate Linker writes,These motifs have provided an armature for a continuous and seemingly self-generating practice in which paintings appear to evolve and differentiate from earlier versions of themselves. Imagery is generated through subject matter yet abstractly, in a series of variations that incrementally expand on and work through a theme.|$|R
2500|$|Finishing is {{the final}} step of the {{manufacturing}} process that gives wood surfaces desirable characteristics, including enhanced appearance and increased resistance to moisture and other environmental agents. Finishing can also make wood easier to clean and keep it sanitized, sealing pores that can be breeding grounds for bacteria. [...] Finishing can also influence other wood properties, for example tonal qualities of musical instruments and hardness of flooring. Patching wood requires skill, but when done properly {{it is possible to}} create a repair that is very difficult to see. An alternative to patching is filling (sometimes known as stopping). Numerous coloured fillers (putties and waxes) are produced commercially and are coloured to match different wood species. Successful filling of voids in wood requires the filler to precisely match the colour and grain pattern of the wood around the void, which is difficult to achieve in practice. Furthermore, filled voids do not behave like wood during subsequent finishing steps, and they age differently to wood. Hence, repairs to wood using fillers may noticeable. Therefore filling is best used with opaque finishes rather than semitransparent finishes, which allow the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> to be seen.|$|E
2500|$|The spur to such {{commercial}} designs can {{be found}} in the [...] "free Renaissance" [...] style that was espoused by Charles Eastlake. In 1868 he published Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details which was very influential in Britain and later in the United States, where the book was published in 1872. Although the archaeology of Mr. Eastlake's volume was always careful, most of the principles in it are beyond question, and can be generally stated in a few words. The Italianate style would have no carving or molding or other ornament glued on—such work must be done in the solid; no mitered joints, but joints made at the right angle, and secured by mortise, tenon and pin; woods in their native colour, and unvarnished, or else painted in flat colour, with a contrasting line and a stenciled ornament at the angles; unconcealed construction everywhere, and purposes plainly proclaimed; and with veneering, round corners and all curves weakening the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> being absolutely forbidden. The furniture that he thus proposed has straight, strong, squarely cut members equal to their intention. Its ornament is painted panels, porcelain plaques and tiles, metal trimmings, and conventionalized carvings in sunk relief, a part of the construction entering into the ornament, also in the shape of narrow striated strips of wood radiating in opposite lines, after a fashion not altogether unknown in the time of Henry III. It has the honesty and solidity, but not the attraction, of the Medieval; and if it is stiff and somewhat heavy, and fails entirely to please, it has yet a wholesome and healthy air.|$|E

I find about me mountains and horizons that limit my view, institutions that vanish also without an explanation, beyond the limit of sight, and a great complexity of things I do not understand and about which, to tell the truth, I do not formulate acute curiosities. People, very unrepresentative people, people just as casual as people in the real world, come into personal relations with us, and little threads of private and immediate interest spin themselves rapidly into a thickening grey veil across the general view.

60|$|From its house a {{staircase}} of cut stone takes {{you down to}} the temple of Chion-in, where I arrived on Easter Sunday just before service, and {{in time to see}} the procession of the Cherry Blossom. They had a special service at a place called St. Peter's at Rome about the same time, but the priests of Buddha excelled the priests of the Pope. Thus it happened. The main front of the temple was three hundred feet long, a hundred feet deep, and sixty feet high. One roof covered it all, and saving for the tiles there was no stone in the structure; nothing but wood three hundred years old, as hard as iron. The pillars that upheld the roof were three feet, four feet, and five feet in diameter, and guiltless of any paint. They showed the natural <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> till they were lost in the rich brown darkness far overhead. The cross-beams were of grained wood of great richness; cedar-wood and camphor-wood and the hearts of gigantic pine had been put under requisition for the great work. One carpenter--they call him only a carpenter--had designed the whole, and his name is remembered to this day. A half of the temple was railed off for the congregation by a two-foot railing, over which silks of ancient device had been thrown. Within the railing were all the religious fittings, but these I cannot describe. All I remember was row upon row of little lacquered stands each holding a rolled volume of sacred writings; an altar as tall as a cathedral organ where gold strove with colour, colour with lacquer, and lacquer with inlay, and candles such as Holy Mother Church uses only on her greatest days, shed a yellow light that softened all. Bronze incense-burners in the likeness of dragons and devils fumed under the shadow of silken banners, behind which, wood tracery, as delicate as frost on a window-pane, climbed to the ridge-pole. Only there was no visible roof to this temple. The light faded away under the monstrous beams, and we might have been in a cave a hundred fathoms below the earth but for the sunshine and blue sky at the portals where the little children squabbled and shouted.|$|E
6000|$|... § 18. I {{call these}} the {{governing}} or leading lines, {{not because they}} are the first which strike the eye, but because, like those of the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> in a tree-trunk, they rule the swell and fall and change of all the mass. In Nature, or in a photograph, a careless observer will by no means be struck by them, any more than he would by the curves of the tree; and an ordinary artist would draw rather the cragginess and granulation of the surfaces, just as he would rather draw the bark and moss of the trunk. Nor can any one be more steadfastly adverse than I to every substitution of anatomical knowledge for outward and apparent fact; but so it is, that as an artist increases in acuteness of perception, the facts which become outward and apparent to him are those which bear upon the growth or make of the thing. And, just as in looking at any woodcut of trees after Titian or Albert Durer, as compared with a modern water-color sketch, we shall always be struck by the writhing and rounding of the tree trunks in the one, and the stiffness, and merely blotted or granulated surfaces of the other; so, in looking at these rocks, the keenness of the artist's eye may almost precisely be tested by the degree in which he perceives the curves that give them their strength and grace, and in harmony with which the flakes of granite are bound together, like the bones of the jaw of a saurian. Thus the ten years of study which I have given to these mountains since I described them in the first volume as [...] "traversed sometimes by graceful curvilinear fissures, sometimes by straight fissures," [...] have enabled me to ascertain, and now generally at a glance to see, that the curvilinear ones are dominant, and that even the fissures or edges which appear perfectly straight have almost always some delicate sympathy with the curves. Occasionally, however, as in the separate beds which form the spur or horn of the Aiguille Blaitière, seen in true profile in Plate +29+, Fig. 3, the straightness is so accurate that, not having brought a rule with me up the glacier, I was obliged to write under my sketch, [...] "Not possible to draw it straight enough."

60|$|I see by {{the date}} of last {{paragraph}} that this chapter has been in my good Aylesbury printer's type {{for more than a}} year and a half. At this rate, Proserpina has a distant chance of being finished in the spirit-land, with more accurate information derived from the archangel Uriel himself, (not that he is likely to know much about the matter, if he keeps on letting himself be prevented from ever seeing foliage in spring-time by the black demon-winds,) about the year 2000. In the meantime, feeling that perhaps I am sent to tell my readers a little more than is above told, I have had recourse to my botanical friend, good Mr. Oliver of Kew, who has taught me, first, of palms, that they actually stitch themselves into the ground, with a long dipping loop, up and down, of the root fibres, concerning which sempstress-work I shall have a month's puzzlement before I can report on it; secondly, that all the increment of tree stem is, by division and multiplication of the cells of the wood, a process not in the least to be described as 'sending down roots from the leaf to the ground.' I suspected as much in beginning to revise this chapter; but hold to my judgment in not cancelling it. For this multiplication of the cells is at least compelled by an influence which passes from the leaf to the ground, and vice versa; and which is at present best {168} conceivable to me by imagining the continual and invisible descent of lightning from electric cloud by a conducting rod, endowed with the power of softly splitting the rod into two rods, each as thick as the original one. Studying microscopically, we should then see the molecules of copper, as we see the cells of the wood, dividing and increasing, each one of them into two. But the visible result, and mechanical conditions of growth, would still be the same as if the leaf actually sent down a new root fibre; and, more than this, the currents of accumulating substance, marked by the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> are, I think, quite plainly and absolutely those of streams flowing only from the leaves downwards; never from the root up, nor of mere lateral increase. I must look over all my drawings again, and at tree stems again, with more separate study of the bark and pith in those museum sections, before I can assert this; but there will be no real difficulty in the investigation. If the increase of the wood is lateral only, the currents round the knots will be compressed at the sides, and open above and below; but if downwards, compressed above the knot and open below it. The nature of the force itself, and the manner of its ordinances in direction, remain, and must for ever remain, inscrutable as our own passions, in the hand of the God of all Spirits, and of all Flesh.|$|E

Conventional breeding of seedlings, or cloning figured trees by grafting, are possi-ble methods to propagate figured <b>wood</b> in walnut. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> such material, however, will de-pend on figure being expressed predictably. For breeding to succeed, <b>the</b> trait <b>of</b> interest must be genetic and heritable. For clonal propagation to be effective, the trait must be reproduced true-to-type. In this study, we evaluate <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> pattern <b>of</b> both grafted and seedling walnut from several highly figured wild selections. Logs from grafted trees of three clones propagated in the 1970 s in Kansas were evaluated. Only one log from one clone showed some figure in its lumber. Ten-year-old seedlings from the figured walnut clone “Lamb ” were grown and cut in Indiana and evaluate...|$|R
40|$|Texture can be {{observed}} in many natural and synthetic images from multispectral satellite images to <b>the</b> microscopic images <b>of</b> cell or tissue samples. Texture is an innate property of virtually all surfaces, <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>the</b> weave <b>of</b> fabric, <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> crop in fields etc It contains important information about <b>the</b> structural arrangement <b>of</b> surfaces and their relationship to the surrounding environment. Since <b>the</b> textural properties <b>of</b> images appear to carry useful information, for discriminating purpose features have always been calculated for textures. The paper deals with the pattern classification using texture features. The features used in the project are standard deviation and entropy of all parts obtained after 3 rd level decomposition using DWT. A mean feature vector is calculated and is used for classification. For classification distance similarity is used. The different distances used are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Bray Curtis distance and Canberra distance. <b>The</b> efficiency <b>of</b> classification is calculated for each distance and is compared. The time required for each retrieval, in every distance method used, is also calculated...|$|R
