25|$|Desert National Park: Located in Rajasthan, this {{national}} reserve features extensive sand dunes and dry salt lakes. Wildlife {{unique to the}} region includes the desert fox and the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} birds are found {{throughout}} the basin, such as myna, Psittacula parakeets, crows, kites, partridges, and fowls. Ducks and snipes migrate across the Himalayas during the winter, attracted in large numbers to wetland areas. There are no endemic birds in the upper Gangetic Plain. The <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Ardeotis nigriceps) and lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus) are considered globally threatened.|$|E
25|$|Destruction {{of forest}} land for {{agriculture}} and other purposes: {{large tracts of}} forest land have been cleaned up for monoculture plantations like teak, coffee and rubber. This {{has led to the}} destruction of species that were dependent on the forest. An example of this is loss of special habitats in Karnataka such as Myristica swamps and high altitude grasslands. In the dry zone, they have adversely affected several species dependent on large tracts of scrub such as the wolf and the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b>|$|E

25|$|Introduction of {{new species}} into a habitat has caused serious {{consequences}} {{to the existing}} species of flora and fauna. A typical example is {{the introduction of the}} African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) in the lakes and rivers of Karnataka. This is a carnivorous fish and has caused serious damage to the indigenous fauna living in those lakes and rivers. Weeds like Eupatorium, Lantana and Parthenium have invaded large tracts of land causing destruction. An increase in Eupatorium is attributed as one of the causes for the spread of the deadly Kyasanur forest disease (which has a morbidity rate of 10%) among humans since it harbors tick populations that are vectors for this disease. Eucalyptus plantations in the Ranibennur blackbuck sanctuary has seriously harmed the extremely rare <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b>|$|E

The male is polygamous.|$|R

5000|$|Kutch Bustard Sanctuary or Kachchh <b>Great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Bustard</b> Sanctuary, {{also known}} as Lala-Parjan Sanctuary, is located near Jakhau village in Nalia Taluka, Kutch District, Gujarat, India. This {{sanctuary}} {{is one of the}} two <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> sanctuaries in Gujarat; the other one is in Jamnagar. It was declared as a sanctuary in July 1992, specifically for the conservation of the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard,</b> the heaviest flying bird belonging to the avian family of Otididae. However, the sanctuary presently legally covers a protected area of about 2 km2 of area (202.86 ha of fenced land only and is the smallest sanctuary in the country. Several suggestions have been made to vastly increase the size of this sanctuary as it is a breeding ground of the endangered <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b> The reason is that its ecological zone is much larger on account of anthropogenic and cattle population pressure that are considered as a ‘biotic threat’ to this omnivorous species.|$|E
50|$|The main {{bird species}} of the sanctuary, the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard,</b> locally called “Ghorad,” is a Schedule I bird under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. It is {{included}} in the Red Data list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). According to the studies conducted by the Bombay Natural History Society on three Indian bustard species - namely the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard,</b> the lesser florican and the Bengal florican - the estimated total population of the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> in all 12 sanctuaries in the country is said to be only about 1,000, out of which only about 30 birds had last been counted within the sanctuary, second only to the Desert National Park in Rajasthan which reportedly had about 70-75 birds.|$|E

Among these, the Jerdon's courser is also considered a globally threatened species, and was rediscovered in this ecoregion in 1986 after being recorded {{for the last time}} in 1900. Other globally threatened bird species such as the lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus) and <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> can also be found in the ecoregion.|$|R
