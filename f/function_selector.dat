40|$|Abstract. Intention {{scheduling}} mechanism plays {{a critical}} role in the correct behaviour of BDI agents. For human-like agents, the independent intentions should be scheduled based on their priorities, which show the respective importance and urgency of the intentions. We propose to enrich the BDI agent architecture with 2 processing components, a PCF (Priority Changing <b>Function)</b> <b>Selector</b> and a Priority Controller. These enable a BDI agent to assign an initial priority value to an intention and change it with time according to the chosen PCF. The initial priority value reflects its urgency at the time of intention creation. The PCF selected defines how the priority should change with time. As an example, we design a function by simulating human behaviors when dealing with several things at the same time. The priority first increases with time according to the Gaussian function to simulate that people are more inclined to do something which has been on their mind for sometime. After a certain time, if the intention still does not get executed because of other higher priority intentions, its priority will decrease according to the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. Experiment results show that with this mechanism, the agent can show some human-like characteristics when scheduling intention to execute. This can be used when simulating human-like agents. 1...|$|E

Development of the fuzzy control can roughly {{be divided into two}} research approaches: development of fuzzy control functions, and development of fuzzy inference methods. Both approaches are discussed in this paper. First, a lately developed fuzzy inference method, called maximal fuzzy similarity, is introduced. Second, two fuzzy traffic signal control <b>functions,</b> phase <b>selector</b> and green extender, are presented and their performance is evaluated by simulations. Third, the applicability of the maximal fuzzy similarity inference method in traffic control systems is compared to the traditional Mamdani inference method. The comparison is made using them separately in the above mentioned control functions. In the simulations, the phase <b>selector</b> <b>function</b> improved significantly the control performance, while the fuzzy green extender worked better than the non-fuzzy control only with high volumes. The fuzzy sets and inference seem to have meaning only when the input values (volumes) are high enough. The main difference between the tested inference methods was the fact, that the defuzzification method of Mamdani inference, center of area, leads to more compromising control decisions than the similarity method. Instead of combining the outputs of all the control rules, the similarity inference launches the action of the rule with highest similarity to the input values and ignores the output values of other rules.

The modular units in such languages are abstract data types called classes, comprising data and <b>functions</b> (or <b>selectors</b> in the OOL parlance); each selector has possibly multiple implementations (or methods in OOL parlance) each in a different class. These languages support reusability of code/functions by allowing a class to inherit methods from its superclass in a hierarchical arrangement of the various classes. Therefore, when a selector s is invoked in a class c, the relevant method for s inherited by c has to be determined. That is the fundamental problem of method-lookup in object-oriented programs. Since nearly every statement of such programs calls for a method-lookup, efficient support of OOLs crucially relies on the method-lookup mechanism. The challen [...] ...|$|R

For higher CCL (30  μA) applied to the device, a bipolar memory switching is obtained, which is attributed to formation and rupture of the conducting filament in SiOy layer. 1.5 -nm-thick AlOy layer with high thermal conductivity plays an important role in lowering the off-current for memory and threshold switching. Through the temperature dependence, high-energy barrier (0.463  eV) in the LRS is confirmed, which can cause nonlinearity in a low-resistance state. The smaller the CCL, the higher the nonlinearity, which provides a larger array size in the cross-point array. The coexistence of memory and threshold switching in accordance with the CCL provides the flexibility to control the device for its intended use.|$|R

PFL inherits the advantages of functional pro-gramming languages, including higher-order func-tions, static type checking, lazy evaluation, and sup-port for user-defined types and constants.

40|$|AbstractBackground: In Drosophila, segment-specific muscle {{pattern is}} thought to be {{determined}} by the autonomous <b>function</b> of homeotic <b>selector</b> genes in the mesoderm in combination with inductive cues from the developing epidermis and nervous system. Here, we have examined the roles of homeotic genes in the patterning of the somatic muscles of the thoracic segments of Drosophila. Results: We determined the expression patterns of homeoproteins in the mesoderm of the thoracic segments during embryonic and adult development. We found that, unlike the mesoderm of the first and third thoracic segments which express Sex combs reduced and Antennapedia (Antp), respectively, the mesoderm of the second thoracic segment does not express any known homeotic selector gene of the Antp or bithorax complex. In animals homozygous for Antp null mutations, the muscles of the second thoracic segment were affected in the embryo, probably as an indirect consequence of its requirement in the ectoderm. Animals that specifically lacked Antp function in the mesoderm, but expressed the gene in the epidermis, developed with a normal muscle pattern in the second thoracic segment. Furthermore, specific ectopic expression of Antp and other homeotic selector genes in the mesoderm of the second thoracic segment respecified its muscle pattern, indicating that these genes are not required autonomously during muscle development in this segment. Finally, we showed that Antp continues to be expressed in the mesoderm of the homeotically transformed third thoracic segment in the ‘four-winged fly’, and suggest that this is a likely reason for the failure of flight muscle development in the transformed segment. Conclusions: We present a model for muscle development in the second thoracic segment whereby mesodermal properties are specified entirely by induction, in contrast to muscle development in other segments, where autonomous <b>function</b> for homeotic <b>selector</b> genes is also required...|$|R

Mutations within the Pax 6 homologs including fly eyeless, mouse Small eye and human Pax 6 lead to severe retinal defects in their respective systems. In Drosophila eyeless and twin of eyeless, play non-redundant roles in the developing retina. One particularly interesting characteristic of these genes is that, although expression of either gene can induce ectopic eye formation in non-retinal tissues, {{there are differences in}} the location and frequencies at which the eyes develop. eyeless induces much larger ectopic eyes, at higher frequencies, and in a broader range of tissues than twin of eyeless. In this report we describe a series of experiments conducted in both yeast and flies that has identified protein modules that are responsible for the differences in tissue transformation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{anterior}} {{and intermediate}} lobes of the pituitary gland {{derive from the}} surface ectoderm. They provide a simple system to assess mechanisms of developmental identity established by tissue determinants. Each lobe contains a lineage expressing the hormone precursor pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) : the corticotropes and melanotropes. The T-box transcription factor Tpit controls terminal differentiation of both lineages. We now report on the unique role of Pax 7 as a selector of intermediate lobe and melanotrope identity. Inactivation of the Pax 7 gene results in loss of melanotrope gene expression and derepression of corticotrope genes. Pax 7 acts by remodeling chromatin and allowing Tpit binding to a new subset of enhancers for activation of melanotrope-specific genes. Thus, the <b>selector</b> <b>function</b> of Pax 7 is exerted through pioneer transcription factor activity. Genome-wide, the Pax 7 pioneer activity is preferentially associated with composite binding sites that include paired and homeodomain motifs. Pax 7 expression is conserved in human and dog melanotropes and defines two subtypes of pituitary adenomas causing Cushing's disease. In summary, expression of Pax 7 provides a unique tissue identity to the pituitary intermediate lobe that alters Tpit-driven differentiation through pioneer and classical transcription factor activities...|$|R
