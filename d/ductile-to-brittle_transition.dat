50|$|At lower temperatures, {{more energy}} (i.e. - larger applied stress) is {{required}} to activate some slip systems. This is particularly evident in BCC materials, in which not all 5 independent slip systems are thermally activated at temperatures below the <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature, or DBTT, so BCC specimens therefore become brittle. In general, the CRSS increases as the homologous temperature decreases because it becomes energetically more costly to activate the slip systems, although this effect is much less pronounced in FCC.|$|E

The reduction in fracture strain is generally temperature dependent and a [...] "ductility trough" [...] is observed as the test temperature is decreased. A <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> <b>transition</b> behaviour is also exhibited by many metal couples. The shape of the elastic region of the stress-strain curve is not altered, but the plastic region may be changed during LME. Very high crack propagation rates, varying from a few centimeters per second to several meters per second are induced in solid metals by the embrittling liquid metals. An incubation period and a slow pre-critical crack propagation stage generally precede final fracture.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{now well}} {{acknowledged}} that, after a prototypical {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) transient, the resultant mechanical properties of fuel cladding tubes depend strongly on the oxygen {{content of the}} residual prior-β layer, as this phase is the only metallic part of the high-temperature oxidized cladding that may show some residual ductility. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain relevant information on the evolution of the mechanical properties, on the one hand, of the prior-β structure as a function of the oxygen content, assuming that there is a critical oxygen content that leads to a <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> failure mode <b>transition</b> at low testing temperatures (20 – 135 °C); and on the other hand, of the α(O) structure as a function of the oxygen content. Sheets of Zircaloy- 4, 1 to 3 mm thick, and M 5 ® advanced alloys from AREVA NP have been studied. To obtain different oxygen contents, they were oxidized at high temperature and then annealed under vacuum in order to reduce the oxide layer. Systematic post-treatment measurements of the oxygen concentration and of its homogeneity within the sheet thickness were performed. The different prior-β and α(O) structures thus obtained have homogeneous oxygen content between ∼ 0. 14 wt. % and 0. 9 wt. % and ∼ 2 wt. % and 7 wt. %, respectively. Such oxygen concentration ranges cover the solubility values that are expected in the β phase and in the α(O) phase at high temperatures typical of LOCA transients. Detailed microstructure investigations were subsequently performed on the prior-β structures since it is considered to be the most important layer when regarding the post-quench mechanical behavior of the material. Continuous cooling temperature (CCT) phase diagrams as a function of the oxygen content were established to correctly interpret the results. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis has then allowed the crystallographic orientations and the morphology of prior-β phase sub-grains to be determined. For each considered prior-β grain, it was possible to interpret the data by taking into account the “Bürgers” crystallographic relationship between the parent β phase and the resultant α phase. Complementary electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was also used. These last experiments have shown a spatial fluctuation of the oxygen content within the microstructure that depends both on the nominal oxygen content and on the cooling rate. Nanohardness measurements were also performed and correlated with this oxygen spatial partition. These measurements proved to be useful for the understanding of the tensile macroscopic mechanical behavior. Finally, on the one hand, tensile tests were performed on prior-β phase at testing temperatures ranging from − 100 °C up to 260 °C. The <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> temperature <b>transition</b> and the mechanical constitutive laws as a function of the oxygen content were then described. These tests show the existence of a <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> failure mode <b>transition</b> at 20 °C for a critical oxygen concentration of ∼ 0. 5 wt. %. A detailed fractographic analysis was performed to assess the failure mechanism. On the other hand, four-point bending tests were conducted on α(O) phase at 25 °C and 135 °C in order to obtain behavior laws. Preliminary finite element calculations were performed to simulate ring compression tests carried out on multi-layered high-temperature oxidized cladding tubes...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of 1950 ’s vintage, A 285 Grade B carbon steels have been compiled for elastic-plastic fracture mechanics analysis of storage tanks (Lam and Sindelar, 1999). The properties are from standard Charpy V-notch (CVN), 0. 4 T planform Compact Tension (C(T)), and Tensile (T) specimens machined from archival steel from large water piping. The piping and storage tanks were {{constructed in the}} 1950 s from semi-killed, hot-rolled carbon steel plate specified as A 285 Grade B. Evaluation of potential aging mechanisms at both service conditions shows no loss in fracture resistance of the steel in either case.

Furthermore, the tank sidewalls are 1 / 2 or 5 / 8 -inch thick, and therefore, the J-resistance (JR) curve that characterizes material resistance to stable crack extension under elastic-plastic deformation best defines the material fracture toughness.

40|$|Crystalline silicon (Si) wafers used as {{substrates}} in {{the semiconductor}} and photovoltaic (PV) industries are traditionally manufactured using a multi-wire slurry sawing (MWSS) technique. Due to its high productivity potential, the fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing (DWS) technique is of considerable interest to Si wafer producers. Although both sawing techniques are currently {{used in the}} industry, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still lacking, particularly for diamond wire sawing. Consequently, optimization of the wire sawing process is carried out largely based on experience and trial and error. This thesis aims to develop a systematic fundamental understanding of diamond wire sawing of Si materials used for PV applications. First of all, a comparative analysis {{of the characteristics of}} silicon wafers cut by slurry and fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing is presented. The analysis results indicate that fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing may be a viable alternative to slurry wire sawing. Modeling and experimental studies of single grit diamond scribing of Si are proposed to shed light on the basic cutting mechanisms. Although Si is brittle at room temperature, it is possible to properly control the cutting conditions to obtain a completely ductile mode of material removal. The effects of material anisotropy, abrasive grit shape, friction condition and external hydrostatic pressure on the <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> mode <b>transition</b> in cutting of single crystal Si (sc-Si) are systematically investigated. Multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) based solar cells take up the majority of the global PV market. Hard inclusions (Silicon carbide and Silicon nitride) in multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) ingots may cause wire breakage and negatively impact the process, surface/subsurface morphology and mechanical properties of the resulting wafer. Their effects are experimentally studied through the single grit diamond scribing on the mc-Si sample with high density of inclusions. Finally, it is identified that there is a correlation between the high dislocation density and the increase of fracture toughness in mc-Si. The increase in fracture toughness leads to greater capability of ductile mode of cutting and higher specific scribing energy in the brittle fracture regime. Results of these fundamental investigations are expected to generate useful knowledge for optimizing the diamond wire sawing process in order to achieve high productivity and minimum surface/subsurface damage.

In some recent car models press hardening steel has reached already a weight share of more than 20 % in the body structure while {{it is estimated that}} it could reach even around 40 % in the future. However conventional press hardening steel based on the alloying concept 22 MnB 5 was designed originally not for automotive application. In spite of the high strength level, press hardening steel has generally low toughness due to the relatively high carbon content and its martensitic microstructure. Particularly important is the <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature at low temperature, which might lead to unexpected failure in cold climate regions. Furthermore, hydrogen embrittlement is a major concern in press hardening steel as previous results indicated that only a few ppm of hydrogen could induce delayed cracking.

This material capability is usually characterized by the toughness. All these characteristics have not yet been systematically investigated in press hardening steel.

The study aimed to investigate differences in mechanical properties of a single microstructure; asdeposited and reheated microstructures and subjected to various mechanical tests. Additionally, to simulate the effects of irradiation embrittlement a number of specimens were prestrained and then statically strain aged. Charpy impact transition curves had obvious trends depending upon microstructure and condition, with microstructure having a significant influence on the transition region and upper-shelf impact energy level. Prestraining and ageing the specimens promoted {{an increase in the}} <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature and reduction the upper shelf energy level for both microstructures.

A combination of factors decreases toughness for the asdeposited prestrained and aged condition, which exhibited the highest yield stress, and lowest work hardening exponent and the best cleavage fracture resistance.

Creep strengthening and <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> <b>transition</b> were quantified {{as a function of}} oxygen content and test temperature, and modeled into viscoplastic flow constitutive equations and an empirical fracture criterion...|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} a new mode of brittle failure {{that occurs in}} the bulk of tin-based lead-free solder joints, unlike the typical brittle failures {{that occur in the}} interfacial intermetallics. Brittle failures in the joint bulk result from the low-temperature <b>ductile-to-brittle</b> <b>transition</b> in the fracture behavior of beta-tin. The bulk embrittlement of these joints is discussed by referring to the results of impact tests performed on both solder joints and bulk solder specimens. The mechanism of bulk embrittlement is largely explained {{based on the results of}} a fractography study performed on the bulk joint failures using scanning electron microscopy. status: publishe...|$|E
