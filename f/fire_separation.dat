5000|$|... {{construction}} defects (failure {{to build}} as designed) had left unfilled gaps between floors and walls throughout, hidden only by skirting boards and ceiling paper, which {{left the building}} without <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> (or acoustic separation) between flats. Tall blocks of flats in the UK are permitted relatively narrow staircases because the requirement for full <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> between floors means that in theory, it is safer for people above the fire {{to stay in their}} flats rather than walk down the stairs. (This theory does not hold where the <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> fails, as happened in the Grenfell Tower fire). Without <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> it would be necessary for all people above a fire to escape, which would not be possible using the existing narrow staircases.|$|E
5000|$|... {{closures}} (fire dampers) Sometimes firestops {{are treated}} in building codes identically to closures. Canada de-rates closures, where, for instance a 2-hour closure is acceptable {{for use in}} a 3-hour <b>fire</b> <b>separation,</b> so long as the <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> is not an occupancy separation or firewall. The lowered rating is then referred to as a fire protection rating, both for firestops, unless they contain plastic pipes and regular closures.|$|E
50|$|A firestop is a fire {{protection}} system made of various components used to seal openings and joints in fire-resistance rated wall or floor assemblies. Firestops {{are designed to}} restore the fire-resistance of wall or floor assemblies, impeding the spread of fire by filling the openings with fire-resistant materials. Unprotected openings in <b>fire</b> <b>separations</b> cancel out the fire-resistance ratings of the <b>fire</b> <b>separations,</b> allowing the spread of fire, usually past {{the limits of the}} fire safety plan of a building.|$|R

50|$|In smaller theatres, {{a safety}} curtain {{is not usually}} required.

50|$|In {{a modern}} {{high-rise}} {{building with a}} well-sealed envelope, the stack effect can create significant pressure differences that must be given design consideration and {{may need to be}} addressed with mechanical ventilation. Stairwells, shafts, elevators, and the like, tend to contribute to the stack effect, while interior partitions, floors, and <b>fire</b> <b>separations</b> can mitigate it. Especially in case of fire, the stack effect needs to be controlled {{to prevent the spread of}} smoke and fire, and to maintain tenable conditions for occupants and firefighters.|$|R

40|$|Flow {{separation}} {{which plays}} an important role in the design of a rocket engine nozzle is discussed. For a given ambient pressure, the condition of no flow separation limits the area ratio and, therefore, the vacuum performance. Avoidance of performance loss due to area ratio limitation requires a correct prediction of the flow separation conditions. To provide a better understanding of the flow separation process, the principal behavior of flow separation in a supersonic overexpanded rocket nozzle is described. The hot <b>firing</b> <b>separation</b> tests from various sources are summarized, and the applicability and accuracy of the measurements are described. A comparison of the different data points allows an evaluation of the parameters that affect flow separation. The pertinent flow separation predicting methods, which are divided into theoretical and empirical correlations, are summarized and the numerical results are compared with the experimental points...|$|R

50|$|A National Fire Protection Association report {{attributed}} the ignition {{of the fire}} to human error by a worker who had identified faulty valve assembly on gas cylinder in a ground-floor buffet; while attempting to shut off the valve, the worker inadvertently increased the flow of gas and caused an explosion. The combustible wood and vinyl furnishings of the establishment allowed the fire to develop rapidly, as did a lack of <b>fire</b> <b>separation,</b> compartmentation and active suppression systems. As acrid smoke overcame the entire complex, several victims reportedly jumped from the higher windows to their deaths.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to have multiple occupancies (or building uses) within one building. For example, a high-rise building can have retail stores occupying the lower levels, while the upper levels are residential. Different occupancies within a building are separated by a fire barrier with a defined fire-resistance rating. It is common for a penetration (such as a fire door) to have a fire protection rating lower than the wall fire-resistance rating {{in which it is}} installed. For example, a two-hour <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> normally requires fire doors rated at 90 minutes.|$|E

Now and then, the exterior door was left open, which affected ambient indoor temperatures and thus the [...] "snapping" [...] process of the foam, whose density varied widely within the seal. Silicone foam, once mixed, evolves hydrogen gas, which bubbles, thus creating a foam, as the liquids turn to solid rubber.|$|E

5000|$|An {{accidental}} pad {{firing of}} a launch escape system {{occurred during the}} attempted launch of the unmanned Soyuz 7K-OK No.1 spacecraft on December 14, 1966. The vehicle's strap-on boosters did not ignite, preventing the rocket from leaving the pad. About 30 minutes later, while the vehicle was being secured, the LES engine <b>fired.</b> <b>Separation</b> charges started {{a fire in the}} rocket's third stage, leading to an explosion that killed multiple pad workers. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. Originally it was thought that the LES firing was triggered by a gantry arm that tilted the rocket past 7 degrees, meeting one of the defined in-flight abort conditions. However, a more thorough investigation found a different cause: the Earth's rotation caused the rate gyros to register an approximately 8Â° tilt, which the abort sensing system interpreted as the booster deviating from its flight path. The system was subsequently redesigned to prevent recurrence of this unanticipated error.|$|R
5000|$|Feeder busway {{is used to}} {{interconnect}} equipment, such as between a transformer and a switchgear line up. A variant type is low-impedance busway, {{which is designed to}} have lower voltage drop by virtue of close spacing of bus bars, which reduces inductive reactance. [...] A trolley busway provides power to equipment that must be frequently moved. The busway is open at the bottom, and a movable collector assembly [...] "trolley" [...] is used to connect between the fixed bus bars in the busway and the cable connected to moving equipment. Bus ducts are building service penetrants that are required to be externally firestopped where they penetrate <b>fire</b> <b>separations</b> required to have a fire-resistance rating. Any internal firestops that are supplied by the manufacturer may be tested as integral components to either UL857 or IEEE C37.23 for North American models, and then via ASTM E814, UL1479 or ULC-S115. Bus duct-internal firestops mitigate the transmission of internal fires, smoke and heat between fire compartments through the combustion of bus duct-internal covalent wrappings, spacers and brackets.|$|R
50|$|The concern, most {{particularly}} about the <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> issue, eventually led {{the council to}} evacuate the building, and then to demolish it in 1986 in a forensic manner (rather than, for example, using explosives). When this was done, {{the extent of the}} defects found shocked even some of the activists, such as the architect Sam Webb, who had been lobbying for years that the building was unsafe. On the lower floors, cracks were found in the concrete where it had been point loaded, and it was alleged that the extra pressure on those points during a high wind (such as during the Great Storm of 1987, barely a year after the demolition) would soon have led to building collapse.|$|E
50|$|A {{fire door}} is a {{door with a}} fire-resistance rating (sometimes {{referred}} to as a fire protection rating for closures) used as part of a passive fire protection system to reduce the spread of fire and smoke between separate compartments of a structure and to enable safe egress from a building or structure or ship. In North American building codes, it, along with fire dampers, is often {{referred to as a}} closure, which can be derated compared against the <b>fire</b> <b>separation</b> that contains it, provided that this barrier is not a firewall or an occupancy separation. In Europe national standards for fire doors have been harmonised with the introduction of the new standard EN 16034, which refers to fire doors as fire-resisting door sets. Starting September 2016, a common CE marking procedure will be available abolishing trade barriers within the European Union for these types of products. In the UK, it is Part B of the Building Regulations that sets out the minimum requirements for the fire protection that must be implemented in all dwellings this includes the use of fire doors. All fire doors must be installed with the appropriate fire resistant fittings, such as the frame and door hardware, for it to fully comply with any fire regulations.|$|E
30|$|As the {{understanding}} of fire performance of engineered timber products increases, innovative solutions seek to combine timber with conventional materials to optimize structural design.

40|$|Abstract: In {{response}} to the market demand for <b>fire</b> <b>separations</b> in the light industrial, commercial and residential buildings, a research project is currently under way to improve the thermal performance of cold-formed steel stud wall systems used in these buildings. Extensive fire testing of both non-load-bearing and load-bearing wall panels has been completed to date in the Fire Research Laboratory of Queensland University of Technology. This paper presents {{the details of this}} experimental study into the thermal performance of some small scale non-load-bearing walls lined with dual layers of plasterboard and insulation. The first two wall panels were built traditionally using lipped channels with two plasterboard linings on both sides and the cavity filled with and without glass fibre insulation. The third panel tested was built similarly, but with the insulation sandwiched between the plasterboards {{on either side of the}} steel wall frame instead of being placed in the cavity. Fire tests undertaken were based on the standard time-temperature curve recommended by AS 1530. 4 (SA, 2005). Experimental results showed that the new stud wall system outperformed the traditional stud wall system giving a much higher fire rating...|$|R

50|$|Without fuel, a fire will stop. Fuel can {{be removed}} naturally, as where the fire has {{consumed}} all the burnable fuel, or manually, by mechanically or chemically removing the fuel from the <b>fire.</b> Fuel <b>separation</b> {{is an important factor}} in wildland fire suppression, and is the basis for most major tactics, such as controlled burns. The fire stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease in energy release and a lower temperature. Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat.|$|R
