5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
5|$|The role of Johnny {{was written}} by Jarmusch {{specifically}} for Joe Strummer, {{who had been the}} frontman of The Clash, the director's favorite 1980s rock band. Jarmusch had conceived the part a few years previously while the two were together in Spain, and although the musician had been in a period of depression at the time following the collapse of the band, he was drawn by the Memphis setting of the film. Unlike the jovial Steve Buscemi, Strummer did not stay on set to <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> the veteran actors between shots, but instead preferred to keep his own company, focusing intensively on orienting himself to the role.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

5|$|On July 22, 1916, Riley {{suffered}} a second stroke. He recovered enough {{during the day}} to speak and <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> his companions. He died before dawn the next morning, July 23. Riley's death shocked the nation and made front page headlines in major newspapers. President Woodrow Wilson wrote a brief note to Riley's family offering condolences {{on behalf of the}} entire nation. Indiana Governor Samuel M. Ralston offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the Indiana Statehouse—Abraham Lincoln being the only other person to have previously received such an honor. During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24, more than thirty-five thousand people filed past his bronze casket; the line was still miles long {{at the end of the}} day and thousands were turned away. The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries. A large funeral procession then carried him to Crown Hill Cemetery where he was buried in a tomb at the top of the hill, the highest point in the city of Indianapolis.|$|E

The book features a running <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> Stein being confused by references to Frankenstein, being unfamiliar with the story.|$|E

25|$|In 1978 Coleman founded Killing <b>Joke</b> <b>with</b> drummer Paul Ferguson in Notting Hill, United Kingdom. The pair then {{recruited}} guitarist Geordie Walker and bassist Martin Glover (aka Youth). The group released {{their first}} single in October 1979 and their first eponymous album {{was released in}} 1980. Coleman contributed lead vocals and keyboards to the band's songs, which are categorised as post-punk, and the music later inspired the industrial rock and metal genres.|$|E
25|$|Russians are a {{stereotype}} in Russian jokes themselves when set next to other stereotyped ethnicities. Thus, the Russian appearing in a triple <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> two Westerners, German, French, American or Englishman, will {{provide for a}} self-ironic punchline depicting himself as simple-minded and negligently careless but physically robust, which often ensures that he retains the upper hand over his less naive Western counterparts. Another common plot is a Russian holding a contest with technologically-superior opponents (usually, an American and a Japanese) and winning with sheer brute force or a clever trick.|$|E

According to Dark, the label hired him {{with the intention of}} re-image Spears from the naughty schoolgirl persona of [...] "...Baby One More Time", and stated that they [...] "wanted a much more story-oriented video without dance, one that was serious and emotional." [...] He further stated that, during the filming, [...] "I'd <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> her so that she would loosen up and feel comfortable acting, as opposed to being Britney Spears at that moment."

500|$|Much of the episode's plot {{revolves}} around a practical <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> a fake cake that Jim {{has set up}} {{in an attempt to}} fool Pat. Moving the cake reveals the head of the person hiding under the table, but, in the mean time, the hidden character can hear conversations taking place nearby, unbeknownst to those who are not in on the joke. The episode plays on viewers' guesses as to what has led to the arrival—seen {{at the opening of the}} episode—of a paramedic. In particular, the person under the table is at risk of injury if candles burn down or someone puts a knife into the [...] "cake".|$|E

The name Jesus pops up and Michael replies with Apollo Creed. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) encourages Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to pursue Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes. Later, Andy strums [...] "The Rainbow Connection" [...] on his banjo while singing falsetto. Pam smiles politely and silently shares the <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> Jim.|$|E

500|$|... "The Bubble" [...] was {{directed}} by Matt Sohn and written by Brian Rowe and Greg Levine, the latter of whom regularly works as a writers assistant on the series. The episode was originally broadcast on May 19, 2011, and ran back-to-back with the Parks and Recreation episode [...] "Li'l Sebastian", which aired immediately afterward. The two are stand-alone episodes that were not originally designed to be shown together. However, because the show premiered late as a mid-season replacement in January, the two episodes aired together so the third season could conclude {{at the end of}} the television season. The concept of the fourth floor of Pawnee's town hall as a dark and horrifying place was introduced in the second season episode [...] "Tom's Divorce", and has been a running <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> the show ever since.|$|E
500|$|Beck v. Eiland-Hall {{is a case}} {{filed in}} 2009 before the [...] World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a United Nations agency. [...] It was filed by [...] {{political}} commentator Glenn Beck against Isaac Eiland-Hall, concerning the website [...] "GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com". Eiland-Hall created the site as a parody to express the view that Beck's commentary style challenged his guests to prove a negative. The site's name {{was based on a}} joke first used by comedian Gilbert Gottfried at the 2008 Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget, in which Gottfried jokingly implored listeners to disregard the (non-existent) rumor that Saget had raped and murdered a girl in 1990. Online posters began an Internet meme comparing Gottfried's <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> Beck's style of debate, by requesting Beck disprove he had committed the act in question. Eiland-Hall launched his website on September 1, 2009.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} commemoration, Larson's opponents from 1984 {{were invited}} back to be contestants on Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck playing against Larson's brother, James, with Tomarken {{returning}} to host the question round. Despite {{the fact that the}} board was now more random (host Todd Newton called it [...] "Larson-proof"), {{and there was no way}} the same trick could have been performed, Long and Litras (who had remarried and took the surname Litras-Dakan) still lost. When James Larson hit the Big Bank space on his first spin of the first round, Long proceeded to <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> host Newton that he had [...] "seen this before". At one point, Litras-Dakan advanced to first place before hitting a Double Whammy shortly afterward, effectively giving James Larson the win. James Larson won a digital grand piano worth $6,695, while Newton closed the game by announcing, [...] "The legacy continues".|$|E

500|$|Discworld is a third-person point-and-click graphic {{adventure}} game. An overhead map appears when {{leaving a}} location {{that allows the}} player {{to go straight to}} another.

Locations outside Ankh-Morpork include the Dark Wood (where Nanny Ogg resides), the Mines (where dwarves tune swords), and the Edge of the World (where [...] "the world ends and space begins"). Items can be examined or used, and can either be stored in Rincewind's pockets or in the Luggage. To progress in the game, Rincewind must collect items, talk to people and solve puzzles. Rincewind may also acquire special skills needed to perform certain tasks. Characters featured include an Archchancellor, the Dibbler, the Librarian, and Death. During a conversation, the player may choose to have Rincewind greet, <b>joke</b> <b>with,</b> vent anger towards, or pose a question to the character.|$|E
500|$|Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) {{built on}} the Joker's 1951 origin story, portraying him as a failed comedian {{pressured}} into committing crime as the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Batman's interference causes him to leap into a chemical vat, which disfigures him. This, combined with the trauma of his wife's earlier accidental death, causes him to go insane and become the Joker. However, the Joker says that this story may not be true, as he prefers his past to be [...] "multiple choice". In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon and tortures her father, Commissioner James Gordon, {{to prove that it}} only takes one bad day to drive a normal man insane. After Batman rescues Gordon and subdues the Joker, he offers to rehabilitate his old foe and end their rivalry. Although the Joker refuses, he shows his appreciation by sharing a <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> Batman. Following the character's maiming of Barbara, she became a more important character in the DC Universe: Oracle, a data gatherer and superhero informant, who has her revenge in Birds of Prey by shattering the Joker's teeth and destroying his smile.|$|E
