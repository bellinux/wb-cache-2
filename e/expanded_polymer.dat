40|$|Highly {{filled polymer}} composites, such as polymer {{concrete}} (PC), suffer from setting stresses generated during the cure of the resin binder, when polymerization shrinkage is hindered {{by the close}} packing of filler and aggregate particles. Setting stresses impair significantly {{the strength of the}} cured composite. Current zero-shrinkage and <b>expanding</b> <b>polymer</b> concrete formulations achieve these properties with a sacrifice in strength. In this investigation, a novel system was developed for producing zero-shrinkage and <b>expanding</b> <b>polymer</b> concrete composites with concomitant enhancement in strength. This was achieved by dispersing small amounts of the hydrated mineral montmorillonite (MMT) into the resin and was found effective with three different resin binders (polyester, epoxies, and acrylics). Most resins require less than 2 % MMT to produce zero-shrinkage systems with flexural strengths and splitting tensile strengths 30 % and 16 % greater than conventional PC; higher MMT contents create PC systems which expand upon curing or generate positive hydrostatic pressure during constant-volume cure. We have examined here the complex physicochemical interactions between the polymerizing resin and the dehydrating mineral, which give rise to the observed cure-expansion and strength enhancement. This required extensive experimental work, including strength measurements, X-ray diffractometry, differential scanning calorimetry, thermomechanical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry data. Based on the results of these measurements we propose a mineral-resin interaction mechanism that involves the migration of organic species from the curing resin into the MMT crystal structure; these organic molecules replace some of the ordered hydration water, released by the mineral at the temperatures generated by the exothermic polymerization reaction. The MMT-resin bonding takes place through the molecules of silane coupling agents, thus contributing to the strength enhancement of the composite. The observed expansion at cures above 100 (DEGREES) C is due to the release of highly disordered water, which remains distributed in the pores and internal structure of MMT, rather than forming a discrete gas phase...|$|R

Temperature-induced wettability changes were studied using sessile drop contact angle measurements. The surface topography was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in Milli-Q water at 25 and 40 degrees C. The reversible attachment of a fluorescently labeled model protein was studied as a function of temperature using a fluorescence microscope and a fluorescence spectrometer. Maximum switching in terms of the contact angle change around the LCST was observed at a ratio of 36 : 1 PNiPAAm to PAAc.

In addition reinforcing, fibers appearing at the surface are well-wetted by the liquid hardening or crosslinking polymer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the method of manufacture, involving assembly, heating and subsequent coating of the molding. Preferably heating is by a hot gaseous phase, e. g. steam, or alternatively microwaves are used. Preferred features: The foam is a compound of EPP and a further <b>expanded</b> <b>polymer.</b> The polymer applied to the free surface of the fibrous layer is an elastomer. The reinforcing fibers are glass, carbon or aramid. The mixed fiber layer is a woven, knitted or laid fabric.

40|$|Significant {{injectivity}} loss during polymer injection measured {{particularly in}} the near wellbore has been reported. This challengeable issue is identified as bridging polymer adsorption caused by the bridging of pore throats via macromolecular polymers previously stretched under elongational flow conditions occurring {{in the vicinity of}} the injection well. There has been no attempt to describe this phenomenon by numerical simulation model because the conventional Langmuir isotherm widely used in reservoir simulation is not able to contain this bridging-adsorption observed in complicated polymer flooding experiments. This study focuses on the development of numerical model for the bridging adsorption by implementing population balance theory and performs extensive simulation verifications with small core-scale reservoir rock. To reflect distinct flow condition to induce bridging adsorption, the rate of bridging adsorption is established by considering the relationship of <b>expanded</b> <b>polymer</b> under shear force and narrow pore size. To verify the feasibility of new model, simulation results are compared with experiment output reported in previous studies. The simulation results indicate that a considerable amount of bridged polymer can be generated in the low permeability cells only if the polymer solution is exposed to high shear velocity related with shear rate. This is in accordance with a number of previous experimental reports. In addition, the mechanism to induce permeability reduction is totally different from that of conventional Langmuir&# 39;s isotherm which is widely incorporated in commercial simulators. With buildup of bridging-polymer, the adsorption model can enable the application of numerical simulation targeted at chemical EOR process to be wider.

40|$|A silica-supported tandem {{catalyst}} system, {{capable of}} producing ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymers from ethylene being the single monomer, has been investigated. As tandem couple a phenoxyimine titanium catalyst for ethylene trimerization was combined with a metallocene catalyst for alpha-olefin polymerization. Two different approaches were pursued to combine the two catalysts as silica-supported tandem partners. The co-immobilization of the catalysts on the same support particles led to low polymerization activities and yielded products with low comonomer content due to interference of the two catalysts on the support. Immobilization of the two catalysts on separate supports prevented this interaction and led to high polymerization activities while the comonomer content of the product was controlled by the employed catalyst ratio. The copolymers obtained via the latter method were thoroughly analyzed with composition distribution (CCD) by DSC-SSA, Crystaf, and HT-HPLC.

40|$|Polypropylene foams {{have great}} {{industrial}} interest because of balanced physical and mechanical properties, recyclability {{as well as}} low material cost. During the foaming process, the elongational forces applied to produce the <b>expanded</b> <b>polymer</b> {{are strong enough to}} rupture cell walls. As a result, final foam has a high amount of coalesced as well as opened cells which decreases mechanical and also physical properties. To increase melt strength and also avoid the coalescence effect, one of the current solution is blend PP with ramified polymers as well as branched polypropylene (LCBPP) or ethylene-octene copolymer (POE). In this research to provide extensional properties and achieve uniform cellular structures of expanded PP, 20 phr of LCBPP or POE was added into PP matrix. The blend of PP with ramified polymers was prepared by twin-screw extrusion. Injection molding process was used to produce PP foams using azodicarbonamide (ACA) as chemical blowing agent. The morphological results of the expanded PP displayed a non-uniform geometrical cell, apparent density of 0. 48 g/cm³ and cell density of 13. 9. 104 cell/cm³. Otherwise, the expanded PP blended with LCBPP or POE displayed a homogeneous cell structure and increased the amount of smaller cells (50 – 100 μm of size). The apparent density slightly increased with addition of LCBPP or POE, 0. 64 and 0. 57 g/cm³, respectively. Thus, the cell density reduced to 65 % in PP/LCBPP 100 / 20 and 75 % in the sample PP/POE 100 / 20 compared to expanded PP. The thermo-mechanical properties (DMTA) of PP showed specific stiffness of 159 MPa. cm- 3. g- 1, while the sample PP/LCBPP 100 / 20 increased the stiffness values of 10 %.

Low charge density terpolymers were found to show greater viscosity enhancement upon the addition of surfactant compared to the high charge density terpolymers.

40|$|Many polymer gels undergo reversible, {{discontinuous}} volume {{changes in}} response {{to changes in the}} balance between repulsive intermolecular forces that act to <b>expand</b> the <b>polymer</b> network and attractive forces that act to shrink it. Repulsive forces are usually electrostatic or hydrophobic in nature, whereas attraction is mediated by hydrogen bonding or van der Waals interactions.

Here we describe a more direct influence on this balance of forces, by showing that the radiation force generated by a focused laser beam induces reversible shrinkage in polymer gels. Control experiments confirm that the laser-induced volume phase transitions are due to radiation forces, rather than local heating, modifying the weak interactions in the gels, in agreement with previous observations of light-induced chain association in polymer solutions(8, 9).

40|$|This {{research}} project investigates {{a new technique}} to efficiently mix crystalline solid additives with polymers by gentle ball milling with steel balls {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide (C 02) at 17 to 30 °C and 1300 to 2500 psig. As the ball milling system is agitated, the steel balls transfer mechanical energy to the fluoropolymer and additive thereby converting them to powders. C 02 is added into the chamber to <b>expand</b> the <b>polymer</b> and make it amenable to impregnation by the additive. At the end of the mixing process, a free flowing powder is produced consisting of the additive coated with fluoropolymer. The additives were extracted from the powders and intrinsic viscosity measurements were done on the remnant fluoropolymer. Viscosity studies showed that the virgin and post-ball milled fluoropolymers had similar intrinsic viscosities, hence similar molecular weights within experimental error limits. This implies that most of the polymer chains were simply disentangled during the mixing process and not broken. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) were done on the virgin polymer, the additives and the fabricated powders to determine the loading levels and to ascertain if there were any changes to the physical properties of the polymer. Scanning electron micrographs showed that some of the powder particles had additive particles stuck on the surface, but when these additives were washed off the surface of the powders with a suitable solvent that did not dissolve the polymer, DSC analysis showed the presence of additive incorporated into the polymer matrix...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidics {{has changed}} {{the way we think about}} {{laboratory}} experimental design. With the use of lab-on-chip devices, we are capable of carrying out experiments that include several functions on a single chip. Despite a lot of progress in the miniaturization of these devices, the peripheral systems which control the microfluidic functionalities like valves and pumps, remain bulky, making the microfluidic devices less portable. Conducting polymers are potential candidates that show promise to solve this issue and make the microfluidic devices portable. They are a class of polymer materials with intrinsic conductive properties and the ability to be formed and deformed at a low applied electric potential. This thesis presents the different aspects of the conceptualisation and creation of the actuator for an all polymer conducting polymer microfluidic valve. The proposed system uses the widely studied multi-layer bending beam actuator, commonly used as an artificial muscle or soft actuator. The actuation of the all polymer system is the result of the different expansion rates during an electrochemical reaction. The system consist of three polymer layers. The first layer is the flexible base layer that also functions as a fluid barrier in the microfluidic system. The second layer is the electrode material that is used as an electrode in both the fabrication and actuation of the expanding layer. The final layer is the electrochemically polymerized layer of <b>expanding</b> conducting <b>polymer.</b> The all polymer actuator can eventually form the basis for new opportunities regarding the miniaturisation and commercialisation of Lab on Chip device...|$|R
30|$|Hydrogel microcoils are 0.018 -inch {{detachable}} platinum microcoils {{coated with}} hydrogel <b>polymer</b> that <b>expand</b> when the <b>polymer</b> contact with blood. The hydrogel expands approximately {{five times the}} original volume of the bare coil, thus may offer more filling volume with potentially fewer number of microcoils. The available coil size were 3  mm, 4  mm, 5  mm, 6  mm, and 8  mm in loop diameter and 5  cm, 10  cm, and 20  cm in the extended length. The hydrogel microcoils were prepared and deployed according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For pre-softening, the stretched hydrogel microcoil was immersed in warm sterile saline at 60 degree C in five to ten seconds until the coil curls. When the hydrogel microcoil was appropriately positioned in the vessel, the coil was released with a detachment controller (V-Grip, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Repositioning time of the coil was limited within three minutes {{from the time of}} loading into the microcatheter, because it will become difficult to retract the coil once in contact with blood. It will take approximately 20  minutes until complete expansion of the hydrogel.|$|R
