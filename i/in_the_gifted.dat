25|$|Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. {{was born}} on September 27, 1982, {{and grew up in}} the Hollygrove {{neighborhood}} of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father–son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Lil Wayne has also spoken about his deceased stepfather, Rabbit, who he has said he considers his real father. Carter has a tattoo dedicated to Rabbit, who was murdered before Carter became a star. Carter enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> program of Lafayette Elementary School and in the drama club of Eleanor McMain Secondary School. Wayne attended McMain in the early 1990s for two years. He moved to the Marion Abramson Senior High School.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} thought to {{encourage}} us, still more direct, {{and still more}} positive. The boisterous old notion of hero-worship, which has been preached by so eloquent a voice in our age, is after all now seen to be a half-truth, and to contain the less edifying and the less profitable half of the truth. The world {{will never be able}} to spare its hero, and the man with the rare and inexplicable gift of genius will always be as commanding a figure as he has ever been. What we see every day with increasing clearness is that not only the wellbeing of the many, but the chances of exceptional genius, moral or intellectual, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> few, are highest in a society where the average interest, curiosity, capacity, are all highest. The moral of this for you and for me is plain. We cannot, like Beethoven or Handel, lift the soul by the magic of divine melody into the seventh heaven of ineffable vision and hope incommensurable; we cannot, like Newton, weigh the far-off stars in a balance, and measure the heavings of the eternal flood; we cannot, like Voltaire, scorch up what is cruel and false by a word as a flame, nor, like Milton or Burke, awaken men's hearts with the note of an organ-trumpet; we cannot, like the great saints of the churches and the great sages of the schools, add to those acquisitions of spiritual beauty and intellectual mastery which have, one by one, and little by little, raised man from being no higher than the brute to be only a little lower than the angels. But what we can do--the humblest of us in this great hall--is by diligently using our own minds and diligently seeking to extend our own opportunities to others, to help to swell that common tide, on the force and the set of whose currents depends the prosperous voyaging of humanity. When our names are blotted out, and our place knows us no more, the energy of each social service will remain, and so too, let us not forget, will each social disservice remain, like the unending stream of one of nature's forces. The thought that this is so may well lighten the poor perplexities of our daily life, and even soothe the pang of its calamities; it lifts us from our feet as on wings, opening a larger meaning to our private toil and a higher purpose to our public endeavour; it makes the morning as we awake to it welcome, and the evening like a soft garment as it wraps us about; it nerves our arm with boldness against oppression and injustice, and strengthens our voice with deeper accents against falsehood, while we are yet in the full noon of our days--yes, and perhaps it will shed some ray of consolation, when our eyes are growing dim to it all, and we go down into the Valley of the Dark Shadow.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} what IEA data {{tell us about}} the {{situation}} of <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>in</b> Belgium. (Author) All the data indicate a low achievement <b>in</b> Belgium for <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> group, at all school levels and for the different school subjects. This deficit is especially clear if we compare Belgian students with English-speaking and Scandinavian students. The underachievement of <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> is particularly marked in Populations I and II [...] The situation is better for Population IV. In this case, we can assume that improvement is not caused by specific action of <b>the</b> school <b>in</b> favor of <b>the</b> <b>gifted.</b> Undoubtedly, this ipmrovement {{is the result of the}} high retentivity of the system. The IEA survey took place during the school years 1969 - 1970, before new secondary school structures and methods were introduced on Belgium. None of the students tested followed the new curriculum.

Also on the positive side, our country has a high retentivity rate and the flexibility of the new secondary education curriculum.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{course of}} their work, {{teachers}} often come across gifted pupils. According to the White Paper of Education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Slovenia (2011), gifted children are defined with national criteria as high-above average pupils and represent less than 10 per cent of the population. Their superiority is measured according to the achievements of those pupils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intellectual, creative, learning (language, mathematics, social sciences, science and technology), artistic (music, art, drama, literature) and kinaesthetic or sports areas. Gifted pupils need {{to be treated as}} an independent group of pupils with special potentials or achievements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of learning, therefore, justifying individualized adaptations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sphere of primary and secondary education. Working with gifted pupils, a teacher is required to use different strategies, which will encourage <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> and help them develop their potentials. Only by means of the adapted educational work, gifted students can develop into healthy and creative individuals, affecting the evolution of the society as a whole. A teacher’s expertise <b>in</b> dealing with <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> is influenced by his/ her attitude to <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> and to his/her work alike. Since their views on teaching <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> strongly affect <b>the</b> teacher’s work, the topic is specified and closely studied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thesis. The main purpose of my study was to discover teachers’ attitudes towards training and educating <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> pupils. For this reason, I have carried out an empirical research including 80 primary school teachers. I was interested whether there are any differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teachers’ views due to their years of service, the class they teach, the gender and their pedagogical experience with gifted pupils. I also wanted to find out if there are any links among specific groups of the attitudes studied. I have realised, by means of the research, that there are no great differences in different attitudes of the teachers according to the variables measured (gender, years of service, class, experience <b>in</b> teaching <b>the</b> <b>gifted).</b> It is true that primary school male teachers give a slightly stronger support to differentiation and acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> than their female colleagues, but there were statistically no great differences according to the period of time they have been teaching and their pedagogical experience. The results equally show that teachers working with teenagers are much more aware of the social value of <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> pupils than teachers working with younger children. Finally, I have discovered the weak to moderately strong links among specific groups of teachers’ attitudes to teaching and educating gifted pupils. ...|$|R
