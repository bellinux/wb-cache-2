5|$|Two {{species of}} chewing lice {{have been found}} on <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rails, Pscudomenopon scopulacorne and Rallicola (Parricola) zumpti. R. zumpti has not been {{described}} on any other species of bird from <b>Inaccessible</b> Island. P. scopulacorne found on the <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail were originally described as a new species, P. rowani (Keler, 1951), but were later lumped into the widespread species in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Hovercraft were {{introduced}} in 2002, allowing rescue on mud flats and in river estuaries <b>inaccessible</b> to conventional boats.|$|E
5|$|In his 1928 {{paper on}} the species, Lowe thought that the <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail was the {{descendant}} of flightless ancestors which had reached <b>Inaccessible</b> Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria. Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development and acceptance of plate tectonics. By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to <b>Inaccessible</b> Island. It was also realised that {{like all the other}} land birds of the Tristan Archipelago, it had probably reached the island from ancestors in South America.|$|E

5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{describe a}} single, personal, <b>inaccessible,</b> omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God {{who is the}} creator of all things in the universe. The existence of God and the universe {{is thought to be}} eternal, without a beginning or end. Though <b>inaccessible</b> directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail (Atlantisia rogersi) {{is a small}} bird of {{the rail}} family, Rallidae. It is the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Endemic to <b>Inaccessible</b> Island in the Tristan Archipelago in the {{isolated}} south Atlantic, it is notable for being the smallest extant flightless bird in the world. The species was described by physician Percy Lowe in 1923 but had first come {{to the attention of}} scientists 50 years earlier. The <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail's closest relatives are uncertain but may be crakes in the genus Laterallus.|$|E
5|$|A small species, the <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on <b>Inaccessible</b> Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E
5|$|All-terrain vehicle (ATV) – {{for example}} quad bikes; these {{are used for}} {{response}} off-road, especially at events. ATVs can be modified to carry a stretcher, and are used for tasks such as mountain rescue in <b>inaccessible</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, an {{unlisted}} Bikeshare {{station was}} {{installed on the}} White House grounds, <b>inaccessible</b> to the public. It was removed in August 2017 {{at the request of}} the Trump Administration.|$|E
5|$|Jerome {{reports that}} {{apparently}} the Christians {{had intended to}} remove Joseph's bones to their city, but a column of fire rose skyward from the tomb scaring them away. The Samaritans subsequently covered the tomb with earth rendering it <b>inaccessible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on <b>Inaccessible</b> Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed {{only a small part of}} the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E
5|$|The most {{complete}} {{narrative of the}} battle itself is given by Bede, who nevertheless fails to inform us of the location other than his mention that it took place 'in straits of <b>inaccessible</b> mountains'.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and <b>inaccessible.</b> Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and <b>inaccessible</b> to researchers.|$|E
5|$|After his {{investigations}} Perring {{buried the}} robbers tunnel which remains <b>inaccessible</b> to this day. The pyramid of Userkaf entered the official records {{a few years}} later in 1842 when Karl Richard Lepsius catalogued it in his list of pyramids under number XXXI. Since Perring had already buried the robbers tunnel by that time, K. R. Lepsius did not investigate the pyramid any further.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{affected}} area is extremely remote, distributing the relief supplies was difficult. Reaching some villages would require a five-hour drive over unpaved roads, some of which had collapsed or had been covered by landslides during the earthquake. Helicopters were used to provide supplies to some otherwise <b>inaccessible</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Christmas {{television}} is predominantly secular {{and focuses on}} the ethical message of generosity through gift giving and Santa Claus, or the psychological message of home, nostalgia and childhood, or both. The theological message of the holidaythe Incarnationis rarely encountered in Christmas television. Such a message would be <b>inaccessible</b> to many Americans.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its high}} cost, {{portable}} X-ray devices use thulium {{that has been}} bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source. These sources have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, {{as well as to}} detect defects in <b>inaccessible</b> mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead.|$|E
5|$|During the January 2006 auction, {{the website}} {{was subject to}} a {{distributed}} denial-of-service attack (DDoS) and ransom demand, which left it <b>inaccessible</b> to visitors for a week while its security system was upgraded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wiltshire Constabulary investigated the attack and extortion attempt.|$|E
5|$|Far {{out into}} the Atlantic, exposed to its fullest fury, and {{generally}} <b>inaccessible,</b> yet has nursed a population before, rather than behind, {{those of the other}} Hebrides. Without any advantages or other religious ordinances than are supplied by the annual visit of a priest from Barra, these very interesting people thirst for education, and would make considerable sacrifices to obtain it.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{operations}} in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery at first, but SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th Army Group and Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Smith {{soon realized that}} he had made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and <b>inaccessible,</b> and it lacked the necessary communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|Helicopter – Usually {{used for}} {{emergency}} care, either in places <b>inaccessible</b> by road, or {{in areas where}} speed is of the essence, as {{they are able to}} travel significantly faster than a road ambulance.

5|$|Henry Tufton died in 1849, and castle {{ownership}} fell to Hothfields. Maintenance was {{too expensive}} for the family, and by 1859 cattle were being kept in its gatehouse, and visitors complained that parts of the romantic ruin had become <b>inaccessible.</b> Without sufficient funds, the castle quickly fell into marked decay.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the prevalence of health services in urban regions, much of rural Sarawak is only accessible by river transport, which limits access. Remote rural areas that are beyond the operating areas of health clinics, about , and <b>inaccessible</b> by land or river are serviced by a monthly flying doctor service, which was established in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively <b>inaccessible</b> to spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Several {{conservation}} {{measures have been}} undertaken or proposed to protect this species. <b>Inaccessible</b> Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the Tristan da Cunha Island Council in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced New Zealand flax {{has been removed from}} the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on biosecurity for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached <b>Inaccessible</b> Island, but this may have negative impacts on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.|$|E
5|$|Swifts {{spend most}} of their time in flight. Few birds have the {{necessary}} speed and agility to catch them, hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually sufficiently <b>inaccessible</b> to be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators.|$|E
5|$|TPI {{provides}} tours from May 1 through October 31. In April and November, {{the association}} provides only an exterior shuttle and walking tour. Because the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation owns the property, it is <b>inaccessible</b> outside {{the confines of}} a tour. Roughly 25,000 people visit Taliesin each year.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail {{has a low}} basal {{metabolic}} rate (BMR), measured in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not {{as a result of}} flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols sought {{alliances with}} other nations and {{societies}} to ensure the flow of trade through the empire. The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent by destroying cities on the less-important or more <b>inaccessible</b> routes. The Mongol military was mostly made up of cavalrymen. This allowed the military to move swiftly and easily over large distances.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{engaged in}} a {{strategy}} of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements {{took the form of}} the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into <b>inaccessible</b> regions such as mountains and forests.|$|E
5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The Germans had evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier and removed the pumps which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker <b>inaccessible</b> to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The website was <b>inaccessible</b> to {{visitors}} {{for a week}} until the host server upgraded the security system, and filtered traffic through anti-DDoS software. Wiltshire Constabulary's Hi-Tech Crime Unit and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called to investigate the extortion and attack; they believed it originated in Russia.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl is {{protected}} {{in some of}} the areas in which it lives by national parks. Additionally, there seems to be little habitat destruction in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too <b>inaccessible</b> for future human development. Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the grey-necked rockfowl.|$|E
5|$|Turkey's internet, {{which has}} 42.3 million active users, holds a 'Not Free' ranking in Freedom House's index. Turkish {{government}} has constantly blocked websites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube {{and as of}} May 2017, Wikipedia is currently <b>inaccessible.</b> According to Twitter's transparency report, Turkey leads in social media censorship.|$|E
5|$|Two extinct flightless {{species of}} rail were {{at one time}} placed in the genus Atlantisia with the <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail. The Ascension crake (Mundia elpenor) and the Saint Helena {{swamphen}} (Aphanocrex podarces) were once considered congeners of A. rogersi. The Ascension crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist Peter Mundy in 1656. The Saint Helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 {{and has never been}} encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus Aphanocrex with the genus Atlantisia, and described the Ascension crake as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with A. podarces probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus Mundia was erected and the Saint Helena swamphen moved back to Aphanocrex, leaving the <b>Inaccessible</b> Island rail the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Both the Ascension crake and the Saint Helena swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species, mainly cats and rats.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} oceanic islands, <b>Inaccessible</b> Island has {{remained}} free from introduced predators, allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds, particularly flightless rails, have gone extinct. The species is nevertheless considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), {{due to its}} single small population, which would be threatened by the accidental introduction of mammalian predators such as rats or cats.|$|E
