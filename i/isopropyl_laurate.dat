40|$|Abstract. Density and {{viscosity}} are {{two major}} rheological properties that determine the performance of an <b>isopropyl</b> <b>laurate</b> (IPL) ester based drilling fluid. In this study, the effect of barite particle size on the IPL drilling fluid system settling behavior was investigated using five particle sizes namely- 32, 32 - 45, 45 - 75, + 75 µm and the unsieved barite. Stokes ’ law of separation theory was employed in the analysis. It was found that smaller barite particle sizes (< 75 µm) enhances the settling resistance. An ideal barite particle size of- 32 µm was chosen and used in the subsequent formulations to obtain optimum rheological properties by varying the amount of viscosifier used at 4. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 g marked as sample (a), (b) and (c). These samples were analysed for their rheology by using the conventional Fann viscometer calibrated using Bingham model. The results showed that sample (b) exhibited the most promising performance based on the plastic viscosity (PV), yield point (YP) and gel strength (GS) rheological analyses. Moreover, IPL drilling fluid sample (b) showed improve particle suspension ability for more than 78 hours when compared to IPL drilling fluid system prepared using unsieved barite particles. The results suggested that palm oil based <b>isopropyl</b> <b>laurate</b> ester {{has the potential to}} be used as based fluid in the ester based drilling fluid system...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a family of}} gelators in which alkyl chains are connected to the amino groups of L-lysine methyl ester using a range of different hydrogen bonding linking groups (carbamate, amide, urea, thiourea and diacylhydrazine) using simple synthetic methodology based on isocyanate or acid chloride chemistry. The ability of these compounds to gelate organic solvents such as toluene or cyclohexane can be directly related to the ability of the linking group to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In general terms, the ability to structure solvents can be considered as: thiourea <carbamate <amide <urea similar to diacylhydrazine. This process has been confirmed by thermal measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. By deprotecting the methyl ester group, we have demonstrated that a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups is essential-if the system has too much hydrophilicity (e. g., diacylhydrazine, urea) it will not form gels due to low solubility in the organic media. However, the less effective gelators based on amide and carbamate linkages are enhanced by converting the methyl ester to a carboxylic acid. Furthermore, subsequent mixing of the acid with a second component (diaminododecane) further enhances the ability to form networks, and, {{in the case of the}} amide, generates a two-component gel, which can immobilise a wide range of solvents of industrial interest including petrol and diesel (fuel oils), olive oil and sunflower oil (renewable food oils) and ethyl <b>laurate,</b> <b>isopropyl</b> myristate and isopropyl palmitate (oils used in pharmaceutical formulation). The gels are all thermoreversible, and may therefore be useful in controlled release/formulation applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
