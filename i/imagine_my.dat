However, she acknowledged that this gave her a greater appreciation for Blair in the second volume, noting that Blair [...] "really {{had to learn how}} to rough it" [...] after losing her privileged lifestyle. She went on to state that [...] "Blair is one character that is fun to hate on. So <b>imagine</b> <b>my</b> surprise when I actually started to like her by the end of the book".|$|E
500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way! Because I can <b>imagine</b> <b>my</b> legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E

I am just endlessly fascinated by the different ways of representing them, and always impressed by the actors' ability to bring the characters to life." ...|$|R
500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] <b>Imagine</b> <b>my</b> surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{received}} his degree in 1973 and was ordained a deacon in June 1973 at the cathedral {{of the diocese}} of Newark, New Jersey. [...] He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was {{to start a business}} and ministry: in the winter it was called [...] "The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center" [...] and in the summer it became [...] "Pony Farm". [...] Boo still runs [...] "Pony Farm" [...] as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, [...] "hat is inextricably tied up with having children. And since I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>my</b> life without Jamee and Ella, it's just a completely irrelevant question for me. And I don't regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It's just a part of my journey, and why would I possibly regret that?" ...|$|E

The answer, for me, is an unequivocal no. Furthermore, Musić wrote, “my research and reflection helped me to <b>imagine</b> <b>my</b> sexuality as a gift from a loving, not hateful, God.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Al-Ahly Portuguese coach Manuel José de Jesus {{describes}} Aboutrika as [...] "the best {{football player}} in Africa". He said that Aboutrika has {{more and more}} skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: [...] "Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place". José sees Aboutrika {{as one of the}} best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: [...] "Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>my</b> team without him".|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{had a fine}} rock boa to {{play the}} title-rôle, a snake which was the pride of my heart, so one can <b>imagine</b> <b>my</b> disgust when I saw that one critic ended his disparaging review by the words, 'The crisis of the play was {{produced}} {{by the appearance of}} a palpably artificial serpent.' I was inclined to offer him a goodly sum if he would undertake {{to go to bed with}} it. The real fault of the play was that in trying to give Holmes a worthy antagonist I overdid it and produced a more interesting personality in the villain. The terrible ending was also against it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart who was Gates' {{subordinate}} {{for over}} a year, took his former chief's side in the political struggle between Gates and his rival Philip Schuyler. When Gates assumed command of the Northern Department in August 1777, Stewart wrote him, [...] "You can't <b>Imagine</b> <b>my</b> Dear Sir, the Satisfaction it gives me your being sent back to your proper Command. It is so great a thing, to get the better so Nobly of that petty party, for I can call them by no other Name." [...] In another letter to Gates, he wrote of his fellow Pennsylvanian Anthony Wayne having to dig trenches, [...] "We are throwing up a few works at Wilmington, where Wayne is like a mad bear, it falling to his brigade. I believe he heartily wishes all engineers at the devil." ...|$|E
60|$|As I <b>imagined</b> <b>my</b> {{world without}} that radiant face, that bird-like voice, I fell into black despair. My only hope {{was in the}} nurse, who refused to give her up.

I had possessed her {{only a few years}} and yet she was already woven into the innermost fibers of my heart.|$|R

2500|$|Brown later {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} Life Against Death, referring to its chapter on [...] "Language and Eros" [...] as [...] "quite immature." [...] He {{observed that the}} book, [...] "records the first revision of my historical identity, from Marx to Marx and Freud", a process which occurred because his first [...] "historical identity", Marxism, had been [...] "wrecked in the frozen landscapes of the Cold War, {{the defeat of the}} simplistic hopes for a better world that inspired the Henry Wallace campaign for the Presidency in 1948." [...] Brown, who saw Louis Zukofsky's poetry as anticipating the ideas of both Life Against Death and Love's Body (1966), has called Life Against Death [...] "my first exuberant surge of premature post-Marxist energy", writing that in it he had wagered his [...] "intellectual life on the idea of finding in Freud what was missing in Marx." [...] Brown [...] "found in Freud's analysis of the pathological dimension of human desires the basis for a post-Marxist critique of capitalism." [...] Commenting on his intellectual development, Brown noted that, [...] "My Marxist background had given me a healthy prejudice against moneymaking. <b>Imagine</b> <b>my</b> excitement when I discovered Sandor Ferenczi's article 'The Ontogenesis of the Interest in Money'; with its immortal conclusion, 'After what has been said money is seen to be nothing other than deodorized, dehydrated shit that has been made to shine.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ibárruri {{offered a}} string of speeches, some of them radio {{broadcasts}} from Madrid: [...] "Danger! To arms!" [...] (July 19), [...] "Our fighters must lack for nothing!"

[...] (September 3), [...] "A salute to our militiawomen on the front line" [...] (September 4), [...] "Our battle cry has been heard by the whole world" [...] (September 15). It can be inferred that the majority in Madrid rallied {{to the side of the}} Republic, that uncontrolled elements roamed the capital that many rounds of gunfire were wasted out of nerves (July 29), that Nationalist propaganda was more effective (July 30) and that she understood early on that the war would be lost without foreign aid (August 24). On October 2 she wrote a revealing letter to her son in Russia, apologizing for not having written earlier and described the harrowing situation, [...] "You cannot even <b>imagine,</b> <b>my</b> son, how savage is the struggle going on in Spain now...Fighting is going on daily and round the clock. And in this fighting some of our finest and bravest comrades have perished." [...] She recounted that she had spent many days beside the troops at the front, and reveals her misgivings about the outcome of the war, [...] "It is my hope that in spite of all the difficulties, particularly the lack of weapons, we shall still win." ...|$|E

I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I <b>imagined</b> <b>my</b> fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline.|$|R
