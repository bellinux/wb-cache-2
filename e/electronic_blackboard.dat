5000|$|A five-year {{study of}} the impact of the PLATO system is published. Here are some highlights: [...] "The results of {{exploratory}} queuing studies show that the system could teach as many as a thousand students simultaneously, while still allowing each student to proceed through the material independently." [...] The PLATO system had two different ways to teach - [...] "tutorial logic" [...] where the system presented facts and examples, and then asked questions on the materials presented, and [...] "inquiry logic" [...] where the student could request and organize appropriate information from the computer. The presentation of materials ("slide selector") was called an electronic book. The store of information in the system was called an <b>electronic</b> <b>blackboard.</b> PLATO had a sophisticated help system, whereby different types of wrong answers resulted in the student being sent different help sequences. A rudimentary spell checker was included in the system. A comment page allowed the student to comment on the lessons at any time. An instructor page allowed the instructor to communicate with the student. A [...] "perfect workbook" [...] recorded student responses to questions, as well as kept a record of each button the student pushed and the time at which he or she pushed it. These records were stored on magnetic tape for later statistical analysis.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a project in which Italian undergraduate students at the Palaeopathology Division of Pisa University will attend a two-year Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) course combining the study of funerary archaeology with English as vehicular language. At the presence of a subject and language teacher working together, the trainees will use different types of technology including devices such as <b>electronic</b> <b>blackboards</b> and Word applications with user-friendly interfaces (Excel, Powerpoint, etc.), audio tapes, DVDs, videos taken from important satellite television programmes (BBC, Discovery Channel, National Geographic, etc.). The activities will range from reading parts of funerary archaeology texts scanned and put onto the computer, to gap-filling exercises by listening to a recording, matching words with their definitions, jumbled sentences, etc. A number of resources will be prepared by the learners, for example a bilingual glossary of archaeology terms with definitions extracted from authentic texts, as well as an English grammar with examples-in-context of the basic grammar items, to be exploited by the students of future courses. While performing the different tasks, the learners will be involved in the learning of funerary archaeology content, in improving their language skills, and in understanding how to use different technological tools. In the summer period at the end of the first year, more sophisticated technology will support the students during the explorations at an archeological site in the small village of Benabbio in northern Tuscany. In particular, the excavations of 14 th century bodies on the one hand, and of corpses of people who were victims of the 1855 cholera epidemic on the other, will be carried out using surveying tools that can contribute to the understanding of the underground features. Such tools include geo-radars which help the archaeologists collect information about the location of past human cultures in a particular area; G. I. S., the science that allows to view, interpret, and visualize data concerning maps, globes, reports, and charts; aerial photography, by which it is possible to detect traces of buried structures that are not visible at ground level. Finally, some of the bodies will be submitted to computerized axial tomography (C. A. T.) for a more thorough investigation that can reveal and clarify certain types of information that would have been impossible to obtain in the past. Understanding of the different technologies used for geographic inquiry and treatment of the bodies will also be part of the content course in funerary archaeology held by the subject teacher. The students will be able to experiment the tools, exchanging ideas, sharing experiences, and speaking about their work with British peers from the United Kingdom, who are spending the summer period at Benabbio on exchange courses, and graduating in funerary archaeology in their country. The final exam will consist of a dissertation written in English in which the students will describe particular tasks in which they have been involved, as well as an oral Powerpoint presentation illustrating a particular phase of the excavation activities. Technology-supported tools have become increasingly available in educational contexts, allowing trainees to learn from practical experiences, to be engaged in authentic tasks and build up their self confidence for communication in real life situations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT - This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an instructional unit with the goal of improving the integration of a high-fidelity simulator into an existing curriculum. Another goal was the use of practical applications of Constructivist learning theory. The target audience is bachelor’s-degree level health care sciences students who are learning medical ultrasound in a university environment. A comprehensive four-week lesson plan was developed using a combination of the R 2 D 2 and the PC 3 ID models, both designed to employ practical applications of Constructivism in electronically-supported learning. Participatory design, recursion, reflection, conversation, collaboration, and cognitive tool uses were all a part of the ID process. The resulting lesson plan incorporates instructional elements supportive of Constructivist learning theory: scaffolding, cognitive apprenticeship, active learning, learner selfreflection, social and meaningful learning experiences, and self-guided course progress. Implementation plans were also developed including formative and summative assessments. The entire instructional unit is based in the <b>Blackboard</b> <b>electronic</b> learning environment. The result of this project is a self-contained, self-guided instructional unit based on practical applications of Constructivist theory, which will have positive effects on the further integration of the simulator into the overall instructional curriculum.

40|$|By {{helping to}} be active during large scale lectures, {{students}} remember better what is presented, and can better connect new knowledge to entry knowledge. In large scale lectures with more than 150 students, {{it is nearly impossible}} to manage personal, face-to-face discussions and interaction. Based upon positive experiences with enabling interaction via mobile phones a new form of interaction was tried in a second year Bachelor's course (722 students). Students could send in open comments and questions via SMS, Twitter or via mobile Internet. The lecturer built in blocks of time to respond to these questions and comments. Unanswered but relevant questions are forwarded to the forum of the <b>electronic</b> learning environment (<b>Blackboard),</b> enabling an online response. An experimental design was set up, dividing the lectures of the same lecturer between "reactionlectures" and traditional lectures. Three primary questions for this study were defined: Would students learn better in a reactionlecture than in a traditional lecture? What are the opinions of students on giving direct reactions during a lecture? What forms of providing open comments during lectures can be used? A difference in learning results (as perceived by the students) was not found. Although students indicated that by giving open comments, the lecturer could better adapt to their entry knowledge. Further, questionnaires showed that students were happy both with the options for interaction, and with the connection between the lecture and the discussion forum in Blackboard. Students indicated they would like to have more blocks of interaction during the lecture, so that responding via their mobile phone doesn't distract from listening to the lecturer. Contrary to expectations about the "Facebook generation", students did not respond or comment often. To make the reactionlecture more effective, blocks of interaction on key lecture topics should be scheduled...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{numerical}} development, visuo-spatial skills are are assumed to provide an early foundation for later mathematical learning. First evidence for positive effects of visuo-spatial training on numerical performance in children has recently been provided (Cheng & Mix, 2014). In sum, visuo-spatial training {{can be considered as}} being a promising approach for enhancing young children’s early math performance and providing them with a sound foundation for later mathematical learning. Nevertheless, rarely any visuo-spatial training material is currently available for the preschool setting. Based on this, we have developed a tablet-based visual-spatial intervention tool for preschoolers. This tool has been specifically designed for the school setting and should be administered by a teacher to a whole classroom or a small group of children. In terms of design, the tablet workspace is conceptualized as an <b>electronic</b> <b>blackboard</b> being used in combination with external material such as booklets. A multitude of tasks targeting different levels of visual-spatial abilities have been developed and will be presented. This tool is currently being scientifically evaluated in {{the context of}} a first classroom based intervention study in Luxembourgish kindergartens (N= 125). In a pretest-posttest design, we are evaluating changes in visuo-spatial abilities and potential transfer effects on numerical abilities in the intervention group (n= 68) compared to a “teaching as usual” control group (n= 57). The intervention is carried out twice per week (20 minutes per session) over a period of 10 weeks. Only near transfer effects could be observed, but no further transfer to non-trained transformation skills and early math abilities. Training effects were thus restricted to skills that have been specifically targeted during training sessions...|$|E

The faculty members who teach in media-based {{distance education}} are compensated in various ways: course preparation fees, course development fees, grading stipends, overload payments, share in the revenue generated, etc. In some cases; such teaching is considered {{as part of the}} teaching load. Some institutions also compensate faculty for participating in training programs designed to teach them how to teach using distance education technologies. ^ However, little has been done to determine exactly what the mix of faculty compensation is and especially how it has changed over the years. Thus, two surveys, consisting of the same survey sent five years apart, were conducted of institutions that belong to one of three consortia: AMCEE (Association of Media-based Continuing Education for Engineers); NTU (National Technological University); and NUTN (National University Teleconference Network). ^ The surveys collected information on compensation for teaching using the following technologies: telecourses, video, audioconferencing, computer conferencing, and audiographics (computer-based or <b>electronic</b> <b>blackboard).</b> These technologies could be used for either credit or non-credit courses. ^ In addition, information was gathered on other types of compensation such as money made available to hire graduate assistants or to purchase equipment. Information was also obtained about training programs available and the compensation awarded for participation in such programs. ^ The results of each survey are given in order to provide data from a large sample size on the various types of compensations awarded. Using Rogers 2 ̆ 7 model of the diffusion of innovations, analysis was completed to see what changes had occurred over the five-year period in order to determine if the distance education innovations have followed the developments in compensation that other innovations have. ^ The findings of this study support some elements of the model of the diffusion of innovations. However, there is not strong evidence that institutions have consistently followed the diffusion model. Additional areas for research are suggested. ...|$|E
