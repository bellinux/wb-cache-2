That {{the said}} Warren Hastings did proceed unto the said {{province}} of Oude under color {{of providing a}} remedy for the disorders described to be existing in the same, and for {{the recovery of the}} Company's pretended debt. And the said Warren Hastings, who had thought fit to recall the Company's Resident, appointed to that office by the Court of Directors, and to suspend his office, did, notwithstanding, of his own choice and selection, and on his own mere authority, take with him in his progress a large retinue, [...] "and a numerous society of English gentlemen to compose his family," [...] which he represents as necessary, although, in a letter from that very place to which he took that very numerous society, he informs the Court of Directors [...] "that his own consequence and that of the nation he represents are independent of show." [...] And after his arrival there, he, the said Warren Hastings, did write from Lucknow, the capital of that province, a letter, dated the 30th of April, 1784, to the Court of Directors, in which are several particulars to the following purport or tenor, and which he points out to the Directors [...] "to be circumstances of no trivial information," [...] namely,--"that he had found that the lands in that province, as well as in some parts more immediately under the Company, have suffered in a grievous manner, being completely exhausted of their natural moisture by the total failure of one entire season of the periodical rains," [...] with a few exceptions, which were produced only [...] "by the uncommon labor of the husbandman." [...] And in a letter to Edward Wheler, Esquire, a member of the Council-General, from Benares, the 20th of September, 1784, he says, that [...] "the public revenues had declined with the failure of the cultivation in three successive years; and all the stores of grain which the providence of the husbandmen, (as he was informed is their custom,) in defiance of the vigilance of the aumils [collectors], clandestinely reserved for their own use, were of course exhausted, in which state no person would accept of the charge of the collections on a positive engagement; nor did the rain fall till the 10th of July." [...] And in another letter, dated from Benares, the 1st of October following, he repeats the same accounts, and that the [...] "country could not bear further additions of expense: that it had no inlets of trade to supply the issues that were made from it" [...] (the exceptions stated there being inconsiderable); [...] "therefore every rupee which is drawn into your treasury [the Company's] from its circulation will accelerate the period at which its ability must cease to pay even the stipulated subsidy." [...] Notwithstanding this state of the country, of which he was well apprised before he left Calcutta, and the poverty and distress of the prince having been frequently, but in vain, represented to him, in order to induce him to forbear his oppressive exactions, he did, in order to furnish the Council with a color for permitting him to recall the Company's Resident, and to exercise the whole powers of the Company in his own person, without any check whatsoever, or witness of his proceedings, except the persons of his own private choice, make the express and positive engagement aforesaid, which, if understood of a real and substantial <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> for the relief of the total of the Company's finances, was grossly fallacious: because at the very time he must have been perfectly sensible, that, in the then state of the revenues and country of Oude, (which are in effect the Company's revenues and the Company's country,) the debt or pretended debt aforesaid, asserted to be about five hundred thousand pounds, or thereabouts, could not be paid without contracting another debt at an usurious interest, without encroaching on the necessary establishments or on private property or on the pay of the army, or without grievous oppression of the country, or all these together. And it doth appear that one hundred thousand pounds towards the said payment of debts was borrowed at Calcutta by the Nabob's agent there, but at what interest is not known; it appears also that other sums were borrowed for arrear of the interest, on which forty thousand pounds sterling appears in the Company's claims for the current year, and that various deductions were made from the jaghires restored to the Begums, as well as other parts of the Nabob's family; and it did and doth appear that an arrear is still due to the old and new brigade,--but whether the same be growing or not doth not appear: yet he hath not hesitated to assert that he had [...] "provided for the complete discharge, in one year, of a debt contracted by the accumulation of many, and from a country whose resources have been wasted and dissipated by three successive years of drought and one of anarchy." [...] But the said Hastings never did even realize the payments {{to be made in the}} first year, (as he confesses in the said letter,) except by an anticipation of the second; and though he states in his letter aforesaid the following facts and engagements, that is to say, [...] "that a recovery of so large a part of your property [the Company's] will afford a seasonable and substantial relief to the necessities of your government, and enable it (for such is my confident hope) to begin on the reduction of your debt at interest before the conclusion of this year (I mean the year of this computation)." [...] Whereas the said Warren Hastings did apply the whole produce of the revenue to the mere pay of some part of the British army in Oude; and did not mention in his correspondence that he had remitted any money whatsoever to Calcutta, nor to any other place, (except the fifty thousand pounds taken from Almas Ali Kh√¢n, and said to be remitted to Surat,) for the said [...] "substantial relief," [...] in consequence of the said pretended [...] "recovery of property,"--admitting that it had been suggested to him, and not by him denied, that he had [...] "disappointed the popular expectation by not adopting the policy which he had, on the conception of better grounds, rejected; nor did he begin the reduction of the interest debt" [...] at the time stated, nor at any time; but the whole (he well knowing the state of the country from whence the resources aforesaid were by him promised) was a premeditated deceit and imposition on the Board of Council, his colleagues, and on the Court of Directors, his masters.|$|E

40|$|The rising {{availability}} of consumer loans causes {{an increase of}} debtors who aren't {{able to carry out}} all their monetary obligations. They get into financial problems which often end in several current executory proceedings. For debtors this situation is apparently hopeless and many of them try to solve it by using bridging loans. This leads to deepening of their personal financial crisis. The Insolvency Act No. 182 / 2006 Sb. which contains the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Debts</b> brings a solution for such debtors. <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Debts</b> as one <b>of</b> the ways <b>of</b> sanitation <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> in Czech law represents modern trends of European and American Insolvency law that joins the debtor back into the economic life. <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Debts</b> represents a possibility to solve the debtor's unbearable financial situation and to keep at least partially his living standards. For creditors it can be a way how to obtain at least part of their claims by the legal procedure.

40|$|The current {{regulation}} <b>of</b> the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> in the Czech Republic {{from the perspective}} of jurisprudence This thesis analyzes the institute <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts,</b> which was incorporated into our legal system relatively recently, effective as of 1 st January 2008, and soon became a very popular instrument for resolving the debtor's bankruptcy or impending bankruptcy. The importance of the jurisprudence in the area <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> is highlighted in this work. Although the jurisprudence is not the source of law in the Czech Republic, the decisions of insolvency courts are significantly influenced by that.

40|$|The federal {{bankruptcy}} system {{strikes a}} balance between the rights of debtors seeking a fresh start and the rights of creditors seeking repayment for debt. While many areas of the Bankruptcy Code provide examples of this balancing act, perhaps no area of the Code embodies this balance better than <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> provides the fresh start for debtors on which the bankruptcy system rests, but the Code also protects the interests of creditors who would otherwise have their claims against the debtor discharged. Section 523 (a) (6) excepts from discharge any debt ¬ìfor willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. ¬î Clearly, this section prohibits discharge for debts that result from a bad act of the debtor, and serves a punitive function by not allowing a debtor to use the bankruptcy system to avoid debts when the debtor acted wrongfully in incurring those debts.

40|$|A primary {{policy of}} {{bankruptcy}} law {{is to give}} consumer debtors a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù by discharging their debt. A rival policy is that the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> is a selectively conferred privilege that is not granted in some situations. For example, society is unwilling to pardon debt related to embezzlement or a domestic-support obligation. This ‚Äúdischarge restrictions‚Äù policy is manifested {{in part by the}} Bankruptcy Code‚Äôs exceptions to discharge. The U. S. Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the tension between the fresh start and discharge restriction policies. It has sought to achieve a fair balance between these policies by applying a ‚Äúplainly expressed‚Äù standard when interpreting exceptions to discharge. Surprisingly, the circuit courts have not followed the Supreme Court. Instead, nearly every circuit court has developed a practice of construing exceptions to discharge narrowly in favor of the debtor and against the creditor. This Article highlights this established practice and seeks to challenge it. In essence, the circuit courts have transformed the fresh start policy into a canon of construction when interpreting exceptions to discharge. This Article makes three contributions. First, it identifies and evaluates the circuit courts‚Äô use of the fresh start policy as a canon of construction. Second, it analyzes Supreme Court jurisprudence and finds an established pattern rejecting the fresh start canon when interpreting exceptions to discharge. Third, it explores the purpose and nature of exceptions to discharge and argues the fresh start canon is an unsuitable tool for interpreting them...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of consumer bankruptcy in Slovenian law. In the first part author analyses what are the social purposes and goals of this legal institution. This is done with assistance of the comparative legal method taking into account the relevant comparable legal regulations. In {{the second part of the}} article author presents the function of the consumer bankruptcy and <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> in Slovenian legal regulation. It is followed by the third part with an economic analysis of the debtor incentives for investment of a maximal effort to compensate creditors. This analysis shows how the maximal compensation is achieved in a system where there is no debt discharge and this is valid as far as the value of the debt does not reach a margin where the debtor has no more motivation for cooperation and he starts actively impeding the process of creditor‚Äôs compensation. In such situation the creditors repay from the existing debtor‚Äôs property only. Therefore it seems better to have a regulation where the debtor has an option to partially repay his debt and act adequately during a certain period of time, and then to have a discharge of the remaining debt which all give him a possibility for a fresh start. However, even in such situation we cannot expect debtor to invest his maximal effort in a partial compensation. It would therefore be more effective to have a solution where a clear and to debtor position adjusted sum of partial compensation would be set as a condition to achieve a debt discharge (similar as in Austrian regulation) ...|$|E
