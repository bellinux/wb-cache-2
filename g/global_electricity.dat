Copper motor rotors, a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives, are enabling general-purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency standards.|$|E

25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{documented}} how {{nuclear power plants}} generate 16% of <b>global</b> <b>electricity,</b> but provide only 6.3% of energy production and 2.6% of final energy consumption. This mismatch stems mainly from the poor consumption efficiency of electricity compared to other energy carriers, and the transmission losses associated with nuclear plants which are usually situated far away from sources of demand.|$|E
25|$|Competition from {{renewable}} energy sources {{may lead to the}} loss of value of fossil fuel companies due to their inability to compete commercially with the {{renewable energy}} sources. In some cases this has already happened. Deutsche Bank predicts that 80% of the <b>global</b> <b>electricity</b> market will have reached grid parity for solar electricity generation by the end of 2017.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} <b>global</b> atmospheric <b>electricity</b> {{used to examine the}} effect of upper atmospheric generators on the global electrical circuit. The model represents thunderstorms as dipole current generators randomly distributed in areas of known thunderstorm frequency; the electrical conductivity in the model increases with altitude, and electrical effects are coupled with a passive magnetosphere along geomagnetic field lines. The large horizontal-scale potential differences at ionospheric heights map downward into the lower atmosphere where the perturbations in the ground electric field are superimposed on the diurnal variation. Finally, changes in the upper atmospheric conductivity due to solar flares, polar cap absorptions, and Forbush decreases are shown to alter the downward mapping of the high-latitude potential pattern and the global distribution of fields and currents...|$|R

25|$|Coal can {{be found}} in {{abundance}} in the USA and many other countries and its price has remained relatively constant in recent years. Of the traditional fossil fuels - oil, coal, and natural gas - coal is used as a feedstock for 40% of <b>global</b> <b>electricity</b> generation. Fossil fuel consumption and its contribution to large-scale, detrimental environmental changes is becoming a pressing issue, {{especially in light of the}} Paris Agreement. In particular, coal contains more CO2 per BTU than oil or natural gas and is responsible for 43% of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. Thus, the lower emissions that IGCC technology allows through gasification and pre-combustion carbon capture is discussed as a way to addressing aforementioned concerns.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{deployment}} of other energy sources, coal and biomass use is increasing worldwide {{to meet the}} rising <b>global</b> demand for <b>electricity.</b> <b>Global</b> fluctuations in coal price and logistic uncertainties in coal supply mean that many power stations are burning a diverse range of coals (indigenous and imported) and the type and quality of coal being fired at any moment is often unknown for various practical reasons. Although biomass {{can be used to}} generate energy in different ways, co-firing with coal at existing power stations or 100 % biomass firing at converted or new power stations remains a practical option available to power plant operators, and is widely adopted as one of the main technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power generation. Biomass originates from a diverse range of sources {{in a wide variety of}} forms. In general, biomass has a higher moisture content and higher volatile matter than coal, but its density and calorific value are lower than coal. The inherent differences between biomass and coal and the unknown changes in the type and quality of coals and fluctuations in electricity demand have posed significant challenges to the power generation industry. Instrumentation and measurement techniques have an important part to play in tackling these challenges...|$|R
40|$|Layer {{clouds are}} {{globally}} extensive. Their lower edges are charged negatively by the fair weather atmospheric electricity current flowing vertically through them. Using polar winter surface meteorological data from Sodankyla ̈ (Finland) and Halley (Antarctica), {{we find that}} when meteorological diurnal variations are weak, an appreciable diurnal cycle, on average, persists in the cloud base heights, detected using a laser ceilometer. The diurnal cloud base heights from both sites correlate more closely with the Carnegie curve of <b>global</b> atmospheric <b>electricity</b> than with local meteorological measurements. The cloud base sensitivities are indistinguishable between {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres, averaging a (4. 0 ± 0. 5) m rise for a 1 % change in the fair weather electric current density.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} a fossil fuel tax and research subsidy in directing innovation from fossil fuel toward renewable energy technologies in the electricity sector. Using a <b>global</b> firm-level <b>electricity</b> patent database from 1978 to 2011, we find that the impact of fossil fuel taxes on renewable energy innovation varies with the type of fossil fuel. Specifically, a tax on coal reduces innovation in both fossil fuel and renewable energy technologies while a tax on natural gas has no statistically significant impact on renewable energy innovation. The reason is that easily dispatchable energy sources like coal-fired power plants need to complement renewable energy technologies in the grid because renewables generate electricity intermittently. Our results suggest that a tax on natural gas, combined with research subsidies for renewable energy, may effectively shift innovation in the electricity sector towards renewable energy. In contrast, coal taxation or a carbon tax that increases coal prices has unintended negative consequences for renewable energy innovation...|$|R

In addition to the three aspects of promoting access, renewables, and efficiency, the dimension of resilience in energy systems should also considered.

To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigate the resilience of global energy systems through an examination of diversity measure of <b>global</b> embodied <b>electricity</b> trade based on multi-regional input-output (MRIO) networks. The significance of this reserch lies in its ability to utilize high resolution MRIO data sets in assessing the resilience of national energy systems.
