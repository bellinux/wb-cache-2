5000|$|A <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> test or [...] "high potential" [...] or [...] "hipot" [...] test is an {{electrical}} test performed on a component or product {{to determine the}} effectiveness of its insulation. The test may be between mutually insulated sections of a part or energized parts and electrical ground. The test is a means to qualify a device's ability to operate safely during rated electrical conditions. If current through a device under test {{is less than a}} specified limit at the required test potential and time duration, the device meets the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> requirement. A <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> test may be done as a factory test on new equipment, or may be done on apparatus in service as a routine maintenance test.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dielectric</b> <b>Withstand</b> Test. A {{standard}} test voltage is applied (below the established Breakdown Voltage) {{and the resulting}} leakage current is monitored. The leakage current must be below a preset limit or the test is considered to have failed. This test is non-destructive providing {{that it does not}} fail and is usually required by safety agencies to be performed as a 100% production line test on all products before they leave the factory.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to over-stressing the insulation, the test {{can also be}} performed to detect material and workmanship defects, most importantly small gap spacings between current-carrying conductors and earth ground. When a product is operated under normal conditions, environmental factors such as humidity, dirt, vibration, shock and contaminants can close these small gaps and allow current to flow. This condition can create a shock hazard if the defects are not corrected at the factory. No other test can uncover this type of defect {{as well as the}} <b>Dielectric</b> <b>Withstand</b> test.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the thermal protection system, field joint protection system, and systems tunnel components of Flight Set 360 L 006, are documented, as evaluated by postflight hardware inspection. The condition of both motors was similar to previous flights. Sixteen aft edge hits were noted on the ground environment instrumentation thermal protection system. Each hit left a clean substrate, indicating that the damage was caused by nozzle severance debris and/or water impact. No National Space and Transporation System debris criteria for missing thermal protection system were violated. One 5. 0 by 1. 0 in. unbond was observed on the left hand center field joint K 5 NA closeout and was elevated to an in-flight anomaly (STS- 34 -M- 4) by the NASA Ice/Debris team. Aft edge damage to the K 5 NA and an associated black streak indicate that burning debris from the nozzle severance system was the likely cause of the damage. Minor divots caused by debris were seen on previous flights, {{but this is the}} first occurrence of a K 5 NA unbond. Since the unbond occurred after booster separation there is no impact on flight safety and no corrective actions was taken. The right hand center field joint primary heater failed the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstanding</b> voltage test after joint closeout. The heater was then disabled by opening the circuit breaker, and the redundant heater was used. The redundant heater performed nominally during the launch countdown. A similar condition occurred on Flight 4 when a secondary joint heater failed the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstanding</b> voltage test...|$|R
40|$|Circuit-breakers (CBs) {{are subject}} to {{electrical}} stresses with restrikes during capacitor bank operation. Stresses are caused by the overvoltages across CBs, the interrupting currents {{and the rate of}} rise of recovery voltage (RRRV). Such electrical stresses also depend on the types of system grounding and the types of dielectric strength curves. The aim {{of this study is to}} demonstrate a restrike waveform predictive model for a SF 6 CB that considered the types of system grounding: grounded and non-grounded and the computation accuracy comparison on the application of the cold <b>withstand</b> <b>dielectric</b> strength and the hot recovery dielectric strength curve including the POW (point-on-wave) recommendations to make an assessment of increasing the CB remaining life. The simulation of SF 6 CB stresses in a typical 400 kV system was undertaken and the results in the applications are presented. The simulated restrike waveforms produced with the identified features using wavelet transform can be used for restrike diagnostic algorithm development with wavelet transform to locate a substation with breaker restrikes. This study found that the hot <b>withstand</b> <b>dielectric</b> strength curve has less magnitude than the cold <b>withstand</b> <b>dielectric</b> strength curve for restrike simulation results. Computation accuracy improved with the hot <b>withstand</b> <b>dielectric</b> strength and POW controlled switching can increase the life for a SF 6 CB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In this paper, we {{describe}} the analysis of inkjet-printed silver (Ag) patterns on epoxy-coated substrates according to several reliability evaluation test method guidelines for conventional printed circuit boards (PCB). To prepare patterns for the reliability analysis, various regular test patterns were created by Ag inkjet printing on flame retardant 4 (FR 4) and polyimide (PI) substrates coated with epoxy for each test method. We coated the substrates with an epoxy primer layer to control the surface energy during printing of the patterns. The contact angle of the ink to the coated epoxy primer was 69 o, and its surface energy was 18. 6 mJ/m 2. Also, the substrate temperature was set at 70 oC. We were able to obtain continuous line patterns by inkjet printing with a droplet spacing of 60 ㎛. The reliability evaluation tests included the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstanding</b> voltage, adhesive strength, thermal shock, pressure cooker, bending, uniformity of line-width and spacing, and high-frequency transmission loss tests...|$|R

Several tests (visual inspection, maximum power determination, <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand,</b> wet leakage current, and electroluminescence test) were carried out on 31 PV modules located in a PV plant in Italy. The electroluminescence test highlighted the strong correlation between the appearance of snail trails and presence of damaged cells in PV modules.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an experimental program to determine the aging and loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) behavior of electrical connections in order to obtain an initial scoping of their performance. Ten types of connections commonly used in nuclear power plants were tested. These included 3 types of conduit seals, 2 types of cable-to-device connectors, 3 types of cable-to-cable connectors, and 2 types of in-line splices. The connections were aged for 6 months under simultaneous thermal (99 C) and radiation (46 Gy/hr) conditions. A simulated LOCA consisting of sequential high dose-rate irradiation (3 kGy/hr) and high-temperature steam exposures followed the aging. Connection functionality was monitored using insulation resistance measurements during the aging and LOCA exposures. Because only 5 of the 10 connection types passed a post-LOCA, submerged <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> test, further detailed investigation of electrical connections and the effects of cable jacket integrity on the cable-connection system is warranted...|$|E
30|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), showing extreme {{inertness}} {{characteristics and}} excellent chemical stability, {{has been widely}} used as an electrical-insulating medium in gas-insulated switchgears (GIS) [1, 2]. However, moisture in GIS, particularly in the liquid phase, seriously affects its <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> strength. Thus, it shall be maintained under a level {{so that it does}} not condense into liquid at any expected operating temperatures. Additionally, when the partial discharge occurs caused by the internal insulation defects, SF 6 would decompose into SF 5, SF 4, SF 3, SF 2, S 2 F 10, and other low-fluoride sulfides [3, 4]. And the excessive moisture in the enclosed equipment could accelerate the further reaction of these decomposition products to corrosive gases like SO 2, SO 2 F 2, and HF. Hence, to avoid the potential to endanger the safe operation of equipment, a lot of efforts have been made to detect and control moisture content in SF 6 gas [5 – 7].|$|E

40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} (MLCCs) {{exposed to}} high voltages, around 1000 VDC in air, {{are prone to}} both surface-arcover and internal breakdown. In either event failures will result at the instance of surface-arc-over as the circuit is destabilized which may cause damage to surrounding components even if the capacitor remains temporarily functional. The performance of HVArc Guard TM X 7 R capacitors, that prohibit arc-over occurrence, is compared to conventional MLCC designs using a <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstanding</b> tester, surface acoustic microscopy and high speed photography. The high speed camera fixture developed allows the failure occurrence on applying DC voltage to be closely examined. By coupling this with post examination of voltage failures in cross-sections, {{the root cause of}} failures is determined on a case-by-case basis. Cross-section analysis of failures without the benefit of direct observation of the failure event cannot always determine the root cause because of extensive damage and destruction to the components. At higher ramp rates of 3000 VDC/second the mechanism of failure for HVArc Guard TM capacitors is internal breakdown not surface-arc-over that is observed in conventional MLCCs. In addition to the above voltage breakdown tests a series of AC Voltage and surge voltage tests on HVArc Guard TM X 7 R and C 0 G (NP 0) capacitors are described. These differences in performance are reviewed and the relevance to applications discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} two phase {{program is}} to develop the {{technology}} and design and fabricate ultralightweight high reliability DC to DC converters for space power applications. The converters will operate from a 5000 V dc source and deliver 1 MW of power at 100 kV dc. The power weight density goal is 0. 1 kg/kW. The cycle to cycle voltage stability goals was + or - 1 percent RMS. The converter is to operate at an ambient temperature of - 40 C with 16 minute power pulses and one hour off time. The uniqueness of the design in Phase 1 resided in the dc switching array which operates the converter at 20 kHz using Hollotron plasma switches along with a specially designed low loss, low leakage inductance and a light weight high voltage transformer. This approach reduced considerably the number of components in the converter thereby increasing the system reliability. To achieve an optimum transformer for this application, the design uses four 25 kV secondary windings to produce the 100 kV dc output, thus reducing the transformer leakage inductance, and the ac voltage stresses. A specially designed insulation system improves the high voltage <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstanding</b> ability and reduces the insulation path thickness thereby reducing the component weight. Tradeoff studies and tests conducted on scaled-down model circuits and using representative coil insulation paths have verified the calculated transformer wave shape parameters and the insulation system safety. In Phase 1 of the program a converter design approach was developed and a preliminary transformer design was completed. A fault control circuit was designed and a thermal profile of the converter was also developed...|$|R
40|$|Various prototypes {{designs of}} 36 kV vacuum interrupters {{have been tested}} in {{high-power}} test station during capacitive switching operations. Back-to-back tests were performed for inrush current of 20 kA peak level and 4250 Hz frequency. Experiment was performed {{with a number of}} prototype vacuum interrupters of different geometry and contact material. Vacuum gap behavior under pre-arcing and inrush current conditions (pre-arc energy, duration and interruption of inrush current) will be highlighted. Field electron emission measurement has been used to monitor field electron emission current that flows in vacuum gaps after current interruption. Statistics will be presented in relation to the late breakdown events, field electron emission current measurement, vacuum interrupters design and contact material. It was observed that only the mechanism of electron field emission alone could not explain the breakdown in vacuum at the origin of late breakdown phenomena. Contact material, vacuum interrupter design as well as circuit breaker characteristics are determining the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> during capacitor bank switching operations...|$|E
40|$|Transmission System Operators (TSO's) {{are facing}} an {{increase}} of fault current levels in their networks due {{to the expansion of}} generation capacity. This thesis investigates three possible fault current limiting measures in the Dutch transmission grid which is operated and maintained by TenneT TSO. In order to evaluate the behavior of the fault current limiting measures, two independently operating grid models were established and validated. The examined fault current limiters consisted of a current limiting reactor (CLR) and a superconducting fault current limiter (SCFCL). The possibility of substation splitting was also investigated. All three measures reduced the short-circuit levels successfully to values within the electromechanical and thermal withstand levels of the power system. Simulation results revealed that the SCFCL has a significantly lower impact on the rate-of-rise-of-recovery-voltage (RRRV) of the circuit breaker (CB) as compared to the CLR. Additional measures were presented to keep the RRRV of the CLR within the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> levels of the CB as specified in the IEC 62271 - 100.

40|$|Electrical {{switchgear}} industry {{dealing with}} {{transmission and distribution}} of power is strongly affected by the changing dynamics of climate control. Their main contribution to the global warming is through SF 6 gas, having a GWP of 23500 (times of CO 2). SF 6 {{plays an important role}} in providing electrical insulation for these high voltage systems. So, there is a need to find an alternative ‘green’ insulation system. The search is hindered because of lack of design criteria for <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> in highly inhomogeneous fields, as seen typically in gas- insulated switchgears (GIS). This needs a physical understanding of charge transport and dynamics under such electric fields. Additionally, the replacement gases are characterized by lower <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> performance and hence needs solid insulation together with gaseous insulation to enhance the electrical properties. This raises a need to develop combined gas-solid physical framework for charge transport and interaction in such systems. This includes initiation and propagation of electrical discharges in gas phase, interactions of produced gas discharge plasma with solid dielectric surfaces, charge transport though solid material, etc. The thesis focuses on developing a numerical simulation framework of discharge initiation and propagation, incorporating various charge generation processes for different insulation systems under highly inhomogeneous electric fields. The mathematical model of non-thermal electrical discharges in the present thesis is composed of a set of time dependent highly non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) describing charge transport by drift and diffusion under the influence of electric field incorporating various reactions (electron impact ionization, electron attachment, recombination, etc.). The reaction rate coefficients are calculated by two term Boltzmann approximation of electron energy distribution function. Another coupled set of PDEs for radiative transport process (photoionization), provides additional reaction sources. Solid insulation modelling includes additional PDEs for electron and hole transport inside the solid insulation. Charge injection from gaseous medium together with charge accumulation at the solid-gas interface is accounted for. The PDEs are solved by custom finite element logarithmic weak formulation with Petrov- Galerkin stabilization. This method is implemented in commercial code (COMSOL- Mathematical module). Adaptive mesh refinement techniques are used to speed up the calculation time. The developed method is validated against reference experimental data (nanosecond resolved) and published cases. Later, non-axial discharges, 3 d branching, hybrid insulation study cases are presented...|$|E
30|$|Although many {{results have}} been {{reported}} on trapping ions with MEMS-fabricated traps, the process details to fabricate the trap chips are very scarce in the literature. Fabricating ion traps requires thick <b>dielectric</b> films to <b>withstand</b> several hundred volts of RF voltages.

The actual transmitter is usually located in a separate building, which supplies RF power to the helix building via a transmission line.|$|R
40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{technical and}} economical importance of power transformers in the electrical {{transmission and distribution}} networks {{does not need to}} be discussed. The continuous awareness of the evolution of the conditions of the insulation system and of the internal mechanical sturdiness is of great value for the system operator as it allows to optimise the lifecycle management of the machine as well as the scheduling of the maintenance operations. Power transformers are designed to <b>withstand</b> <b>dielectric</b> stresses linked with the operating voltage and overvoltages as calculated in the insulation coordination process, thermal stresses linked with their loading guide and electrodynamical stresses linked with external short-circuits. Internal displacements or damages may be generated during the transportation of the machines if the internal mechanical structure of the windings and core are not correctly tight together. When a transformer has undergone abnormal stresses, it is necessary to check its response to the stresses and consequently its conditions, to be aware of its residual ability to withstand further abnormal forces. The Sweep Frequency Response Analysis method (SFRA) has been found to be adequate for the evaluation of possible displacements and deformation of the windings as well as for the pointing out of short circuits among coils. Furthermore, the level of humidity in the paper-oil insulation system may cause a premature ageing and, in presence of abrupt variation of the temperature, formation of bubbles leading to potential internal discharge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} testing of novel, environmentally friendly, 138 kV and 345 kV optical voltage transducers (OVTs) for metering and protection relaying applications in high-voltage electric power transmission systems. Each OVT uses three miniature optical electric field sensors housed inside a resistive shield. The locations of the electric field sensors, the electrical and geometrical parameters of the resistive shield, and the formula for deriving voltage from the electric field measurements are all chosen using the quadrature method to achieve very accurate voltage measurements. The resistive shield is, in turn, housed inside a hollow composite insulator filled with low-pressure dry nitrogen. Conventional accuracy and <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> tests demonstrate that the OVTs meet IEC 60044 - 7 0. 2 and IEEE/ANSI C 57. 13 0. 3 accuracy class standards and insulation requirements.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} a {{comparative}} study of statistical Breakdown Voltage (BDV) in mineral oils, natural esters (vegetable oils) issued from different origins, and one synthetic ester through the measurements of 32 BDV using spherical electrode under AC voltage according to main lines of IEC 60156 specifications. The Normal and Weibull distribution functions are used to analyze and estimate the BDV probability of these oils. The hypothesis testing is then used to select the distribution functions suitability. We mainly analyze the histogram, frequency, mean, standard deviation and estimate the BDV probability of the sample population. The considered liquids are three different mineral oils (MO 3 ', MO 4 ' and MO 5), one synthetic ester (SE 1) and three different natural esters (VO 2, VO 3 and VO 4). It's shown that the measured BDV data follow better Normal than Weibull distribution. Basing on the BDV at the levels of risk 1 %, 10 % and 50 % probability for U 1 %, U 10 % and U 50 %, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> of ester oils, under AC, homogeneous field and small gap, is slightly better compared to mineral oils.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} locating small breaches in insulation on electrical wires combines {{aspects of the}} prior <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> voltage (DWV) and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) methods. The method was invented to satisfy a need for reliably and quickly locating insulation defects in spacecraft, aircraft, ships, and other complex systems that contain large amounts of wiring, much of it enclosed in structures that {{make it difficult to}} inspect. In the DWV method, one applies a predetermined potential (usually 1. 5 kV DC) to the wiring and notes whether the voltage causes any arcing between the wiring and ground. The DWV method does not provide an indication of the location of the defect (unless, in an exceptional case, the arc happens to be visible). In addition, if there is no electrically conductive component at ground potential within about 0. 010 in. (approximately equal to 0. 254 mm) of the wire at the location of an insulation defect, then the DWV method does not provide an indication of the defect. Moreover, one does not have the option to raise the potential in an effort to increase the detectability of such a defect because doing so can harm previously undamaged insulation. In the TDR method as practiced heretofore, one applies a pulse of electricity having an amplitude of less than 25 V to a wire and measures the round-trip travel time for the reflection of the pulse from a defect. The distance along the wire from the point of application of the pulse to the defect is then calculated as the product of half the round-trip travel time and the characteristic speed of a propagation of an electromagnetic signal in the wire. While the TDR method as practiced heretofore can be used to locate a short or open circuit, it does not ordinarily enable one to locate a small breach in insulation because the pulse voltage is too low to cause arcing and thus too low to induce an impedance discontinuity large enough to generate a measurable reflection. The present improved method overcomes the weaknesses of both the prior DWV and the prior TDR method...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{comparative}} study of AC and DC breakdown voltages of based mineral oil mixtures with natural and synthetic esters mainly used in high voltage power transformers. The goal was to analyze the performances of oil mixtures from the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> {{point of view and}} to predict the behavior of transformers originally filled with mineral oil and re-filled with synthetic or natural ester oils when emptied for maintenance. The study concerns mixtures based on 20 %, 50 %, and 80 % of natural and synthetic ester oils. AC breakdown voltages were measured using a sphere-sphere electrode system according to IEC 60156 specifications; the same specification was adopted for DC measurements since there is no standard specifications for this voltage waveform. A statistical analysis of the mean values, standard deviations, and histograms of breakdown voltage data was carried out. The Normal and Weibull distribution functions were used to analyze the experimental data and the best function that the data followed was used to estimate the breakdown voltage with risk of 1 %, 10 %, and 50 % probability. It was shown that whatever the applied voltage waveforms, ester oils always have a significantly higher breakdown voltage than mineral oil. The addition of only 20 % of natural or synthetic ester oil was sufficient to considerably increase the breakdown voltage of mineral oil. The dielectric strength of such a mixture is much higher than that of mineral oil alone and can reach that of ester oils. From {{the point of view of}} dielectric strength, the mixtures constitute an option for improving the performance of mineral oil. Thus, re-filling of transformers containing up to 20 % mineral oil residues with ester oils, does not present any problem; it is even advantageous when considering only the breakdown voltage. Under AC, the mixtures with natural ester always follow the behavior of vegetable oil alone. With the exception of the 20 % mixture of natural ester in DC, the breakdown voltage values of all the tested mixtures were in accordance with the normal distribution, which made it possible to define the breakdown voltages for the risk levels of 1 %, 10 %, and 50 % of probability...|$|E
40|$|Capacitor {{banks are}} {{installed}} in {{an increasing number}} {{in order to control}} power quality issues in the transmission and distribution networks. Due to load fluctuation, switching of capacitor banks is normally a daily operation. Although the current to be switched (e. g. the normal load current) is far below the maximum capability of circuit breakers, the transient current upon making (the so-called inrush current) {{has proven to be a}} major challenge for circuit breakers. The often very high value of (inrush) current flowing during the closing (pre-) arc between breaker contacts is potentially harmful for the contact system. The IEC circuit breaker 62271 - 100 standard specifies 20 kA peak while energizing (an) additional bank(s) to those already energized, the so-called back-to-back configuration. It will be demonstrated that three-phase energization with full inrush current cannot be reliably performed in test-circuits. Statistics will be presented on the number of (transmission, distribution) circuit breakers that were tested for this duty. The probability of a late breakdown in vacuum, after energization with inrush current, is rising with rated voltage. Absence of late breakdown of vacuum interrupters after capacitive current switching is especially challenging at higher voltage levels, and is a main barrier to develop vacuum interrupters for transmission voltages having very low probability of re-strike. It was observed that in SF 6 circuit breakers, the very intense pre-arc can damage the nozzle, whereas in vacuum circuit breakers, the inrush current arc may deteriorate the <b>dielectric</b> <b>withstand</b> of the switching gap, sometime leading to (late) breakdown after load current interruption. A new measurement method is described to monitor the field electron emission (FEE) current that flows in a pulsating manner in vacuum gaps after current interruption. This measurement system is able to deal (and measure) currents varying as wide as nine decades, from full breakdown currents of several tens of kA to FEE currents of tens of µA). Research tests in full-power test-circuits (following the IEC standard) with a number of prototype vacuum interrupters of different geometry and contact material show a very large range (from micro-amperes to milli-amperes) of current during recovery voltage after load current interruption. It was observed that the load current at longer arcing times reduces the electrical emission activity of the contact surfaces. Large inrush current increases the FEE current. No relationship between steady state FEE current intensity and breakdown probability could be established...|$|E
