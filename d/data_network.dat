25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in blister packaging. It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an electronic module. The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC smart phone or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable <b>data</b> <b>network</b> is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, handheld device, tablet or smart watch via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver.

40|$|Abstract â€” The rapidly {{emerging}} mobile <b>data</b> <b>networks</b> {{fueled by}} the world-wide deployment of 3 G, HSPA, and LTE networks created new challenges {{for the development of}} Internet applications. Unlike their wired counterpart, mobile <b>data</b> <b>networks</b> are known to exhibit highly variable bandwidth. Moreover, base stations are often equipped with large buffers to absorb bandwidth fluctuations to prevent unnecessary packet losses. However these two factors together invalidate the assumptions used in conventional protocol designs, which routers are assumed to have fixed link capacity and a small buffer. Consequently to optimize protocol performance in mobile <b>data</b> <b>networks</b> it is essential to be able to accurately characterize the network properties such as bottleneck link buffer size. This work tackles the challenge in estimating link buffer size in modern mobile <b>data</b> <b>networks.</b> Using extensive trace-driven simulations based on actual bandwidth trace data measured from production mobile <b>data</b> <b>networks,</b> we show that existing link buffer size estimation algorithms such as max-min and loss-pair no longer work well in bandwidth-varying networks. We develop a novel sum-of-delays algorithm to tackle this challenge. Simulation results show that it can accurately estimate the link buffer size under both fixed and varying bandwidth conditions, outperforming the existing algorithms by multiple orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|In CDMA packet <b>data</b> <b>networks,</b> the {{throughput}} {{depends on}} physical-layer receiver algorithms and {{medium access control}} (MAC) layer protocols. Taking a holistic approach, we investigate the through-put of a CDMA network employing linear multiuser detection, type-I ARQ and packet combining. In particular, the following two models of CDMA <b>data</b> <b>networks</b> are considered: (1) Fixed-access CDMA <b>data</b> <b>networks,</b> by which we mean {{that the number of}} active users is fixed. The corresponding through-put is analyzed by using a one-dimensional Markov chain, and conditions for achieving the optimal throughput are explored. (2) Random-access CDMA <b>data</b> <b>networks,</b> in which we take into account the random arrivals/departures of users. By viewing the fixed-access network studied in the first case as a snapshot of the random-access network, we exploit the results therein to analyze the random-access network, under a processor-sharing system model. Moreover, we identify some important properties of the corresponding throughput and devise a simple recursive algorithm to find the throughput-optimal admission region. Some recent advances on large-system performance of various multiuser detection algo-rithms are employed in our study. The results in this paper quantitatively characterize the potential for network throughput gain by employing multiuser detection and packet combining, in both fixed-access and random-access CDMA packet <b>data</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
