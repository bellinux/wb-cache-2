40|$|Objective. Degenerative <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>tendons</b> {{present an}} {{enormous}} clinical challenge. They are extremely common, prone to recur and existing medical and surgical treatments are generally unsatisfactory. Recently eccentric, but not concentric, exercises {{have been shown}} to be highly effective in managing tendinopathy of the Achilles (and other) tendons. The mechanism for the efficacy of these exercises is unknown although it has been speculated that forces generated during eccentric loading are of a greater magnitude. Our objective was to determine the mechanism for the beneficial effect of eccentric exercise in Achilles tendinopathy. Methods. Seven healthy volunteers performed eccentric and concentric loading exercises for the Achilles tendon. Tendon force and length changes were determined using a combination of motion analysis, force plate data and real-time ultrasound. Results. There was no significant difference in peak tendon force or tendon length change when comparing eccentric with concentric exercises. However, high-frequency oscillations in tendon force occurred in all subjects during eccentric exercises but were rare in concentric exercises (...|$|E
40|$|Overuse <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>tendons,</b> or tendinopathies, {{present a}} {{challenge}} to sports physicians, surgeons, {{and other health care}} professionals dealing with athletes. The Achilles, patellar, and supraspinatus tendons are particularly vulnerable to injury and often difficult to manage successfully. Inflammation was believed central to the pathologic process, but histopathologic evidence has confirmed the failed healing response nature of these conditions. Excessive or inappropriate loading of the musculotendinous unit is believed to be central to the disease process, although the exact mechanism by which this occurs remains uncertain. Additionally, the location of the lesion (for example, the midtendon or osteotendinous junction) has become increasingly recognized as influencing both the pathologic process and subsequent management. The mechanical, vascular, neural, and other theories that seek to explain the pathologic process are explored in this article. Recent developments in the nonoperative management of chronic tendon disorders are reviewed, as is the rationale for surgical intervention. Recent surgical advances, including minimally invasive tendon surgery, are reviewed. Potential future management strategies, such as stem cell therapy, growth factor treatment, and gene transfer, are also discussed. <br /...|$|E

A num-ber of surgical techniques have been described for treating chronic degen-erative Achilles tendinosis. This is the largest reported series evaluating a method of transferring the flexor hallu-cis longus (FHL) tendon and securing it with an Arthrex interference screw into the calcaneus.

Understanding tenocyte differentiation may provide new therapeutic insights for the prevention and treatment of chronic tendinopathy. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} if CTGF exerts a similar effect on BMP 12 -driven differentiation of rat TSCs. Methods: In overexpressing and RNA interference CTGF TSCs, tenogenic differentitation and the expression of related genes were determined by immunofluorescence staining, quantitative PCR, and western blotting, with or without BMP 12 treatment. The interaction in vitro between CTGF and BMP 12 was detected by Chemical crosslinking assay. Results: Our results showed that BMP 12 effectively increased the expression of the tenocyte lineage markers scleraxis (Scx) and tenomodulin (Tnmd) at both mRNA and protein levels. Over-expression of CTGF from a lentiviral vector increased the expression of Scx and Tnmd as well as tendon proteins type I collagen (ColI) and tenascin-C (Tn-C) in TSCs compared to non-treated control cells with or without simultaneous BMP 12 stimulation. Knockdown of CTGF expression decreased the expression of Scx, Tnmd, ColI and Tn-C compared to control cells. Chemical crosslinking experiments demonstrated a direct interaction between CTGF and BMP 12.

The MSD symptoms of each patient were assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) and neck disability index (NDI). Blood samples were collected from control subjects and MSD patients before and after treatment. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were measured using ELISA. Results. Prior to MSN treatment, serum levels of CRP and TNF were significantly higher in the MSD patients than the healthy controls. Serum CRP levels correlated with VAS and NDI scores, and serum TNF levels correlated with NDI scores. Compared to pretreatment, VAS and NDI scores were significantly lower in MSD patients after MSN treatment, while serum CRP and TNF levels were significantly lower compared with the healthy control levels.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Disorders</b> <b>of</b> the Achilles <b>tendon</b> can be broadly {{classified}} into acute and chronic entities. Few studies have established chronic Achilles tendinopathy as {{a precursor to}} acute Achilles ruptures. In this study, we assessed the relationship between Achilles tendinopathy and rupture, clarifying the incidence of rupture {{in the setting of}} underlying tendinopathy. Methods. The United Healthcare Orthopedic Dataset from the PearlDiver Patient Record Database was used to identify patients with ICD- 9 codes for Achilles rupture and/or Achilles tendinopathy. The number of patients with acute rupture, chronic tendinopathy, and rupture following a prior diagnosis of tendinopathy was assessed. Results. Four percent of patients with an underlying diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy went on to sustain a rupture (7, 232 patients). Older patients with tendinopathy were most vulnerable to subsequent rupture. Conclusions. The current study demonstrates that 4. 0 % of patients who were previously diagnosed with Achilles tendinopathy sustained an Achilles tendon rupture. Additionally, older patients with Achilles tendinopathy were most vulnerable. These findings are important as they can help clinicians more objectively council patients with Achilles tendinopathy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) due to {{repetitive work}} {{are common in}} manufacturing industries, such as the automotive industry. However, it's still unclear which MSDs of the upper limb {{are to be expected}} in the automotive industry in a first aid unit as well as in occupational precaution examinations. It is also unclear which examination method could be performed effectively for practical reasons and under rehabilitation aspects. Additionally, it was to discuss whether the conception of unspecific description for MSDs has advantages or disadvantages in contrast to a precise medical diagnosis. Methods We investigated the health status of two study populations working at two automotive plants in Germany. The first part included 67 consecutive patients who were seen for acute or chronic MSDs at the forearm over a 4 -month period at the plants' medical services. Information about patients' working conditions and musculoskeletal symptoms was obtained during a standardized interview, which was followed by a standardized orthopedic-chiropractic physical examination. In the second part, 209 workers with daily exposure to video display terminals (VDT) completed a standardized questionnaire and were examined with function-oriented muscular tests on the occasion of their routine occupational precaution medical check-up. Results The majority of the 67 patients seen by the company's medical services were blue-collar works from the assembly lines and trainees rather than white-collar workers from offices. Rates of musculoskeletal complaints were disproportionately higher among experienced people performing new tasks and younger trainees. The most common MSD in this group were <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> flexor <b>tendons</b> <b>of</b> the forearm. By contrast, among the 209 employees working at VDT <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> the neck and shoulders were more common than discomfort in the forearm. A positive tendency between restricted rotation of the cervical vertebrae and years worked at VDT was observed. In addition, only less than 8 % <b>of</b> unspecific <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> the upper limb (esp. wrist and forearm) were found. Conclusions Functional tests for the upper limb seemed to be very helpful to give precise medical advice to the employees to prevent individual complaints. The results are also helpful for developing specific training programs before beginning new tasks as well as for rehabilitation reasons. There's no need to use uncertain terminology (such as RSI) as it may not be representative of the actual underlying disorders as diagnosed by more thorough physical examinations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tendons connect {{muscles to}} bones, {{and serve as}} the {{transmitters}} of force that allow all {{the movements of the}} body.

40|$|Tendon {{disorders}} are frequent, and {{are responsible for}} much morbidity both in sport and the workplace. Although the presence of degenerative changes does not always lead to symptoms, pre-existing degeneration has been implicated as {{a risk factor for}} acute tendon rupture. The term tendinopathy is a generic descriptor of the clinical conditions in and around tendons arising from overuse. The terms "tendinosis" and "tendinitis/tendonitis" should only be used after histopathological examination. Disordered healing is seen in tendinopathy, and inflammation is not typically seen. In acute injuries, the process <b>of</b> <b>tendon</b> healing is an indivisible process that can be categorized into three overlapping phases for descriptive purposes. Tendon healing can occur intrinsically, via proliferation of epitenon and endotenon tenocytes, or extrinsically, by invasion of cells from the surrounding sheath and synovium. Despite remodeling, the biochemical and mechanical properties <b>of</b> healed <b>tendon</b> tissue never match those <b>of</b> intact <b>tendon.</b> Tendon injuries account for considerable morbidity, and often prove disabling for several months, despite what is considered appropriate management.
