5|$|The tooth is {{recurved}} with {{a backward}} bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its {{front and back}} cutting edges are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per millimeter (0.04in), and each <b>denticle</b> is square and chiseled. The overall form of the tooth, its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla (upper jawbone) and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to Dromaeosaurus, and differing {{from members of the}} Velociraptorinae subfamily. Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that the cutting edge at the front side is further {{from the middle of the}} tooth. Although the tooth is larger and the denticles similar, each <b>denticle</b> was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus, which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of Dromaeosauroides 30. The second known tooth is smaller——with the same features as the holotype.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has <b>denticle</b> serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each <b>denticle</b> has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.|$|E
50|$|The radular {{structure}} of Leptoxis compacta {{is described as}} including a rachidian tooth with a widely convex basal margin and a blunt central cusp flanked by four to five <b>denticles,</b> with the outermost being weakly developed in most cases. The lateral tooth contains one larger rectangular central cusp that is flanked by four to five outer <b>denticles</b> and three to four inner <b>denticles.</b> The inner marginal teeth contain 10 to 12 <b>denticles,</b> and the outer marginal teeth have 12 to 16 <b>denticles.</b> The outer <b>denticles</b> are often weakly developed.|$|R

25|$|The skin {{is thick}} and densely covered by small, overlapping, well-calcified dermal denticles; each <b>denticle</b> has a leaf-shaped crown with a {{horizontal}} ridge and three teeth on the posterior margin. There is a prominent, saw-like crest of enlarged denticles along the dorsal {{margin of the}} caudal fin. G. murinus and G. springeri also have a similar crest along the ventral margin of the caudal fin. Galeus species are typically grayish or brownish above and lighter below, and most have a pattern of darker saddles and/or blotches along the back and tail. The interior of the mouth may be light or dark.|$|E
25|$|Stenonychosaurus teeth, however, are {{different}} from most other theropods. One comparative study of the feeding apparatus suggests that Stenonychosaurus {{could have been an}} omnivore. The jaws met in a broad, U-shaped symphysis similar to that of an iguana, a lizard species adapted to a plant-eating lifestyle. Additionally, the teeth of Stenonychosaurus bore large serrations, each of which is called a <b>denticle.</b> There are pits at the intersections of the denticles, and the points of the denticles point towards the tip, or apex, of each tooth. The teeth show wear facets on their sides. Holtz (1998) also noted that characteristics used to support a predatory habit for Stenonychosaurus - the grasping hands, large brain and stereoscopic vision, are all characteristics shared with the herbivorous/omnivorous primates and omnivorous Procyon (raccoon).|$|E
25|$|Figaro {{was coined}} as a {{subgenus}} of Pristiurus by Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in a 1928 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Records of the Australian Museum, to contain his newly described species P. boardmani. In 1908, Henry Weed Fowler synonymized Pristiurus with the genus Galeus. Though Whitley elevated Figaro {{to the rank of}} full genus in 1939, most authors continued to regard Figaro as a subgenus of Galeus. In 1983, Yuan-Ting Chu and colleagues referenced Figaro to contain Galeus boardmani, Dichichthys melanobranchus (=Parmaturus melanobranchus), and F. piceus (=P. melanobranchus). However, it is uncertain whether they intended to resurrect Figaro or were simply unaware of its synonymy with Galeus, and their use of the ventral <b>denticle</b> crest to define the genus posed taxonomic problems. In 2008, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) researchers Daniel Gledhill, Peter Last, and William White resurrected Figaro with additional defining characters, to contain F. boardmani and the new species F. striatus. The genus has since been generally accepted as distinct.|$|E

50|$|The tail has 18 {{laterally}} compressed spines, the dorsal {{surface is}} covered in <b>denticles,</b> while the ventral surface lacks <b>denticles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The tail is whip-like and {{measures}} 11.5 {{times as long}} as the disc is wide. A long, serrated spine originates in the first third of the tail, and is followed by a low dorsal keel and a ventral fin fold. Young rays have smooth skin, while adults have a patch of small dermal denticles between and behind the eyes, and a row of thorns along the midline of the back. There are 16 tubercles in front of the tail spine, and numerous small denticles behind. This species is plain brown above, often with yellow or orange coloring before the eyes, behind the spiracles, around the disc margin, and laterally on the tail in front of the spine. The tail darkens to nearly black towards the tip and on the ventral fin fold. The underside is white with bright orange-red patches. The Mekong freshwater stingray (D. laosensis) is also characterized by orange ventral coloration and has some similar meristic counts to this species, but differs in disc shape, <b>denticle</b> coverage, and dorsal coloration.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the shell varies between 50mm and 165mm, its {{diameter}} between 100mm and 120mm. The large, ponderous, shell has a conical shape, appearing subperforate. It is covered by a corneous striate, brown or yellowish cuticle usually lost on the upper whorls. Its color beneath the cuticle is white, longitudinally striped with crimson, violet or reddish brown. The base of the shell is maculate or radiately strigate with a lighter shade of the same. The spire is strictly conical. The apex is acute, usually eroded. The shell contains 8-10 whorls. The upper ones are tuberculate at the sutures, and spirally beaded, the following flat on their outer surfaces, smooth, separated by linear suture. The body whorl is expanded, dilated and compressed at the obtuse periphery, more or less convex below, indented at the axis. The umbilical tract is covered by a spiral pearly deeply entering callus. The aperture is transverse and very oblique. The columella is oblique, terminating in a <b>denticle</b> below, and with a strong spiral fold above, deeply inserted into the axis. The operculum is circular, thin, corneous, orange-brown, and composed of about 10 whorls.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} small to minute, clavate, {{more or less}} tapering, {{greatest}} width well below the middle, always more than two-and-a-half times as long as wide, transparent when fresh to whitish when worn. The umbilicus is completely closed. The spire is produced, slightly tapering or sides at most subparallel, not convex. The apex is flattened, obtusely conical to mamillate. The shell has from five-and-a-half to just under six hardly convex whorls, that are superficially smooth but under high magnification with faint spiral sculpture and growth lines, growth lines turning to weak costulation behind the labrum. Sutures are somewhat impressed, fairly shallow, simple and filiform. The aperture is subovate, sometimes distinctly squarish at base, peristome slightly incrassate and reflected, aperture not or hardly obstructed by three-fold dentition: a small angular process (usually a mere swelling), somewhat distant from and therefore not connected with apex of labrum {{so that there is}} no sinus; opposite the angular <b>denticle</b> there is an upper labral process {{in the form of a}} thickening of the labrum, which process does not correspond to a depression behind the labrum; finally, a very faint thickening of the lower columella may be interpreted as a columellar process.|$|E
40|$|The placoid scales, or <b>denticles,</b> of the {{external}} epidermis of elasmobranchs are well known as a hard protective coat over the skin to reduce abrasion or as elements to reduce hydrodynamic drag. However, the structure and function of <b>denticles</b> within the oral cavity is uncertain. Using stereological and scanning electron microscopy, this study examines the structure and distribution of oral <b>denticles</b> {{in a range of}} elasmobranchs. Of the batoids analyzed, only members of the Rhinobatidae possessed oral <b>denticles,</b> with no <b>denticles</b> found in the members sampled in the Gymnuridae or Dasyatidae. In contrast, oral <b>denticles</b> were located in all the selachians examined, except for members of the Orectolobidae. Within the selachians, the <b>denticles</b> of the Carcharhinidae have a grooved surface and a central spine, which is angled toward the posterior of the mouth. These denticular adaptations are beneficial to reduce hydrodynamic drag, an advantage for these free-swimming species with ram ventilation. Alternatively, members of the Hemiscyllidae have broad bulbous <b>denticles</b> that often overlap, providing a hard surface to protect the epithelium from abrasion during the consumption of hard-bodied prey. The distribution and high number of oral <b>denticles</b> appears to spatially compromise the capacity for oral (taste) papillae to populate the oropharyngeal cavity but provides increased friction and grip on prey items as they are manipulated within the mouth...|$|R
50|$|Teeth {{are typical}} cladodont in form. They are {{composed}} of 5 cusps, the central being the largest, the two extreme lateral smaller, and the intermediate very small. Cusps are rounded in cross section, slightly curved inwards and strongly striated vertically. Modified <b>denticles</b> cover the dorsal surface {{of the head and}} upper edge of dorsal fin. Both sets of <b>denticles</b> are smooth, monocuspid and curved posteriorly. The <b>denticles</b> on the head are relatively uniform in size (about as high as the central cusps in the teeth), and rounded in cross section. The <b>denticles</b> {{on the edge of the}} dorsal fin have polygonal bases and are fitted together in a mosaic pattern. In the male, the <b>denticles</b> increase in height and decrease in curvature toward the midline of the fin, so that the central <b>denticles</b> reach 2 cm in height.|$|R

25|$|The {{shell is}} dextral, not decollate, light corneous, fragile, glossy and rather translucent. It is very slender, with a nearly cylindrical, narrow, upper third and a {{spindle-shaped}} lower part. The shell has 12-15 moderately convex whorls separated by an indented, relatively deep suture. Protoconch is glossy, teleoconch whorls are with obtuse growth-lines, {{which are more}} rib-like on the more narrowly sculptured, cervical part of the last whorl. Peristome is double; inner lip recognizable as a narrow ridge, contacting the body whorl and closing the umbilicus (visible in not fully grown specimens); outer lip very strongly thickened, with some prominent growth-ridges, tube-like protruding. Neck is with {{a more or less}} clearly developed basal crest. Aperture is obliquely pear-shaped to narrowed elliptical, with a sinulus bordered by the lamella parietalis and a knob on the peristome, whitish inside. Peristome is continuous, white, broadly reflexed. In frontal view, the prominent lamella parietalis (= superior), and the more inconspicuous lamella columellaris (= inferior) and plica principalis are seen, whereas the frontal end of the lamella subcolumellaris is usually discernible as a blunt <b>denticle.</b> The lamella parietalis is connected with the spiralis, which reaches as far as the lamella subcolumellaris inside, i.e. hardly further than the columellaris; there is no lamella inserta. Ventro-laterally, next to the plica principalis, there are four short, nearly parallel plicae palatales. Clausilial blade is rather broad, curvature of its outer border dictated by the position of the short palatal plicae.|$|E

500|$|The body {{is rather}} {{laterally}} compressed and tapers towards the tail, with two dorsal fins set far back. The first dorsal fin originates over {{the rear of}} the pelvic fins and is much larger than the second, which originates over the midpoint of the anal fin base.

The caudal fin is short and broad, with an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very thick skin is covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. Each <b>denticle</b> has an arrowhead-shaped crown with three posterior points, mounted on a short stalk.|$|E
500|$|Like other stingrays, the {{reticulate}} whipray is aplacental viviparous: {{the developing}} embryos are initially sustained by yolk, which is later supplanted by histotroph ("uterine milk", enriched with proteins and lipids) {{produced by the}} mother.

Off South Africa, the newborns measure [...] across and sexual maturation is attained at a disc width of approximately , which corresponds to an age of 4-5. Off Australia, the newborns measure [...] across, with males reported to mature at [...] across. The juveniles of this species, H. leoparda, and H. undulata differ in birth size, disc shape, <b>denticle</b> development, and amount of spotting, and are in fact more distinct from each other than are adults of the three species.

500|$|The skin {{is covered}} by a layer of foul-smelling mucus several {{millimeters}} thick. The dermal denticles are scattered irregularly over the body and vary greatly in size, measuring up to [...] across. Each <b>denticle</b> is thorn-like in shape, with ridges radiating out from the central point over the base. As many as ten denticles may be {{fused together to form}} multi-pointed plates. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth is densely covered by small denticles in sharks under [...] long; these denticles become larger and sparser in larger sharks. This species is brown to black above, with a metallic purplish hue, and paler below; some individuals have red or black blotches.
