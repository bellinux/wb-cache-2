25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not <b>just</b> <b>beautiful</b> singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

As much as who killed Lilly Kane." [...] For the finale, Thomas promised [...] "80 percent total satisfaction. People will know who killed Lilly Kane. And there won't be that twist at the end that 'perhaps they didn't do it.' I'm not going to be leaving people like that. However, {{at the end of the}} episode, it gives us a pretty big cliffhanger {{question}} as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was <b>just</b> <b>beautiful...</b> He showed all of us {{that it was possible to}} go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot on March 15, 2010 in the deserts of Lancaster, California, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. When talking to 'MTV News' about the video Minaj stated, [...] "I didn't want to shoot the typical new-artist vision. Thank God I have a wonderful label that stands behind me and my vision. I met Hype in a freakin' airport...and {{it happened to be}} a week before I wanted to shoot a video. I told him the idea. Of course, I had to let Baby and Slim know and hope they would understand my expensive taste. It all came together." [...] It's <b>just</b> <b>beautiful</b> — the clothes, everything. The ambiance..It's for all the girls that like to play dress-up. They're gonna love this one...we get on the walkie-talkie, like, 'Mayday! Mayday!' It's really fashion and beauty shots, and we're acting like we're doing something important. We wanted to make it pretty in the dirt. We wanted to have a very crazy contrast. I didn't want to do everything clean. I like the dirt. All that pink stuff looks even prettier in the dirt." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was <b>just</b> <b>beautiful.</b> And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{figure in}} the {{development}} of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and ethnologist, Augustus Pitt Rivers, who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical {{by the standards of the}} time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He arranged his artifacts by type or [...] "typologically, and within types by date or [...] "chronologically". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that all artifacts, not <b>just</b> <b>beautiful</b> or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.|$|E

2500|$|In his July 14, 2001 {{review of}} Viz Media's four volume Perfect Collection edition, of the manga, Michael Wieczorek of Ex.org {{compared}} the series to Princess Mononoke stating, [...] "Both stories deal with man's struggle with nature {{and with each}} other, {{as well as with}} the effects war and violence have on society." [...] Wieczoek gave a mixed review on the detail of the artwork in this, [...] sized, edition, stating, [...] "It is good because the panels are <b>just</b> <b>beautiful</b> to look at. It is bad because the size of the manga causes the panels within to be very small, and some of these panels are just crammed with detailed artwork. That can sometimes cause some confusion about what is happening to which person during an action scene." [...] The Perfect Collection edition of the manga is out of print.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the series}} premiere, [...] "Give Me a Ring Sometime" [...] (1982), Diane Chambers, a college student, enters Cheers and meets Sam Malone, a {{recovering}} alcoholic and a womanizer. While {{she waits for}} her fiancé Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire), Diane realizes that Sumner has left her, and that she is jobless and penniless with nothing else in her life. Sam offers Diane {{a job as a}} cocktail waitress, and she accepts. In the next episode, [...] "Sam's Women" [...] (1982), Diane snootily teases Sam for preferring <b>just</b> <b>beautiful</b> women with below average intelligence. In response, Sam involves his ex-wife, Debra (Donna McKechnie), in a pretend relationship to prove Diane wrong. (In some syndicated prints, Sam's past marriage is omitted.) When Sam and Debra are leaving [...] "for" [...] an opera, Diane retrieves the opera pamphlet from Debra only to find it two years old, foiling Sam's scheme. Sam blames Diane for making his romantic life less fun anymore, and Diane assures that he would never win an intelligent woman. They argue but then make up. When Sam explains a color of the sky at a ski resort and compares it to Diane's eyes in vivid detail, apparently distracted Diane is nearly touched but then averts herself and treats it as repulsive to an intelligent woman. Throughout the season, Sam and Diane are attracted to each other and trade each other flirts and innuendos, but they never consummate their relationship. In the two-part season finale, [...] "Showdown" [...] (1983), Diane briefly dates Sam's successful, handsome, well-educated brother Derek, making Sam jealous. No longer able to suppress their feelings, Sam and Diane kiss passionately in the bar's office.|$|E

This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass, and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass. Why, there is romance in the life-history of any grass, yes, and adventure, too. The very thought of it stirs me.
