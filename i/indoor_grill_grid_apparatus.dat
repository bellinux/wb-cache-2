Lattice filters are used widely {{in the areas}} of speech and signal processing. Herein, they are used to identify the structural dynamics model of the flexible structures.

Before the identified model and control laws are integrated, the identified model is passed through a series of validation procedures and only when the model passes these validation procedures control is engaged. This type of validation scheme prevents instability when the overall loop is closed. The results obtained from simulation were compared to those obtained from experiments.

40|$|AbstractTransport {{phenomena}} occur {{frequently in}} industrial problems. Most of the turbulent transport properties {{can be directly}} associated with the turbulent energy dissipation rate; hence {{it is a very}} significant parameter in the design of chemical processing equipment. To develop a better chemical processing equipment design, a thorough knowledge of the effect flow structure on local turbulence parameters like turbulent kinetic energy, eddy diffusivity and the energy dissipation rate are required. Turbulence is heterogeneous in most of the process equipment. Hence, the use of spatial average energy dissipation rate causes error in modelling of turbulent transport processes. In this present work, particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to obtain the energy spectrum from grid generated homogeneous turbulence velocity data. The model of energy spectrum given by Kang et al. (2003) has been fitted to this energy spectrum using energy dissipation rate. A different approach, based on a third order structure function and velocity gradient technique has been used to compute the energy dissipation rate.

40|$|Dissolution {{and mass}} {{transfer}} at gas liquid interfaces {{are central to}} many industrial and environmental issues. All these applications aim at predicting the transfer velocities between the two phases, and the dependency of these velocities on several factors such as pressure, temperature, flow regime and so on.

The dissolution of an atmospheric sparingly soluble gas, carbon dioxide, is considered.

40|$|Turbulence {{modulation}} of {{a nearly}} isotropic flow field {{due to the}} presence of single glass particles, with diameters in the range of 1 - 8 mm (~ 10 - 77 times the Kolmogorov scale), was studied experimentally in an oscillating <b>grid</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to obtain the instantaneous, two-dimensional velocity field for grid Reynolds number, Reg, varying from 1080 to 10, 800. Fluctuating velocity components, flow field length scales, energy dissipation rates, turbulence intensity modulation and energy spectra were determined. An apparent increase of ~ 2 - 25 % in the turbulence fluctuating velocity in the inertial subrange was noted compared with the fluid-only system. Presence of the particle led to enhancement in the flow field isotropy ratio and this ratio was found to be more dependent on the particle size compared with grid Reynolds number. The integral length scale for both fluid-only and fluid-particle systems exhibited a decreasing power law dependency on the grid Reynolds number. A critical ratio (0. 41) of particle size to integral length scale was obtained which demarcated the regime of attenuation and enhancement of turbulence intensity and found to be valid for general grid turbulence in multiparticle systems as well. Energy dissipation rate was observed to increase with increase in particle size. Both longitudinal and transverse energy spectrum exhibited less steep slope than - 5 / 3 in the presence of particle which was reasoned to the production of turbulence in the inertial subrange region. Energy enhancements from large scale to smaller scale were explained by the dissipative spectrum which showed maximum energy enhancement in the inertial subrange followed by a decaying trend. In general, the role of a particle in modulating turbulence was explained through possible wake oscillation and vortex shedding due to boundary layer separation on the particle surface and interaction with bulk eddies...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The hydropyrolysis of coal {{is considered to be}} an attractive future route for the conversion of coal to gaseous and liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks. This thesis comprises a study of the behaviour of coal under the conditions pertinent to those envisaged within a commercial hydropyrolysis process, that is, using pulverised coal, a short coal-reactor residence time, high hydrogen pressure and high heating rate. For this purpose, an electrically heated <b>grid</b> <b>apparatus</b> has been used. The experimental conditions have been weighted towards achieving a maximum loss of primary volatile products whilst minimising unwanted and poorly controlled secondary reactions such as char hydrogasification. In this way, it has been possible to compare the influence of a hydrogen atmosphere on primary devolatilisation for a range of coals. Overall, the total volatile release is enhanced by hydropyrolysis to a degree dependent upon the partial pressure of the hydrogen. The increased yield is due mainly to an increase of saturated hydrocarbons, although the production of some individual species such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unsaturated hydrocarbons are diminished with respect to helium pyrolysis. The magnitude of both total and individual product yields vary with coal type, as does the degree by which these yields are influenced by a hydrogen atmosphere. This influence is considered to depend specifically on the type and number of various reactive sites and functionalities within coal and also on their accessibility for hydrogen, which is in tum dependent upon the thermoplastic behaviour of the coal. A further factor governing both product yields and hydrogen influence is the coal petrographic composition. Inertinite macerals have been observed to be significantly more responsive than exinite or vitrinite to hydrogen, producing relatively high methane yields. Thus {{it has been shown that}} inertinite rich coals or enriched feedstocks may be suitable candidates for hydropyrolysis processing. The data obtained have also demonstrated how a number of coal properties obtained by standard analytical techniques may be used for coal selection and yield prediction. BS volatile matter, carbon content, vitrinite reflectance and both 0 /C and H/C atomic ratios are the most useful of the properties investigated in this respect. This is considered to be an important step towards the foundation of a classification system for hydropyrolysis processing...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{arising from}} the area of {{decentralized}} control are emerging for analysis and control synthesis for large flexible structures. In this paper the control strategy involves a decentralized model reference adaptive approach using a variable structure control. Local models are formulated based on desired damping and response time in a model-following scheme for various modal configurations. Variable structure controllers are then designed employing co-located angular rate and position feedback. In this scheme local control forces the system to move on a local sliding mode in some local error space.

A technique has been developed to study in detail and under controlled conditions, the preferential flow of water and solutes in large, intact soil blocks, isolated at field sites and transported to the laboratory. The soil blocks, 46 -cm (18 ") on each side (145 kg, 320 lb) were carefully cut with a flat shovel, then encased on the vertical sides with a polyurethane foam shell (inside a plywood box) to stabilize it during transport and later experimentation. The blocks were cut at least 46 cm deep to ensure that the A/B horizon interlayer was included. Unstable, preferential water flow (and solute movement) often occur...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} are being conducted {{to observe the}} liquid/solid interface of He- 4 near 1 K. Interesting instabilities are expected to occur when the solid is non-hydrostatically stressed. (1) A compact interdigital capacitor {{is used as a}} level detector to observe solid He- 4 to which stresses are applied externally. The capacitor consists of 38 interlaced 50 m wide and 3. 8 mm long gold films separated by 50 m and deposited onto a 5 mm by 5 mm sapphire substrate. The capacitor is placed on one flat end wall of a cylindrical chamber (xx mm diameter and xx mm long). The solid is grown to a known height and a stress is applied by a tubular PZT along the cylindrical axis. The observed small change in height of the solid at the wall is linearly proportional to the applied stress. The solid height decreases under compressive stress but does not change under tensile stress. The response of the solid on compressive stress is consistent with the expected quadratic dependence on strain. (2) Interferometric techniques are being developed for observing the solid He- 4 surface profile. A laser light source is brought into the low temperature region via single mode optical fiber. The interference pattern is transmitted back out of the low temperature apparatus via optical fiber bundle.

40|$|Abstract]: Townsville’s former General Hospital site is {{undergoing}} a major redevelopment that includes the construction of twelve elevated, level residential allotments with commanding views across Cleveland Bay towards Magnetic Island. To achieve the above development objectives, a large quantity of fill is required and most importantly {{will need to be}} retained to construct the allotments. Numerous methods of retainment were investigated and the reinforced earth option was discovered to be the most feasible. A recycled concrete fill material, crushed to 100 mm minus, was proposed {{to be used in the}} reinforced earth structure. This material was a result of the demolition of numerous buildings from within the site. External advice suggested that the 100 mm minus material would not integrate sufficiently with the reinforcement (Tensar Geogrid) and would need to be crushed further to a 75 mm minus material. This would help to provide enough resistance to achieve the correct pullout characteristics of the reinforcement. The objective is to create a testing apparatus that makes it possible to test the interaction of the Tensar Geogrid reinforcement with the various gradings of crushed recycled concrete material. These tests can then be analysed to confirm interaction calculations and the design of the reinforced earth structure. A plywood box is constructed to allow the compaction of various grades of crushed concrete within. A similar grade of Tensar grid is used for each test and located centrally within the material. The reinforcement material extrudes from the box allowing a force to be applied. A load gauge records the pullout force applied to pull the Tensar <b>grid</b> from the <b>apparatus.</b> The results from the individual tests undertaken are analysed against calculations made for the various types of material. The results are then compared against each other to indicate the ability of interaction and performance under load. Preliminary analysis indicates that failure strength is similar for all tests undertaken, however the rate of failure gives a good indication of the interaction characteristics of the materials...|$|R
