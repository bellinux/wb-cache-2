40|$|Television {{inheritance}} effects, inordinately {{high levels}} of audience du-plication between programs scheduled back-to-back, have helped broadcasters manage audience flow for decades. This study uses 2004 national peoplemeter data collected by Nielsen to replicate a study of inheritance effects done 20 years earlier. It finds the same predictors ex-plain either 96 % or 58 % of variance in the <b>duplicated</b> <b>audience,</b> de-pending upon the measure of duplication that is used. The research re-solves discrepancies {{in the literature on}} inheritance effects and casts serious doubt on the common practice of inferring audience duplica-tion from the strength of correlations between lead-in and lead-out pro-gram ratings. Inheritance effects {{are one of the most}} important, and robust, of all television audi-ence behaviors. Also known as lead-in effects, or simply audience flow, they have been routinely reported in the academic literature for over 40 years. Essentially, they describe the tendency of people who watch one program on a given network to sta...|$|E
40|$|A goal {{programming}} {{model for}} selecting media is presented which alters the objective and extends previous media models by accounting for cumulative <b>duplicating</b> <b>audiences</b> over {{a variety of}} time periods. This permits detailed control {{of the distribution of}} message frequencies directed at each of numerous marketing targets over a sequence of interrelated periods. This is accomplished via a new logarithmic non-reach device and a continuous lognormal generation of the discrete message frequencies. ...|$|R
40|$|The author shows {{one way to}} estímate the net {{cumulative}} {{coverage and}} frequency distribution of a print schedule from the <b>duplicated</b> <b>audiences</b> of pairs of publications and pairs of issues. ESPITE AN ABUNDANCE of information little dreamed of a decade ago, the media planner still lacks {{some of the basic}} tools he needs. This is particularly true in the case of audience duplication. When a schedule encompasses both print and broadcast media, assessing the number of different people reached is largely a matter of guesswork. Generally, the net coverage o £ print and broadcast are estimated separately. But when it comes to marrying these two parts together, the amount of duplication is either guessed at or ignored. D Moreover, print coverage, based on average-issue readership, ignores the effect of repeat reading of different issues of the same publication. As early as 1953, Alfred Politz demonstrated that this cumulative readership is far from negligible: whereas an average issue of Life was read by 22. 1 percent of individuals, this figure increased to 50. 6 per cent over six issues. It would not be rash to say that most net coverage estimates bear little resemblance to fact. (Note: the word "readership, " used here in the European sense...|$|R

For example, an audience member with [...] "1234" [...] needed one of each digit to come on stage, while one with [...] "5555" [...] needed four 5's to be eligible.|$|R
