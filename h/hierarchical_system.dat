5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system.</b> This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system.</b> From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the mammals were {{comprehensively}} revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, {{which has}} resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system,</b> covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, List {{initially}} {{devised the}} idea that ancient German society had been led by a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system</b> of initiates, the Armanenschaft, an idea which had developed into {{a key part of}} his thinking by 1908. List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of Freemasonry. He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, grips, and passwords. He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting as teachers, priests, and judges. In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland. He believed that they developed a secretive language for transmitting their teachings, known as kala.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman empire's <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system,</b> a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not {{indicate}} {{that he is a}} peer of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped like that of the Parthian monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination of title and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E
5|$|Larger rodents tend to live {{in family}} units where parents and their {{offspring}} live together until the young disperse. Beavers live in extended family units typically {{with a pair of}} adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young. Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a territory around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system</b> of dominance with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse. The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated, after which time he defends a territory, a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|The ACC's {{representatives to}} these bowls were picked in a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system</b> {{that allowed the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl to have the first {{selection}} after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Music City Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Humanitarian Bowl, in that order. The ACC's agreement with the bowls dictated that the bowls would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after the bowls with higher selections made their pick. Bowls would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could select a 53 team over a 62 team, but could not select a 44 team over a 62 team.|$|E
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>system</b> of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E

40|$|Fuzzy {{systems have}} a dual role: {{on the one}} hand, they are {{rule-based}} systems constructed from a collection of fuzzy IF-THEN rules; on the other hand, they are nonlinear mappings with nice mathematical properties like universal approximation. In this paper, we use fuzzy systems to model higher levels of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>systems</b> and design controllers for the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>systems.</b> In the modeling part, we consider three-level <b>hierarchical</b> <b>systems</b> where the lowest level comprises the plant and conventional feedback controller, the middle level performs supervisory operations to guarantee {{the stability of the}} whole system, and the top level is a planning level that provides control targets for the lower levels and communicates with the environment. The plant is modeled by differential equations, and the supervision and planning levels are modeled by fuzzy systems. Two case studies are presented: integrated planning and control of mobile robots, and intelligent vehicle/highway systems. In the control part, two types of control systems are designed for the hierarchical model, depending upon whether or not the plant model is available. In both cases, the whole <b>hierarchical</b> control <b>systems</b> are shown to be stable, with the tracking errors converging to zero. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{monograph}} we formulate a simple model for heat transfer in living tissue with self - regulation. The initial {{point of the}} model is the governing equations describing heat transfer in living tissue at the mesoscopic level, i. e. considering different vessels individually. Then, basing on the well known equivalence of the diffusion type process and random walks, we develop a certain regular procedure that enables us to average these mesoscopic equations practically over all scales of the hierarchical vascular network. The microscopic governing equations obtained in this way describe living tissue {{in terms of an}} active medium with continuously distributed self - regulation. One of the interesting results obtained in the present monograph is that there can be the phenomena of ideal self - regulation in large active <b>hierarchical</b> <b>systems.</b> Large <b>hierarchical</b> <b>systems</b> are characterized by such a great information flow that none of its elements can possess whole information required of governing the system behavior. Nevertheless, there exists a cooperative mechanism of regulation which involves individual response of each element to the corresponding hierarchical piece of information and leads to ideal system response due to self - processing of information. The particular results are obtained for bioheat transfer. However, self - regulation in other natural <b>hierarchical</b> <b>systems</b> seems to be organized in a similar way. The characteristics of large <b>hierarchical</b> <b>systems</b> occurring in nature are discussed from the stand point of regulation problems. By way of example, some ecological and economic systems are considered. An cooperative mechanism of self-regulation which enables the system to function ideally is proposed...|$|R
