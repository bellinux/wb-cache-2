40|$|The {{presence}} of genotype by environment interaction (GxE) between <b>registered</b> and commercial <b>herds</b> for dairy traits was investigated using Australian Holstein-Friesian data.

In 1997, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador passed the Heritage Animals Act, which made the Newfoundland pony the first (and, so far, only) heritage animal of Newfoundland and Labrador. A subsequent order designated the Newfoundland Pony Society as [...] "the group which will maintain the registry of ponies and otherwise act {{for the preservation of}} the animal." [...] In part, this Act required anyone wishing to export ponies from Newfoundland to first acquire a permit; this ensured that ponies were going to private homes instead of slaughterhouses. Also in 1997, the Newfoundland Pony Breed Association was formed. This group sought to have the Newfoundland pony recognized under the Canadian Animal Pedigree Act, which may have given it additional protection and recognition. In March 2014, the Newfoundland Pony Society stated that they believed the breed should not have federal recognition, believing that the [...] "federal act is meant for farm stock and breeding animals", not heritage breeds. Members of the society also fear that protection of the breed may be lessened under federal law when compared with current provincial regulations. However, the provincial government will make the final decision on whether to move forward with the process for federal recognition.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{elaborate}} literature review {{on the issue of}} cattle reproduction, factors influencing fertility and describe the various types of heat detection. The work also includes practical observations, which was based on comparing the results of its own conception of cows {{depending on the type of}} heat detection. The hypothesis was that the results of visual observation will have lower levels of reproduction than heat detection using measuring physical activity. 	The comparison was carried out within the company ZOD Roztoky Kruh, which is located in Roztoky u Jilemnice and enterprise Zetka Strážník, a. s. in Studenec u Horek. Information about the results of reproduction and performance were collecte in the two companies taken from their Analysis of <b>herds</b> <b>registered</b> in the stud book of Czech Fleckvieh and the Results of milk recording system during the period 2012 to 2015. Consequently, the results of reproduction were evaluated graphically for each business separately and then they were compared for both companies between themselves and within the whole population. As selected reproduction indicators for comparison, I selected the number of pregnant cows after all inseminations, insemination interval, service period, insemination index and length of the calving period. 	The comparison showed that the two companies is different in nearly all indicators of reproduction, except calving period, the length of which was in both companies almost the same, on average from 394 to 396 days. In ZOD Enterprise Roztoky Kruh faced with increasing length of calving period, which varies in length averaging about 99. 9 days, which is considered inconvenient. In contrast, the length of insemination interval was shorted by an average of 8. 5 days from the start of monitoring. The number of pregnant cows after insemination was on average around 52. 6 %, which is 4. 7 % less than in the enterprise Zetka Strážník, a. s., where it achieved 57. 3 %. The index of insemination for cows was an average of 1. 75. The enterprise Zetka Strážník had an average length of calving period 94. 9 days. Insemination interval was prolonged by an average of 5. 6 since 2012. The index of insemination for cows had an average value 1. 55. This indicator is not influenced by the type of heat detection. 	The hypothesis was confirmed even though the difference was not too great. Enterprise, which used measurements of physical activity to detect estrus, had better results in terms of reproduction. We can see that heat detection using visual observation is not as effective as using the detectors that detect physical activity in a stable all day...|$|R

40|$|The breed {{structure}} and genetic {{history of the}} New Zealand pedigree Angus breed were analysed by Robertson and Asker's (1951) modification of the Wright-McPhee (1925) pedigree sampling method. The pattern of the breed structure obtained is generally similar to that found in other studies, but it is both diffuse and dynamic owing to the present rapid expansion of the breed. There are {{changes taking place in}} the herd composition of the major breeders' herds and many new herds have yet to find their level in the structure. Considerable emphasis has been placed on the use of imported animals {{in the development of the}} breed. Of all <b>herds</b> <b>registering</b> in Volume 61 of the herd book, 20. 5 % used imported sires, and the percentage of genes in the breed in 1966 / 67 derived from animals imported since 1863 was 85. 4. The most important herd in 1969 has a genetic contribution to the breed of 21. 9 per cent:, while the contributions of the four next most important herds were 8. 72, 8. 7, 4. 7 and 3. 7 per cent. In the four-generation pedigrees from which these figures were derived, the contribution of imported animals was 42. 4 %. The relationship between herd size and importance of the herd was considered. Herd duration was also discussed, in so far as it relates to improvement of the breed. The animal with the highest relationship to the breed was Blackleg (11. 65 % in the 1900 pedigree sample). But overall, the most important animal over the period 1900 - 1966 / 67 was Lancer of Advie. Of the 33 sires and 9 dams whose direct relationships are 3. 0 % or more in any of the 8 sample years, 19 sires and 3 dams were imported. The total inbreeding in 1966 / 67 (base year 1863) was 1. 80 %. This comprised 0. 09 % current inbreeding, 0. 95 % long-term inbreeding, and 0. 76 % strain inbreeding. The index of subdivision calculated from the non-current and long-term inbreeding is 1. 79, indicating that there is only a slight tendency towards family formation in the breed. The effective generation length is approximately 5. 6 years. About 50 - 56 % of the animals in the 1966 / 67 sample were sired by bulls 4 years old or younger, while about 38 % are from dams 4 years or younger. It is unlikely that there is much genetic variation between herds. This is because bulls from major breeders' herds are used widely throughout the breed while about 80 percent of sires and 37 per cent of dams are bred in herds other than the one in which they were used...|$|R

50|$|In 1912, Kershaw began a {{long career}} as a cattleman, with the initial {{purchase}} of a <b>herd</b> of <b>registered</b> Aberdeen Angus cattle from the Gatewood herd of Texas and the Nicholas herd in Iowa. He recognized the potential of raising high-quality show and breeding stock of a breed of cattle which were well-suited for the short grass of Oklahoma and the long, dry summers. Angus cattle could be cross-bred with the Texas longhorn, and the product would be a hornless breed of cattle. Angus bulls were popular with cattle breeders for their first cow because the calves would be small, and easy to deliver for the new cows. Kershaw was elected a Director of the Oklahoma Free State Fair in Muskogee in 1913. It was the largest free State Fair and exposition in Oklahoma at the time. In 1917, one of Kershaw's prize bulls, winner of 19 championships, Ben Hur of Lone Dell, was featured {{on the cover of}} the Breeder's Gazette, the leading publication in the country at the time, advocating pedigreed cattle stock.

50|$|Polled strains {{have been}} {{developed}} of many cattle breeds which were originally horned. This has usually been done by crossing with naturally polled breeds, most commonly Angus and Galloway cattle. For example, polled Jersey cattle originated in Ohio sometime prior to 1895. Two strains were developed, the first to appear being founded by crosses of registered Jersey bulls (the standard) on common muley (hornless) cows. These were graded up by the continued use of purebred Jersey sires, selection being made of the polled offspring of each generation, the horned progeny being discarded. Thus originated what was later known as the single-standard strain. As {{in the case of}} the Polled Shorthorns and Polled Herefords, the development of the single-standard strain was soon followed by the appearance of a double-standard strain, founded by a few naturally hornless sports that were discovered in <b>registered</b> <b>herds</b> of horned Jersey cattle. These standards were bred among themselves or crossed with registered horned Jerseys, followed by selection for the polled head, and the strain was developed in this way.|$|R
