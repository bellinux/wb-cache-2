30|$|Nevertheless, an {{important}} drawback of foam fractionation is simultaneous cell accumulation in the foam, {{which leads to}} a continuous reduction of biomass concentration in the fermentation broth (Kosaric and Vardar-Sukan 2015). A simple foam fractionation method can be applied in cases when the biomass enrichment in the foam is low, but there are only few examples where low biomass enrichments in the foam are described (Beuker et al. 2016), otherwise the loss of the producing microorganism has a significant influence on production efficiency (Davis et al. 2001). Foam affinity for various cells is different (Shedlovsky 1948) and it is not yet clear which properties and system variables influence the cell attachment to foam bubbles. Strain selection, genetic engineering and medium modification were suggested to reduce cell hydrophobicity and address the foaming issue of rhamnolipid fermentation (Sodagari and Ju 2014). A subsequent problem of foam is that conventional exponential feeding strategies indeed fail to account for the loss of biomass caused by foaming (Chenikher et al. 2010). The volume of foam created in the process needs to be accounted for as well, due to the resulting loss of nutrients and liquid volume that make up the liquid fraction of the foam. Cultivation with integrated <b>foam</b> fractionation and <b>separation</b> is not feasible as long as no cell retention method is employed. This generates a necessity for implementation of some kind of cell retention method, such as cell immobilization in magnetic alginate beads (Heyd et al. 2011). Product separation and subsequent cell recirculation into the bioreactor were also suggested (Winterburn et al. 2011).|$|R

I compare model simulations of sea surface temperature to high resolution observations for three unique cases. The model runs over a daily cycle using a 1 -dimensional 2 nd moment closure turbulence scheme with the inclusion of a wave breaking model. The comparisons reveal poor performance when the wave breaking model is included. Subsequently, attempts to improve on our understanding of wave breaking were made. I developed a technique for estimating whitecap coverage estimates of both actively breaking (stage A) waves, and maturing (stage B) <b>foam.</b> The Spatial <b>Separation</b> of Whitecap Pixels (SSWP) allows for accurate distinguishing of stage A and stage B whitecap regions by manually evaluating the pixel intensity, location (with respect to the crest of the wave), texture and shape of a given whitecap region.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility {{of the use of}} a novel process of high liquid carryover (HLC) mode flotation to treat wastewater from a cardboard printing and coating plant. This is conducted by characterising the process conditions with the purpose of achieving a set condition that have a low susceptibility to variability in the wastewater composition. Information pertaining to the surface and physical characteristics of the solid contained in the wastewater sample were used to explain the flotation outcomes. Fe(II) was found to be more suited for industrial use as coagulant over the more commonly known coagulants, Al(III) and Fe(III), as it has the advantages of having a constant optimum flotation pH (6. 5) regardless of wastewater characteristics, as well as having a much lower detrimental effect on the flotation outcome when present in excess of the minimum requirement for flocculation of wastewater solids. This allows the setting of a coagulant dose (5 mM) that will treat both high and low solids content wastewater samples. The use of cationic surfactant (CTAB) was found to require lower coagulant dosages compared to those required for anionic (SDS) or non-ionic (TericG 12 A 8) surfactants in order to achieve good flotation outcomes. A CTAB concentration of 300 ppm was required to achieve a stable foam that can sustain for a prolonged period to allow solid (in <b>foam)</b> /liquid <b>separation.</b> The optimum batch mode conditions for HLC flotation were found to be pH 6. 5, 5 mM Fe(II) and 300 ppm CTAB. This was found to correspond to a small and negative electrophoretic mobility at the wastewater solid surface and large floc size. Batch mode flotation of individual ink components under the optimum conditions for industrial wastewater treatment revealed that the presence of large quantities of either blue or yellow inks in the wastewater can lead to poor removal. Their combined presence, however, did not have detrimental effects. Continuous mode flotation at 5 mM Fe(II), 300 ppm CTAB and pH 6. 5 was found to remove above 96 % of contaminants at cell residence times of 6 minutes and 88 % of contaminants at cell residence times of 1. 5 minute. Greater than 87 % of the initial wastewater volumes were recovered as treated effluent (i. e. < 13 % disposed as waste foam sludge), yielding a waste foam sludge containing between 12 and 17 % solids.

The thesis {{is based on the}} studies on protein recovery from crude feedstocks by extraction in aqueous two-phase systems and detergent <b>foam,</b> respectively. The <b>separation</b> technologies have been adapted to suit individual proteins by utilizing different forms of molecular interactions and environmental changes in a very simple way. Interaction of the lipolytic enzyme, cutinase with it's substrate, butyrate resulted in sufficient conformational changes to change it's extraction behavior in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) /salt system. The ability of the polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to complex reactive dyes and metal ions was used to set up a selective extraction process for the proteins (porcine Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and His 6 -LDH) binding these entities in a two-phase system employing PVP as one of the phase forming components. Extraction in aqueous two-phase systems was found to be an efficient separation technique for cold-active, highly labile enzyme molecules. Cold-active ß-galactosidase was purified with high yields using extraction as a primary separation sep. In case of cold-active ß-lactamase cloned in a mesophilic host, partial denaturation of the labile enzyme under conditions when the host proteins were still intact, allowed selective extraction in a PEG/salt system. Foam, generated by stirring of a non-ionic detergent Triton X- 114 was used as a separation tool for isolation of cutinase mutants. The mutant with the hydrophobic fusion tag, (Trp-Pro) 4 was recovered with high yields due to the stronger interaction with the detergent. Protein extraction into the foam was made more selective by integration of affinity interactions. The foam prepared from detergent modified with Cibacron blue could selectively extract hydrophilic LDH from muscle extract. The thermoseparating property of Triton X- 114 further helped easy separation of the target enzyme from the bulk detergent...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{material}} {{systems are}} currently playing significant {{roles in the}} medical application areas. Classified as bio-polymers, polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (glycolic acid) (PGA), and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are notable examples. While these materials {{are known for their}} bio-compatibility characteristics, the bio-conductive nature promoting further growth and repairing the damaged parts is often lacking. Natural coral derived HA/calcium carbonate composites and synthetic calcium phosphates are known for bio-conductivity. As a natural consequence, medical materials used in particular for bone repair and replacement needs are a mixture of a biopolymer composite and a bio ceramic. The resulting bio-polymer composites loaded with bio-ceramics such as hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate into different bio-polymer matrices combine the properties both phases and serve the purpose of the specific medical application. Several processing methods such as solvent casting or leaching, phase <b>separation,</b> <b>foaming,</b> gas saturation etc., are applied to put these polymer composites to service. However, most methods fail due to several drawbacks such as time and cost involved and more importantly, lack of flexibility to exactly reproduce complex shapes. In particular, achieving a complex shape is often a prerequisite condition in many medical applications. During the past two decades, the layered processing methods rapidly evolved from mere prototyping solutions to the more advanced technologies, commonly referred to as additive manufacturing. Considering the freedom these techniques offer to manufacture complex forms without any specific tooling or the alteration of the materials and processes, it became important to revisit the current processing techniques as applied to different biopolymers used for varying medical needs. The current research is an attempt in this direction, evaluating a selected combination of a bio-material and an additive processing technology. The specific medical application area targeted is in the bone repair and replacement tasks. Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is selected as the base polymer considering its wider use in bone related applications. The β-form of the tri-calcium phosphate (β-TCP) is the bio-ceramic component to impart the bio-conductivity to the polymer composite. Selective laser sintering is the process, considering the ease of working with powder raw materials and the ultimate control over the micro and meso structures of the sintered substrates. The material consolidation mechanism involves localized heating by a fast moving laser beam. The first task is to match the material combinations with the laser energy so that the substrates absorbs sufficient energy from the laser to achieve the particle melting, fusion, and consolidation. Considering the absorptivity levels of the constituent powders, a CO 2 laser source is selected for the experimental investigations. Simulating the laser sintering process conditions required the development of both hardware and software systems and the integration of the same to achieve the overall experimental test bed. Powder feeding and envelope temperature control systems are added for further process controls. Establishing the viability of the material and process combination involved experimental evaluations in three significant stages. The neat PMMA powders are evaluated first for laser sintering with varying process parameters. Working ranges of laser energy densities for initial laser sintering experiments are established by differential scanning calorimetric results. Morphologies of sintered surfaces and porosity analyses are used to evaluate the intra-layer coalescence. Critical process parameters, laser power and scan velocities are gradually adjusted towards more optimum combinations based on these initial results. Further sintering trials and evaluation of the morphological, physical and mechanical characterization results allowed to establish the best process conditions and the overall effectiveness of neat PMMA for selective laser sintering. The same procedure is repeated in the second stage based on varying compositions of PMMA plus β-TCP composites. The final stage involved evaluation of the possible after-effects if any on the biological and the multi-layer responses of the sintered polymer composites based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), in-vitro analyses, and mechanical testing. Overall, the experimental results indicate the suitability of both neat PMMA and PMMA plus β-TCP polymeric materials for processing by selective laser sintering. Best combinations of critical process parameters, laser power and scan velocities could be established for both material systems. The laser interactions are proved to cause no detrimental effects either in the polymer chemistry or the biological nature of the materials further to sintering. Sufficient inter-layer coalescence is also evidenced, establishing the effectiveness of the material and process combination for manufacturing 3 D forms. Considering the significant attributes of the constituent material systems and the unlimited design freedom allowed by the laser sintering approach, the findings reported in this thesis are expected to pave ways for wider research interest as well as potential medical applications in the future...|$|R

Both plots of TBP concentrations in the foam and in the residual aqueous solution versus initial TBP concentration can be fitted with straight lines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{enriching}} {{mechanism of}} water-soluble proteins in continuous <b>foam</b> <b>separation</b> was studied. The liquid flow {{rate and the}} protein concentration in foam phase were measured at various heights from the interphase between bulk liquid and foam layer, and the intrinsic values at the interface were estimated by the extrapolation method to determine the accurate adsorption density on bubble surface. Ovalbumin (OA) and hemoglobin (HB) were used as the soluble proteins. The solution pHs were varied from 3. 5, 4. 6 and 6. 0 for OA and from 6. 0, 6. 8 and 8. 0 for HB. The experimental isotherms for OA and HB were compared to the Langmuir isotherm, and the two adsorption parameters of the equilibrium constant, K, and the saturated density, γ, at each pH were determined. Both γ values obtained for OA and HB showed maxima at their isoelectric point (i. e. p., pH 4. 6 for OA and pH 6. 8 for HB). Assuming that OA and HB molecules are spherical in shape and they are adsorbed on bubble surface in a closed packed structure at the saturated condition, the calculated diameters for OA and HB molecules were quite similar to the literature values. The variation in γ for both OA and HB were discussed qualitatively relating to the net charge of protein molecule.
