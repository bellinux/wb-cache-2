25|$|If a {{vaccination}} program successfully reduces the disease threat, it {{may reduce the}} perceived risk of disease as cultural memories {{of the effects of}} that disease fade. At this point, parents may feel they <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> by not vaccinating their children. If enough people hope to become free-riders, gaining the benefits of herd immunity without vaccination, vaccination levels may drop to a level where herd immunity ceases to be as effective.|$|E
25|$|While {{recording}} {{his second}} solo album after collaborating on Le Petit Prince, Sébastien attended an audition for the musical The Sun King. While waiting, he met Geraldine Larrosa, (Innocence) and her then-partner Carlos Marín, {{who spoke to}} him after hearing Sébastien sing in online videos. Carlos said it was worth a try, so Sébastien went to the Bastille in Paris, where the auditions were being held by Sonny Takhar. Hearing Izambard Caruso performed the song while playing the piano himself, relaxed and convinced that {{he had nothing to}} lose since he thought would lead nowhere. But Cowell heard him and offered him the job. Sebastien he said to himself: Je Ne Regrette Rien (I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose),.</b> accepted and devoted worldwide in the stateless musical quartet Il Divo in December 2003, along with Urs Bühler (Switzerland), David Miller (US) and Carlos Marín (Spain). Izambard is {{the only member of the}} group who is not classically trained.|$|E

500|$|As {{the body}} of Myrcella Baratheon lies in the Great Sept of Baelor, Jaime Lannister is {{approached}} by the High Sparrow. Jaime threatens the High Sparrow in response to Cersei's treatment at their hands, and the High Sparrow responds that the Faith Militant is large and its soldiers <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> and with their strength, the High Sparrow {{has the power to}} [...] "overthrow an empire," [...] which unnerves Jaime.|$|E
500|$|For {{teams that}} {{face each other}} frequently, players may fight just to send {{the message to the}} {{opposing}} players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games. Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights {{near the end of the}} game when they <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a [...] "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.|$|E

500|$|On the thirtieth {{anniversary of}} the series, Henderson called the {{incident}} [...] "the low point of the series", but would later apologize to Clarke. In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that [...] "from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle." [...] He noted [...] "that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice." [...] Media opinion is divided on the effect it had {{on the outcome of}} the series. The controversy and admissions that have come forth throughout the years have led some to the belief that the incident could be considered a form of cheating. Kharlamov, who {{had been one of the}} Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score. In Clarke's opinion, there were other factors for Team Canada's turnaround in Moscow: [...] "In Moscow we played much better than in Canada. We were almost equal to the Soviet team physically by then, we passed much better, we shot the puck much better, we became faster and played better on defence. Besides, when you <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> it is easier to play. And after the fifth game we had nothing to lose." ...|$|E
2500|$|PV2 Brenda [...] "Mrs. B" [...] Mitchell (Nicki Lynn Aycox) — was a [...] "pig-headed" [...] and obstinate 18-year-old, who {{was more}} of a {{liability}} than an asset to the squad, and to her partner, [...] "Doublewide." [...] She took great umbrage at the fact that her nickname is short for [...] "Mrs. Bitch." [...] As a teen, she was raped and later gave birth to an autistic child who was put into the custody of his grandparents. Hardships in life made her significantly more willing to risk her life under fire since she seemed to <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> She {{is one of the few}} characters to carry an M16A2 rifle instead of an M4 carbine, due to her job as part of a support unit instead of a front-line combat unit like her comrades.|$|E
2500|$|Although Stevenson's eloquent oratory and thoughtful, stylish {{demeanor}} impressed many intellectuals, journalists, political commentators, {{and members}} of the nation's academic community, the Republicans and some working-class Democrats ridiculed what they perceived as his indecisive, aristocratic air. During the 1952 campaign Stewart Alsop, a powerful Connecticut Republican, labeled Stevenson an [...] "egghead", based on his baldness and intellectual air. His brother, the influential newspaper columnist Joe Alsop, used the word to underscore [...] Stevenson's difficulty [...] in attracting [...] working-class voters, and the nickname stuck. Stevenson himself made fun of his [...] "egghead" [...] nickname; in one speech he joked [...] "eggheads of the world unite, you <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> but your yolks!" [...] In his campaign speeches Stevenson strongly criticized the Communist-hunting tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy, labeling [...] "McCarthy's kind of patriotism as a disgrace" [...] and ridiculing right-wing Republicans [...] "who hunt Communists in the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries while hesitating to aid the gallant {{men and women who are}} resisting the real thing in the front lines of Europe and Asia...they are finally the men who seemingly believe that we can confound the Kremlin by frightening ourselves to death." [...] In return, Senator McCarthy stated in a speech that [...] "he would like to get on the Stevenson campaign trail with a club and...make a good and loyal American out of the governor." ...|$|E
