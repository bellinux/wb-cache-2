5|$|Although {{opinions}} <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> {{whether the}} Bala Kanda narrative of Ahalya {{refers to the}} divinity of Rama, later sources assert Rama's divine status, portraying Ahalya as a condemned woman rescued by God. The Bhakti-era poets use the episode as an archetypal example to demonstrate God's saving grace. The main theme of such narratives is her deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of his compassion.|$|E

Educated at Hale School, he studied to be an accountant and was practising on a pastoral property in the Kimberley when war broke out in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{agree that}} the Order of Saint Hubert honors a {{military}} victory of the Duke of Jülich, on Saint Hubert's day, 3November 1444. Sources <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> the specific date of establishment of the Order, whether it celebrated the victory at the Battle of Linnich between Gebhard V of Jülich and Arnold of Egmont (or Egmond), or commemorated the battle at a future date. Consequently, {{the date of the}} founding depends on the source. Still other sources date the founding of the Order as late as 1473 or 1475.|$|E
5|$|Sources <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> {{the exact}} cause {{and extent of}} the {{massacre}} in Maribor. All agree that on 27 January 1919, the Coolidge Mission's delegation, led by Sherman Miles, visited Maribor and found thousands of citizens of German ethnic origin gathered in the main city square and waving flags of German Austria, many of which also decorated nearby buildings. German Austrian sources indicate that there were 10,000 protesters singing songs and wearing patriotic dress. Twenty soldiers under Maister's command were stationed {{in front of the}} city hall, armed with rifles mounted with bayonets.|$|E

By Stowell's account, only one militiaman was killed, but {{as many as half}} of their number deserted along the march. In their struggle to enter Camden Station, the 5th suffered 16 to 24 injuries, but none seriously wounded or killed. Between 9 and 12 civilians were killed, and 13-40 injured.|$|E
5|$|Sources <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> {{the year}} of Linda Syddick's birth. The Art Gallery of South Australia {{suggests}} 1941; Birnberg and Kreczmanski's biographical survey suggests circa 1937. The ambiguity around {{the year of}} birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. She was born near Western Australia's Wilkinkarra, or Lake Mackay, northeast of Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia and northwest of Kintore, Northern Territory.|$|E

Various {{authorities}} (e.g. ITIS 16, GRIN 27, WCSP, NCBI, DELTA) <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> {{the exact number}} of genera included in Liliaceae s.s., but generally there are about fifteen to sixteen genera, depending on whether or not Amana is included in Tulipa and Lloydia in Gagea. For instance Amana is still listed separately in WCSP.|$|E

5|$|Before the battle, both armies {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by smaller units; {{by the time}} of the battle, the Allied forces had about 60,000 men, with another 5,000 holding Frankfurt, and the Prussians had almost 50,000. The Russians and Austrians lost about 15,000 men (approx. 5,000 killed), although some sources suggest a slightly higher number, perhaps 15,600 or 15,700, about 26 percent. Christopher Duffy places Russian losses at 13,477; in addition, the Russians had lost about 4,000 at the Battle of Kay a week earlier. Sources <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> Prussian losses. Duffy maintains 6,000 killed and 13,000 wounded, a casualty rate of more than 37 percent. Gaston Bodart represents losses at 39 percent, and that two thirds (12,000) of the 19,000 casualties were deaths. Frank Szabo places Prussian losses at 21,000.|$|E
5|$|Epatiana succeeded {{his father}} as King of Rurutu around 1886, while still a young child. Due to historians' lack of {{consensus}} about his birth year, sources <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> the actual age of Epatiana at the time. This early succession was a consequence of a decision taken in old age by Epatiana's father to abdicate and journey back to his homeland of Huahine, where he died shortly after arrival. The body of Teuruarii III was repatriated to Rurutu and interred in the royal cemetery. Because of Epatiana's youth and inexperience, his mother Taarouru served as regent for an indeterminate number of years until the prince was deemed fit to rule independently.|$|E
5|$|For {{his support}} he was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel and joined the new General Staff. For seven months, between October 1945 and April 1946, Castillo Armas received training at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, coming in contact with American intelligence officers. After serving on the General Staff, he became director of the military academy until early 1949, at which point he was made the military commander at Mazatenango, a remote military garrison. He was at Mazatenango when Arana launched a failed coup attempt against Arévalo on 18July 1949, and was killed: Castillo Armas did not hear of the revolt until four days later. Historians <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> what happened to him at this point. Piero Gleijeses writes that Castillo Armas was expelled from the country following the coup attempt against Arévalo. Nick Cullather and Andrew Fraser, however, state that Castillo Armas was arrested in August 1949, that Árbenz had him imprisoned under doubtful charges until December 1949, and that he was found in Honduras a month later.|$|E

5|$|From D-Day to 21 August, the Allies landed 2,052,299 men in {{northern}} France. The {{cost of the}} Normandy campaign was high for both sides. Between 6 June {{and the end of}} August, the American armies suffered 124,394 casualties, of whom 20,668 were killed. Casualties within the First Canadian and Second British Armies are placed at 83,045: 15,995 killed, 57,996 wounded, and 9,054 missing. Of these, Canadian losses amounted to 18,444, with 5,021 killed in action. The Allied air forces, having flown 480,317 sorties in support of the invasion, lost 4,101 aircraft and 16,714 airmen (8,536 members of the USAAF, and 8,178 flying under the command of the RAF). The Free French SAS paratroopers suffered 77 killed, with 197 wounded and missing. Allied tank losses have been estimated at around 4,000, with losses split evenly between the American and British/Canadian armies. Historians slightly <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> overall casualties during the campaign, with the lowest losses totaling 225,606 and the highest at 226,386.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{women were}} {{traditionally}} excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics {{and managed to}} acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to late twenties and {{gave birth to a}} daughter before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
