25|$|Three of Mayflowers owners {{applied to}} the Admiralty court for an {{appraisal}} of the ship on May 4, 1624, two years after Captain Jones' death in 1622; one of these applicants was Jones' widow Mrs. Josian (Joan) Jones. This appraisal probably was made to determine the valuation of the ship {{for the purpose of}} settling the estate of its late master. The appraisal was made by four mariners and shipwrights of Rotherhithe, home and burial place of Captain Jones, where the Mayflower was apparently then lying in the Thames at London. The appraisement is extant and provides information on ship's <b>gear</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> at that time, as well as equipment such as muskets and other arms. The ship may have been laid up since Jones' death and allowed to get out of repair, as that is what the appraisal indicates. The vessel was valued at one hundred and twenty-eight pounds, eight shillings, and fourpence.|$|E

The square tuck stern changed into an immersed elliptical counter, either by evolution or adoption of the Southport form, the change being complete before 1880. All of the boats had wide side decks and a long cockpit, {{about a third of}} the beam in width, with low freeboard and a low rail to facilitate lifting the <b>gear</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> These shrimp boats, about , were fast and handy in the shallow waters of Morecambe Bay. The larger boats were called “prawners”, though they were actually used to catch pink shrimps (Pandalus montagui). In addition to the larger prawner (called [...] "sprawner" [...] at Morecambe) a subtype called [...] "bay boat" [...] developed for the holiday trade. The bay boat had a shallow draft so it could operate around Grange-over-Sands at the head of Morecambe Bay.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately for the nationalists, due to {{the chaos}} of the battle and the damage to the {{communication}} <b>gears</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> most of its naval vessels, the decision for the naval units to retreat from the battlefield to save the dying sailors and commanders was not relayed to nationalist force on the island, where the defenders interpreted such retreat as fleeing and abandoning them, and the morale of the land force collapsed as a result. In the meantime, the communist troops landed on the island believed the same and their morale was drastically boosted and their pressure on the defenders intensified. The demoralized nationalist defenders had managed to hold on their positions until the nightfall, and then asked and was allowed retreated from the island under the cover of darkness.|$|R

25|$|Stranded vessels can be {{retracted}} from a {{beach or}} reef {{by the use}} of Grasp's towing machine and propulsion. Additional retraction force can be applied to a stranded vessel through the use of up to six legs of beach gear, consisting of 6,000 pound STATO anchors, wire rope, chain, and salvage buoys. In a typical configuration, two legs of beach <b>gear</b> are rigged <b>on</b> <b>board</b> Grasp, and up to four legs of beach are rigged to the stranded vessel.|$|R
50|$|The main {{components}} of VMS are the department's centralized database, tracking devices, and ArcGIS.

50|$|Capable {{of lifting}} 25 tons with an A-frame derrick mounted forward {{and capable of}} a 100-ton ballast bow lift: an {{exceptional}} salvage platform with air compressors for diving operations and salvage tools. A Clyde salvage winch and a capstan, each with 7.5-ton pulling capacity, provided the muscle needed for the A-frame, the three complete sets of beach <b>gear</b> carried <b>on</b> <b>board</b> (60-ton pull <b>on</b> each leg), and the flexible power needed on independent operations. Two jetting pumps provided dewatering, underwater digging, and auxiliary fire fighting capabilities. Cutting/welding and messing/berthing facilities were also aboard. Two AC generators also provided electrical power to the salvage site and shore power to distressed ships/bases as required. Manned by an Officer in Charge and 16 enlisted men, they often operated independently and were a vital asset to a major salvage job.|$|R

"Gentlemen, I {{never heard}} Lieutenant Glover's name {{until a few}} minutes ago, but I can with {{confidence}} tell you that no more gallant officer {{is to be found}} in the service; and when I say that, with that little ten-gun brigantine and a crew of forty men, he engaged the French frigate that you see behind her and forced her to strike, after a fight in which she had a hundred and seventy men killed or wounded, that he took a hundred and thirty prisoners, and recaptured those two West Indiamen which were her prizes, I think you will all agree that I am not exaggerating. He is naturally very anxious to be off. The frigate's mizzen-mast is lying astern of her, and will make an excellent jury-mast, as all the <b>gear</b> is <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> and only requires shortening.

5000|$|On 26 May Reading {{commenced}} {{conversion to}} a weather ship. An intricate array of meteorological equipment was installed, her number three 3-inch (76 mm) gun mount {{was replaced by}} a hangar for a weather blimp, and a supply of cold weather <b>gear</b> was taken <b>on</b> <b>board</b> before the Reading was declared ready for sea on 10 June. Her first weather station was off Boston, where she was forced to [...] "lie to" [...] because it was too deep to anchor. In the fall, the weather ship moved northward and took station between the Canadian and Icelandic coasts. Weather observations were transmitted 12 times daily and homing signals were radioed to aircraft periodically. When relieved from her station, the ship put into either NS Argentia, Newfoundland or Reykjavík, Iceland for refueling and provisioning.|$|R
50|$|Gee-H {{was used}} to {{supplant}} the Oboe bombing system, both of which worked along similar lines. By measuring and maintaining a fixed distance to a radio station, the bomber was able to navigate along an arc in the sky. They dropped their bombs when they reached a set distance from a second station. The main difference between Oboe and Gee-H was {{the location of the}} equipment; Oboe used very large displays in ground stations to take very accurate measurements but could only direct one aircraft at a time. Gee-H used much smaller <b>gear</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the aircraft and was somewhat less accurate but could direct as many as 80 aircraft at a time.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the efficiency or harvesting capacity 3 of individual fishing vessels can increase over time due to a complex mix of technological and social factors. Rapid advances in effective effort are particularly evident in tuna purse seine fleets. The influence of new and more powerful deck machinery, sophisticated electronics, subscription to satellite image services and the like will be modified by accumulated experience, expertise and, most importantly, the willingness of vessel operators to utilize new technology. Other factors, such as information networks, sharing of FADs, utilization of auxiliary vessels and global tuna market factors will have a strong influence on catch rates, fishing strategies and species targeting. Teasing apart the relative contribution of these factors to increasing efficiency is clearly a difficult task. The most empirical and definable means to monitor increasing fishing power may be through the documentation of new <b>gear</b> and technology <b>on</b> <b>board</b> vessels. However, {{there is a clear}} danger of basing assumptions of fishing power <b>on</b> a simple <b>gear</b> list as it makes no qualification as to how often or how effectively the new gear is utilized.
