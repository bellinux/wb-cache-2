5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the churches}} in the Liberal Catholic movement, only the {{original}} church, the Liberal Catholic Church under Bishop Graham Wale, does not ordain women. The position held by the Liberal Catholic Church is that the Church, even if it wanted to ordain women, {{does not have the}} authority to do so and {{that it would not be}} possible for a woman to become a priest even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> through the ordination ceremony. The reasoning behind this belief is that the female body does not effectively channel the masculine energies of Christ, the true minister of all the sacraments. The priest has to be able to channel Christ's energies to validly confect the sacrament; therefore priests must be male. When discussing the sacrament of Holy Orders in his book Science of the Sacraments, Second Presiding Bishop Leadbeater confirmed that women could not be ordained; he noted that Christ left no indication that women can become priests and that only Christ can change this arrangement.|$|E

When Cliff tells his daughter about what time he expects her home and what attire she should wear, she scoffs at the notion since it is a Friday night and thus, [...] "not a school night."

500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
500|$|Alceste {{required}} some repairs after a {{long journey}} in inclement weather so Maxwell petitioned the viceroy of Canton for permission to travel up the Tigris to a secure anchorage, unaware that Amherst's mission had been unsuccessful. The emperor's attitude towards the British envoy had been off-hand; he showed little interest in Europe or its affairs, and refused a gift from King George as he considered it insufficient. Having received an insulting message {{in response to his}} request, Maxwell decided to enter the river regardless but was soon hailed by a local mandarin who threatened to have the batteries guarding the entrance sink Alceste <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> any further. Still in need of repairs and requiring navigation to Whampoa to collect Amherst, Maxwell told the mandarin that he would proceed in any event. Alceste quickly dealt with the shore defences and 17 war-junks sent to stop her, and continued up the river to Whampoa. There she anchored and received fresh supplies while awaiting the arrival of Amherst and his suite. The incident would later be publicly described as, [...] "A friendly interchange of salutes". Having completed as much of his mission as possible, Amherst boarded Alceste which left Whampoa on 21 January 1817.|$|E

60|$|It {{is curious}} {{that the case}} is {{precisely}} the same with a steam engine. A steamer can cross the Atlantic with a very much smaller supply of coal, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> slowly, than <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> fast. One might imagine {{that it would take}} just twice as much coal to go ten miles an hour as would be required to go five; but in reality it takes more than four times as much--the higher rate of speed requiring a very disproportionate expenditure of power.|$|R
2500|$|Wolf himself saw {{the merit}} of these {{compositions}} immediately, raving to friends {{that they were the}} best things he had yet composed (it was with the aid and urging of several of the more influential of them that the works were initially published). It was now that the world outside Vienna would recognize Wolf as well. Tenor Ferdinand Jäger, whom Wolf had heard in Parsifal during his brief summer break from composing, was present at one of the first concerts of the Mörike works and quickly became a champion of his music, performing a recital of only Wolf and Beethoven in December 1888. His works were praised in reviews, including one in the Münchener Allgemeine Zeitung, a widely read German newspaper. (The recognition was not always positive; Brahms's adherents, still smarting from Wolf's merciless reviews, returned the favor—when they would {{have anything to do with}} him at all. Brahms's biographer Max Kalbeck ridiculed Wolf for his immature writing and odd tonalities; another composer refused to share a program with him, while Amalie Materna, a Wagnerian singer, had to cancel her Wolf recital when allegedly faced with the threat of being on the critics' blacklist <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> on.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{four months}} this {{hospital}} affair continued and love blossomed. This accident left Meena Kumari with a banded left pinky which remained banded throughout her life, {{and she used}} to cover her left hand with a dupatta or saree during shoots. After Kumari was discharged from hospital, the famous telephoning marathon between her and Amrohi began during nights. Soon shooting of the film Anarkali commenced but unfortunately, the producer Makhanlaljee, suffered a crippling financial disaster and the film was abandoned. On 14 February 1952 Meena Kumari, 18, and Kamal Amrohi, 34, secretly got married in a simple [...] "Nikah" [...] ceremony {{in the presence of}} a Qadi and Kumari's younger sister, Mahliqa (Madhu). The Nikah paper was witnessed by Baqar Ali (Kamal Amrohi's friend and assistant) and Qadi's two sons, and signed in the name of Mahjabeen Bano (Meena Kumari's real name) and Syed Ameen Haider (Kamal Amrohi's real name). After the ceremony Amrohi planted a kiss on Kumari's forehead and the newlyweds parted. Amrohi left for Sion and Meena and Madhu returned home. The marriage was kept secret from the family and media, although Kamal Amrohi was already married and had three children from his former wife. After some months, the matrimony news leaked to his father, Ali Bux, by a cook who overheard their midnight phone conversations. The angry father regularly hurled accusations, and recommended a divorce. Meena Kumari remained adamant on her decision, but stayed in her father's house. Meanwhile, Kamal Amrohi planned a film called Daera in 1953. Kumari asked her father's permission for working in the film, but Ali Bux refused on the basis that the dates were given to Mehboob Khan for the film Amar. Reluctantly, Meena Kumari agreed, but after shooting for five days, she instigated a disagreement with Mehboob Khan and left the studios. The following day it was disclosed to her father by some external sources that she was off to Bombay Talkies to work for Daera. Ali Bux warned his daughter that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> for Daera the doors of his house would be permanently shut for her. On 14 August 1953 Meena Kumari drove to Bombay Talkies and worked in front of her husband's camera, and at night, on her return, Ali Bux refused to open the door. Meena Kumari turned her car around and left for her husband's residence at Sion.|$|E
