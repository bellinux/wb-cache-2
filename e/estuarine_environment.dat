5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} in loose schools of tens to {{thousands}} of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of the riverbank and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline—it can survive {{in a wide range}} of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in salinity (and resulting change in buoyancy) by changing the volume of its swim bladder, which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when salinity is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases buoyancy respectively. This adaptation helps the fish in the range of salinities it encounters in its <b>estuarine</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of organisms in the LSZ {{is dependent upon}} both abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors include the physical geography and hydrology of the estuary, including nutrient inputs, sediment load, turbidity, environmental stochasticity, climate and anthropogenic influences. Abiotic factors tend to drive production in the <b>estuarine</b> <b>environment,</b> and are mediated by biotic factors.|$|E
25|$|Visitors walk onto {{a wooden}} boardwalk into a {{full-scale}} re-creation of a southwest Florida mangrove forest and sea grass estuary. The boardwalk passes through mangrove trees, mudflats, and simulated water. Insect, bird, and water sounds combine with slow changes in lighting {{to capture the}} feeling of the environment. A huge 360-degree mural painting extends the view to distant barrier islands, bird rookeries, an upland area, and the heart of mangrove forests. Interpretive panels introduce the critical stories of the rich <b>estuarine</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

25|$|Continuity in {{cultural}} history {{suggests that the}} peoples of those areas were also descended from {{the inhabitants of the}} Archaic period. In the panhandle and {{the northern part of the}} peninsula, people adopted cultivation of maize. Its cultivation was restricted or absent among the tribes who lived south of the Timucuan-speaking people (i.e., south of a line approximately from present-day Daytona Beach, Florida to a point on or north of Tampa Bay.) Peoples in southern Florida depended on the rich <b>estuarine</b> <b>environment</b> and developed a highly complex society without agriculture.|$|E
2500|$|Richardson Bay is {{developed}} on surficial sediments of clays, silts and minor sands and gravels deposited in a primarily marine and <b>estuarine</b> <b>environment</b> {{during periods of}} previous high stands of water relative to the present shoreline. [...] The bay muds are widespread in San Francisco Bay and, at Richardson Bay, are approximately 80 to 95 feet (24 to 30 meters) deep. [...] The Bay Muds are of Holocene Age (less than 10,000 years of age). [...] They overlie firm alluvial soils which contain two sand layers at 92 and 110 feet (29 and 35 meters), respectively. [...] This section, in turn, overlies shale of the Franciscan Complex, a heterogeneous mixture of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rock gathered together {{in the course of}} the tectonic evolution of the region from the Late Jurassic to the Middle Miocene. [...] These assemblages of Franciscan rocks are referred to as tectonostratigraphic terrains and two of them, the Central Belt and the Coastal Belt, are in fault contact near Richardson Bay.|$|E

50|$|Indicator {{species are}} {{also known as}} {{sentinel}} organisms, i.e. organisms which are ideal for biomonitoring. Organisms such as oysters, clams, and cockles have been extensively used as biomonitors in marine and <b>estuarine</b> <b>environments.</b> For example, the Mussel Watch Programme is a world-wide project using mussels to assess environmental impacts on coastal waters. Their well-documented feeding habits, stationary condition and their role as integral parts {{of the food chain}} are some of the main reasons why oysters and mussels are widely used biomonitors. A considerable amount of contaminant concentrations are found in the surficial sediments (i.e. the finer-grained particulate matter, usually muds, silts or clays) of marine and <b>estuarine</b> <b>environments.</b> A major physical process governing the transport of fine particulate material and associated particle-bound contaminants in <b>estuarine</b> <b>environments</b> is resuspension. Strong winds create surface waves, which, in shallow water (<5m), project energy to the water-sediment interface resulting in resuspension of fine sediment from the upper layers of the estuary floor. Once in suspension, fine material may be transported by tidal currents {{to other parts of the}} estuary and possibly to the ocean during multiple reworking phases. Mussels and oysters are filter feeders and therefore uptake is by ingestion of particulates in the water column. Sediment resuspension is thus very important in the bioaccumulation process which aids the evaluation of possible adverse biological effects of sedimentary contaminants in marine and <b>estuarine</b> <b>environments.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Estuarine</b> environments: <b>Estuarine</b> <b>environments,</b> or estuaries, {{are located}} at the lower parts of rivers that flow into the open sea. Since {{they are in the}} seaward section of the drowned valley system they receive {{sediment}} from both marine and fluvial sources. These contain facies that are affected by tide and wave fluvial processes. An estuary is considered to stretch from the landward limit of tidal facies to the seaward limit of coastal facies. Phosphorites are often deposited in fjords within <b>estuarine</b> <b>environments.</b> These are estuaries with shallow sill constrictions. During Holocene sea-level rise, fjord estuaries formed by drowning of glacially-eroded U-shaped valleys.|$|R
