2500|$|For use on {{land the}} AF-2 had {{independently}} mounted wheels, each between {{a pair of}} legs fitted with a shock absorber and hinged on a tube in {{the leading edge of}} the sponson. [...] This arrangement enabled them to be raised by rotation, though still exposed, or lowered in fifteen seconds through a worm <b>gear</b> <b>drive.</b> There was a laminated tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|From 1911 to 1914 Scott's Tourist Trophy racers used {{rotary valves}} {{to control the}} inlet and {{transfer}} phases of the two-stroke cycle. In 1911 the engine was controlled by advancing or retarding the valve timing and not by the throttle. [...] Scott reverted to throttle control in 1912, giving the rotary valves a fixed <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> These contributions would improve engineering applications of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|Strength {{research}} is always {{one of the}} study focuses of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> However, a strength calculation solution, in which bending stresses, contact stresses, and bulk temperatures are included, combined with gear design standards for face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> is still not constructed due to complex face gear teeth. Thus, in this study, an equivalent face gear tooth is proposed by assessment of geometric characteristics of face gear teeth and tooth contact analysis, and a strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> {{which is based on}} ISO 6336 standard associated with the proposed equivalent face gear teeth, is constructed. The fidelity of the proposed strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is verified by comparing its results with the benchmark of results by finite element methods. Furthermore, the impact of geometric parameters on the strength of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is investigated, and some design suggestions are extracted. These contributions would benefit the improvement of engineering applications of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Replacement of {{the steam}} engines began in 1922, {{starting}} at Whitworth Street. Four [...] pumping engines were removed {{and replaced by}} electrically driven centrifugal pumps. The work was completed by 1924. The following year, the remaining [...] pumps were retained, but their steam cylinders were removed, and the flywheels replaced by a helical <b>gear</b> <b>drive,</b> to connect the pumps to [...] electric motors. These were variable speed direct current devices, and a motor converter set had to be installed, to provide the low voltage DC supply from the incoming high voltage alternating current supply. The motor converter set was built in 1914, and was second-hand. The pumps at the Water Street station were converted to electrical operation {{in a similar manner}} soon afterwards.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} has been developed by the authors to estimate the load share of worm <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> and to calculate the instantaneous tooth meshing stiffness and loaded transmission errors. In the approach, the finite element (FE) modelling {{is based on the}} modified tooth geometry, which ensures that the worm gear teeth are in localized contact. The geometric modelling method for involute worm gears allows the tooth elastic deformation and tooth root stresses of worm <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> under different load conditions to be investigated. On the basis of finite element analysis, the instantaneous meshing stiffness and loaded transmission errors are obtained and the load share is predicted. In comparison with existing methods, this approach applies loaded tooth contact analysis and provides more accurate load capacity rating of worm <b>gear</b> <b>drives...</b>|$|R
