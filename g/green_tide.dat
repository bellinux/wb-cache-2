50|$|Damages such as environmental, {{economic}} and health are increasing in frequency, duration and in remote regions. These {{are caused by}} harmful algal blooms (HAB), also known as red tide or <b>green</b> <b>tide.</b> HABs {{have been known to}} produce a wide range of toxins, with newer toxins discovered frequently, which makes the task of understanding these phenomena increasingly difficult. HAB can be found in water of high importance for {{economic and}} environment; with salinity ranging from low to high such as in rivers and lakes to reservoirs and oceans. Toxins seeped into water column where it can get into water supply and affecting humans and livestock. Toxins can have either direct or indirect effect towards an organism. Some marine life is susceptible to toxins caused by HABs while others are affected through accumulation of toxins over a period of time; such as filter-feeding shellÂ¬fish and secondary consumers. It has been estimated that there are thousands of human poisoning cases annually in Asia from toxic water. Single HAB fish-kill events in Korea have been estimated to have cost from $1-100 million in lost fish, while in Japan such events have been estimated to have resulted in losses of fish worth more than $300 million.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that Terra {{moderate}} resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) has low detection and characterization efficiency when mapping a <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> (Ulva prolifera) in the Yellow Sea. To quantify the uncertainty in mapping of the <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> using MODIS data, comparisons were conducted between quasi synchronous MODIS images and in situ observation data, as well as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image. The results show that MODIS images could detect the location of large (> 100 m) floating green algae patches with good positional accuracy but tended to ignore the existence of small patches less than 10 m in width. The floating macroalgae area extracted using MODIS was several times larger than the area mapped using the UAV image. The Sentinel- 2 multispectral instrument, the Chinese high resolution GF- 1 wide field camera, and the Chinese HJ- 1 charge-coupled device are recommended for early <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> detection, whereas MODIS is suitable for <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> monitoring.

40|$|The {{spectacular}} massive <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> of Ulva prolifera in {{the southern}} Yellow Sea, {{which has become a}} recurrent phenomenon in this region over the last 8 years, attracted much attention of scientists and local government. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the early development of green tides in the Yellow Sea, but many questions still remain to be answered. Two years after the first occurrence of massive <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> in the Yellow Sea, a project in the National Basic Research Priority Program (973 project) "Succession of Harmful Algal Blooms in the Coastal Waters of China and the Impacts on Marine Ecosystems (CEOHAB II) " supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China started to perform comprehensive investigations and studies on the early development of green tides {{in the western part of}} the southern Yellow Sea.

40|$|International audienceAll {{over the}} world, {{numerous}} bays and estuarine {{systems that are}} known to shelter essential fish habitats are experiencing proliferations of green macroalgae known as <b>green</b> <b>tides.</b> Although the processes that enhance <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> in response to nutrient enrichment are well known, their consequences for ecological communities -especially for ichthyofauna- remain poorly studied. To estimate these consequences, this analysis focused on {{the two types of}} shallow systems that are experiencing green tides: sandy beaches and estuarine mudflats. In these two systems, macroalgae proliferation and fish community were surveyed along seasonal cycles at control and impacted sites that shared similar physicochemical parameters and sediment structure. To analyse the consequences of <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> on the fish community, a Before-After Control-Impact approach was used. This approach reveals no difference between fish communities at the control and impacted sites before the macroalgal bloom. Then, it underlines an influence of <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> on the fish community, and this influence varies according to the composition, density and duration of the macroalgal bloom. Indeed, when intertidal systems experienced short proliferation and/or weak density, <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> did not seem to impact the fish community. However, when green macroalgae proliferated in large quantities and/or when the proliferation lasted for long periods, the fish community was significantly affected. These modifications in the fish community led to a significant decrease in fish species diversity and density until fish disappeared from impacted sites at high proliferations. Furthermore, the response of fish species to <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> differed according to their functional guilds. Negative consequences for benthic and marine juvenile fish species were beginning at low proliferations, whereas for pelagic fish species they occurred only at high proliferations. Thus, <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> significantly affect fish habitat suitability because they lead to changes in the composition of the fish community and eventually to the local disappearance of fish at high proliferations.

40|$|Coastal ecosystems, {{which provide}} {{numerous}} essential ecological functions for fish, {{are threatened by}} the proliferation of green macroalgae that significantly modify habitat conditions in intertidal areas. Understanding the influence of <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> on the nursery function of these ecosystems is essential to determine their potential effects on fish recruitment success. In this study, the influence of <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> on juvenile fish was examined in an intertidal sandy beach area, the Bay of Saint-Brieuc (Northwestern France), during two annual cycles of <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> with varying levels of intensity. The responses of three nursery-dependent fish species, the pelagic Sprattus sprattus (L.), the demersal Dicentrarchus labrax (L.) and the benthic Pleuronectes platessa L., were analysed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> according to species-specific habitat niche and behaviour. The responses to this perturbation were investigated based on habitat selection and a comparison of individual performance between a control and an impacted site. Several indices on different integrative scales were examined to evaluate these responses (antioxidant defence capacity, muscle total lipid, morphometric condition and growth). Based on these analyses, <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> affect juvenile fish differently according to macroalgal density and species-specific tolerance, which is linked to their capacity to move and to their distribution in the water column. A decreasing gradient of sensitivity was observed from benthic to demersal and pelagic fish species. At low densities of green macroalgae, the three species stayed at the impacted site and the growth of plaice was reduced. At medium macroalgal densities, plaice disappeared from the impacted site and the growth of sea bass and the muscle total lipid content of sprat were reduced. Finally, when high macroalgal densities were reached, none of the studied species were captured at the impacted site. Hence, sites affected by <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> are less favourable nursery grounds for all the studied species, with species-specific effects related to macroalgal density...|$|R

The results showed that macroalgal wastes from the connecting ropes of Porphyra aquaculture rafts {{contributed significantly to the}} original biomass of free-floating green algae. Approximately 6500 t of Ulva prolifera were released into the coastal waters from mid-April to late-May when farmers were cleaning aquaculture facilities. Among the total biomass disposed, about 62. 3 % floated up to the sea surface, which turned into the original floating patches. The floating U. prolifera, with a high growth rate of 26. 3 % per day, dominated in the floating algal patches rapidly, moved northward under the hydrodynamic action, and formed a massive free-floating <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> near the south of Shandong peninsula in early June. The optimal sea temperature and sufficient nutrients in the Yellow Sea facilitated the formation of the <b>green</b> <b>tide.</b> No other source contributing substantially to the initial floating biomass was detected in the survey except those from the connecting ropes of rafts.

These same characteristics are sought after for algae in integrated aquaculture systems. To evaluate the potential use of naturally occurring <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> algae in tropical integrated aquaculture {{the effects of}} key variables on resilience, biomass productivity and bioremediation potential were quantified. Three locally abundant <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> algal species (Cladophora coelothrix, Chaetomorpha indica and Ulva sp.) demonstrated a high tolerance across the extremes of salinity (15 to 45 â°) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN from 7 up to 700 Î¼mols lâ»Â¹) characteristic of tropical aquaculture bioremediation ponds. In a preliminary in situ experiment Cladophora coelothrix demonstrated high growth and survival rates, a high predicted productivity (4 t haâ»Â¹ for a 7 -day harvest cycles) and corresponding nitrogen removal (23 kg N harvestâ»Â¹). Subsequently, {{it was determined that}} large scale, in situ productivity of Cladophora coelothrix during four winter months correlated primarily with nitrogen concentration, position in the pond and stocking density, with a lesser influence of salinity, temperature and the ratio of nitrate nitrogen and total ammonium nitrogen. Growth and resilience were then determined in factorial laboratory and mesocosm experiments, according to environmental fluctuations of an entire growing season. Cladophora coelothrix growth was high irrespective of seasonal fluctuations. Temperature was the key variable for seasonal growth, followed by nitrogen concentration and salinity, and interestingly growth was limited by ~ 20 % when nitrate-N and TAN were available simultaneously. In addition to adequate nitrogen levels, seaweeds under intensive culture require a high flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (Ci) to support productivity. In this study, higher levels of inorganic carbon (Ci), in particular COâ significantly enhanced the productivity of Cladophora coelothrix (26 %), Chaetomorpha linum (24 %) and Cladophora patentiramea (11 %), despite the demonstrated HCOââ» utilization through high pH compensation points (9. 7 - 9. 9) and growth in pH levels up to 9. Finally, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis in combination with logistic equations, using relevant laboratory, mesocosm and field data from all previous data chapters, were used to develop annual model simulations for large-scale algal culture for two locally abundant <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> algae. The logistic model simulations demonstrate that Cladophora coelothrix had a high environmental tolerance and the highest predicted annual productivity of 24. 3 T dry weight haâ»Â¹ yearâ»Â¹, equating to a nitrogen removal of 140 kg haâ»Â¹yearâ»Â¹, whereas the lower environmental tolerance and overall growth of Cladophora patentiramea resulted in a lower annual productivity of 10. 8 T dry weight haâ»Â¹ yearâ»Â¹. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> algae can be cultured in tropical land based ponds with high productivity and nitrogen bioremediation.

40|$|Highly dynamic systems, often {{considered}} as resilient systems, are characterised by abiotic and biotic processes under continuous and strong changes {{in space and}} time. Because of this variability, the detection of overlapping anthropogenic stress is challenging. Coastal areas harbour dynamic ecosystems {{in the form of}} open sandy beaches, which cover {{the vast majority of the}} worldâs ice-free coastline. These ecosystems are currently threatened by increasing human-induced pressure, among which mass-development of opportunistic macroalgae (mainly composed of Chlorophyta, so called <b>green</b> <b>tides),</b> resulting from the eutrophication of coastal waters. The ecological impact of opportunistic macroalgal blooms (<b>green</b> <b>tides,</b> and blooms formed by other opportunistic taxa), has long been evaluated within sheltered and non-tidal ecosystems. Little is known, however, on how more dynamic ecosystems, such as open macrotidal sandy beaches, respond to such stress. This thesis assesses the effects of anthropogenic stress on the structure and the functioning of highly dynamic ecosystems using sandy beaches impacted by <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> as a study case. The thesis is based on four field studies, which analyse natural sandy sediment benthic community dynamics over several temporal (from month to multi-year) and spatial (from local to regional) scales. In this thesis, I report long-lasting responses of sandy beach benthic invertebrate communities to <b>green</b> <b>tides,</b> across thousands of kilometres and over seven years; and highlight more pronounced responses of zoobenthos living in exposed sandy beaches compared to semi-exposed sands. Within exposed sandy sediments, and across a vertical scale (from inshore to nearshore sandy habitats), I also demonstrate that the effects of the presence of algal mats on intertidal benthic invertebrate communities is more pronounced than that on subtidal benthic invertebrate assemblages, but also than on flatfish communities. Focussing on small-scale variations in the most affected faunal group (i. e. benthic invertebrates living at low shore), this thesis reveals a decrease in overall beta-diversity along a eutrophication-gradient manifested in the form of <b>green</b> <b>tides,</b> as well as the increasing importance of biological variables in explaining ecological variability of sandy beach macrobenthic assemblages along the same gradient. To illustrate the processes associated with the structural shifts observed where <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> occurred, I investigated the effects of high biomasses of opportunistic macroalgae (Ulva spp.) on the trophic structure and functioning of sandy beaches. This work reveals a progressive simplification of sandy beach food web structure and a modification of energy pathways over time, through direct and indirect effects of Ulva mats on several trophic levels. Through this thesis I demonstrate that highly dynamic systems respond differently (e. g. shift in Î´ 13 C, not in Î´ 15 N) and more subtly (e. g. no mass-mortality in benthos was found) to anthropogenic stress compared to what has been previously shown within more sheltered and non-tidal systems. Obtaining these results would not have been possible without the approach used through this work; I thus present a framework coupling field investigations with analytical approaches to describe shifts in highly variable ecosystems under human-induced stress...|$|R

40|$|Ulva is the {{dominant}} genus in the <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> events and is considered to have efficient CO 2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). However, little is understood regarding the impacts of ocean acidification on the CCMs of Ulva {{and the consequences of}} thalli's acclimation to ocean acidification in terms of responding to environmental factors. Here, we grew a cosmopolitan green alga, Ulva linza at ambient (LC) and elevated (HC) CO 2 levels and investigated the alteration of CCMs in U. linza grown at HC and its responses to the changed seawater carbon chemistry and light intensity. The inhibitors experiment for photosynthetic inorganic carbon utilization demonstrated that acidic compartments, extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA) and intracellular CA worked together in the thalli grown at LC and the acquisition of exogenous carbon source in the thalli could be attributed to the collaboration of acidic compartments and extracellular CA. Contrastingly, when U. linza was grown at HC, extracellular CA was completely inhibited, acidic compartments and intracellular CA were also down-regulated to different extents and thus the acquisition of exogenous carbon source solely relied on acidic compartments. The down-regulated CCMs in U. linza did not affect its responses to changes of seawater carbon chemistry but led to a decrease of net photosynthetic rate when thalli were exposed to increased light intensity. This decrease could be attributed to photodamage caused by the combination of the saved energy due to the down-regulated CCMs and high light intensity.

We examined the occurrence of an intricate speciation within the clade, including the Qingdao strains, via combined studies of culture, hybridization and phylogenetic analysis. The two entities separated by our phylogenetic analyses of the clade were simply distinguished as U. linza and U. prolifera morphologically by the absence or presence of branches in cultured thalli. The inclusion of sexual strains and several asexual strains were found in each taxon. Hybridizations among the sexual strains also supported the separation by a partial gamete incompatibility. The sexually reproducing Qingdao strains crossed with U. prolifera without any reproductive boundary, but a complete reproductive isolation to U. linza occurred by gamete incompatibility.

Calibration of the biological model was mainly based on the seasonal variation of the maximum nitrogen uptake rate (VmaxN) and the half-saturation constant for nitrogen (KN) to reproduce the internal nutrient quotas measured in situ for each site. In each bay, model predictions were in agreement with observed algal coverage converted into biomass. A numerical tracking method was implemented to identify the contribution of the rivers that empty into the study bays, and scenarios of decreases in nitrate concentration in rivers were simulated.

Biomass, in the form of marine macro-algae, is becoming popular among new renewable energy sources. Fast pyrolysis is one of the most important thermal conversion processes from biomass to bio-fuel. In this work, the marine <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> macroalgae Enteromorpha prolifera was converted into bio-oil by fast pyrolysis in a free-fall reactor at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 750 degrees C.

30|$|We {{found that}} the {{quenching}} coefficients (qP and NPQ) of these two Ulva species {{were related to the}} rETR. The RLCs curves showed a slight down-turn at elevated irradiances (Fig.Â  2). Lavaud et al. suggested that in RLCs this decline may be better linked to dynamic down-regulation of Photosystem II (Lavaud et al. 2004). A decline in rETR is generally attributable to increased energy dissipation via non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) (Ralph et al. 2002). In this study U. prolifera showed a higher increase in NPQ and a lower decrease in qP with increasing irradiance than U. intestinalis (Figs.Â  6, 7). This may suggest more efficacious photoprotection in the former than in the latter. The free-floating U. prolifera suffers more complex and harsh environmental conditions including higher irradiance than the attached U. intestinalis, so more efficacious photoprotection is very important to U. prolifera, and further helps explain its <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> forming potential.|$|E
40|$|China is {{amongst the}} {{countries}} most severely affected by coastal and marine disasters. In this study, the annual variation and geographic {{distribution of the}} direct economic losses and fatalities caused by rapid-onset coastal and marine disasters in China have been analysed. This {{was based on a}} collection of historical documents and official records. The five main hazards include storm surges, rough seas, sea ice, red <b>tides</b> and <b>green</b> <b>tides.</b> The results show that: (1) Storm surges caused the most economic losses (92 % of the total); (2) At national scale, direct economic losses induced by coastal and marine disasters fluctuated with no clear trend; the number of fatalities per year declined, and in relative terms both economic losses and fatalities decreased dramatically throughout time; (3) Substantial heterogeneity exists across the 11 provincial-level administrative regions in terms of the spatial pattern and temporal trends of coastal and marine hazards, exposure, vulnerability and observed impacts. Guangzhou, Fujian, Zhejiang and Hainan provinces experienced the highest direct economic losses and fatalities due to repeated typhoon-induced storm surges. The decline in adverse impacts caused by hazards is due to substantial progress in coastal and marine disaster prevention and migration in China, largely thanks to institutional measures, plus adaptation and mitigation actions at both national and regional levels. Coastal China still faces growing risks due to socio-economic development, climate change, as well as subsidence and new emerging marine disasters (e. g. <b>green</b> <b>tides).</b> Further management needs to promote integrated solutions across socio-economic development, disaster risk reduction and environmental conservation in coastal regions. This should happen at national and international levels as disasters can affect neighboring countries and their marine environments and socio-ecological systems. Lessons may be learnt from countries experiencing similar problems over the long-term...|$|R

40|$|Annually {{recurrent}} green-tides in the Yellow Sea {{have been}} shown to result from direct disposal into the sea of fouling Ulva from Pyropia aquaculture. The role abiotic factors play in Ulva biomass accumulation on rafts was studied to find ways to mitigate this problem. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was very high at all sites, but the highest Ulva biomass was associated with the lowest DIN and anthropogenic N. Under luxuriant background nutrient conditions, variability in temperature and periods of emersion, rather than pH, light and salinity determined Ulva biomass. Two dominant species of Ulva displayed differing tolerances to temperature and desiccation which helped explain why Ulva prolifera dominates floating green-tides. Rather than trying to mitigate <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> only by reducing nutrient pollution, an earlier harvest of Pyropia in southern Jiangsu Province especially before temperatures increase greatly above 10 degrees C during April, could reduce the biomass of U. prolifera disposed from rafts.

40|$|AbstractâIn recent years, enteromorpha prolifera {{detection}} {{has received}} increasing attention. Supervised learning with remote sensing images can achieve satisfactory performances for <b>green</b> <b>tide</b> monitoring. However, data distributions be-tween images obviously differ, {{and it would}} be too costly to label a massive amount of images for enteromorpha prolifera detection. Thus, this paper focuses on detecting enteromorpha prolifera using not only limited labelled data, but also a large amount of unlabelled data. We propose an effective semi-supervised clustering framework for entero-morpha prolifera detection, which can reduce the labelling cost and alleviate the overfitting problem. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and potential of our approach, with almost a 15 % increase from baseline. In addition, the proposed approach can provide quantitative assessments for band data of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, and several often ignored bands, such as bands 5, 6, and 7, are shown to be useful for enteromorpha prolifera detection.

30|$|We {{suspected}} that the oxygen produced from photosynthesis would fill the inner tubes of U. prolifera and keep these buoyant. Then favorable oceanographic conditions and high nutrient levels in the Yellow Sea could support the floating U. prolifera to grow and aggregate and form a <b>green</b> <b>tide.</b> We thus deduced {{that there may be}} a close relationship between photosynthetic activities and capacities and the rapid accumulation of vast green algal biomass. The chlorophyll excitation energy dissipated by fluorescence has an inverse relationship with photosynthetic carbon assimilation (Schreiber 2004). Several selective measuring techniques have been developed to determine the photosynthetic rates, like PAM fluorometry and 77 Â K chlorophyll fluorescence. In recent years, many case studies of Ulva species (Chlorophyceae) have utilised these techniques for measuring the influences of environmental stress on PSII performance (Figueroa et al. 2003; Xia et al. 2004; Bischof et al. 2006; Choi et al. 2010; Luo and Liu 2011; Wang et al. 2012). Although there were differences between Ulva species, growth performance and PSII activity in the researched species were generally sensitive to stress conditions.|$|E

50|$|In mid-June 2010, a large algal bloom, {{consisting}} of enteromorpha algae, developed {{off the coast}} of Shangdong, in the Yellow Sea. Causes of the algal outbreak include marine pollution from sewage and agricultural run-off, in addition to run-off from fish farms, worsened by eutrophication following the drought, subsequent flooding and heat wave, as well as high sea surface temperatures in the area. The bloom continues to expand, and preparations have been made for a flotilla of vessels to ward off the bloom, covering an area of 400 sqkm sq mi, the largest bloom since 2008. The patch of algae since expanded offshore Jiangsu Province, and is pushing toward the city of Qingdao. The Chinese State Oceanic Administration has warned that the algae could threaten marine life and local tourism, and other scientists have stated that the bloom could decompose on beaches and release toxic gases if not cleaned up. Close to 4,000 tonnes a day of algae is being removed from the bloom, to be sent off and used as animal feed or fertilizer. <b>Green</b> and red <b>tides</b> have become more common in China in recent years. The <b>green</b> <b>tides</b> from the current algal blooms can also result in dead zones from localized ocean anoxia.
