It was created in 1986 to develop the Lesotho Highland Water Project, a joint project between Lesotho and South Africa. As of 2012, TCTA has developed or is developing six other dam and bulk water supply projects throughout the country, including the Berg River Dam. TCTA sells bulk water to the government, represented by the Department of Water {{as the owner of}} the Water Boards that treat the water and sell it on to municipalities and mines. TCTA uses these revenues mainly to repay the debt it has raised to finance its infrastructure, its operating costs and to pay royalties to the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lesotho.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{explores the}} role of {{interest}} groups in the politics <b>of</b> the <b>Lesotho</b> Highlands Water Project (LHWP). These types of non-governmental actors have, in the recent past, begun to make inroads into the domain of water politics. Their participation in this milieu stretches from Namibia to China and Latin America. The LHWP also has its fair share involvement of these groups. They seem to focus their attention on the World Bank which is partially funding the LHWP. Their endeavours {{do not seem to}} be very effective due to the existence of certain factors, among others the willingness or rather unwillingness <b>of</b> the <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lesotho</b> and South Africa and of the World Bank to bow to their influence. Therefore, the interest groups are not very influential in their actions against the <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lesotho</b> and South Africa and the World Bank regarding the LHWP...|$|R
50|$|The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) is {{an ongoing}} water supply and {{hydropower}} project {{in the area of}} the Highlands. Developed in partnership between the <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lesotho</b> and South Africa, it comprises a system of several large dams and tunnels throughout the territory of both countries. The project allegedly is said to have had so far negative social and environmental effects.|$|R
40|$|The Lesotho Highlands Water Project, a joint {{development}} effort <b>of</b> the <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lesotho</b> and South Africa, involved {{the construction of}} several large dams and other infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power lines. The purpose of the dam and water transfer project was to provide water to the Gauteng region of South Africa and electricity to Lesotho. Phase 1 B of the project, the Mohale Dam, resulted in the displacement of over 320 households and the inundation of villages, fi elds, and grazing lands. In line with the 1986 Treaty between the <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lesotho</b> and South Africa, the project authorities provided compensation for losses suffered and put in place development projects {{in an effort to}} promote economic self-suffi ciency. This article assesses the degree to which project-affected people in the Lesotho highlands were actively engaged in planning and decision-making regarding their own resettlement and rehabilitation, {{and the extent to which}} public participation contributed to their subsequent welfare...|$|R

40|$|Situated {{within an}} {{analysis}} of regional underdevelopment the dissertation evaluates a self-help (or community development) rural development programme building water supplies in Lesotho. The social and material achievements of the programme are considered; social and cultural constraints to the acceptability and effectiveness of the programme are discussed; the implications of self-help strategy are investigated; and recommendations are made to improve management of the supplies. • The dissertation illustrates {{the use of an}} anthropological perspective in development planning, and is based on an evaluation commissioned in 1975 by the <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lesotho</b> and the United Kingdom. The basic material for the dissertation was gathered in the course of nine months residence in the mountainous Easternmost district of the country, Mokhotlong. Information was obtained by social anthropological fieldwork methods working in a total of fourteen villages. Results show the programme to have achieved very little. The immediate problems faced are an overstimulation of demand for supplies {{and the creation of a}} subs 'al backlog, and a high rate of breakdown among the supplies installed. The material benefits of the programme are minimal; there has been no change in domestic water use patterns and consequently little impact upon health; water quality has improved but this ha...|$|R
