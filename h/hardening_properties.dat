Brick {{continued to be}} manufactured in Italy throughout the period 600-1000 AD but elsewhere the craft of brick-making had largely disappeared {{and with it the}} methods for burning tiles. Roofs were largely thatched. Houses were small and gathered around a large communal hall. Monasticism spread more sophisticated building techniques. The Cistercians may have been responsible for reintroducing brick-making to the area from the Netherlands, through Denmark and Northern Germany to Poland leading to Backsteingotik. Brick remained the most popular prestige material in these areas throughout the period. Elsewhere buildings were typically in timber or where it could be afforded, stone. Medieval stone walls were constructed using cut blocks {{on the outside of the}} walls and rubble infill, with weak lime mortars.

Knowledge about the fresh and <b>hardened</b> <b>properties</b> of mortar {{is fundamental to}} ensure a good performance of masonry walls. Water/cement ratio and aggregates grading are among several variables that influence physical and mechanical behaviour of mortars. An experimental program is presented in order to evaluate the influence of aggregates grading and water/cement ratio in workability and <b>hardened</b> <b>properties</b> of mortars. Eighteen compositions of mortar are prepared using three relations cement:lime:sand, two types of sand and three water/cement ratios. Specimens are analyzed through flow table test, compressive and flexural strength tests. Results indicate that the increase of water/cement ratio reduces the values of <b>hardened</b> <b>properties</b> and increases the workability. Besides, sands grading has no influence in compressive strength. On the other hand, significant differences in deformation capacity of mortars were verified with the variation {{of the type of}} sand.

40|$|Engineerd Cementitious Composites (ECC) is a {{class of}} ultra ductile fiber {{reinforced}} cementitious composites, characterized by a high ductility and a tight crack width control. In the production of ECC, beside mix design, processing is another crucial factor for both fresh and <b>hardened</b> <b>properties</b> of ECC. The processing influences the fresh properties of ECC, and the fresh properties of ECC mortar {{have a significant effect}} on the <b>hardened</b> <b>properties.</b> Therefore, in order to obtain good <b>hardened</b> <b>properties,</b> fresh properties have to be properly controlled, for example, by means of water or chemical admixture adjustments.

After fibers disperse in mortar homogenously, the rest of the liquid materials are added to modify the workability of fresh ECC and the material <b>properties</b> of <b>hardened</b> ECC. In this paper, the influence of different mixing sequences of water was investigated by comparing the experimental results of uniaxial tensile tests.

40|$|Today, ECC {{has been}} {{developed}} to a stage where the material is being used in eld testing and limited full scale constructed facilities. However, the lack of reliable, practical, standardized test methods for determination of the strain <b>hardening</b> <b>properties</b> of the material constitutes a signi cant obstacle for day-to-day structural engineering design and material quality control during construction execution. In practice a simple and robust test method is required on a construction site. The uniaxial tension test (UTT) is regarded too complicated to serve as such. Instead, the widely adopted four point bending test (FPBT) {{may be used for}} this purpose, provided that an appropriate interpretation of the test data is available.

Large deformation {{rheological properties}} of gas cell walls were measured using biaxial extension for a number of doughs of varying breadmaking quality at constant strain rate and elevated temperatures of 25 - 60 degreesC. Strain hardening and failure strain of cell walls both decreased with temperature, with cell walls in good breadmaking doughs remaining stable and retaining their strain <b>hardening</b> <b>properties</b> at higher temperatures (60 degreesC), while the cell walls of poor breadmaking doughs became unstable at lower temperatures (45 - 50 degreesC) and had lower strain hardening.

As predicted by the considered failure criterion, a strain hardening value of I defines a region below which gas cell walls become unstable, and discriminates well between the baking quality of a range of commercial flour blends of varying quality.

Sheet steels with multiphase microstructures exhibit favourable combinations of strength and ductility. The so called TRIP steels have a metastable microstructure that consists of a continuous ferrite matrix containing a dispersion of hard second phases martensite and bainite. These steels also contain retained austenite, at room temperature, that represents {{the source of the}} TRansformation Induced Plasticity effect. When the material is subjected to deformation step, the retained austenite transforms itself into martensite; the produced martensite delays the onset of necking resulting in a product with high total elongation, excellent formability and high crash energy absorption.

Recent work confirms the observation that dynamic shear plateau modulus is essentially independent of variations in MW amongst wheat varieties of varying baking performance and is not related to variations in baking performance, and {{that it is not the}} size of the soluble glutenin polymers, but the structural and rheological properties of the insoluble polymer fraction that are mainly responsible for variations in baking performance. The rheological properties of gas cell walls in bread doughs are considered to be important in relation to their stability and gas retention during proof and baking, in particular their extensional strain <b>hardening</b> <b>properties.</b> Large deformation rheological properties of gas cell walls were measured using biaxial extension for a number of doughs of varying breadmaking quality at constant strain rate and elevated temperatures in the range 25 - 60 degrees C. Strain hardening and failure strain of cell walls were both seen to decrease with temperature, with cell walls in good breadmaking doughs remaining stable and retaining their strain <b>hardening</b> <b>properties</b> to higher temperatures (60 degrees C), whilst the cell walls of poor breadmaking doughs became unstable at lower temperatures (45 - 50 degrees C) and had lower strain hardening.

As predicted by the Considere failure criterion, a strain hardening value of I defines a region below which gas cell walls become unstable, and discriminates well between the baking quality of a range of commercial flour blends of varying quality.
