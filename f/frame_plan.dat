The vernacular building has a wood <b>frame</b> <b>plan</b> and limestone walls and used local materials in its construction, which cost $3,855.55.

At a bare minimum, the roof <b>framing</b> <b>plans</b> should show the rafter layout, specify the size and spacing of the rafters, and specify the allowable span of the rafters. Some engineers today provide only this minimal amount of detail on the roof <b>framing</b> <b>plans</b> they generate. Other engineers provide a much higher degree of detail. In addition to the items mentioned above, they show the location of all roof supports (i.e. struts) and show all purlins with dimensions to tie down their location. Generally speaking, the more detailed the roof <b>framing</b> <b>plan,</b> the higher quality the roof frame engineering.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a {{saliency}} based psycho-visual weighting of the BoVW for object recognition. This approach {{is designed to}} identify objects related to IADL on videos recorded by a wearable camera. These recording give an egocentric point-of-view on the upcoming action. This point- of-view is also characterized by a complex visual scene with several objects on the <b>frame</b> <b>plan.</b> The human visual system functions {{is a way to}} process only the relevant data by considering areas of interest. Based on this idea, we propose a new approach by introducing saliency models to discard irrelevant information in the video frames. Therefore we apply a visual saliency model to weight the image signature within the BoVW framework. Visual saliency is well suited for catching spatio-temporal information related to the observer's attention on the video frame. We also proposed an additional geometric saliency cue that models the anticipation phenomenon observed on subjects watching video content from the wearable camera. The findings show that discarding irrelevant features gives better performances when compared to the baseline method which consider the whole set of features in the images...|$|E

There are opposing methodologies, policies, standards and desired outcomes between these organisations. Do they want to ‘do things right’ or ‘do the right thing?’ This is a literature based study centring on styles, theories and methods of leadership and how they are applied and implemented within the relevant organisations, in both the UK and further afield, in order to frame a discussion regarding the challenges presented by administering students across this nexus...|$|R

Since {{the start of the}} war, Bazaine appeared to lack the appetite for the fight which had been his trademark in his military career to date; this, although imperceptible on the field of battle because his reputation for impassive bearing under fire was beyond question, was only too obvious in the staff offices, where the work of manoeuvring the army and <b>framing</b> <b>plans</b> and orders was chiefly done.

40|$|Variability in {{day-ahead}} {{energy prices}} {{offers the potential}} for reductions in energy expenditures through flexible load planning in which production is shifted to periods of low predicted energy prices. In this paper we present a means of optimizing a production run for the following day and week given basic constraints on the start and end times of production shifts {{as well as the}} total production within a specified time <b>frame</b> (<b>planning</b> horizon). The general problem is a difficult, non-convex optimization problem over stochastic variables that can only be solved in its original form by global optimization and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. However, reasonable approximations to the original problems render it more tractable. By linearizing the energy price forecasts and the plant consumption profile, as well as discretizing the stochastic variables involved, we can reduce the planning problem to a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, with the customary linear bounds...|$|R
40|$|The article deploys Bauman’s {{metaphor of}} the ‘gardening’ state to {{consider}} the imbrication of planning and {{the dark side of}} modernity. It interrogates the public production and defence of urban spaces suitable for people deemed to have value. Using empirical material from urban Zimbabwe, I <b>frame</b> <b>planning</b> as a spatial technology of the gardening state and peer into its handling of informality under two main themes: first, the perception, construction and designation of ‘weeds’, and second, the declaration and treatment of the ‘weeds’. Situating Bauman’s metaphor in the nexus between planning, the state and informality, I conclude that the metaphor paints a helpful but inadequate picture. I argue that while the metaphor is helpful with regards to the first theme, refinements are needed in its application to the second. Rather than see planning enforcement as a rational-scientific practice, a nuanced conceptualisation is needed that explicitly acknowledges the messy business of politics...|$|R

40|$|Agile {{autonomous}} {{systems are}} emerging, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), that must robustly perform tightly coordinated time-critical missions; for example, military surveillance or search-and-rescue scenarios. In the space domain, execution of temporally flexible plans has provided an enabler for achieving the desired coordination and robustness. We address {{the challenge of}} extending plan execution to non-holonomic systems that are controlled indirectly through the setting of continuous state variables. Our solution is a novel model-based executive that takes as input a temporally flexible state plan, specifying intended state evolutions, and dynamically generates an optimal control sequence. To achieve optimality and safety, the executive plans into the future, <b>framing</b> <b>planning</b> as a disjunctive programming problem. To achieve robustness to disturbances and tractability, planning is folded within a receding horizon, continuous planning framework.
