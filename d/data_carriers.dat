50|$|The EPCIS {{standard}} was originally conceived {{as part of}} a broader effort to enhance collaboration between trading partners by sharing of detailed information about physical or digital objects. The name EPCIS reflects the origins of this effort in the development of the Electronic Product Code (EPC). However, EPCIS does not require the use of Electronic Product Codes, nor of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) <b>data</b> <b>carriers,</b> and as of EPCIS 1.1 does not even require instance-level identification (for which the Electronic Product Code was originally designed). The EPCIS standard applies to all situations in which visibility event data is to be captured and shared, and the presence of “EPC” within the name is of historical significance only.|$|E
50|$|A key {{principle}} of EPCIS is that unlike raw data captured from <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> such as bar codes and RFID tags, EPCIS events include additional information that imbues the raw observations with meaning {{relative to the}} physical or digital world and to specific steps in operational or analytical business processes. An EPCIS event, while containing {{much of the same}} data as an RFID tag read or a bar code scan, is at a semantically higher level because it incorporates an understanding of the business context in which the identifier data were obtained. Moreover, there is no requirement that an EPCIS event be directly related to a specific physical data carrier observation. For example, an EPCIS event may indicate that a perishable trade item has just crossed its expiration date; such an event may be generated purely by software.|$|E
