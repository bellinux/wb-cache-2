40|$|Abstract—Using <b>high-resolution</b> <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> {{displays}} for TV systems, {{the visibility}} of signal impairments has grown. As a solution, content-based image processing {{can be used for}} obtaining higher levels of picture-quality improvement, thereby outperforming traditional TV image-enhancement methods. This paper presents a new algorithm and feature model for blue sky detection, which enables content-adaptive enhancement of TV video sequences. The algorithm analyzes the image, creates adaptive position and color models, and classifies the sky areas of the image using a pixel-accurate soft segmentation. Such a probabilistic measure matches well with the requirements of typical video enhancement functions in TVs. We have evaluated the proposal for typical and critical natural scenes, and obtained a clear improvement over state-of-the-art techniques. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} experiments investigating {{factors that}} contribute to the readability of computer displays. We present two experiments that focus on reading text from various display technologies, ranging from paper to novel, <b>high-resolution,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> displays. This work represents a sequence of controlled experiments and field studies aimed at better understanding the affordances of paper and corresponding design requirements for portable reading devices. Our efforts update previous studies and consider new factors afforded by advances in display technology. Although our findings indicate no statistically significant performance differences between reading from paper and reading from electronic displays for intensive, short proofreading tasks, users nonetheless indicate a strong subjective preference for paper. Evidence from a second experiment indicate that the previously unexamined factors of weight, flexibility and thickness are significant factors behind this...|$|E
40|$|The Virtual Book Project {{explored}} {{the use of}} a prototype electronic reading appliance to replace paper as the medium for reading and browsing a wide variety of material. The research hypothesis was that the relevant technologies for <b>high-resolution</b> <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> displays and the associated storage, processing and communication components were reaching thresholds that enabled them to compete successfully with paper for sustained reading. Our research strategy was to build and deploy a dozen prototype units, gaining hands-on experience with the issues involved in their use. Our experience with the Lectrice prototype shows that reading appliances are indeed crossing the threshold to practicality, but that a number of challenges remain to make these devices fully competitive with some of the more subtle advantages of paper. At the same time, the inherent advantages of electronic media make the long-term prospects for reading appliances very compelling. This report describes Lectrice, summariz [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Polycrystalline silicon {{thin film}} {{transistors}} (poly-Si TFTs) {{are used in}} a wide variety of applications, and will figure prominently in the future <b>high-resolution,</b> high-performance <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> display technology. However, it is difficult to fabricate high performance poly-Si TFTs at temperatures lower than 300 °C and the temperature of the process is limited to less than 600 °C on glass. This paper describes a high temperature process above 750 °C to obtain poly-Si films. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer was deposited on a flexible Mo metal substrate and crystallized by rapid thermal annealing. The a-Si:H films were crystallized at various temperatures between 750 °C to 1050 °C. The high temperature annealed poly-Si films illustrated field effect mobilities higher than 67 cm 2 /Vs. The poly-Si TFT showed an improved Ion/Ioff ratio of 10 6, reduced gate threshold voltage, and a field effect mobility increased by three orders. In this paper, we introduce the new TFTs process on a flexible substrate a very promising roll-to-roll process, and exhibit the properties of high temperature crystallized poly-Si TFT on Mo substrate...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{we suggest}} {{a kind of}} {{metallic}} planar microlenses, consisting of finite-sized two-dimensional nanohole arrays with a triangular lattice distribution. When the lens size and the spacing between two adjacent microlenses become comparable to the working wavelength, the diffraction effect cannot be ignored anymore, which is normally out of consideration for the conventional microlens arrays. Based on the FDTD numerical simulation method, the focusing performance of the microlenses in an array is investigated in detail as the spacing between adjacent microlenses, the working wavelength, the diameter of microlenses, and the array size are changing. The results show that a larger spacing, a larger lens size, a shorter wavelength, or a smaller array scale {{can lead to a}} weaker focusing coupling effect. This research provides a valuable reference to design an array of metallic planar microlenses and to have a good control over its focusing performance. Nevertheless, a further study on this topic is needed to verify the simulation results by the experiments, and also some other problems like the polarization-related coupling and the fringing effect of the focusing remain to be investigated further. The broadband focusing capabilities and the miniaturization of microlenses and their arrays proposed opens a great potential for such applications as <b>high-resolution</b> imaging, <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> displays, beam collimating for optical fibers, and high-efficiency solar cells.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} for room temperature, solution-based fabrication of alternating current thin-film electroluminescent (AC-TFEL) devices using phosphor-doped nanocrystals. Synthesis for stable ZnSe/ZnS:Mn/ZnS nanocrystals that exhibit a quantum yield of 65 (5 % is outlined, and their electroluminescence is demonstrated in structures consisting of only wide band gap ceramic layers. Both the nanocrystal and the ceramic films have minimal absorption across the visible light spectrum, enabling us to demonstrate transparent AC-TFEL devices. Alternating current thin-film electroluminescent (AC-TFEL) devices already occupy {{a segment of}} the large area, <b>high-resolution,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> display market. AC-TFEL displays are robust, possess long lifetimes, and offer high luminance with relatively low power consumption. 1 AC-TFEL devices consist of a phosphor layer, such as manganese-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Mn), vertically sandwiched between two insula-tors that are contacted by electrodes.

The experimental setup was designed to allow cyclic loading of the sample of pelvic bone with implanted cemented acetabular component. The hip contact force of required direction and magnitude was applied to the implant using a spherical femoral component head. The most unfavorable activity (downstairs walking) was simulated.

Our {{aim was to}} assess the role of <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> detector CT in brain arteriovenous malformations, which has not yet been assessed. Five patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were studied with <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> detector CT, DSC-MR imaging, and vessel-encoded pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling. In glomerular brain arteriovenous malformations, perfusion was highest next to the brain arteriovenous malformation with decreasing values with increasing distance from the lesion. An inverse tendency was observed in the proliferative brain arteriovenous malformation. <b>Flat</b> <b>panel</b> detector CT, originally thought to measure blood volume, correlated more closely with arterial spin-labeling-CBF and DSC-CBF than with DSC-CBV. We conclude that <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> detector CT perfusion depends on the time point chosen for data collection, which is triggered too early in these patients (ie, when contrast agent appears in the superior sagittal sinus after rapid shunting through the brain arteriovenous malformation).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A recent {{development}} in radiology {{is the use}} of <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> detectors in CT to obtain higher-resolution images. This technique is known as <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> volume CT (fpVCT). We sought to compare the image quality and diagnostic value of 2 different <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> detector–equipped scanners: one is a prototype fpVCT scanner, and the other is a so-called <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> digital volume tomography (fpDVT) scanner, which is routinely used in clinical setup with current state-of-the-art multisection CT (MSCT) scanners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five explanted temporal bones and 2 whole-head cadaveric specimens were scanned with fpVCT, fpDVT, and MSCT scanners. The image series were blindly evaluated by 3 trained observers who rated 38 anatomic structures with regard to their delineation/appearance. RESULTS: Although the image quality obtained with fpVCT and fpDVT was rated significantly better compared with MSCT on isolated temporal bones, the differences were not significant when whole cadaveric heads were scanned. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretic and practical advantages exist for <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> detector–equipped scanners, including improved image quality.
