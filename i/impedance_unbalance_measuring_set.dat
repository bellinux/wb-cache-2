At sufficient production, measurements show a high distortion of phase voltage and variable waveform of both phase voltage and current. Analysis of the installation showed that a Yy 0 transformer is used introducing a high zero sequence <b>impedance.</b> <b>Unbalance</b> in the injected current combined with a high zero sequence impedance leads to a high neutral-ground voltage and distorted phase-neutral voltages.

40|$|On {{the roof}} of a wool {{processing}} company a 385 kWp PV installation is installed. When production of the installation is more than 60 % of the rated power the circuit breaker trips. Measurements show high THD(U) of phase voltages and variable waveform of both voltage and current. Analysis of the installation showed that a Yy 0 transformer is installed introducing a high zero sequence field <b>impedance.</b> <b>Unbalance</b> in the injected current combined with a zero sequence impedance leads to high voltage drops and distorted phase voltages. Measurements also show high RMS values of the current in the neutral conductor. Analyses show that the tripping of the circuit breaker is caused by the measurement method of the device itself. Higher current values are calculated due to multiple zero crossings of both voltage and current.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for studying electromechanical transients in power systems using three phase, combined {{transmission and distribution}} models (hybrid models). The methodology models individual phases of an electric network and associated unbalance in load and generation. Therefore, the impacts of load unbalance, single phase distributed generation and line <b>impedance</b> <b>unbalance</b> on electromechanical transients can be studied without using electromagnetic transient simulation (EMTP) programs. The implementation of this methodology in software is called the Three Phase Dynamics Analyzer (TPDA). Case studies included in the paper demonstrate the accuracy of TPDA {{and its ability to}} simulate electromechanical transients in hybrid models. TPDA has the potential for providing electric utilities and power system planners with more accurate assessment of system stability than traditional dynamic simulation software that assume balanced network topology.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{influence}} of the static unbalance on an infrared missile guidance system, a new static <b>unbalance</b> <b>measure</b> system for the gimbals axes has been developed. Considering the coupling effects caused by a mass eccentricity, the static balance condition and measure sequence for each gimbal axis are obtained. A novel static unbalance test approach is proposed after analyzing the dynamic model of the measured gimbal axis. This approach is to drive the measured gimbal axis to do sinusoidal reciprocating motion in a small angle and collect its drive currents in real time. Then the static <b>unbalance</b> of the <b>measured</b> gimbal axis can be obtained by the current multi-cycle integration. Also a measuring system using the proposed approach has been developed. A balanced simulator is used to verify the proposed approach by the load and repeatability tests. The results show the proposed approach enhances the efficiency of the static unbalance measurement, and the developed measuring system is able to achieve a high precision with a greater stability...|$|R

Borel sets B in R (or in a Polish group) {{for which there}} is a {{translation}} invariant Borel measure assigning positive and σ-finite measure to B. We investigate which sets can be written as a (disjoint) union of <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We show that every Borel nullset B⊂R of the second category is larger than any nullset A⊂R in the sense that there are partitions B=B_ 1 ∪ B_ 2, A=A_ 1 ∪ A_ 2 and gauge functions g_ 1, g_ 2 such that the Hausdorff measures satisfy H^g_i(B_i) = 1 and H^g_i(A_i) = 0 (i= 1, 2). This implies that every Borel set of the second category is a union of two <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We also present Borel and compact sets in R which are not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> This is done in two steps.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the methods used}} to design elastomerically damped supports for high-speed, flexible rotor-bearing systems. The procedure consists of using a damped natural frequency analysis to identify stiffness and damping requirements for the supports over the speed range. Optimum values for these coefficients are found and unbalance response analysis {{is used to calculate}} expected rotor behavior. Equations for calculating the shear and compressive stiffness and damping of button-type elastomer mounts are given, as is a procedure for their application to the design of the elastomeric mounts. These techniques were successfully applied to the design of damped elastomeric supports for a high-speed rotor, which traverses two bending critical speeds. Results of the testing showed that the rotor was well behaved and showed linear response to <b>unbalance.</b> <b>Measured</b> modal damping exceeded expectations and tests were conducted with both high- and low-loss elastomers, enabling the exploration of the practical range of elastomer damping capability...|$|R

40|$|A model-based new {{procedure}} {{for measuring the}} single electrode-gel-skin impedance (ZEGS) is presented. The method is suitable for monitoring the contact impedance of the electrodes of a large array with limited modifications of the hardware and without removing or disconnecting the array from the amplifier. The procedure is based on multiple measurements between electrode pairs and is particularly suitable for electrode arrays. It {{has been applied to}} study the effectiveness of three skin treatments, with respect to no treatment, for reducing the electrode-gel-skin impedance (ZEGS) and noise: (i) rubbing with alcohol; (ii) rubbing with abrasive conductive paste; (iii) stripping with adhesive tape. The complex impedances ZEGS of the individual electrodes were measured by applying this procedure to disposable commercial Ag-AgCl gelled electrode arrays (4 × 1) with a 5 mm 2 contact area. The <b>impedance</b> <b>unbalance</b> ΔZ = ZEGS 1 − ZEGS 2 and the RMS noise (VRMS) were measured between pairs of electrodes. The tissue impedance ZT was also obtained, as a collateral result. Measurements were repeated at t 0 = 0 min and at t 30 = 30 min from the electrode application. Mixed linear models and linear regression analysis applied to ZEGS, ΔZ and noise VRMS for the skin treatment factor demonstrated (a) that skin rubbing with abrasive conductive paste is more effective in lowering ZEGS, ΔZ and VRMS (p < 0. 01) than the other treatments or no treatment, and (b) a statistically significant decrement (p < 0. 01), between t 0 and t 30, of magnitude and phase of ZEGS.

50|$|The null cover {{characterization}} {{conveys the}} intuition that a random real number {{should not have}} any property that is “uncommon”. Each <b>measure</b> 0 <b>set</b> {{can be thought of}} as an uncommon property. It is not possible for a sequence to lie in no <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets,</b> because each one-point <b>set</b> has <b>measure</b> 0. Martin-Löf's idea was to limit the definition to <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> that are effectively describable; the definition of an effective null cover determines a countable collection of effectively describable <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> and defines a sequence to be random if it does not lie in any of these particular <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets.</b> Since the union of a countable collection of <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> has <b>measure</b> 0, this definition immediately leads to the theorem that there is a <b>measure</b> 1 <b>set</b> of random sequences. Note that if we identify the Cantor space of binary sequences with the interval 0,1 of real numbers, the measure on Cantor space agrees with Lebesgue measure.|$|R
