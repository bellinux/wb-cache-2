5|$|Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) {{is brought}} to a maximum {{security}} military prison to begin a ten-year sentence for his decision (in violation of a presidential order) to send U.S. troops on a mission in Burundi, resulting {{in the deaths of}} eight soldiers. Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling <b>it</b> <b>something</b> no actual battlefield veteran would ever have.|$|E

5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of <b>it,</b> <b>something</b> that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

The defence asserted that the abdominal scar identified by pathologist Spilsbury was really just folded tissue, for among other things, it had hair follicles growing from <b>it,</b> <b>something</b> scar tissue could not have; Spilsbury noted that the sebaceous glands appeared at the ends but not {{in the middle of the}} scar.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the new-born {{child is}} {{associated}} with a newly planted tree with which its life is supposed to be bound up; or, on ceremonial occasions (betrothal, marriage, ascent to the throne), a personal relationship of this kind is instituted by planting trees, upon the fortunes of which the career of the individual depends. Sometimes, boughs or plants are selected and the individual draws omens of life and death. Again, a person will put themselves into relationship with a tree by depositing upon <b>it</b> <b>something</b> which has been in close contact with them, such as hair or clothing.|$|E
25|$|For Anaximander, the {{principle}} of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is <b>it</b> <b>something</b> halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth. Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example, water can only be wet, never dry — and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could {{any of the other}} candidates. He postulated the apeiron as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.|$|E

25|$|He first {{submitted}} the piece {{to appear at}} the Cubist Salon des Indépendants, but Albert Gleizes (according to Duchamp {{in an interview with}} Pierre Cabanne, p.31) asked Duchamp's brothers to have him voluntarily withdraw the painting, or to paint over the title that he had painted on the work and rename <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else. Duchamp's brothers did approach him with Gleizes' request, but Duchamp quietly refused. However, there was no jury at the Salon des Indépendants and Gleizes was in no position to reject the painting. The controversy, according to art historian Peter Brooke, was not whether the work should be hung or not, but whether or not it should be hung with the Cubist group.|$|E
25|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{and other forms}} of torture—self-inflicted or otherwise—were common to many parts of Mesoamerica. Thus the rite was nothing new to the Aztecs when they arrived to the Valley of Mexico, nor was <b>it</b> <b>something</b> unique to pre-Columbian Mexico. Other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Purépechas and Toltecs, performed human sacrifices as well and from archaeological evidence, it probably existed since the time of the Olmecs (1200–400 BC), and perhaps even throughout the early farming cultures of the region. Although the extent of human sacrifice is unknown among several Mesoamerican civilizations, such as Teotihuacán, what distinguished Maya and Aztec human sacrifice was the importance with which it was embedded in everyday life.|$|E
25|$|The Senators {{knew from}} {{observation}} that Chára {{would be a}} reliable defender, and were also {{aware that he was}} growing into his body and improving his skills each year. However, Chára grew in ways that exceeded all expectations. In 2001–02, during his first year in Ottawa, he recorded new career highs in goals (10) and points (23) as he turned into a bona fide two-way defenseman. His powerful slapshot continued to improve, and Ottawa began to deploy him on the power play to use <b>it,</b> <b>something</b> the Islanders had rarely done. It resulted in four of Chára's goals being scored with the man advantage that season. The following year, in 2002–03, Chára began to blossom into an elite NHL defenseman. He posted new career highs with 30 assists and 39 points and became one of Ottawa's top two defenders, along with Wade Redden. He also earned his first All-Star Game appearance, where he recorded the second-hardest shot behind Al MacInnis in the Skills Competition.|$|E

25|$|The end of 1912 saw {{the end of}} a year of {{political}} struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for not paying attention to their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer trying to convince the King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the Royal Assent on <b>it,</b> <b>something</b> that horrified Law's constitutional law adviser A.V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable– they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write a memo to Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule be put to the electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.|$|E

[...] Powderfinger manager Paul Piticco commented that [...] "their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability".|$|E
