5|$|Beale {{suggested}} that, {{in addition}} to a military fort, the route was also in immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements. Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and San Bernardino, California, a distance of , were the Zuni and Laguna pueblos. According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> of the route, and his interpreter, Petro. Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping with the animals in the pack train. The Rose–Baley Party paid Savedra's fee of $500 in advance.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the goals}} of CRM are the identification, preservation, and {{maintenance}} of cultural sites on public and private lands, {{and the removal of}} culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination {{to determine whether or not}} any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.|$|E
25|$|Some of Lauffray’s {{results were}} further corroborated during {{investigations}} {{at the site}} in 1987. A joint Syrian–French mission was initiated in 2006 by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM) and the Paul Valéry University from Montpellier in France. The mission was led by Sylvie Blétry. After an <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> mission in 2006, three excavation and restoration seasons took place between 2007 and 2009. Apart from a renewed investigation and mapping of the public buildings and ramparts, the Syrian–French mission also excavated areas with residential architecture. During the 2009 season, the necropolis was also mapped, resulting in the discovery of more than 100 new tombs.|$|E
25|$|An <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> {{conducted}} by the UNDP estimates that 14,000 homes, 68 government buildings, and 31 non-governmental organization offices (NGOs) were either totally or partially damaged. As a result, an estimated 600,000 tonnes of concrete rubble {{will need to be}} removed. Since 2007, construction material have not permitted entry into Gaza, adversely affecting UN projects, in particular UNRWA and UNDP which were forced to suspend more than $100 million in construction projects due to lack of materials. Another UNDP rapid damage assessment of 170 out of the 407 government and private schools in the Gaza strip found that ten schools were severely damaged, and that 160 government and ten private schools were partially damaged during the Israeli military operation. Eight kindergartens were severely damaged and 60 were partially damaged. The UN humanitarian office stated that repairing such schools remains an urgent priority. Ten UNICEF tents were brought to Gaza to be used as learning spaces in the most damage-stricken areas. The Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories has confirmed that there is as yet no intention to revise the policy prohibiting clearance of reconstruction materials which would enable aid agencies working in Gaza to transition to rehabilitation and reconstruction.|$|E

As part of the work, a three-dimensional laser scan of the stonework was undertaken, and a steel and oak walkway was installed around {{the interior of the}} castle. The castle reopened to the public in 2012, and the following year it [...] was removed from English Heritage's at risk register. The castle is protected under UK law as a grade II* listed building and as a scheduled ancient monument.|$|E
500|$|In 1778, the French National Stud {{performed}} an <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> of the breed {{and found that}} most were black or dark bay. During the 1800s, gray horses began to appear, {{and it was the}} predominating color {{by the end of the}} century. Gray became a popular color during this time due to the use of the horses to haul fish at night– gray horses were more visible in the dark, and therefore more valuable. In the later years of the 20th century, breeders again began to prefer darker colors such as bay and chestnut. Today, chestnut, gray and black are the only colors allowed by the French breed registry, with the vast majority of horses being gray– a popular phrase says that the horses have coats [...] "the color of the clouds from the coast".|$|E
500|$|In April 1936, Hely took {{command of}} No.3 Squadron's North Australia Survey Flight, {{one of two}} such flights formed by the Air Force that month to carry out {{photographic}} surveys. Flying a twin-engined de Havilland Dragon Rapide (serial number A3-2), Hely departed Richmond on 11April for Port Hedland, {{which was to be}} the flight's base for its <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> work in Western Australia. Over the Northern Territory, between Newcastle Waters and Wave Hill, he became lost, ran out of fuel, and had to crash land. He and his crew of two were found by RAAF search aircraft ten days later, on 22April. The Argus had reported that [...] "grave fears" [...] were held for their safety, but they were largely uninjured, Hely having suffered cuts and abrasions to his head and leg. The aircraft was badly damaged and had to be transported back to Richmond in pieces. In February 1937, Hely took part in the search for a missing Stinson airliner that was eventually found in the McPherson Range, Queensland, five of its seven passengers and crew dead.|$|E

500|$|Nature for Pliny was divine, a pantheistic concept {{inspired}} by the Stoic philosophy which underlies much of his thought. But the deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve the human race: [...] "nature, that is life" [...] is human life in a natural landscape. After an <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> of cosmology and geography, Pliny starts his treatment of animals with the human race, [...] "for whose sake great Nature appears to have created all other things". This teleological view of nature was common in antiquity and {{is crucial to the}} understanding of the Natural History. The components of nature are not just described in and for themselves, but also with a view to their role in human life. Pliny devotes a number of the books to plants, with a focus on their medicinal value; the books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in architecture, sculpture, painting and jewellery. Pliny's premise is distinct from modern ecological theories, reflecting the prevailing sentiment of his time.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, American {{livestock}} breed enthusiasts, including scientists, farmers, and historians, {{became increasingly}} {{aware of the}} disappearance of many traditional livestock breeds in the US. This awareness was partially due to difficulties encountered in obtaining heritage breeds for living history sites. This was particularly evident when historians were searching for historically authentic breeds to display at the Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts and were unable to find sheep of the Vermont strain of Merino, as they had gone extinct. As a result, these historians and others decided to attempt preservation of other rare breeds facing extinction. On March 16, 1977, the American Minor Breeds Conservancy was incorporated in Vermont. It was the first United States organization focused on preserving rare breeds of livestock and promoting genetic diversity among livestock breeds, and remains the preeminent organization in this field in the United States. A similar organization in Great Britain, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, had been formed in 1973. The organization conducted its first comprehensive survey of American livestock breeds in 1985. Since then, the survey has been repeated every five years, with the status of endangered breeds being monitored in between. The <b>initial</b> <b>survey</b> was called [...] "the most comprehensive assessment of livestock genetic resources ever conducted in the United States". In 1986, a fellow organization, Rare Breeds Canada, was formed, and the two bodies have worked together closely to preserve and promote breeds that have populations in the US and Canada. [...] In 1993, the organization {{changed its name to}} the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy (ALBC). In 2013, the organization again shortened its name to [...] "The Livestock Conservancy".|$|E
