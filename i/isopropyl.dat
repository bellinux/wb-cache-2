5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|Several {{herbicides}} {{were discovered}} {{as part of}} efforts by the USA and the British to develop herbicidal weapons for use during World War II. These included 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), 2,4,5-T (coded LN-14, and also known as trioxone), MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, 1414B and 1414A, recoded LN-8 and LN-32), and <b>isopropyl</b> phenylcarbamate (1313, recoded LN-33).|$|E
5|$|Treatment of an ester or lactone with AlMe3 or AlMe2Cl affords the {{corresponding}} Weinreb amide in good yields. Alternatively, non-nucleophilic Grignard reagents such as <b>isopropyl</b> magnesium chloride {{can be used}} to activate the amine before addition of the ester.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> {{alcohol is}} esterified to give <b>isopropyl</b> acetate, another solvent. It reacts with carbon {{disulfide}} and sodium hydroxide to give sodium isopropylxanthate, an herbicide and an ore flotation reagent. <b>Isopropyl</b> alcohol reacts with titanium tetrachloride and aluminium metal to give titanium and aluminium isopropoxides, respectively, the former a catalyst, {{and the latter}} a chemical reagent. This compound {{may serve as a}} chemical reagent in itself, by acting as a dihydrogen donor in transfer hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> {{alcohol is}} often used in DNA extraction. It is added to a DNA {{solution}} in order to precipitate the DNA which then forms a pellet after centrifugation. This is possible because DNA is insoluble in <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> alcohol has {{a maximum}} {{absorbance}} at 205nm in an ultraviolet-visible spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Since 2007, reformulated poppers {{containing}} <b>isopropyl</b> nitrite {{are sold}} in Europe; isobutyl nitrite is prohibited.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> {{alcohol is}} {{oxidized}} to form acetone by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, {{and has a}} biological half-life in humans between 2.5 and 8.0 hours.. Unlike methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, the metabolites of <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol are less toxic, and treatment is largely supportive. Furthermore, {{there is no indication}} for the use of fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, unless co-ingestion with methanol or ethylene glycol is suspected.|$|E
25|$|Using the A-Values of the {{hydroxyl}} and <b>isopropyl</b> subunit, {{the energetic}} {{value of a}} favorable intramolecular hydrogen bond can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> {{alcohol is}} {{oxidized}} to form acetone by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, but has occasionally been abused by alcoholics, {{leading to a}} range of adverse health effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> nitrite poppers {{may be a}} {{cause of}} maculopathy (eye damage), as {{reported}} in France and the United Kingdom. Some studies have concluded {{that there may be}} increased risk for at least temporary retinal damage with habitual popper use in certain users; {{in a letter to the}} New England Journal of Medicine, an ophthalmologist described four cases in which recreational users of poppers suffered temporary changes in vision. Foveal (center-of-gaze) damage has also been described, in six habitual users of poppers. In 2014, optometrists and ophthalmologists reported having noticed an increase in vision loss in chronic popper users in the United Kingdom, associated with the substitution of <b>isopropyl</b> nitrite.|$|E
25|$|Crude acetone is {{hydrogenated}} in {{the liquid}} phase over Raney nickel or {{a mixture of}} copper and chromium oxide to give <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol. This process is useful when coupled with excess acetone production, such as the cumene process.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, 1.5 {{million tonnes}} of <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol was {{produced}} in the United States, Europe, and Japan. This compound is primarily produced by combining water and propene in a hydration reaction. It is also produced by hydrogenating acetone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> alcohol (rubbing alcohol) is {{effective}} as a topical insecticide, particularly on scale insects. Diazinon is an excellent systemic insecticide that is tolerated by most carnivorous plants. Malathion and Acephate (Orthene) have also been reported as tolerable by carnivorous plants.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium isopropoxide is the {{chemical}} compound usually described with the formula Al(O-i-Pr)3, where i-Pr is the <b>isopropyl</b> group (CH(CH3)2). This colourless solid {{is a useful}} reagent in organic synthesis. The structure of this compound is complex, possibly time-dependent, and may depend on solvent.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Standard Oil first {{produced}} <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol by hydrating propene. Its major use at {{the time}} was not rubbing alcohol but for oxidation to acetone, whose first major use was in World War One for the preparation of the smokeless propellant, cordite.|$|E
25|$|The two landing modules and {{the rover}} will be {{sterilised}} {{in order not}} to contaminate the planet with Earth life forms. Cleaning will require a combination of sterilising methods, including ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and chemicals such as ethyl and <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol. (see Planetary protection).|$|E
25|$|The {{indirect}} process reacts propene with sulfuric acid {{to form a}} mixture of sulfate esters. Subsequent hydrolysis of these esters by steam produces <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, which is distilled. Diisopropyl ether is a significant by-product of this process; it is recycled back to the process and hydrolyzed to give the desired product.|$|E
25|$|Most widely sold {{products}} {{include the}} original amyl nitrite (isoamyl nitrite, isopentyl nitrite), but also variants such as, isobutyl nitrite, <b>isopropyl</b> nitrite (2-propyl nitrite, increasingly, after EU ban of the isobutyl form). In some countries, to evade anti-drug laws, poppers are packaged labelled as room deodorizers, leather polish or tape head cleaner.|$|E
25|$|The {{haloform}} reaction {{can also}} occur inadvertently in domestic settings. Bleaching with hypochlorite generates halogenated compounds in side reactions; chloroform {{is the main}} byproduct. Sodium hypochlorite solution (chlorine bleach) mixed with common household liquids such as acetone, butanone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol, or <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol can produce some chloroform, {{in addition to other}} compounds such as chloroacetone or dichloroacetone.|$|E
25|$|Other {{flammable}} liquids such as diesel fuel, methanol, turpentine, jet fuel, and <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol {{have been used}} in place of, or combined with petrol. Thickening agents such as solvents, foam polystyrene, baking soda, petroleum jelly, tar, strips of tyre tubing, nitrocellulose, XPS foam, motor oil, rubber cement, detergent and dish soap have been added to help the burning liquid adhere to the target and create clouds of thick, choking smoke.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> alcohol dissolves a {{wide range}} of {{non-polar}} compounds. It also evaporates quickly, leaves nearly zero oil traces, compared to ethanol, and is relatively non-toxic, compared to alternative solvents. Thus, it is used widely as a solvent and as a cleaning fluid, especially for dissolving oils. Together with ethanol, n-butanol, and methanol, it belongs to the group of alcohol solvents, about 6.4 million tonnes of which were utilized worldwide in 2011.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, {{a widely}} {{accepted}} method for preparing aluminium isopropoxide {{was published in}} 1936 by Young, Hartung, and Crossley. Their procedure entails heating a mixture of 100g of aluminium, 1200mL of <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, and 5g of mercuric chloride at reflux. The process occurs via {{the formation of an}} amalgam of the aluminium. A catalytic amount of iodine is sometimes added to initiate the reaction, which can be quite vigorous. Young et al. achieved an 85–90% yield, after purification by distillation at 140–150°C (5mm Hg).|$|E
25|$|A hand {{sanitizer}} or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. In the late 1990s and {{early part of}} the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or {{hand sanitizer}}s) began to gain popularity. Most are based on <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Officials from Maple Leaf {{believe that}} the {{outbreak}} originated sometime in July on line 8 or line 9 of the North York facility. Regardless, the entire plant has undergone intense sanitation, which began August 21. About 80 workers {{were involved in the}} cleanup, with additional outside experts and microbiologists supervising the operation. They used peroxyacetic acid, quaternary ammonium compound, <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, refrigeration gel and a granular compound to disinfect the parts of the apparatuses. About 600 employees were to attend a four-hour training session on Listeria and on cleanliness, and about 250 employees were laid off while the plant was being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{cassettes}} {{themselves were}} relatively durable, the players required regular maintenance to perform properly. Head cleaning may {{be done with}} long swabs, soaked with <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, or cassette-shaped devices that could be inserted into a tape deck to remove buildup of iron-oxide from the heads, tape-drive capstan, and pinch-roller. Some otherwise normal recording tapes included sections of leader that could clean the tape heads. One of {{the concerns of the}} time however was the use of abrasive cleaning tape. Some of the cleaning tapes actually felt rough to the touch and were considered damaging to the heads. Similarly shaped demagnetizers used magnets to degauss the deck, which kept sound from becoming distorted (see Cassette demagnetizer).|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} step, {{and usually}} the last, in {{the synthesis of}} β-blockers consists of adding a propanolamine side chain. This can be done following two paths which both involve alkylation of an appropriate phenoxide with epichlorohydrin (ECH). The first way is shown as the upper way in figure 5. It consists of phenoxide reacting at the oxirane and resulting in an alkoxide, that displaces the adjacent chloride {{to form a new}} epoxide ring. The second way is shown as the lower route in figure 5. It consists of displacement of the halogen directly with a SN2 reaction to give the same glycidic ether. When following both pathways, the central chiral carbon preserves its configuration, which is an important part to consider when synthesizing enantiomerically defined drugs. The ring opening of the epoxide ring in glycidic ether is done with an appropriate amine, such as <b>isopropyl</b> amine or tert-butylamine, and leads to the aryloxypropanolamine compound that consist of a secondary amine. This amine is typically known as the structural requirement for the β-adrenergic blocking activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these degradation products in the fuel tank, fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components {{makes it harder to}} start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup {{may or may not be}} eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits, <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, or other additives. Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is seasonal (low to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} beam lithography (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is {{the choice of a}} positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E

It took four hours of make-up work for Luther to be ready, and she described the costume as slightly skimpier than she was used to as a lingerie and bikini model. Despite the application of <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, Luther said that it took days for the remnants of the make-up to be removed.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{processes}} {{require that}} the <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. <b>Isopropyl</b> alcohol and water form an azeotrope and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by weight <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol and 12.1% by weight water.
