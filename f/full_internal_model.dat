40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the tracking coordination of a linear switched reluctance machine (LSRM) network {{based on a}} global feedback control strategy with a full-state observation framework. The observer is allocated on the follower instead of the leader to form a leader–follower–observer network, by utilizing the leader as the global feedback tracking controller and the observer as the observation of the <b>full</b> states. The <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> compensator (IMC) {{is applied to the}} leader for the improvement of the network performance. The full-state information of the LSRM network is reconfigured by the output of the LSRM where the observer is located to provide necessary feedback information to the leader. Then, the controllability and observability of the leader–follower–observer network with the IMC are inspected, serving as a basis for the design of the global controller with the IMC and full-state observer. Experimentation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed network control scheme and the results demonstrate that both the absolute and the relative accuracy can be simultaneously improved, compared to the LSRM network with only the consensus algorithm and no global feedback mechanism...|$|R

The prime objective of any industrial {{process is to}} perform efficiently with optimum cost reduction. <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control (IMC) is a commonly used technique that provides a transparent mode for the designing and easy tuning of control structure. I have designed the <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> control for binary distillation column. The transfer function has been taken from Wood and Berry <b>model.</b> The <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> control has been designed considering three strategies namely, process perfect, process mismatch with disturbances and process model with considering only disturbance. It has also been tried to reduce the disturbance created in the system by varying tuning parameter (ë). In the second proposal, Lead-Lag based <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control method is proposed based on <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control (IMC) strategy. We have also designed the Lead-Lag based <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control for binary distillation column. We have found the composition control and disturbance rejection using Lead-Lag based IMC and comparing with the response of generalize <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Controller.

40|$|As {{human beings}} we {{interact}} with unstable objects {{on a day}} to day basis, sometimes not even realizing that we are behaving in a stabilizing, controlling manner. Riding a bicycle for example, is a highly unstable task with complex intrinsic dynamics, which would usually require a carefully assembled, stabilizing control mechanism, but is performed by humans in a seemingly effortless way (assuming that a learning process of some sorts has previously occurred). The human process of determining the necessary set of muscle forces and joint activations to execute a desired movement or action, based on available sensory information, is titled human motor control. One of the more prominent theories concerning the dynamical and neural control processes involved is the theory of <b>internal</b> <b>models.</b> It assumes that the human brain acquires an <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> of the physical properties of the elements involved in the presently pursued task [2, 3, 4]. <b>Internal</b> <b>models</b> also surface in fundamental control theory, specifically in the <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> principle.

40|$|The {{main reasons}} for giving {{insurance}} companies the option to apply <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> for calculating the solvency requirement within the Solvency II framework is to enhance better risk management and to allow a more accurate risk oriented capital requirement than the standard Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) would provide. The possibility to use <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> within Pillar I basically means freedom to calculate the solvency requirement using some other formulae and even principles than those given by the standard formula. In our view within Pillar I, contrary to Pillar II, {{there is a clear}} need both for insurance supervisors and for those developing <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> in practise to have a common guideline among EU member states on how to validate and approve <b>internal</b> <b>models.</b> The tentative advice from The Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) to the European Commission roughly follows the same approach.
