5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and <b>eczema,</b> and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, <b>eczema,</b> and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, <b>eczema</b> and other {{external}} conditions.

Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom.

40|$|Introduction: Skin {{diseases}} {{are a common}} cause of morbidity in Nepal as per the health services report. There is limited information on the prevalence and pattern of skin diseases in the community. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the pattern of skin diseases in a rural village development community of Nepal. Materials and methods:  Two  dermatologic  health camps were conducted, during which, the villagers were examined by dermatologists. The skin diseases diagnosed were recorded in a proforma. Results: There were 433 individuals examined and 359 (male- 47. 9 %; female- 52. 1 %) had skin disease identified clinically (camp prevalence- 83 %). The age of patients ranged from 1 to 80 years (mean- 24. 5; SD± 15. 9), with majority in the age group of 10 - 19 years. The most common skin disease category was <b>eczemas</b> (36. 4 %), followed by infections (28. 4 %), acne (22 %), pigment disorders (34 %) and urticaria (12. 3 %). Conclusion: Skin diseases were common in the community. The five most common Skin disease categories were <b>eczemas,</b> infections, acne and pigment disorders were the more common conditions...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the overall prevalence of skin diseases a whole-body skin examination was performed for 1, 932 members (46 -years of age) of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966), {{which is a}} comprehensive longitudinal research program (N = 12, 058). A high prevalence of all skin diseases needing treatment was found (N = 1, 158). Half of the cases of skin findings were evaluated to be serious enough to require diagnostic evaluation, treatment or follow-up either in a general health care, occupational health care or a secondary care setting. The remaining half {{were thought to be}} slight and self-treatment was advised. Males (70 %) had more skin diseases needing treatment than females (52 %) (P, 0. 001). The most common skin finding was a benign skin tumor, which was found in every cohort member. Skin infections (44 %), <b>eczemas</b> (27 %) and sebaceous gland diseases (27 %) were the most common skin diseases in the cohort. Moreover, skin infections and <b>eczemas</b> were more commonly seen in the group with low education compared to those with high education (P, 0. 005). The results strengthen the postulate that skin diseases are common in an adult population...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{pattern of}} skin {{diseases}} varies form {{one country to}} another and across different parts within the same country. A two-day multispecialty medical camp was held among the local population at the district of Kausambi, Allahabad, UP, in October 2005. A cross section of pattern of skin diseases observed at the camp is reported and compared with similar studies in literature. Materials and Methods: All cases attending the medical camp {{were included in the}} study. All those with dermatological complaints were examined in detail, brief relevant history was elicited and clinical diagnosis was made. Results: Skin diseases comprised 7. 86 &#x 0025; of all those who attended the camp. The 11 - 20 year age group was the most common age group involved with 164 (31. 4 &#x 0025;) cases. Infective disorders were found in 59. 1 &#x 0025; and noninfective disorders in 40. 9 &#x 0025; of all the skin cases. Among the infective disorders, fungal infections were most common (54. 52 &#x 0025;), and among the noninfective dermatoses, <b>eczemas</b> were most common (39. 2 &#x 0025;) cutaneous disorders. Conclusion: Our study brought out a higher prevalence of infective dermatoses and a relatively higher, but statistically insignificant, prevalence of fungal infections, scabies and <b>eczemas,</b> thereby reflecting minor regional variance in our study group...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The pilgrimage (Hajj) to {{the holy}} mosque {{in the city of}} Makkah takes place once every year and during this huge {{gathering}} skin diseases are quite common due to hot weather and over crowding. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect and report data regarding different dermatological problems occurring during the holy month of Zil-hajj. METHODS: Data regarding skin diseases was collected from pilgrims which were examined and diagnosed clinically at the Department of Dermatology King Abdul Aziz Hospital, during the month of Zil-Hajja of the year 2000. These patients were referred from various primary health centers, medical hajj missions of various countries and Children and Maternity hospital in Makkah. RESULTS: During the month of Zil-hajja of the year 2000, 1510 cases were seen, of these 1143 were males and 367 were females. The criteria for diagnosis for most of the cases were mainly clinical. The highest number of patients was in the age group of 20 - 50 years. <b>Eczemas</b> of different types were the most common skin disease observed in these pilgrims, intertrigo was the next most common presenting condition this was followed by fungal and bacterial infections.

40|$|Background: Across the globe, skin {{disorders}} {{represent a}} frequent occupational concern for many health professionals including veterinarians {{and there is}} a serious impact of skin diseases on their lives and careers. But {{little is known about the}} prevalence and distribution of skin diseases (especially occupational) within this important professional group across Asia, especially India. Materials and Methods: The study was a cross-sectional study carried out over a period of one year in which veterinarians and veterinary workers of Kashmir valley were screened for various skin diseases and occupational dermatoses. Results: The study group comprised 910 veterinarians and associated workers working across the valley with the majority being males; 846 workers (93 %). The mean age of the group was 38. 53 years. Out of these, 267 veterinarians and associated workers (29. 3 %) were found to have skin lesions. Of the 267 cases, 165 (61. 80 %) had non-infectious lesions, while the rest had 102 (38. 20 %) had infectious skin diseases. The main non-infectious lesions included friction-related disorders, <b>eczemas,</b> pigmentary disorders, papulosquamous disorders, and many others; while the infectious lesions were of fungal, bacterial, viral, and parasitic etiology. Fungal infections, <b>eczemas,</b> and melasma were more common in them, indicating an occupational etiology. Conclusion: A huge group of skin diseases was seen in veterinarians and veterinary workers, with some diseases showing an occupational nature. To reduce the burden of skin diseases in this particular group, proper prevention measures need to be instituted at work places by veterinary governing bodies of the state...|$|R
