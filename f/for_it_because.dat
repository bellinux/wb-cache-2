Depression is also common, as victims are made to feel guilty for ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense criticism. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and {{it is suggested that}} many receive therapy <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.|$|E

It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E

500|$|David Geffen, {{founder of}} Geffen Records, {{had the idea}} to record the album The Simpsons Sing the Blues based on The Simpsons, to be {{released}} in time for Christmas 1990. The writers wrote humorous lyrics for the actors to perform over blues and hip hop. The album faced great publicity before its release. One particular element that was highly publicized was Michael Jackson's involvement, which was denied {{around the time of the}} album's release. Early published reports attributed Jackson as the composer of [...] "Do the Bartman", which Groening denied in a press release. However, Groening revealed in 1998 that [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson, but he could not receive credit <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he was under contract to another record label. Jackson was a fan of The Simpsons, especially Bart, and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number one single and do a guest spot on the show, which is how [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] came about. Jackson eventually guest-starred in the episode [...] "Stark Raving Dad".|$|E
500|$|During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to {{deal with}} their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a {{different}} project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles [...] "Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums"—a song inspired by [...] "Pet" [...] that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and [...] "Passive". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he [...] "tested the waters" [...] and was subsequently [...] "crucified" [...] <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release.|$|E

Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from Gary Sanchez Productions after the screening of Dead Snow at the Sundance Film Festival: [...] "So my first meeting, my first day in LA was with those guys and I pitched Hansel and Gretel and they loved it. And they took me to Paramount two days after and we sold it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script. It’s full throttle, there’s lots of blood and gore and bad language, I often wonder how I got this movie made. It’s all across the world now.

500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> you can sometimes sit too long with ideas.

500|$|John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he {{developed}} his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported {{the views of}} the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the Irenaean theodicy seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them. Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal hell would render [...] "a Christian theodicy impossible". The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.|$|E
