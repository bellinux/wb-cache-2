5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built {{with the construction of}} the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northwest}} corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Kala Burj ("Black Pavilion"). The pavilion is the most significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort. The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the Quran, and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 2003, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was renovated and mural {{paintings}} were painted on <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The under part of {{the school}} is open for play grounds and is asphalted. The rooms are well lighted from high gable windows; outlet {{ventilation}} from panels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> is conducted through iron tubing and Boyle's ventilators.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1876, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> chapel of D. Fradique was remodelled and repaired.|$|R
5|$|The two {{then follow}} a small {{path through the}} woods until they come to {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; {{the price of oil}} and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E
50|$|The main altarpiece {{was painted}} <b>in</b> 1631. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> has {{elaborate}} 18th-century stucco decoration.|$|R
50|$|Inside, the {{original}} layout is almost intact. Much of {{the original}} trim remains, including the marble fireplace mantel in each room. One of the fireplaces has a coal stove attached. Many {{of the original}} light fixtures remain, hanging from plaster medallions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> sixth attempt, <b>in</b> September 1946 in Sembel, {{once again}} {{included}} Meridor and another Irgun man, {{was made by}} breaking holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Meridor and his comrade escaped and met with the remaining escapees from the fifth attempt. They were all eventually caught by the British intelligence.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) discovers a bat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> It flies {{through the}} office, sending the {{employees}} scurrying for cover. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and {{is turning into}} a vampire. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5:00 passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith who continues {{to hide in the}} breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scully, who doesn't want {{to abandon}} her Christmas plans, follows Mulder {{into the house}} to {{retrieve}} her car keys from him, and {{the door to the}} mansion slams shut. Inside the house, the agents experience strange phenomena: creaks are heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> from the upper floor, and the shadow {{in the form of an}} old woman in a nightgown is seen, among other occurrences. Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as the agents, along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk through is the same library room they first entered. They then decide to split up, hoping to find a way out of the room.|$|E
50|$|The state seal is {{displayed}} in stained glass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of both <b>the</b> Wyoming's House of Representatives Chamber and the Wyoming Senate Chamber <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state capital. The seal is also {{incorporated into the}} design of the state flag, which prominently features the seal set against the silhouette of an American Bison.|$|R
50|$|He also {{painted a}} Betrothal of Psyche, and, jointly with Landi, he painted, <b>in</b> fresco, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> Torlonia Palace.|$|R
50|$|As a result, the Goochland County Public Schools {{received}} {{the new school}} bus. Her idea was to install sound baffles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of school bus bodies to help reduce driver distraction. Compact forms of such equipment were later developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s by Wayne and other bus manufacturers when diesel engines (and their greater noise) became commonplace.|$|R
5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase {{at the south end of}} the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible from the front of the house. A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the Brew-house below.|$|E
5|$|Working {{with his}} {{associate}} Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design {{centered on a}} building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees. A plaza stretches out before the building, {{and a series of}} support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's High Court building in Chandigarh, India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5000|$|Built <b>in</b> 1361, <b>the</b> castle {{once belonged}} to the princes of the Meli Lupi family of Soragna. The castle had corner towers. In 1446, {{ornamental}} grapevine frescoes were painted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of <b>the</b> courtyard portico. Further reconstructions and expansions occurred through the centuries. The castle is still inhabited by descendants of the Meli Lupi family.|$|R
50|$|The primary room on {{the second}} floor is the Plavcan Gallery, located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the north side, {{connecting}} with {{the upper part of the}} Main Hall. The Plavcan Gallery is a large room that contains a vaulted, coffered ceiling with laylights set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffers. On the south side of the second floor, two of the offices contain laylights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> <b>The</b> basement contains the Children's Library spaces and numerous stack areas; most of the original finishes have been replaced with modern, sound-absorbing, light materials.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{fire started}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ballroom's <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> old <b>ceiling,</b> which was deemed a fire hazard, was not removed when <b>the</b> new <b>ceiling</b> was installed, {{providing}} kindling for the fire, which started from faulty wires.|$|R
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Lutheran Church (also {{known as}} the Cross Church at Danebod) was {{dedicated}} Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to {{the arms of the}} cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting walls and ceiling, porthole windows as in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest Lutheran church in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Danebod Lutheran Church remains a part of the ELCA still today.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground was}} broken {{for the new}} school {{building}} in March 1972. <b>In</b> September 1974 <b>the</b> new Delta High School was opened. Delta High School was remodeled in 1992. It was once again remodeled in 2007 due to a mold problem.It also had many structural issues (leaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> etc.) and mold problems circa 2004-2007, but recent remodeling has hopefully helped to remedy this issue.|$|R
50|$|It {{is because}} of this {{decoration}} and roof layout {{that it has been}} suggested this room was used mainly as a chapel. There are also huge double-hung windows, with rooms both off to the left and right of the circular hall. This hall is said to be dated back to 1770, with Adam Style ornamentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and 18th-century twisted balusters on the staircases.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1937, <b>the</b> {{original}} {{wooden floor}} {{was replaced by}} red clay tiles. Due to a fire <b>in</b> 1950, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was replaced one meter away from the original location.|$|R
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> near the exit.|$|E
25|$|Attributed to Ponzone are twenty {{paintings}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of {{the church}} of San Francesco Šibenik, as well as other paintings of saints.|$|E
25|$|Balloon Ballroom:Located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{above the}} main {{entrance}} hall, this small room was first accessed by tying a rope {{to a bunch of}} balloons and floating them up into the passage.|$|E
5|$|Room of the Ark: {{contains}} {{a painting by}} Giovan Battista Caracciolo (17th century). <b>In</b> 1816, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was frescoed by Luigi Ademollo with Noah entering Jerusalem with the Ark.|$|R
2500|$|The {{campus was}} Wi-Fi enabled. Surveillance {{was carried out}} through CCTV cameras <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{laboratories}} and classrooms. Initially, a centralised air-conditioning system for the whole building was planned. Even AC ducts were installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> But <b>the</b> system never became completely operational. Ultimately, ceiling fans had to be installed <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> rooms. Air-conditioning units were installed wherever they were needed (e.g. computer labs, seminar halls, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{other two}} {{sections}} {{are to be}} found the six large rooms. These rooms are hexagonal, and all of them measure exactly the same. Each of their six sides is 109 inches <b>in</b> width, and <b>the</b> design of the rooms of the upper story is carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> narrowing and rising toward the center and ending in a circle about {{a foot and a half}} in diameter.|$|R
