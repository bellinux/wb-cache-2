Written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johntá Austin, and {{produced by the}} former three, the song drew comparisons to Carey's [...] "We Belong Together". According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, the song features a similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and production as the latter song, and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of G minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of F6. Lyrically, the song describes the potency of a [...] "first love", and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to [...] "not forget about them". Critics noted that the song's lyrics both let go of a lover, as well as cherishing their memory. Carey sings, [...] "You <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> die / With no goodbyes", indicating a relationship that has long decayed, and how she has let it drift away, while also adding, [...] "There's only one me and you / And how we used to shine / No matter what you go through / We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny", indicating that while {{they are no longer}} together, she will continue to cherish the memory of them and how strong their love was.

In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals".

[...] The cast and crew of the series have expressed their enjoyment of the installment. Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on.

[...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan.

[...] He further noted that Knowles didn't need distractions from her singing, [...] "which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with [...] staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a very positive review for the concert and noted that Knowles performed [...] "two fast-paced hours of terrific singing, solid musicianship, spectacular staging {{and some of the}} most imaginative choreography ever to have graced the stage of Oracle Arena." [...] Hildebrand further noted that Knowles used [...] "occasional bits of rasp to her ringing mezzo tones to emphasize key lines" [...] while performing the ballads. He wrote that every [...] "twitch, turn, slide and hip shake was in perfect sync" [...] and praised the singer's constant motion most of the time which never left her [...] "out of breath". While reviewing Knowles' concert in Bangkok, Thailand, Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised her dancing which included [...] "shaking, bouncing and belly dancing, mixed with hip-hop" [...] further comparing it with Shakira's. She further noted that the highlight of the show was when Knowles sang the slow-tempo ballads. The Courier Mails Tonya Turner praised Knowles' [...] "passionate and fiery" [...] performance accompanied by [...] "frantic booty popping and sexy R moves". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers noted that the tour was one of the [...] "modern superstar spectacles that casts the artist's reality onto the level of myth". However, she noted, that [...] "Beyoncé's 'Experience' plays off the performer's well-known struggles and triumphs to build a story that will make fans both gawk and relate. The maddening thing about this dazzling entertainment, though, is that the tale it tells is partly the wrong one." [...] She concluded the review by saying, [...] "Beyoncé is electric in concert yet reined in by her show's post-feminist theme. Why not <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be about her musical prowess?". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Knowles' energy and powerful performance on stage, writing [...] "With her triumphant gait, statuesque figure and steely stare, the singer seemed primed not just to perform but to vanquish... Beyoncé sang with a fiery determination, stressing cries and shouts that had no use for subtlety and even less for vulnerability. She danced at an equally mad clip... hitting every mark with a vengeance... A Beyoncé show... {{has everything to do with}} power and nothing to do with nuance. It's the kind of thing meant to inspire awe, not intimacy... She sang her songs last night with the force of a rapper, stressing pieces from her two solo albums in a way that made every sound seem percussive." [...] However, Farber criticized the unsure repertoire of songs performed, writing [...] "Many of her tunes prove too skittish to sink in, and some of her rhythms are too robotic to find a groove." [...] Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the snippets of other artists that Knowles included in her own songs were refreshing and included the fast-paced Destiny's Child medley and the performances of [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights of the show.

There doesn't {{have to be the}} idea that this is the great, golden document. It's all there, and it's not cleaned up. You get what you get." [...] The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to cassettes, then eventually digital formats such as DAT, CD-R and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the Grateful Dead, Phish and Pearl Jam, three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.|$|E
