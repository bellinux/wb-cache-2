5|$|The {{service is}} {{typically}} used for valuable and somewhat time-sensitive cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is heavy {{enough to make}} the cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery and spare parts (in both directions), as well as high-end <b>groceries</b> <b>and</b> consumer goods (primarily toward China). While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also make it possible to send less-than-container shipments.|$|E

The tolls brought in an income which remained below £9,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach £13,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, <b>groceries</b> <b>and</b> building materials. Some of it supplied villages {{along the line of}} the canal, and some of that which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham.

5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on.

Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking <b>groceries</b> <b>and</b> hoping to profit from the gold rush.|$|E

25|$|Bears {{were once}} {{commonly}} observed along roadsides and within developed areas of Yellowstone National Park.
