50|$|The Indian Universities Commission was a body {{appointed}} in 1902 on the instructions of Lord Curzon which {{was intended to}} make recommendations for reforms in University education in India. Appointed following a conference on education at Simla in September 1901, the Commission was led by Law member Sir Walter Raleigh and included among its members Syed Hussain Belgrami and Justice Gooroodas Banerjee. The recommendations of the commission included regulations for reformation of University Senates in Indian Universities, greater representation of affiliated colleges in the senates, and stricter monitoring of affiliated instituitions by the universities. It also made recommendations for reform of school education, curricular reforms at Universities, recommendations on education and examinations, research, as well as student welfare and state scholarships. The recommendations were however controversial at the time. There was a growing nationalist sentiment in British India, {{and a number of}} colleges and institutions of higher education had risen in metropolitan suburbs which were linked to the major universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. These set their own curriculum, and the recommendations of the commission were seen as measures to <b>derecognise</b> and regulate indigenous institutions which fell into disfavour of the Raj. Despite strong and sustained opposition from Indian populace, the recommendations were enacted by Curzon as Indian Universities Act 1904.|$|E

40|$|The {{issuance}} of Brazilian Law 11. 638 / 2007 {{is a critical}} step in the convergence of the Brazilian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAPs) towards International Financial Reporting Standards. After the law was implemented and later modified by Provisional Executive Order 449 / 2008 (converted into Law 11. 941 / 2009), certain accounting choices were allowed during the transition period. The Brazilian GAAPs allowed for restructuring costs and costs related to opening a new facility to be recognised as assets. As a transitional provision, companies were allowed to choose between maintaining or eliminating these values. In this paper, we attempted to identify which company characteristics were associated with this accounting choice. The final sample consisted of Brazilian companies listed on the BM & FBOVESPA, and a logistic regression identified two characteristics. Participation {{in one of the}} three different corporate governance levels of the BM & FBOVESPA was associated with the choice to <b>derecognise</b> the deferred assets, while companies decided to maintain the deferred asset if it was relatively large. The empirical evidence reported here contributes to the literature by explaining the manner in which a set of firm characteristics is related to a firm's accounting choices...|$|E

50|$|As per {{the terms}} of accession, the {{erstwhile}} Indian princes received privy purses (government allowances), and initially retained their statuses, privileges, and autonomy in internal matters during a transitional period which lasted until 1956.

In 1956, the position of Rajpramukh was abolished and the federations dissolved, the former principalities becoming part of Indian states. The states which acceded to Pakistan retained their status until the promulgation of a new constitution in 1956, when most {{became part of the}} province of West Pakistan; a few of the former states retained their autonomy until 1969 when they were fully integrated into Pakistan.

50|$|In 1947, it {{was agreed}} the Indian subcontinent would be {{partitioned}} into the independent British dominions of India and Pakistan, with the princely states acceding to one nation or the other. The accession process proceeded smoothly, with the notable exception of four {{of the most influential}} principalities. The Muslim ruler of the Hindu-majority state of Junagadh ruler acceded to Pakistan, but his decision was overruled by the Indian government, while Hyderabad chose to be independent, but was forcibly annexed to India in 1948. The Hindu ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, among the largest and most powerful of the principalities, but with a Muslim-majority population, initially held off on a decision. In the autumn of 1947, an invading force from Pakistan frightened the ruler into acceding to India. The ruler of Kalat, in Baluchistan, declared his independence in 1947, after which the state was forcibly merged with Pakistan, resulting in an insurgency persisting to this day. With the promulgation of the Indian constitution in 1950, India abolished its monarchy under the British crown and became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, followed by Pakistan in 1956; as a result of both developments, the majority of the princes formally lost their sovereign rights. A few remaining principalities in Pakistan retained their autonomy until 1969, when they finally acceded to Pakistan. The Indian government formally <b>derecognised</b> its princely families in 1971, followed by Pakistan in 1972.|$|R
2500|$|The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) {{attempted}} to de-recognize the {{college in the}} 2010–11 academic year, after which the college management went to court seeking a stay on the order for a year. The college got the stay, and later also managed to get it extended for the academic year 2011–12. However, when it {{tried to do the}} same for the 2012–13 academic year, the Bombay High Court refused and upheld the AICTE's order in a ruling on 22 August 2012.The AICTE had not granted the Extension of Approval to continue the undergraduate courses in the college, (thus halting its first-year admissions in the DTE-managed CAP rounds of 2012) and had directed the college to shut down immediately, transferring the current students to other engineering colleges of the University of Mumbai. An [...] "expert committee" [...] of the AICTE visited the college for inspection on 6 August 2012, and after inspection it gave a [...] "zero deficiency" [...] report regarding the college infrastructure, facilities, etc. But even then, AICTE did not change its decision of <b>derecognising</b> the college. The Yuva Sena (youth wing of the Shiv Sena political party) protested the AICTE decision at the Mumbai regional office of the AICTE. A contentious issue in the matter of the college not being allowed to function was the college not possessing the required Occupancy Certificate from the Thane Municipal Corporation. But on 27 August 2012, the college obtained the Occupancy Certificate, and then challenged the High Court ruling by appealing in the Supreme Court of India. The hearing was expected on 29 August 2012, but it was postponed to 4 September 2012 due to late availability of the High Court order copy. Classes, examinations and other works continued at the college till December 2012, when the Supreme Court issued its verdict in favour of AICTE. Thus, PCoE had to be closed down and all current students were transferred (by the Directorate of Technical Education of the state Government of Maharashtra) to other engineering colleges of the University of Mumbai. But the Supreme Court also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on AICTE for the delay of 2 years (2008–09 and 2009–10) in its initiative to investigate the case of the college (under the previous trustee Mr. Tekchand Shah) shifting campuses without following proper procedures.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the effect of unions on {{investment}} and innovation decisions, both at the theoretical and the empirical level. The theoretical analysis deals with the choice of adoption of a new technology {{in the presence of}} an oligopolistic product market. A duopoly is considered for the ease of exposition. Unions are assumed to affect innovation decisions only via wage bargaining. The results show that environments where unions have a relatively strong (and not very spread) bargaining power tend to harm, ceteris paribus, innovation. If, instead, there is enough spread between unions in terms of their bargaining power, so that only one firm innovates, this firm is, ceteris paribus, the one facing the less powerful union. A firm may be the only one to innovate when facing the more powerful union, if this union is relatively more concerned with employment than the "rival". In general, environments where unions prize the defense of employment above pay rises tend to be more conducive to innovation. These results show the effectiveness of the "rent-seeking" mechanism outlined by Grout. Finally, there are cases where no firm would innovate should the labour market be competitive (non-unionised), while one firm would adopt the new technology, ceteris paribus, when firms face unions. The main results of the analysis are robust to the consideration of collusion in the product market. The generalisation to a model in which firms choose the quantity of capital also confirms the main results. The empirical analysis is based on data from a sample of British nonagricultural quoted companies over the period 1982 - 89. Data on investment have been constructed from the budget data and matched with information on unionisation and indutrial relations at the company level. Panel data estimation techniques (mostly Random Effects) have been employed. The results show that union recognition has, ceteris paribus, a significantly negative effect on the companies' propensity to invest. This negative impact is robust to the consideration of product market conditions, but seems to be concentrated {{in the first part of}} the period under study (1982 - 85). No separate effect on investment is detected for the presence of closed shop arrangements. There is evidence that the higher the union density at the company level, the lower the investment performance, but the results show also some evidence of non-linear effects. Finally, there is some evidence that companies that have partially <b>derecognised</b> during the eighties have benefited in terms of investment over the short-run...|$|R
