40|$|More than 50 million {{compounds}} with molecular struc-tures {{are known}} today. Reliable hazard {{information is available}} {{for only a few}} thousand of them. Nevertheless, laws and regulations can (and have to) be applied to all chemical substances used in a laboratory. For this pur-pose, a new web-based system [1] has been developed for the online evaluation of hazardous substances. Using a web form which offers a structure editor, any given structure can be submitted to a SciDex-driven back-end [2]. In the first step of evaluation, the backend runs a database query to a CLAKS-Database [3] with more than 140 000 known substances. If the substance is already known to the database, the backend returns the applicable <b>danger</b> <b>symbols,</b> R-and S-Phrases. If it is not found in the database, a substructure analysis according to several reg-ulations will be done. Furthermore, relevant degradation compounds are calculated and analysed. Relevant laws and regulations are e. g. European Hazard Law [4], the Chemical Weapons Convention [5], German law about narcotics [6], regulations about explosives [7] and lists of known poisons...|$|R

Unobserved, the man wakes and reaches for a discarded pick-axe. As he regards the Alphans with increasing hostility, {{a representation of the}} 'Flammon' <b>danger</b> <b>symbol</b> glows into existence beneath the skin of his forehead. When he hears the boy is safe, both his anger and the symbol fade before he again loses consciousness. The two are taken to the Medical Centre, where tests conclude their physiology to be borderline human.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a part of {{designing}} a system that will help to detect possible obstacles among the in-house object for visually impaired, low vision personnel by birth or accident or due to old age. The input of the system will be a scene (set of objects) and output as audio. Facility of alert is provided based on potential obstacles that gives by its shape like pointed tip, sharp edge, fragile, <b>danger</b> <b>symbol</b> etc. Different techniques are use to provide detection of objects based on shapes and alert users about the severity of the objects. The features of the object are extracted, and clusters of features are formed based on shape similarity. This avoids the exhaustive searching during testing and thus gives less computation timing. Alert service is provided to the user before the actual object is detected by considering the shape of the object. In case the object does not have a likely matching shape in any of the clusters, then it will not performed the remaining several operation that required for object detection. It declared as a new object. In such way, the overburden to the system is minimized...|$|E

He {{explains}} that once the Golden Dragon has managed to get the other Guardians bands back from the Zodiac Master, the bands are to be placed on top of the Zodiac Symbol. Ang tests with the Snake Powerband they retrieved from the Zodiac Master and places it on top of the Snake Symbol and the image of a Snake then takes the band back to the Temple of the Snakes. Master Chin goes on to explain these also act as warning beacons: whenever a temple is in danger or has been violated or the Guardian themselves are in <b>danger</b> the <b>symbol</b> will glow and right that second, the Dragon symbol begins to glow, suggesting that someone has broken into the Dragon Temple. Ang powers up and finds a small male wearing a white-red mask hopping mad round the temple trying to evade Ang.|$|R

50|$|Crannogs took on many {{different}} forms {{and methods of}} construction based on what was available in the immediate landscape. The classic image of a prehistoric crannog stems from both post-medieval illustrations and highly influential excavations such as Milton Loch in Scotland by C.M. Piggot after World War II. The Milton Loch interpretation is of a small islet surrounded or defined at its edges by timber piles and a gangway, topped by a typical Iron Age roundhouse. The choice of a small islet as a home may seem odd today, yet waterways were the main channels for both communication and travel until the 19th century in much of Ireland and especially Highland Scotland. Crannogs are traditionally interpreted as simple prehistorical farmsteads. They are also interpreted as boltholes in times of <b>danger,</b> as status <b>symbols</b> with limited access and as inherited locations of power that imply a sense of legitimacy and ancestry towards ownership of the surrounding landscape.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{understand}} and demonstrate the narrow ties between sport and International Relations. My purpose is to examine how Football especially is mixed with International Relations in many levels. The theoretical framework deals with the nationalism theories. Nationalism theories have been relevant only {{for the last two}} decades. Nationalism has been developed in the two last centuries with the industrialisation. It can be considered as a political doctrine or ideology. The definition of Nationalism is not obvious because there are no founding theorist or text on it. This process of nationalism induced nations to existence or self-determination. But extreme nationalism can be a <b>danger.</b> Nationals <b>symbols</b> have been created like language, food and drink, clothing, commemorative holidays, military heroes, flags, colours, and anthems. Sport should not be forgotten in this Nationalism ideology. A qualitative study of all the books have been studied carefully. The thesis is based on a long historical approach that permitted to demonstrate the links between sport and International Relations. Pierre de Coubertin wanted Olympics to bring peace and without political means, but the situation changed rapidly everything and government policies were really influenced by sports. Not only totalitarian states but also democratic ones have been using sport for their propaganda to promote national strength. It has been like a trigger mechanism, everyone has understood how to use sport for diplomatic relations and it is a safer and harmless way than a war. Then a study of national identity construction will be the second goal. Governments are now involved in sport to promote the prestige of a group. The other reason is to encourage a sense of identity, belonging and unity. Sport as a diplomatic tool can be considered like a public diplomacy to influence opinion. Football passion is shared by every citizen and helps us to understand the complexity of the world with its conflicting nations. In all this complicated situation, the Nordic nationalism is a fascinating new direction of peace and tolerance. For example, the Danes showed a festive way to support national teams that we can call a ‘sporting nationalism’...|$|R
