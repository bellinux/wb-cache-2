500|$|En Esch, {{one of the}} {{longtime}} core members of KMFDM, had almost {{nothing to do with}} Xtort, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said, [...] "En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief that the thing must keep moving; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without him." [...] He also said the two were not in communication {{around the time of the}} album's release.|$|E
500|$|Espinosa {{landed the}} lead role of the film Gloria in 2014. The film is a biopic about singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, and her {{relation}} with her manager, record producer Sergio Andrade. The movie chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure in a band, her rise to musical stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brazil. Espinosa won the role after a month-and-a-half casting process, stating that [...] "I do not know how many actresses were , or who they were, but once I got the role I knew it was a big responsibility, because it is a character who is alive and has a lot of fans, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well. It is a very complex character, full of nuances, with great force". Espinosa took singing lessons and had to learn Trevi's accent. Also, to fully prepare for the role, the actress was assigned a choreographer and worked with the film director to find the right tone for the scenes. Espinosa watched Trevi's interviews, concerts and films to be able to play her. [...] "The role was meant for me", Espinosa said to Noticine.|$|E

500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

Rutten talked about the origins of the Rutten Jump on his website: [...] "When I won my first fight in Pancrase, I was so hyped that I jumped up in the splits to each side of the ring. Why? I don't know. But, it became my {{trademark}} and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> after every fight that I won." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{storming}} of Nam O Beach {{took place}} on 8 March 1965 on the coastline around the port of Da Nang in South Vietnam. In the few days preceding the landing, Karch commented that the weather was the worst that he had experienced. When inhabitants of the friendly beach greeted the arriving Marines and photographs were taken, Karch was never seen to smile. When this was queried, he replied [...] "...if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over, that picture {{would have been the}} same. When you have a son in Vietnam and he gets killed, you don't want a smiling general with flowers around his neck as leader at that point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speck {{stated that}} at the time of the killings, he [...] "had no {{feelings}}", but things had changed: [...] "I had no feelings at all that night. They said there was blood all over the place. I can't remember. It felt like nothing ... I'm sorry as hell. For those girls, and for their families, and for me. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over again, it would be a simple house burglary." [...] Speck's [...] "final thought for the American people" [...] was, [...] "Just tell 'em to keep up their hatred for me. I know it keeps up their morale.

2500|$|The band {{released}} the album's first single [...] "This Is Music" [...] in May, and it reached No.35, their first single {{to reach the}} Top 40. It was followed by [...] "On Your Own" [...] in June which performed even better, reaching No.28. This single was particularly new for the Verve {{as it was a}} soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single [...] "History", which reached No.24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: [...] "I knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because {{it could have been the}} greatest time of our lives, with [...] "History" [...] doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Gospel Flava that she [...] "received tremendous support" [...] from Music World, saying, [...] "they came to me. There wasn't a question as to what type of music I was going to do. Music World has a Gospel division and I'm the first artist to come out on Music World and in the Gospel division. I'd love to do more and more Gspel projects". She also discussed her Christian upbringing, saying, [...] "I grew up in Rockford, Illinois. St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I thought {{that it would be a}} perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that. They go Gospel when they don't have anything else to do anymore, you know? I chose to do this while I can reach people." ...|$|E
