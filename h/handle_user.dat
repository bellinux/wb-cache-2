50|$|To remedy input kludges, one may use input {{validation}} algorithms to <b>handle</b> <b>user</b> input. A monkey test {{can be used}} to detect an input kludge problem. A common first test to discover this problem is to roll one's hand across the computer keyboard or to 'mash' the keyboard to produce a large junk input, but such an action often lacks reproducibility. Greater systematicity and reproducibility may be obtained by using fuzz testing software.|$|E

50|$|Subscribers may {{register}} for specific messages at build time, initialization time or runtime. In GUI systems, subscribers can be coded to <b>handle</b> <b>user</b> commands (e.g., {{click of a}} button), which corresponds to build time registration. Some frameworks and software products use XML configuration files to register subscribers. These configuration files are read at initialization time. The most sophisticated alternative is when subscribers can be added or removed at runtime. This latter approach is used, for example, in database triggers, mailing lists, and RSS.|$|E

Among those generating significant attention are several Do Not Track legislations and the Right to Know Act (California Bill AB 1291). The California Right to Know Act, if passed, would require every business which keeps user information to provide its user a copy of stored information when requested. The bill faced heavy oppositions from trade groups representing companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, and failed to pass.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{an input}} kludge is {{type of failure}} in software (an anti-pattern) where simple user input is not handled. For example, if a computer program accepts free text input from the user, an ad hoc algorithm will mishandle many combinations of legal and illegal input strings. Input kludges are usually difficult for a programmer to detect in a unit test, but very easy for the end user to find. The evidence exists that the end user can easily crash software that fails to correctly <b>handle</b> <b>user</b> input. Indeed, the buffer overflow security hole {{is an example of}} the problems caused.|$|E
50|$|Applications {{could use}} any, or all, of the Managers in the CTB. A typical {{terminal}} emulator would {{use all of}} them, connecting a Tool selected in the Connection Manager to another in the Terminal Manager, and then periodically using the File Transfer Manager on user request. Such {{was the case for}} common terminal emulators like VersaTerm and MacTerminal. However, another application might use only one of these, say the Connection Manager to set up communications. QuickMail and Eudora are well-known examples. Applications typically used the GUI elements supplied by the Managers to <b>handle</b> <b>user</b> interaction, but could also enumerate the tools on their own to provide a custom GUI.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, {{following}} {{a series of}} prototypes, Saxonica released Saxon Client Edition (Saxon-CE), {{a version of the}} product adapted to run within the browser environment.

Saxon-CE provides the first implementation of XSLT 2.0 running on the browser, and also extends the language so that rather than merely generating HTML, it can directly <b>handle</b> <b>user</b> interaction. With the release of Saxon-CE 1.1 in February 2013, the product became open source.

40|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} (MOO) is a well-studied {{problem for}} several important recommendation problems. While multiple approaches have been proposed, in this work, {{we focus on}} using constrained optimization formulations (e. g., quadratic and linear programs) to formulate and solve MOO problems. This approach {{can be used to}} pick desired operating points on the trade-off curve between multiple objectives. It also works well for internet applications which serve large volumes of online traffic, by working with Lagrangian duality formulation to connect dual solutions (computed offline) with the primal solutions (computed online). We identify some key limitations of this approach [...] namely the inability to <b>handle</b> <b>user</b> and item level constraints, scalability considerations and variance of dual estimates introduced by sampling processes. We propose solutions for each of the problems and demonstrate how through these solutions we significantly advance the state-of-the-art in this realm. Our proposed methods can exactly <b>handle</b> <b>user</b> and item (and other such local) constraints, achieve a 100 × scalability boost over existing packages in R and reduce variance of dual estimates by two orders of magnitude.
