Since Jasniff and Merwell became pupils at Rockville Military Academy and since they ran away from that {{institution}} they have been <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> {{could think of to}} annoy me. They have sent farmers here with produce that I never ordered, and have had publishers send me schoolbooks that I did not want. Worse than that, they have circulated reports to my scholars’ parents that this school was running down, that it was in debt, and that some pupils were getting sick because the sewerage system was out of order. Some of the parents have written to me, and two were on the point of taking their boys away, thinking the reports were true. Fortunately I was able to prove the reports false, and the boys remained here. But I do not know how far these slanders are being circulated and what the effect will be in the future.” ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} people in the world that have never been the victim, but yet are far from being {{carefree}} and are highly concerned with <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> possibly can to avoid a tragic instance, such as rape. A particular quote by Jessica Valenti in her book Full Frontal Feminism stated, [...] "When I was in college, a teacher once said all women live by a 'rape schedule.'" [...] This goes to show that men see women as easier targets and thus they fall victim more easily to rape and live in constant fear.|$|E

He confronts Bishop How, telling him that he believes Merrick’s faith is merely another attempt to emulate others. It comes out that the real source of his frustrations is the chaos of the world around him, with his patients seemingly <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> can to shorten their own lives. No matter how hard he tries he cannot help them, just as he cannot help Merrick. He finally begs for the Bishop to help him.|$|E

Monk is very crippled at the loss of his vision, despite Natalie telling him that there's always hope.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{critics of}} US foreign policy argue that power {{projection}} {{is not merely}} the ability to stabilize a given {{area of the world}} for regional security, but rather as means of discipline and control over the politics, economy and order of states. Noam Chomsky, a critically acclaimed author and activist argued [...] "In the Middle East, they are <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> can to ensure that Iraq remains an obedient client state that serves as a base for US power projection in the region and permits free exploitation of its rich oil resources by Western (primarily US) corporations. That much is evident from ongoing activities and formal pronouncements." ...|$|E

In the Cincinnati Riots of 1836 the press that printed his paper was twice destroyed.However, writing for his newspaper helped him develop ideas for fighting slavery legislatively. He used them as he worked with Salmon P. Chase to protect slaves who escaped to Ohio. In 1837, the American Anti-Slavery Society recruited him as an officer and corresponding secretary and he moved his family to New York.|$|E
50|$|Wilson, in Prometheus Rising, {{uses the}} example of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Hoover saw {{communist}} infiltrators and spies everywhere, and he told his agents to hunt them down. Therefore, FBI agents began seeing and interpreting everything they could as parts of the communist conspiracy. Some even {{went as far as}} framing people as communists, making largely baseless arrests and <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> could to satisfy Hoover's need to find and drive out the communist conspiracy. The problem is, such a conspiracy was greatly exaggerated. Hoover thought it was monolithic and pervasive, and any agent who dared point out the lack of evidence to Hoover would be at best denied promotions, and at worst labeled a communist himself and lose his job. Any agent who knew the truth would be very careful to hide the fact.|$|E
5000|$|The Haredim {{are often}} {{at odds with}} the Supreme Court of Israel, which does not base its rulings on halachic beliefs or policy. A notable case of this trend is the [...] "Who Is a Jew?" [...] case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the Ministry of the Interior (then {{controlled}} by Shas) must recognize Reform and Conservative converts to Judaism. In many instances, the Haredim have responded to these perceived threats angrily, verbally defending against their opponents. At the same time, they recognize the animosity many secular Israelis feel toward them, and have embarked on various public relations campaigns and other media projects to improve their image among the general public. In practice, the Israeli Haredim remain firmly entrenched in seats of political power befitting their voting strength, with both blocs <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> can to gain their support.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking at TAM 2012, Farley {{urged the}} {{audience}} of skeptics to become more involved spreading critical thinking on the Internet, {{just a few minutes}} each day.

[...] He cautions skeptics not to get too comfortable thinking that science will always win, because it is right. [...] "We may delude ourselves in thinking it science does not need our help."
