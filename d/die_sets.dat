50|$|Die {{making is}} a subgenre of tool making {{that focuses on}} making and {{maintaining}} dies. This often includes making punches, dies, steel rule dies, and <b>die</b> <b>sets.</b> Precision is key in die making; punches and dies must maintain proper clearance to produce parts accurately, and it is often necessary to have <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> machined with tolerances of less than one thousandth of an inch.|$|E
40|$|CAD-designers of {{aluminum}} extrusion <b>die</b> <b>set</b> {{have to make}} many decisions on tooling type, construction etc. by experience, their own metal flow sense and special methods of tooling design produced by manufacturer. There was created some software products for designing the planar <b>die</b> <b>set.</b> In addition, metal flow simulation programs using three-dimensional <b>die</b> <b>set</b> models as initial data were developed. However, {{it is a difficult}} task to create a high-quality solid <b>die</b> <b>set</b> model from scratch shortly. This led to three-dimensional <b>die</b> <b>set</b> parametrization systems development. QForm Extrusion Die Designer is one of them. Based on QExDD the automated design technique of <b>die</b> <b>set</b> elements is proposed. It takes into consideration the volumetric metal flow factor and design experience. In addition, it is aimed at CAD-CAE connection with QForm-Extrusion program. The proposed technique consists of two stages: preliminary designing and correction cycle. The first stage is to prepare profile contour and choose the first <b>die</b> <b>set</b> construction version. The algorithms implemented at this stage use only geometrical data, particularly profile contour. A received three-dimensional <b>die</b> <b>set</b> model is transferred to the second stage for iterative construction modification based on extrusion simulation results. As a result of automated design process there is the <b>die</b> <b>set</b> parametrical model that is ready for production and further extrusion test. The first version of the proposed technique is implemented using the QExDD software program and is now under tests in companies of Russia and UK. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Die {{casting process}} has been used widely for complex {{automotive}} products such as the knuckle, arm and etc. Generally, a part fabricated by casting has limited strength due to manufacturing defects by origin such as the dendrite structure and segregation. As an attempt to offer a solution to these problems, forging {{has been used as}} an alternative process. However, the forging process provides limited formability for complex shape products. Rheo-forging of metal offers not only superior mechanical strength but also requires significantly lower machine loads than solid forming processes. In order to produce semi-solid materials of the desired microstructure, a stirring process is applied during solidification of molten state. This paper presents the results of an A 356 aluminum alloy sample, which were obtained by experiment and by simulation using DEFORM 3 D. Samples of metal parts were subsequently fabricated by using hydraulic press machinery. In order to compare the influence of loading method, two types of samples were fabricated: (1) samples fabricated under direct loading <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> (2) those fabricated under indirect loading <b>die</b> <b>sets.</b> The formability and defects, which were predicted by FEM simulation, were similar to those of samples used in practice...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the manufacturing process}} for wide chord fan blades (WCFB) and how the production of <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> used for their manufacture can be substantially improved using reverse engineering. Super plastic formed WCFBs are manufactured by diffusion bonding five separate blade pieces under high pressure. The blade is then hot creep formed into the required shape, using pressure to force the blade against the die walls to yield the desired form, blade twist and the honeycomb centre required. Two <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> are required, one for the hot creep forming of the blade billet and the second for the super plastic blade forming process. Their manufacture requires three solid models to be generated from a bespoke ‘Fan Key System’. This calculates the die set geometry required for both hot and cold states. The three solid models comprise the casting model geometry which incorporates the draw angle and shrinkage allowance, the pattern model for {{the top and bottom}} <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> and a die set model used to define the NC part programs for the five axis finish machining process. The machining process has three elements, pre-machining sometimes termed water line or terrace machining, semi-finish and finish machining. Distortion caused by rate of cooling, graphite precipitation and mould dilation cause massive amounts of metal removal in the waterline machining process which can take up to 35 h and is a non-value added process. It often leaves the die wall thin with the resulting effect on performance and life. A reverse engineering solution was used to improve the geometry of the castings by predicting die distortion more accurately. Point cloud models of nine casting sets were imported into reverse engineering software, ‘Surfacer’ which made possible a comparison with the surface geometry representation required. The resulting design information enabled more accurate die set design. Waterline machining had been substantially reduced and die life has been extende...|$|E
