Having saluted the colour with his sword, the Sergeant-Major takes it from the Colour Sergeant, freeing him to change and then slope arms. The RSM turns, marches to the Ensign, and presents the colour to him. The Ensign salutes the colour with his sword, sheathes the sword without taking <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> colour, and takes possession of it.|$|E
500|$|Another [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] debuts in this episode: Eric Bruskotter {{joins the}} cast as Cooter Menkins, [...] "a football recruiter who comes scouting for talent at McKinley, but finds he can’t take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> team’s gruff but big-hearted coach." [...] Other recurring guest stars {{that appear in}} the episode include football coach Shannon Beiste (Jones), the focus of Cooter's eyes, former prom king Dave Karofsky (Adler), exchange student and new glee club member Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), and Mike's parents Julia Chang and Mike Chang, Sr. (Tamlyn Tomita and Sim).|$|E
500|$|When not {{travelling}} overseas on cricket tours, Harvey {{played baseball}} in the winter for the Fitzroy Baseball Club. He was twice named in the Australian baseball team but the team was named only for the distinction accorded on the players. That is, they never competed. Harvey's fielding abilities were regarded by Wisden as the [...] "finest outfielder in the world" [...] during his career. As a baseball infielder Harvey developed a half round arm throw; its speed and accuracy caused many batsmen to be run out while attempting a run. Ray Robinson said that Harvey's throw was [...] "arrow-like" [...] in accuracy and that [...] "as a versatile fieldsman, this ball-hawk...takes top place". His baseball training also influenced his habit of catching the ball above head height, with which he rarely dropped catches. This {{was based on the}} theory that the fielder need never take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ball and, if it were to bounce out of his hands, he would have time to attempt to grab the rebound. Harvey also covered ground quickly and possessed and efficient method of picking up and returning the ball. From late 1958 when Norm O'Neill made his Test debut until Harvey's retirement in 1963, the duo formed a formidable pairing in the covers, helping to restrict opposition batsmen from scoring in the region.|$|E

500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that today will be his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he has to go to the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself and get it over with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Cockayne {{decided to}} alter {{products}} for release on 16-bit consoles, since smaller 8-bit consoles, {{such as the}} ZX Spectrum, lacked the processing power for larger strategy games.

Following years of successful sales throughout the mid-1980s, Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties, and Cockayne admitted in a retrospective interview that [...] "he took <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ball".

60|$|When {{he entered}} the drawing-room he {{perceived}} at once that the lady was there.

5000|$|He will {{perhaps be}} best {{remembered as a}} [...] "super-sub", having earned wide acclaim for a habit of coming into matches late on as a {{substitute}} and scoring goals. Alex Ferguson remarked that Solskjær has a knack of {{sitting on the bench}} and studying the game without taking <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> action. Reflecting on this aspect of his career years later, Solskjær said: [...] "I had to think about myself, how can I do the most damage for the opposition if I come on?

50|$|Enckelman was {{the culprit}} for a {{defensive}} error in a hotly contested local derby (Birmingham City v Aston Villa (3-0) on 16 September 2002); as Olof Mellberg {{took a quick}} defensive throw-in to the keeper, Enckelman took <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ball and as {{he was unable to}} control it, it slid under his foot and rolled in to the goal. There is some debate over whether the goal should have stood, as the rules state that a goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in. The ball was adjudged to and appeared to scrape against the studs of his boot but Enckelman has stated on numerous occasions that he did not touch the ball prior to it entering the net. The incident led to further controversy when a rival fan charged onto the pitch and approached Enckelman, before making an offensive gesture directly to his face. The fan was later arrested and jailed, and Enckelman was praised for his refusal to retaliate.|$|R
