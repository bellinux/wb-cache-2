60|$|We have heard, my Lords, much {{discussion}} about jaghires. It is in proof before your Lordships {{that they are}} of two sorts: that a jaghire signifies exactly what the word fee does in the English language, or <b>feodum</b> in the barbarous Latin of the Feudists; {{that it is a}} word which signifies a salary or a maintenance, as did originally the English word fee, derived from the word feod and <b>feodum.</b> These jaghires, like other fees and like other feods, were given in land, as a maintenance: some with the condition of service, some without any condition; some were annexed to an office, some were granted as the support of a dignity, and none were granted for a less term than life, except those that were immediately annexed to a lease. We have shown your Lordships (and in this we have followed the example of Mr. Hastings) that some of them are fees granted actually in perpetuity; and in fact many of them are so granted. We are farther to tell your Lordships, that by the custom of the empire they are almost all grown, as the feods in Europe are grown, by use, into something which is at least virtually an inheritance. This is the state of the jaghires and jaghiredars.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "feudal" [...] or [...] "feodal" [...] {{is derived}} from the medieval Latin word <b>feodum.</b> The {{etymology}} of <b>feodum</b> is complex with multiple theories, some suggesting a Germanic origin (the most widely held view) and others suggesting an Arabic origin. Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a beneficium (Latin). Later, the term feudum, or <b>feodum,</b> began to replace beneficium in the documents. The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one-hundred years earlier. The origin of the feudum and why it replaced beneficium has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.|$|E

50|$|Enfeoffment {{gave the}} vassal extensive, {{hereditary}} usufruct of the fief, founded and maintained on {{a relationship of}} mutual loyalty between the lord and the beneficiary. The Latin word beneficum implied, not only the actual estate or property, the fief - in Latin usually called the <b>feodum</b> - but also the associated legal relationship.|$|E
50|$|A fief (also fee, feu, feud, tenure or fiefdom, Lehen, feudum, <b>feodum</b> or beneficium) was {{understood}} to be a thing (land, property), which its owner, the liege lord (Lehnsherr), had transferred to the hereditary ownership of the beneficiary {{on the basis of}} mutual loyalty, with the proviso that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Because feudalism was in {{its origin}} a Teutonic or Gothic system from {{northern}} Europe untouched by Roman civilization, it {{did not exist in}} ancient Rome, where the nearest equivalent was clientelism. No classical Latin word therefore exists to signify it, and a new Low-Latin word <b>feodum</b> was invented by mediaeval European scribes to use in their Latinised charters and other writings.|$|E
5000|$|A theory {{put forward}} by Archibald R. Lewis that the origin of 'fief' is not feudum (or <b>feodum),</b> but rather foderum, the {{earliest}} attested use being in Astronomus's Vita Hludovici (840). In that text is a passage about Louis the Pious which says annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant, which can be translated as [...] "(Louis forbade that) military provender which they popularly call 'fodder' (be furnished)." ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{derived from}} the Latin word <b>feodum</b> or feudum (fief), then in use, the term feudalism and the system it {{describes}} were not conceived of as a formal political system by {{the people living in}} the Middle Ages. In its classic definition, by Fran√ßois-Louis Ganshof (1944), feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{theory was}} {{put forward by}} Archibald R. Lewis. Lewis said the origin of 'fief' is not feudum (or <b>feodum),</b> but rather foderum, the {{earliest}} attested use being in Astronomus's Vita Hludovici (840). In that text is a passage about Louis the Pious that says annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant, which can be translated as [...] "Louis forbade that military provender (which they popularly call [...] "fodder") be furnished.." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Cistercian Abbey of Woney (Irish, Mainistir Uaithne), {{also written}} Wotheny or Owney, {{on the banks}} of the Mulkear River in Abington, County Limerick, was founded in 1205 when Theobald Walter (le Botiller) granted the whole [...] "theodum" [...] (believed to be an error, which should have been <b>feodum)</b> of Woodenikuwice for the purpose. Traces of the {{architecture}} and layout of the monastery may still seen in the graveyard in the hamlet of Abington, just south of Murroe.|$|E
5000|$|Allodial {{lands are}} the {{absolute}} property of their owner and {{not subject to}} any rent, service, or acknowledgment to a superior. Allodial title is therefore an alternative to feudal land tenure. However, historian J.C. Holt states that [...] "In Normandy the word alodium, whatever its sense {{in other parts of}} the Continent, meant not land held free of seigneurial services, but land held by hereditary right," [...] and that [...] "alodium and <b>feodum</b> should be given the same meaning in England." ...|$|E
5000|$|In ancient Rome a [...] "benefice" [...] (from the Latin noun beneficium, meaning [...] "benefit") {{was a gift}} of land (precaria) {{for life}} {{as a reward for}} {{services}} rendered, originally, to the state. In medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service continued to be called a beneficium (Latin). Later, the term feudum, or <b>feodum,</b> began to replace beneficium in the documents. The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one hundred years earlier. The origin of the feudum and why it replaced beneficium has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.|$|E
50|$|Around 800, under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire {{covered a}} great deal of Europe. In much of this empire an {{important}} unit of regional administration, corresponding roughly to a shire or county in England, was the gau (Frankish), or pagus (Latin). A comes or Count ruled over one or more gaue. Because of the low trade, the negative trade balance with the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim states, and the disappearance of currency, the economy was more or less reduced to bartering. The king's vassals could only be rewarded by giving them land (beneficium, from the tenth century on <b>feodum)</b> and usufruct. From this the system of Feudalism developed. The vassals, who were generally appointed by the king, strove for a system of inheritance. This become more and more the rule, and in 877 it was legalised in the Capitulary of Quierzy.|$|E
5000|$|In English common law, fee tail or entail {{is a form}} {{of trust}} {{established}} by deed or settlement which restricts the sale or inheritance of an estate in real property and prevents the property from being sold, devised by will, or otherwise alienated by the tenant-in-possession, and instead causes it to pass automatically by operation of law to an heir pre-determined by the settlement deed. The term fee tail is from Medieval Latin <b>feodum</b> talliatum, which means [...] "cut(-short) fee", and is in contrast to [...] "fee simple" [...] where no such restriction exists and where the possessor has an absolute title (although subject to the allodial title of the monarch) in the property which he can bequeath or otherwise dispose of as he wishes. Equivalent legal concepts exist or formerly existed in many other European countries and elsewhere.|$|E
