Here we describe {{the development of a}} safe and effective intranasal subunit vaccine that is based on recombinant fusion (F) protein bound to the surface of immunostimulatory bacterium-like particles (BLPs) derived from the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis. Different variants of F were analyzed with respect to their conformation and reactivity with neutralizing antibodies, assuming that F proteins mimicking the metastable prefusion form of RSV F expose a more extensive and relevant epitope repertoire than F proteins corresponding to the postfusion structure. Our results indicate that the recombinant soluble ectodomain of RSV F readily adopts a postfusion conformation, generation of which cannot be prevented by C-terminal addition of a trimerization motif, but whose formation is prevented by mutation of the two <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> in F. While the putative postfusion form of F is recognized well by the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab, this is much less so for the more potently neutralizing, prefusion-specific antibodies D 25 and AM 22. Both addition of the trimerization motif and mutation of the <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> increased the reactivity of F with D 25 and AM 22, with the highest reactivity being observed for F proteins in which both these features were combined. Intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with BLPs loaded with this latter prefusion-like F protein (BLP-F), resulted in the potent induction of F-specific immunoglobulins and in significantly decreased virus titers in the lungs upon RSV challenge. Moreover, and in contrast to animals vaccinated with formalin-inactivated RSV, animals that received BLP-F exhibited high levels of F-specific secretory IgA in the nose and RSV-neutralizing antibodies in sera, but did not show symptoms of enhanced disease after challenge with RSV...|$|R

40|$|Furin is a proprotein convertase that proteolytically cleaves protein {{precursors}} {{to yield}} functional proteins. Efficient cleavage {{depends on the}} presence of a specific sequence motif on the substrate. Currently, the cleavage site motif is described as a four amino acid pattern: R-X-[K/R]-R↓. However, not all furin cleavage recognition sites can be described by this pattern and not all R-X-[K/R]-R↓ sites are cleaved by furin. Since many furin substrates are involved in the pathogenesis of viral infection and human diseases, it is important to accurately characterize the <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> motif. In this study, the <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> motif was characterized using statistical analysis. The data were interpreted within the 3 D crystal structure of the furin catalytic domain. The results indicate that the <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> motif is comprised of about 20 residues, P 14 –P 6 ´. Specific physical properties such as volume, charge, and hydrophilicity are required at specific positions.

We made use of reverse genetics to study the importance of FCS- 2 and of pep 27 for BRSV replication in cell culture. Replacement of FCS- 2 in the F protein of recombinant viruses by either of the sequences NANR 109, RANN 109 or SANN 109, respectively, abolished proteolytic processing at this position, whereas the cleavage of FCS- 1 was not affected.

Conversion to the “on” state leads to accelerated deuteration in the S 2 region and in nearby secondary structural elements within the HD. In contrast, complexation with the inhibitory antibody retards deuteration around the S 2 site.

40|$|The {{endoprotease}} furin, which {{belongs to}} the family of mammalian proprotein convertase (PC), is synthesized as a zymogen with an N-terminal, 81 -residue inhibitory prodomain. It has been shown that the proenzyme form of furin undergoes a multistep `autocatalytic' removal of the prodomain at the C-terminal side of the two consensus sites, R 78 -T-K-R 81 ∼ and R 44 -G-V-T-K-R 49 ∼. The furin-mediated cleavage at R 44 -G-V-T-K-R 49 ∼, in particular, is significantly accelerated in an `acidic' environment. Here, we show that under neutral pH conditions, the inhibitory prodomain of furin is partially folded and undergoes conformational exchanges as indicated by extensive broadening of the NMR spectra. Presence of many ring-current shifted methyl resonances suggests that the partially folded state of the prodomain may still possess a `semirigid' protein core with specific packing interactions among amino acid side chains. Measurements of the hydrodynamic radii and compaction factors indicate that this partially folded state is significantly more compact than a random chain. The conformational stability of the prodomain appears to be pH sensitive, in that the prodomain undergoes an unfolding transition towards acidic conditions. Our NMR analyses establish that the acid-induced unfolding is mainly experienced by the residues from the C-terminal half of the prodomain (residues R 44 –R 81) that contains the two <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites.</b> A 38 -residue peptide fragment derived from the entire pH-sensitive C-terminal region (residues R 44 –R 81) does not exhibit any exchange-induced line broadening and adopts flexible conformations. We propose that at neutral pH, the <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> R 44 -G-V-T-K-R 49 ∼ is buried within the protein core that is formed in part by residues from the N-terminal region, and that the <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> becomes exposed under acidic conditions, leading to a facile <b>cleavage</b> by the <b>furin</b> enzyme...|$|R
40|$|The {{coronavirus}} {{spike protein}} (S) {{plays a key role}} in the early steps of viral infection, with the S 1 domain responsible for receptor binding and the S 2 domain mediating membrane fusion. In some cases, the S protein is proteolytically cleaved at the S 1 –S 2 boundary. In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S 2 domain (S 2 ′, R 797). Mutation of R 797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell–cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> at both the S 2 ′ cleavage site within S 2 793 -KPTKR- 797 (S 2 ′), as well as at the junction of S 1 and S 2.

Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S 2 ′), acting in concert with the S 1 –S 2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND/AIMS: The iron-regulatory peptide {{hepcidin}} is synthesized in {{the liver}} as an 84 -aa pre-pro-hormone maturated by proteolysis through a consensus <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> to generate the bioactive 25 -aa peptide secreted in the circulation. This peptide regulates iron export from enterocytes and macrophages by binding the membrane iron exporter, ferroportin, leading to its degradation. Whether pro-hepcidin could be secreted and reflect hepcidin levels remains an open question. However, {{the activity of the}} pro-peptide on ferroportin degradation has never been addressed. METHODS: To answer this question, we produced recombinant pro-hepcidin, both the wild-type form and a <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> mutant, and tested their activity on ferroportin levels in macrophagic J 774 cells. Furin activity was also modulated using furin inhibitor or siRNA-mediated furin mRNA knockdown. RESULTS: We found that pro-hepcidin could fully induce ferroportin degradation, but only when processed by furin to generate the mature hepcidin- 25 form. Pro-hepcidin activity was abolished in the presence of furin inhibitor and diminished after siRNA-mediated knockdown of furin mRNA. Furthermore, the mutated version of pro-hepcidin was completely inefficient at degrading ferroportin in macrophages.

There is a clear interdependence of furin subsites that must be taken in account in determining its specificity and also for the design of inhibitors. However, clear preferences were detected for Substrates with S at P'(1), and V at P'(2), at P'(3) the amino acids D, S, 1, and A are almost equally frequent. in the non-prime subsites the best Substrates presented S and H at P(6); basic amino acids at P(5); and no clear tendency at P(3).

Sequence alignment analysis indicates QSsulf1 is homologous with lysosomal N-acetyl glucosamine sulfatases (G6-sulfatases) that catalyze the hydrolysis of 6-O sulfates from N-acetyl glucosamines of heparan sulfate during the degradation of HSPGs. [...] In contrast to lysosomal active sulfatases, QSulf1 localizes exclusively to the cell surface by interacting hydrophilically with a non-heparan sulfate outer membrane component, and is enzymatically active at a neutral pH. [...] By mutating the catalytically active cysteines to alanine, thereby blocking N-formylglycine formation, they found QSulf1 was responsible for Wingless (Wnt) release from HS chains to activate the Frizzled receptor; this was the first evidence that an extracellular sulf was capable of modifying HS and therefore cell signaling. [...] The overall structure of QSulf is followed closely by its orthologues and paralogues, including human and mouse. The human and murine orthologues of QSulf1, HSulf1 and MSulf1, respectively, were cloned and characterized after the discovery of QSulf1.

The mouse egg ZP is composed of three glycoproteins, called mZP 1 – 3, that are synthesized, secreted, and assembled into a ZP exclusively by growing oocytes. Here, we microinjected epitope-tagged (Myc and Flag) cDNAs for mZP 2 and mZP 3 into the germinal vesicle (nucleus) of growing oocytes isolated from juvenile mice. Specific antibodies and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to follow nascent, recombinant ZP glycoproteins in both permeabilized and nonpermeabilized oocytes. When such cDNAs were injected, epitope-tagged mZP 2 (Myc-mZP 2) and mZP 3 (Flag-mZP 3) were synthesized, packaged into large intracellular vesicles, and secreted by {{the vast majority of}} oocytes. Secreted glycoproteins were incorporated into only the innermost layer of the thickening ZP, and the amount of nascent glycoprotein in this region increased with increasing time of oocyte culture. Consistent with prior observations, the putative transmembrane domain at the C terminus of mZP 2 and mZP 3 was missing from nascent glycoprotein incorporated into the ZP. When the consensus <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> near the C terminus of mZP 3 was mutated, such that it should not be cleaved by furin, secretion and assembly of mZP 3 was reduced.

Results and conclusions—With or without co-expression of VWF, 226 /N 6 was secreted into milk as a biologically active single chain molecule that retained high specific activity similar to therapeutic-grade FVIII. 226 /N 6 had 3 ̆e 450 -fold higher IU/ml than previously reported in cell culture for rFVIII. 226 /N 6 exhibited similar binding to plasma-derived VWF as therapeutic-grade rFVIII and intravenous infusion of transgenic 226 /N 6 corrected the bleeding phenotype of hemophilia A mice. This provides proof-of-principle to study expression of 226 /N 6 and perhaps other single chain bioengineered rFVIII in the milk of transgenic livestock...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{activation of}} the human epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by cleavage. We focused on cleavage of αENaC using the serine protease subtilisin. Trimeric channels formed with αFM, a construct with point mutations in both <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> (R 178 A/R 204 A), exhibited marked reduction in spontaneous cleavage and an ∼ 10 -fold decrease in amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductance as compared with αWT (2. 2 versus 21. 2 microsiemens (μS)). Both αWT and αFM were activated to similar levels by subtilisin cleavage. Channels formed with αFD, a construct that deleted the segment between the two furin sites (Δ 175 – 204), exhibited an intermediate conductance of 13. 2 μS. More importantly, αFD retained {{the ability to be}} activated by subtilisin to 108. 8 ± 20. 9 μS, a level not significantly different from that of subtilisin activated αWT (125. 6 ± 23. 9). Therefore, removal of the tract between the two furin sites is not the main mechanism of channel activation. In these experiments the levels of the cleaved 22 -kDa N-terminal fragment of α was low and did not match those of the C-terminal 65 -kDa fragment. This indicated that cleavage may activate ENaC by the loss of the smaller fragment and the first transmembrane domain. This was confirmed in channels formed with αLD, a construct that extended the deleted sequence of αFD by 17 amino acids (Δ 175 – 221). Channels with αLD were uncleaved, exhibited low baseline activity (4. 1 μS), and were insensitive to subtilisin. Collectively, these data support an alternative hypothesis of ENaC activation by cleavage that may involve the loss of the first transmembrane domain from the channel complex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractB-cell {{activating}} factor (BAFF), {{also known}} as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily member 13 B, is an important immune regulator with critical roles in B-cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion. A BAFF gene has been cloned from spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and its expression studied. The dogfish BAFF encodes for an anchored type-II transmembrane protein of 288 aa with a putative <b>furin</b> protease <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> and TNF family signature as seen in BAFFs from other species. The identity of dogfish BAFF has also been confirmed by conserved cysteine residues, and phylogenetic tree analysis. The dogfish BAFF gene has an extra exon not seen in teleost fish, birds and mammals that encodes for 29 aa and may impact on receptor binding. The dogfish BAFF is highly expressed in immune tissues, such as spleen, and is up-regulated by PWM in peripheral blood leucocytes, suggesting a potentially {{important role in the}} immune system...|$|R
40|$|Enveloped viruses need to fuse with a {{host cell}} {{membrane}} in order to deliver their genome into the host cell. While some viruses fuse with the plasma membrane, many viruses are endocytosed prior to fusion. Specific cues in the endosomal microenvironment induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to viral and host membrane fusion. In the present study we investigated the entry of coronaviruses (CoVs). Using siRNA gene silencing, we found that proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion profoundly promote infection of cells with mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Using recombinant MHVs expressing reporter genes {{as well as a}} novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of MHV to lysosomes is required for fusion and productive entry to occur. Nevertheless, MHV was shown to be less sensitive to perturbation of endosomal pH than vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus, which fuse in early and late endosomes, respectively. Our results indicate that entry of MHV depends on proteolytic processing of its fusion protein S by lysosomal proteases. Fusion of MHV was severely inhibited by a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, while trafficking of MHV to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases was no longer required when a <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> was introduced in the S protein immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. Also entry of feline CoV was shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases. In contrast, MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> just upstream of the fusion peptide, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases. We conclude that a proteolytic cleavage site in the CoV S protein directly upstream of the fusion peptide is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of fusion...|$|E
40|$|The apicomplexan {{parasite}} Cryptosporidium causes diarrheal disease worldwide. Proteolytic {{processing of}} proteins plays {{a significant role}} in host cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites. In previous studies, we described gp 40 / 15, a Cryptosporidium sp. glycoprotein that is proteolytically cleaved to yield two surface glycopeptides (gp 40 and gp 15), which are implicated in mediating infection of host cells. In the present study, we showed that biosynthetically labeled gp 40 / 15 is processed in Cryptosporidium parvum-infected HCT- 8 cells. We identified a putative <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> RSRR↓ in the deduced amino acid sequence of gp 40 / 15 from C. parvum and from all Cryptosporidium hominis subtypes except subtype 1 e. Both human furin and a protease activity present in a C. parvum lysate cleaved recombinant C. parvum gp 40 / 15 protein into 2 peptides, identified as gp 40 and gp 15 by size and by immunoreactivity with specific antibodies. C. hominis gp 40 / 15 subtype 1 e, in which the RSRR sequence is replaced by ISKR, has an alternative <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> (KSISKR↓) and was also cleaved by both furin and the C. parvum lysate. Site-directed mutagenesis of the C. parvum RSRR sequence to ASRR resulted in inhibition of cleavage by furin and the C. parvum lysate. Cleavage of recombinant gp 40 / 15 and a synthetic furin substrate by the C. parvum lysate was inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, by the specific furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (Dec-RVKR-cmk), and by calcium chelators, suggesting that the parasite expresses a Ca 2 + dependent, furin-like protease activity. The furin inhibitor Dec-RVKR-cmk decreased C. parvum infection of HCT- 8 cells, suggesting that a furin-like protease activity may be involved in mediating host-parasite interactions...|$|E
40|$|Immunoproapoptotin {{consists}} of a single-chain antibody against tumor-specific surface marker and an active domain which has the function of translocation and pro-apoptosis. This fused recombinant protein can specifically recognize and kill tumor cells. Immunoproapoptotin comes from immunotoxin which is proved not successful in clinical trials by inducing neutralizing antibody and other side effects due to the heterogenous toxins domains from bacteria or plants. To avoid the immunogenicity of immunotoxin, effectors from human were employed in the 2 nd generation of Immunoproapoptotin. However, the translocation domain is still heterogenous and the efficiency of translocation is limited. In the latest progress, a <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> was used to substitute for the translocation domain and thus enhanced the translocation efficiency and greatly reduced the immunogenicity of Immunoproapoptotin, demonstrating a wide clinical application prospects...|$|E
40|$|B-cell-activating {{factor of}} the TNF family (BAFF) /BLyS {{contributes}} to B-cell homeostasis and {{function in the}} periphery. BAFF is expressed as a membrane-bound protein or released by proteolytic cleavage, but the functional importance of this processing event is poorly understood. Mice expressing BAFF with a mutated <b>furin</b> consensus <b>cleavage</b> <b>site,</b> i. e. furin-mutant BAFF (fmBAFF), were not different from BAFF-deficient mice {{with regard to their}} B-cell populations and responses to immunization. It is however noteworthy that an alternative processing event releases some soluble BAFF in fmBAFF mice. Mild overexpression (? 5 -fold) of fmBAFF alone generated intermediate levels of B cells without improving humoral responses to immunization. Processed BAFF was however important for B-cell homeostasis, as peripheral B-cell populations and antibody responses were readily restored by administration of soluble BAFF trimers in BAFF-deficient mice. However, the rescue of CD 23 expression in B cells of BAFF-deficient mice required both soluble BAFF trimers and fmBAFF, or a polymeric form of soluble BAFF (BAFF 60 -mer). These results point to a predominant role of processed BAFF for B-cell homeostasis and function, and indicate possible accessory roles for membrane-bound BAFF...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the tumor}} {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) family play key roles in the regulation of in¯ammation, immune responses and tissue homeostasis. Here we describe the identi®cation of the chicken homologue of mammalian B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF/BLyS). By searching a chicken EST database we identi®ed two overlapping cDNA clones that code for the entire open reading frame of chicken BAFF (chBAFF), which contains a predicted transmembrane domain and a putative <b>furin</b> protease <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> like its mammalian counterparts. The amino acid identity between soluble chicken and human BAFF is 76 %, considerably higher than for most other known cytokines. The chBAFF gene is most strongly expressed in the bursa of Fabricius. Soluble recombinant chBAFF produced by human 293 T cells interacted with the mammalian cell-surface receptors TACI, BCMA and BAFF-R. It bound to chicken B cells, but not to other lymphocytes, and it promoted the survival of splenic chicken B cells in culture. Furthermore, bacterially expressed chBAFF induced the selective expansion of B cells in the spleen and cecal tonsils when administered to young chicks. Our results suggest that like its mammalian counterpart, chBAFF {{plays an important role}} in survival and/or proliferation of chicken B cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{engineered}} {{an artificial}} β cell line that produces an up-regulation of insulin {{in response to}} dexamethasone, and a down-regulation in response to insulin. A regulatory secretion system was devised by placing proinsulin cDNA containing genetically engineered <b>furin</b> endoprotease <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> and a regulatory promoter for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and an insulin expressing retrovirus vector (pN-PEPCK-mINS) was constructed and transfected into Hepa 1 - 6 cells. The levels of insulin in culture medium and expression of insulin gene was estimated by radioimmunoassay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The clone (Hepa 1 - 6 /INS 21), which secreted {{the highest level of}} insulin (10. 79 µIU/ 106 cells per day), was selected for the regulation experiment. Compared with the non-treated Hepa 1 - 6 /INS 21 cells, insulin production was augmented 3. 6 -fold by the addition of 10 − 7 M of dexamethasone. Addition of exogenous insulin to the culture medium decreased insulin mRNA expression remarkably on RT-PCR results, while dexamethasone increased insulin gene expression at the transcriptional level. The data indicated that genetically engineered Hepa 1 - 6 cells could synthesize process and secrete insulin in a physiological manner.
