50|$|In {{order to}} solve these {{problems}} FPD-Link which uses low-voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, were adopted into LCDs. LVDS, defined by the ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A standard, is a differential signaling system that can run at high speed. LVDS works in serial data transmission. As the main applications had 18 bits color depth in early adoption of FPD-Link, a 7-bit wide <b>differential</b> <b>cable</b> pair for each of 3 channels with another channel for clock became used. By this adoption of FPD-Link, internal interface systems of LCDs could reduce the 22 pair cables into 8 pairs with high-speed serial transmission. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) adopted this as a video standard specification and FPD-Link has penetrated wider as LCD interface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{spectral}} {{nature of}} common mode currents induced {{on high speed}} <b>differential</b> <b>cables</b> operating at 1. 0625 Gb/s was investi-gated using specially constructed shielded test boards. The source test board provided a source with a selectable amount of delay skew. The load test board provided a simple 150 Ohm differential load. The two boards were placed in separate shielded enclosures with a one meter Fibre Channel cable connecting them. Common-mode cable shield current and radiated emissions at 3 meters were meas-ured {{as a function of}} delay skew. At the fundamental frequency of 53 1. 25 MHz, common-mode current and radiated emissions in-creased at a rate of approximately 9 dB/decade of skew. At skew values much lower than the rise time of the signal, common-mode current increased nearly linearly with skew. The second harmonic was present on the cable shield due to duty cycle distortion and rise and fall time differences inherent in the driver transceiver...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} cable equation, {{in which}} membrane conductance is considered constant, is modified by including the linearized effect of membrane potential on sodium and potassium ionic currents, as formulated in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for the squid giant axon. The resulting partial differential equation is solved by numerical inversion of the Laplace transform of the voltage {{response to current}} and voltage inputs. The voltage response is computed for voltage step, current step, and current pulse inputs, {{and the effect of}} temperature on the response to a current step input is also calculated. The validity of the linearized approximation is examined by comparing the linearized response to a current step input with the solution of the nonlinear partial <b>differential</b> <b>cable</b> equation for various subthreshold current step inputs. All the computed responses for the squid giant axon show oscillatory behavior and depart significantly from what is predicted {{on the basis of the}} classical cable equation.

40|$|Abstract-High-speed data links over copper cables can be {{effectively}} equalized using pulse-width modulation (PWM) pre-emphasis. This provides {{an alternative to}} the usual 2 -tap FIR filters. The use of PWM pre-emphasis allows a channel loss at the Nyquist frequency of ~ 30 dB, compared to ~ 20 dB for a 2 -tap symbol-spaced FIR filter. The use of PWM fits well with future high-speed low-voltage CMOS processes. The filter has only one ‘knob’, which is the duty-cycle. This makes convergence of an algorithm for automatic adaptation straightforward. Spectral analysis illustrates that, compared to a 2 -tap FIR filter, the steeper PWM filter transfer function fits better to the copper channel. This applies to both half-symbol-spaced and symbol-spaced 2 -tap FIR filters. Circuits for implementation are as straightforward as for FIR pre-emphasis. In this paper new measurements are presented for a previous transmitter chip, and a new high-swing transmitter chip is presented. Both coaxial and <b>differential</b> <b>cables</b> are used for the tests. A bit rate of 5 Gb/s (2 -PAM) was achieved with all cable assemblies, over a cable length of up to 130 m.

Contemporary {{operational}} strategy is either to remove and replace the fuel source, or to refuel on-deck. Both strategies require the vehicle to surface, be recovered and be relaunched.

The paper describes the almagamation of an algorithm due to Pode, Eames, Berteaux, and Knutson. The purpose here is to solve the <b>differential</b> <b>cable</b> equation in order to estimate loads and costs. A comparison between published data and the present algorithm satisfies reliability considerations. The results of the present algorithm are extended to answer such questions as 1) how long a cable is needed under specified conditions?, and 2) what are the loads and moments felt at the ship? At least three electromechanical (EM) cables are specified. One steel EM cable and two kevlar EM cables are compared in terms of performance and cost. The frequency analysis of Milburn is repeated for the three cables. Survey-class AUVs are described and their salient parameters reviewed. Cable scopes required at increments of depth are tabulated for the kevlar cable. Detailed design can proceed based on this preliminary proposal. <br/...|$|E

40|$|A charge-coupled-device (CCD) based {{high-speed}} imaging system, {{called a}} realtime, event-driven (RARE) camera, is undergoing development. This camera {{is capable of}} readout from multiple subwindows [also known as regions of interest (ROIs) ] within the CCD field of view. Both the sizes and {{the locations of the}} ROIs can be controlled in real time and can be changed at the camera frame rate. The predecessor of this camera was described in High-Frame-Rate CCD Camera Having Subwindow Capability (NPO- 30564) NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 26, No. 12 (December 2002), page 26. The architecture of the prior camera requires tight coupling between camera control logic and an external host computer that provides commands for camera operation and processes pixels from the camera. This tight coupling limits the attainable frame rate and functionality of the camera. The design of the present camera loosens this coupling to increase the achievable frame rate and functionality. From a host computer perspective, the readout operation in the prior camera was defined on a per-line basis; in this camera, it is defined on a per-ROI basis. In addition, the camera includes internal timing circuitry. This combination of features enables real-time, event-driven operation for adaptive control of the camera. Hence, this camera is well suited for applications requiring autonomous control of multiple ROIs to track multiple targets moving throughout the CCD field of view. Additionally, by eliminating the need for control intervention by the host computer during the pixel readout, the present design reduces ROI-readout times to attain higher frame rates. This camera (see figure) includes an imager card consisting of a commercial CCD imager and two signal-processor chips. The imager card converts transistor/ transistor-logic (TTL) -level signals from a field programmable gate array (FPGA) controller card. These signals are transmitted to the imager card via a low-voltage <b>differential</b> signaling (LVDS) <b>cable</b> assembly.
