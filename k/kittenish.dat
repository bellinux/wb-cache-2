Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald gave the song a B+, saying that [...] "pop fans always need a huge hook, catchy chorus and break-it-down-build-it-up bridge. This song’s got all three". Edna Gundersen of USA Today called it [...] "a sleek and impossibly catchy slab", and said that although the song is unmistakable Luke, Spears [...] "holds her own with confident, <b>kittenish</b> vocals." [...] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated that the track [...] "is Spears's most joyously danceable track in a long time." [...] Caryn Ganz of Spin named it [...] "her first truly synapse-sizzling single since 'Toxic. Andy Gill of The Independent selected the song along with [...] "Criminal" [...] as the download picks of the album. Kevin Ritchie of Now stated that [...] "Wannabe World Cup anthem Till The World Ends kicks things off with an aura of pounding, Euro dance euphoria." ...|$|E

She received her first Tony Award nomination in 1970, {{for her role in}} the Neil Simon play, Last of the Red Hot Lovers (1969). Clive Barnes, in his review for The New York Times, wrote: [...] "Linda Lavin, eyebrows, [...] flaunting like telegraphed messages, mouth twitching and pouting, voice as dry as thunder and with a cough like electric static, is beautiful as Elaine, the sex cat feeling coolly <b>kittenish</b> and looking for a safe tin roof." [...] Lavin's last Broadway credit before she moved to Hollywood was in Paul Sills' Story Theatre in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Williams can be {{identified}} as a soprano. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic commented {{that she has a}} [...] "warm, <b>kittenish</b> voice" [...] with the ability to [...] "transform" [...] from [...] "kitten to tiger", belting [...] "with absolute conviction". [...] GospelMusicCity.com praised her [...] "delicate vocals" [...] and described her [...] "sopralto stylings" [...] as [...] "inimitable", writing that on [...] "Heard a Word" [...] she [...] "demonstrates further versatility in Ella-like fashion". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also compared her to other singers writing; [...] "Williams's warm vocal recalls both the playful wisps of her R contemporaries (Jill Scott, Erykah Badu) and the breathy timbre of Diana Ross" [...] while Emily Sogn of PopMatters wrote [...] "Williams singing style is pleasingly slow paced...that owes a lot to her pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson." [...] Similarly, Mike Rimmer of Cross Rhythms described her voice as [...] "soulful" [...] and Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that [...] "Williams's strength is a shimmery jazz lilt".|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{has been described}} by Hilary Kingsley, author the EastEnders Handbook, as a [...] "tease [...] a pretty girl who thinks she can get anything she wants, thanks to her own brand of sexy wheedling." [...] She adds that Sam is [...] "a lot sharper than her brothers [...] and contrives to do just what she wants in the face of their attempts to stand in for their dead father [...] Sam loves excitement and doesn't frighten easily. She's a user, able to get almost anyone to do what she wants." [...] Kate Lock, author of EastEnders Who's Who, has described Sam as [...] "Headstrong, streetwise and pretty [...] a chip off the old Mitchell block, though her methods of manipulation are marginally more subtle than [...] One bat of a sooty eyelash is enough to charm most men into submission and she can wind doting mum Peggy round her little finger [...] she returned to the Square , Sam had lost her <b>kittenish</b> cuteness and hardened up, becoming more EastEnd moll than Barbie doll." ...|$|E
2500|$|MTV praised Perry's vocals, though {{felt the}} lyrics were [...] "clunky". Slant Magazine {{stated that the}} song is [...] "not an {{actively}} painful listen. Sure, the would-be inspirational lyrics ('Baby you're a firework/Come on show them what you're worth') are nonsensical, ... but the chorus gains some momentum and the song would work well enough in a club setting that you could forgive its otherwise glaring weaknesses." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose [...] "Firework" [...] among the top tracks on the album, Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song five out of five stars, calling it [...] "a straight up self-empowerment anthem wrapped in a Coldplay-on-poppers club banger from the Stargate team." [...] PopMatters wrote that [...] "Firework" [...] is [...] "the record's last hurrah; though nothing particularly memorable.....'Firework' has at least a bit of staying power". The Washington Post described the song as [...] "too mushy". Al Fox of BBC Music said that the song [...] "displays a breezy maturity and serious set of pipes, a true demonstration of Perry's musicianship without contradicting the <b>kittenish</b> mischief of the bigger picture." [...] The song was nominated for Record of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Hutchence {{provided}} vocals for Richard Clapton's album Glory Road {{which was}} produced by Jon Farriss. INXS released Kick in October, which provided the band with worldwide popularity, it peaked at No.1 in Australia, No.3 on the US Billboard 200, No.9 in UK, and No.15 in Austria. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top10 U.S. singles, [...] "New Sensation", [...] "Never Tear Us Apart", [...] "Devil Inside" [...] and No.1 [...] "Need You Tonight". [...] "Need You Tonight" [...] peaked No.2 on the UK charts, No.3 in Australia, and No.10 in France. The song is not lyrically complex, it is Hutchence's performance where [...] "he sings in <b>kittenish</b> whisper, gently drawing back with the incredible lust of a tiger hunting in the night... Hutchence knows the prey will eventually come to him" [...] that makes the song [...] "as sexy and funky as any white rock group has ever been". They toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video, directed by Lowenstein, for the 1987 INXS track [...] "Mediate" [...] (which played after the video for [...] "Need You Tonight") replicated the format of Bob Dylan's video for [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues", even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988 the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for [...] "Need You Tonight/Mediate" [...] winning in five categories.|$|E
2500|$|Marc Hirsh from Boston Globe {{criticized the}} track [...] "Sexercize", but {{ultimately}} {{said about the}} album; [...] "It’s the album’s only genuine misstep, but it’s still perplexing, hearing a Minogue that can do wrong." [...] Joe Muggs from Fact magazine awarded it 3.5 points out of 5. Muggs felt majority of the album contained too many fillers and exemplified the songs [...] "Les Sex", [...] "I Was Gonna Cancel", and [...] "Sexercize", but commended the overall production, Minogue's vocal deliveries in most tracks, and the quality. Similarly, Entertainment Weekly writer Adam Markovitz graded it B– and criticized the [...] "sex" [...] tracks. However, he complimented Minogue's [...] "plucky" [...] charm and felt {{it was more a}} treat to her fanbase. Kitty Empire from The Observer said [...] "Polished but <b>kittenish,</b> Kiss Me Once remains true to the effervescent dance-pop for which Kylie is known. But the scenery around this album has altered profoundly." [...] Neil McCormick from The Telegraph awarded it three stars, and complimented her [...] "charm", the albums hooks, and the overall electronic sound, but criticized her lack of innovation through the production and songwriting field. The Guardians Alexis Petridis also awarded the album three stars and listed it as his album of the week of 13 March 2014. He commented that the overall release was [...] "glossy and depthless", and concluded [...] "Her voice isn't the strongest, the lyrics are woeful and filler abounds – but Kylie hasn't lost her knack for producing a superior brand of pop...".|$|E

60|$|The man was {{conscious}} of some disgust. She looked very young and, slight as she was, her figure was prettily rounded {{and she had a}} soft, <b>kittenish</b> gracefulness; but she spoke with the assurance of a dowager. Though he had killed and cut up many a deer, he shrank from the small red stain on her delicate hand. She saw it and laughed, and then with a sudden change of mood she stooped and swiftly rubbed her fingers in the heather.|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} lunch, as {{we made our}} way to the first tee, that the advance-guard of the Mrs. Jopps {{appeared}} in the person of Luella Mainprice Jopp, a <b>kittenish</b> little woman with blond hair and a Pekingese dog. I remembered reading in the papers that she had divorced my employer for persistent and aggravated mental cruelty, calling witnesses to bear out her statement that he had said he did not like her in pink, and that on two separate occasions had insisted on her dog eating the leg of a chicken instead of the breast; but Time, the great healer, seemed to have removed all bitterness, and she greeted him affectionately.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was on}} {{this very}} day that Mr. Arbuton found it harder than ever to renew his {{resolution}} of quitting Quebec, and cutting short at once his acquaintance with these people. He had been pledging himself to this in some form every day, and every morrow had melted his resolution away. Whatever was his opinion of Colonel and Mrs. Ellison, it is certain that, if he considered Kitty merely {{in relation to the}} present, he could not have said how, by being different, she could have been better than she was. He perceived a charm, that would be recognized anywhere, in her manner, though it was not of his world; her fresh pleasure in all she saw, though {{he did not know how}} to respond to it, was very winning; he respected what he thought the good sense running through her transports; he wondered at the culture she had somewhere, somehow got; and he was so good as to find that her literary enthusiasms had nothing offensive, but were as pretty and naive as a girl's love of flowers. Moreover, he approved of some personal attributes of hers: a low, gentle voice, tender long-lashed eyes; a trick of drooping shoulders, and of idle hands fallen into the lap, one in the other's palm; a serene repose of face; a light and eager laugh. There was nothing so novel in those traits, and in different combination he had seen them a thousand times; yet in her they strangely wrought upon his fancy. She had that soft, <b>kittenish</b> way with her which invites a caressing patronage, but, as he learned, she had also the <b>kittenish</b> equipment for resenting over-condescension; and she never took him half so much as when she showed the high spirit that was in her, and defied him most.|$|E
60|$|The plump lady {{developed}} exceedingly <b>kittenish</b> manners {{late in the}} evening, {{and invited}} the whole company to share her tent. A singular type of woman, capable of most ladylike manners and having astonishingly sensible moments, but inexpressibly silly most of the time. She was really a powerful, self-confident, and shrewd woman, but preferred to seem young and helpless. Altogether the company was sufficiently curious. There was a young civil engineer from New York City, a land boomer from Skagway, an Irishman from Juneau, a representative of a New York paper, one or two nondescripts from the States, {{and one or two}} prospectors from Quebec. The night was cold and beautiful and my partner and I, by going sufficiently far away from the old Tennesseean and the plump lady, were able to sleep soundly until sunrise.|$|E
60|$|Now, Simla is {{a strange}} place and its customs are peculiar; nor is any man who has not spent at least ten seasons there {{qualified}} to pass judgment on circumstantial evidence, {{which is the most}} untrustworthy in the Courts. For these reasons, and for others which need not appear, I decline to state positively whether there was anything irretrievably wrong in the relations between the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid. If there was, and hereon you must form your own opinion, it was the Man's Wife's fault. She was <b>kittenish</b> in her manners, wearing generally an air of soft and fluffy innocence. But she was deadlily learned and evil-instructed; and, now and again, when the mask dropped, men saw this, shuddered and almost drew back. Men are occasionally particular, and the least particular men are always the most exacting.|$|E

About my behaviour as a bridegroom opinion appeared to be divided. [...] "He's a bit standoffish with her," [...] I overheard one lady remark to her husband; [...] "I like to see 'em a bit <b>kittenish</b> myself." [...] A young waitress, on the other hand, I am happy to say, showed more sense of natural reserve. [...] "Well, I respect him for it," [...] she was saying to the barmaid, as we passed through the hall; [...] "I'd just hate to be fuzzled over with everybody looking on." [...] Nobody took the trouble to drop their voices for our benefit. We might have been a pair of prize love birds on exhibition, the way we were openly discussed. By the majority we were clearly regarded as a sulky young couple who would not go through their tricks.|$|E
6000|$|It {{must not}} be {{inferred}} from this position of humility, that the youngest Miss Pecksniff was so young as to be, as one may say, forced to sit upon a stool, by reason of the shortness of her legs. Miss Pecksniff sat upon a stool because of her simplicity and innocence, which were very great, very great. Miss Pecksniff sat upon a stool because she was all girlishness, and playfulness, and wildness, and <b>kittenish</b> buoyancy. She was the most arch {{and at the same}} time the most artless creature, was the youngest Miss Pecksniff, that you can possibly imagine. It was her great charm. She was too fresh and guileless, and too full of child-like vivacity, was the youngest Miss Pecksniff, to wear combs in her hair, or to turn it up, or to frizzle it, or braid it. She wore it in a crop, a loosely flowing crop, which had so many rows of curls in it, that the top row was only one curl. Moderately buxom was her shape, and quite womanly too; but sometimes--yes, sometimes--she even wore a pinafore; and how charming THAT was! Oh! she was indeed 'a gushing thing' (as a young gentleman had observed in verse, in the Poet's Corner of a provincial newspaper), was the youngest Miss Pecksniff! ...|$|E
60|$|If it is a merit {{to treat}} a fatuous mother with {{deference}}, Bittridge had that merit. His deference was of the caressing and laughing sort, which took the spectator into the joke of her peculiarities as something they would appreciate and enjoy with him. She had been a <b>kittenish</b> and petted person in her youth, perhaps, and now she petted herself, after she had long {{ceased to be a}} kitten. What was respectable and what was pathetic in her was her wish to promote her son's fortunes with the Kentons, but she tried to do this from not a very clear understanding of her part, apparently, and little sense of the means. For Ellen's sake, rather than hers, the father and mother received her overtures to their liking kindly; they answered her patiently, and Mrs. Kenton even tried to lead the way for her to show herself at her best, by talking of her journey on to New York, and of the city, and what she would see there to interest her. Lottie and Boyne, sternly aloof together in one of their momentary alliances, listened to her replies with a silent contempt that almost included their mother; Kenton bore with the woman humbly and sadly.|$|E
60|$|This was the {{inundation}} of the tan-bark {{with troops}} of pretty Shetland ponies of all ages, sizes, and colors. A cry of delight went {{up from a}} group of little people near me, and the spell of the Horse Show was broken. It was no longer a solemnity of fashion, it was a sweet and kindly pleasure which every one could share, or every one who had ever had, or ever wished to have, a Shetland pony; the touch of nature made the whole show kin. I could not see that the freakish, <b>kittenish</b> creatures did anything to claim our admiration, but they won our affection by every trait of ponyish caprice and obstinacy. The small colts broke away from the small mares, and gambolled over the tanbark in wanton groups, with gay or plaintive whinnyings, which might well have touched a responsive chord in the bosom of fashion itself: I dare say it is not so hard as it looks. The scene remanded us to a moment of childhood; and I found myself so fond of all the ponies that I felt it invidious of the judges to choose among them for the prizes; they ought every one to have had the prize.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was not a}} merry party. Hardyman's {{approaching}} {{marriage had}} been made the topic of much malicious gossip, and Isabel's character had, as usual in such cases, become the object of all the false reports that scandal could invent. Lady Rotherfield's absence confirmed the general conviction that Hardyman was disgracing himself. The men were all more or less uneasy. The women resented the discovery that Isabel was--personally speaking, at least--beyond the reach of hostile criticism. Her beauty {{was viewed as a}} downright offense; her refined and modest manners were set down as perfect acting; [...] "really disgusting, my dear, in so young a girl." [...] General Drumblade, a large and mouldy veteran, in a state of chronic astonishment (after his own matrimonial experience) at Hardyman's folly in marrying at all, diffused a wide circle of gloom, wherever he went and whatever he did. His accomplished wife, forcing her high spirits on everybody's attention with a sort of <b>kittenish</b> playfulness, intensified the depressing effect of the general dullness by all the force of the strongest contrast. After waiting half an hour for his mother, and waiting in vain, Hardyman led the way to the tent in despair. [...] "The sooner I fill their stomachs and get rid of them," [...] he thought savagely, [...] "the better I shall be pleased!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But that is {{just what}} her figure and {{complexion}} did not do. Mr. Reginald Peters, finding his uncle old, feeble, and inclined to be fond, deemed it to his advantage to stay longer than he had intended. Twelve months went by. Miss Peggy was losing her <b>kittenish</b> grace, was becoming lumpy. A couple of pimples--one near the right-hand corner of her rosebud mouth, and another on the left-hand side of her tip-tilted nose--marred her baby face. At the end of another six months the men called her plump, and the women fat. Her walk was degenerating into a waddle; stairs caused her to grunt. She took to breathing with her mouth, and Bohemia noticed that her teeth were small, badly coloured, and uneven. The pimples grew in size and number. The cream and white of her complexion was merging into a general yellow. A certain greasiness of skin was manifesting itself. Babyish ways {{in connection with a}} woman who must have weighed about eleven stone struck Bohemia as incongruous. Her manners, judged alone, had improved. But they had not improved her. They did not belong to her; they did not fit her. They sat on her as Sunday broadcloth on a yokel. She had learned to employ her [...] "h's" [...] correctly, and to speak good grammar. This gave to her conversation a painfully artificial air. The little learning she had absorbed was sufficient to bestow upon her an angry consciousness of her own invincible ignorance.|$|E

[...] Lapham went on, as he scanned his newspaper, {{to give his}} ideas of public questions, in a fragmentary way, while Corey listened patiently, and {{waited for him to}} come back to business. He folded up his paper at last, and stuffed it into his coat pocket. [...] "There's one thing I always make it a rule to do," [...] he said, [...] "and that is to give my mind a complete rest from business while I'm going down on the boat. I like to get the fresh air all through me, soul and body. I believe a man can give his mind a rest, just the same as he can give his legs a rest, or his back. All he's got to do is to use his will-power. Why, I suppose, if I hadn't adopted some such rule, with the strain I've had on me for the last ten years, I should 'a' been a dead man long ago. That's the reason I like a horse. You've got to give your mind to the horse; you can't help it, unless you want to break your neck; but a boat's different, and there you got to use your will-power. You got to take your mind right up and put it where you want it. I make it a rule to read the paper on the boat----Hold on!" [...] he interrupted himself to prevent Corey from paying his fare to the man who had come round for it. [...] "I've got tickets. And when I get through the paper, I try to get somebody to talk to, or I watch the people. It's an astonishing thing to me where they all come from. I've been riding up and down on these boats for six or seven years, and I don't know but very few of the faces I see on board. Seems to be a perfectly fresh lot every time. Well, of course! Town's full of strangers in the summer season, anyway, and folks keep coming down from the country. They think it's a great thing {{to get down to the}} beach, and they've all heard of the electric light on the water, and they want to see it. But you take faces now! The astonishing thing to me is not what a face tells, but what it don't tell. When you think of what a man is, or a woman is, and what most of 'em have been through before they get to be thirty, it seems as if their experience would burn right through. But it don't. I like to watch the couples, and try to make out which are engaged, or going to be, and which are married, or better be. But half the time I can't make any sort of guess. Of course, where they're young and <b>kittenish,</b> you can tell; but where they're anyways on, you can't. Heigh?" ...|$|E
60|$|Bernard went home, {{but he was}} {{not able}} to reach the United States in time for Gordon's wedding, which took place at midsummer. Bernard, {{arriving}} late in the autumn, found his friend a married man of some months' standing, and was able to judge, according to his invitation, whether he appeared happy. The first effect of the letter I have just quoted had been an immense surprise; the second had been a series of reflections which were quite the negative of surprise; and these operations of Bernard's mind had finally merged themselves in a simple sentiment of jollity. He was delighted that Gordon should be married; he felt jovial about it; he was almost indifferent to the question of whom he had chosen. Certainly, at first, the choice of Blanche Evers seemed highly incongruous; it was difficult to imagine a young woman less shaped to minister to Gordon's strenuous needs than the light-hearted and empty-headed little flirt whose inconsequent prattle had remained for Bernard one of the least importunate memories of a charming time. Blanche Evers was a pretty little goose--the prettiest of little geese, perhaps, and doubtless the most amiable; but she was not a companion for a peculiarly serious man, who would like his wife to share his view of human responsibilities. What a singular selection--what a queer infatuation! Bernard had no sooner committed himself to this line of criticism than he stopped short, with the sudden consciousness of error carried almost to the point of naivetae. He exclaimed that Blanche Evers was exactly the sort of girl that men of Gordon Wright's stamp always ended by falling in love with, and that poor Gordon knew very much better what he was about in this case than he had done in trying to solve the deep problem of a comfortable life with Angela Vivian. This was what your strong, solid, sensible fellows always came to; they paid, in this particular, a larger tribute to pure fancy than the people who were supposed habitually to cultivate that muse. Blanche Evers was what the French call an article of fantasy, and Gordon had taken a pleasure in finding her deliciously useless. He cultivated utility in other ways, and it pleased and flattered him to feel that he could afford, morally speaking, to have a <b>kittenish</b> wife. He had within himself a fund of common sense to draw upon, so that to espouse a paragon of wisdom would be but to carry water to the fountain. He could easily make up for the deficiencies of a wife who was a little silly, and if she charmed and amused him, he could treat himself to the luxury of these sensations for themselves. He was not in the least afraid of being ruined by it, and if Blanche's birdlike chatter and turns of the head had made a fool of him, he knew it perfectly well, and simply took his stand upon his rights. Every man has a right to a little flower-bed, and life is not all mere kitchen-gardening. Bernard rapidly extemporized this rough explanation of the surprise his friend had offered him, and he found it all-sufficient for his immediate needs. He wrote Blanche a charming note, to which she replied with a great deal of spirit and grace. Her little letter was very prettily turned, and Bernard, reading it over two or three times, said to himself that, to do her justice, she might very well have polished her intellect a trifle during these two or three years. As she was older, she could hardly help being wiser. It even occurred to Bernard that she might have profited by the sort of experience that is known as the discipline of suffering. What had become of Captain Lovelock and that tender passion which was apparently none the less genuine for having been expressed in the slang of a humorous period? Had they been permanently separated by judicious guardians, and had she been obliged to obliterate his image from her lightly-beating little heart? Bernard had felt sure at Baden that, beneath her contemptuous airs and that impertinent consciousness of the difficulties of conquest by which a pretty American girl attests her allegiance to a civilization in which young women occupy the highest place--he had felt sure that Blanche had a high appreciation of her handsome Englishman, and that if Lovelock should continue to relish her charms, he might count upon the advantages of reciprocity. But it occurred to Bernard that Captain Lovelock had perhaps been faithless; that, at least, the discourtesy of chance and the inhumanity of an elder brother might have kept him an eternal prisoner at the Hotel de Hollande (where, for all Bernard knew to the contrary, he had been obliged to work out his destiny in the arduous character of a polyglot waiter); so that the poor young girl, casting backward glances along the path of Mrs. Vivian's retreat, and failing to detect the onward rush of a rescuing cavalier, had perforce believed herself forsaken, and had been obliged to summon philosophy to her aid. It was very possible that her philosophic studies had taught her the art of reflection; and that, as she would have said herself, she was tremendously toned down. Once, at Baden, when Gordon Wright happened to take upon himself to remark that little Miss Evers was bored by her English gallant, Bernard had ventured to observe, in petto, that Gordon knew nothing about it. But all this was of no consequence now, and Bernard steered further and further away from the liability to detect fallacies in his friend. Gordon had engaged himself to marry, and our critical hero had not a grain of fault to find with this resolution. It was a capital thing; it was just what he wanted; it would do him a world of good. Bernard rejoiced with him sincerely, and regretted extremely that a series of solemn engagements to pay visits in England should prevent his being present at the nuptials.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing {{happened}} to dissipate the good omens with which her partnership with Verena Tarrant was at present surrounded. They threw themselves into study; they had innumerable big {{books from the}} Athenæum, and consumed the midnight oil. Henry Burrage, after Verena had shaken her head at him so sweetly and sadly, returned to New York, giving no sign; they only heard {{that he had taken}} refuge under the ruffled maternal wing. (Olive, at least, took for granted the wing was ruffled; she could fancy how Mrs. Burrage would be affected by the knowledge that her son had been refused by the daughter of a mesmeric healer. She would be almost as angry as if she had learnt that he had been accepted.) Matthias Pardon had not yet taken his revenge in the newspapers; he was perhaps nursing his thunderbolts; at any rate, now that the operatic season had begun, he was much occupied in interviewing the principal singers, one of whom he described in one of the leading journals (Olive, at least, was sure it was only he who could write like that) as [...] "a dear little woman with baby dimples and <b>kittenish</b> movements." [...] The Tarrants were apparently given up to a measure of sensual ease with which they had not hitherto been familiar, thanks to the increase of income that they drew from their eccentric protectress. Mrs. Tarrant now enjoyed the ministrations of a [...] "girl"; it was partly her pride (at any rate, she chose to give it this turn) that her house had for many years been conducted without the element--so debasing on both sides--of servile, mercenary labour. She wrote to Olive (she was perpetually writing to her now, but Olive never answered) that she was conscious of having fallen to a lower plane, but she admitted that it was a prop to her wasted spirit to have some one to converse with when Selah was off. Verena, of course, perceived the difference, which was inadequately explained by the theory of a sudden increase of her father's practice (nothing of her father's had ever increased like that), and ended by guessing the cause of it--a discovery which did not in the least disturb her equanimity. She accepted the idea that her parents should receive a pecuniary tribute from the extraordinary friend whom she had encountered on the threshold of womanhood, just as she herself accepted that friend's irresistible hospitality. She had no worldly pride, no traditions of independence, no ideas of what was done and what was not done; but there was only one thing that equalled this perfectly gentle and natural insensibility to favours--namely, the inveteracy of her habit of not asking them. Olive had had an apprehension that she would flush a little at learning the terms on which they should now be able to pursue their career together; but Verena never changed colour; it was either not new or not disagreeable to her that the authors of her being should be bought off, silenced by money, treated as the troublesome of the lower orders are treated when they are not locked up; so that her friend had a perception, after this, that it would probably be impossible in any way ever to offend her. She was too rancourless, too detached from conventional standards, too free from private self-reference. It was too much to say of her that she forgave injuries, since she was not conscious of them; there was in forgiveness a certain arrogance of which she was incapable, and her bright mildness glided over the many traps that life sets for our consistency. Olive had always held that pride was necessary to character, but there was no peculiarity of Verena's that could make her spirit seem less pure. The added luxuries in the little house at Cambridge, which even with their help was still such a penal settlement, made her feel afresh that before she came to the rescue the daughter of that house had traversed a desert of sordid misery. She had cooked and washed and swept and stitched; she had worked harder than any of Miss Chancellor's servants. These things had left no trace upon her person or her mind; everything fresh and fair renewed itself in her with extraordinary facility, everything ugly and tiresome evaporated as soon as it touched her; but Olive deemed that, being what she was, she had a right to immense compensations. In the future she should have exceeding luxury and ease, and Miss Chancellor had no difficulty in persuading herself that persons doing the high intellectual and moral work to which the two young ladies in Charles Street were now committed owed it to themselves, owed it to the groaning sisterhood, to cultivate the best material conditions. She herself was nothing of a sybarite, and she had proved, visiting the alleys and slums of Boston {{in the service of the}} Associated Charities, that there was no foulness of disease or misery she feared to look in the face; but her house had always been thoroughly well regulated, she was passionately clean, and she was an excellent woman of business. Now, however, she elevated daintiness to a religion; her interior shone with superfluous friction, with punctuality, with winter roses. Among these soft influences Verena herself bloomed like the flower that attains such perfection in Boston. Olive had always rated high the native refinement of her country-women, their latent [...] "adaptability," [...] their talent for accommodating themselves at a glance to changed conditions; but the way her companion rose with the level of the civilisation that surrounded her, the way she assimilated all delicacies and absorbed all traditions, left this friendly theory halting behind. The winter days were still, indoors, in Charles Street, and the winter nights secure from interruption. Our two young women had plenty of duties, but Olive had never favoured the custom of running in and out. Much conference on social and reformatory topics went forward under her roof, and she received her colleagues--she belonged to twenty associations and committees--only at pre-appointed hours, which she expected them to observe rigidly. Verena's share in these proceedings was not active; she hovered over them, smiling, listening, dropping occasionally a fanciful though never an idle word, like some gently animated image placed there for good omen. It was understood that her part was before the scenes, not behind; that she was not a prompter, but (potentially, at least) a [...] "popular favourite," [...] and that the work over which Miss Chancellor presided so efficiently was a general preparation of the platform on which, later, her companion would execute the most striking steps.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, {{the critic}} Damon Knight stated that [...] "(h)er work is distinctively {{feminine}} in tone, but lacks the clichés, overemphasis and other <b>kittenish</b> tricks which often make female fiction unreadable by males".|$|E
50|$|The breed is {{sometimes}} referred to as the Greyhound of the cats, because of the sleek appearance and the galloping run characteristic of the breed. These cats tend to stay playful and <b>kittenish</b> throughout their long lives. Some Cornish Rexes like to play fetch, race other pets, or do acrobatic jumps. The Cornish Rex is an adventurous cat and is very intelligent. It can readily adapt to new situations and will explore wherever it can go. The Rex is extremely curious, seeks out the company of people and is friendly towards other companion animals.|$|E
5000|$|PMB got {{together}} {{a group of}} musicians and producers from different backgrounds who {{found a way to}} mix the Rolling Stones' music with the spirit of bossa nova and contemporary electronic. Following the example of the French Nouvelle Vague album released the previous year, [...] "Bossa n' Stones" [...] was placed in between the tradition of bossa nova and chill out. While the artistic value of this product is debatable, the combination of the <b>kittenish</b> vocals and bossa beats and easily recognizable melodies made these albums popular choice for background music services in large commercial centers, such as shopping malls and restaurants where they can often be heard.|$|E
5000|$|Bosley Crowther, {{film critic}} for The New York Times, was caustic about the casting and the {{adaption}} of Cain's novel, and wrote: [...] "Rhonda Fleming and a laughably <b>kittenish</b> Arlene Dahl, {{are a couple}} of on-the-make sisters, and the fellow, played by John Payne, is an on-the-make big-time gangster. In the end all their faces are red. So, we say, should be the faces of the people responsible for this film, which {{is said to have been}} taken from a novel (unrecognizable) of James M. Cain. For it is an exhausting lot of twaddle about crime and city politics, an honest mayor, his secretary-mistress, her kleptomaniacal sister and the fellow who wants to get control of the gang.|$|E
5000|$|She [...] "arrived at showbiz stardom with a {{featured}} role" [...] in {{the musical}} It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman (1966). She received her first Tony Award nomination in 1970, {{for her role in}} the Neil Simon play, Last of the Red Hot Lovers (1969). Clive Barnes, in his review for The New York Times, wrote: [...] "Linda Lavin, eyebrows, sic flaunting like telegraphed messages, mouth twitching and pouting, voice as dry as thunder and with a cough like electric static, is beautiful as Elaine, the sex cat feeling coolly <b>kittenish</b> and looking for a safe tin roof." [...] Lavin's last Broadway credit before she moved to Hollywood was in Paul Sills' Story Theatre in 1971.|$|E
5000|$|The {{random element}} of Crystal Castles {{also applies to}} Glass's vocal {{performances}} where, {{in the words of}} AllMusic journalist Heather Phares, it can be [...] "terrifying on one track and <b>kittenish</b> on another." [...] Ginger King of Consequence of Sound compared Glass to Karen O, Jemina Pearl, or Glass Candy singer Ida No but also wrote that [...] "the difference is Alice Glass somehow gives less of a fuck." [...] Limey described Glass's vocal performance as [...] "violent," [...] "sometimes morose," [...] and other times [...] "lilting like a Valley girl," [...] while Spin magazine's Mosi Reeves labeled it as [...] "sarcastic." [...] The vocals are heavily altered digitally, and Prefix noted them to have a [...] "fragility" [...] unusual in most electronic dance music.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for The Guardian in October 1992, Adam Sweeting {{thought that}} the album {{contained}} [...] "more than {{its fair share of}} garish artificial charm", surmising that although Boo's songs [...] "hang on a thread of absurdity", presenting critics with an easy target, [...] "her <b>kittenish</b> raps - usually about boys and boy-trouble - bristle with winningly daft rhymes". [...] Allmusic's William Ruhlmann noted that [...] "Boo raps through the verses and sings the choruses (...) in an engaging enough manner, but she never threatens {{to be more than a}} cartoon". Speaking to Q Magazine in 1994, Madonna made a surprising mention of this album by saying it was [...] "sadly overlooked" [...] and was keen to sign Betty Boo to her new record label, Maverick.|$|E

50|$|At the League of Nations, he is {{responsible}} for what is known as The Riddell Incident, where due to his headstrong nature and he tried, oblivious to the <b>kittenish</b> desires of Mackenzie King, to place sanctions on Italy which at that point was dominated by Mussolini. The sanctions came to be known in the international press as the Canadian proposal, whereupon the government blanched because they were unready to occupy the centre of the world diplomatic stage. He ultimately failed when the Mackenzie King government decided to repudiate the sanctions that he had proposed. The Minister of Justice, Ernest Lapointe, reported to Parliament on 2 December 1935 that:Later that month, the Hoare-Laval Pact kerfluffle killed the sanctions regime and left Mussolini to his Abyssinian devices. Churchill would later need to evict him during the East African campaign of World War II, in order to protect their Egyptian position.|$|E
