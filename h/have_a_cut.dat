In this example total RNA is isolated (total as it is nuclear and cytoplasmic) by Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (e.g. Trizol) which isolates most RNA (whereas column methods <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> off of 200 nucleotides) and if done correctly has a better purity.|$|E
25|$|On January 31, 2008, Branyan {{was arrested}} for {{allegedly}} assaulting his then wife, Jill. According to police accounts, officers were called to a {{parking lot of a}} police station after an officer found Jill Branyan sitting alone in her car, crying. The couple had gone to The Cowboy restaurant in Bainbridge, Ohio and reportedly argued on the way home. At some point, Russell Branyan, who was driving, allegedly put his hand on Jill's face, causing her to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> lip. The force of the grab caused her to develop a swollen lip and some bleeding. When the couple entered their home, Jill's mother saw the injury and said she, Jill, and the children should leave the home for the evening and go to her house.|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E

6000|$|The {{windows of}} the dining-room were opened to let in the fresh air, and afforded to the passers-by in the street a pleasant, or perhaps, tantalising view of six gentlemen in white {{waistcoats}} with a quantity of decanters {{and a variety of}} fruits before them--little boys, as they passed and jumped up at the area-railings and took a peep, said to one another, [...] "Hi hi, Jim, shouldn't you like to be there and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> of that there pineapple?"--the horses and carriages of the nobility and gentry passed by conveying them to Belgravian toilets: the policeman, with clamping feet patrolled up and down before the mansion: the shades of evening began to fall: the gasman came and lighted the lamps before Sir Francis's door: the butler entered the dining-room, and illuminated the antique gothic chandelier over the antique carved oak dining-table: so that from outside the house you looked inwards upon a night-scene of feasting and wax-candles; and from within you beheld a vision of a calm summer evening, and the wall of Saint James's Park, and the sky above, in which a star or two was just beginning to twinkle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you will}} see a {{difference}} to-morrow,' replied the witch, 'for one will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> on his sleeve. That is the youth you must kill.' And one hour before midnight, when witches are invisible, she glided into the room where all three lads were sleeping in the same bed. She took out a pair of scissors and cut a small piece out of the boy's coat-sleeve which was hanging on the wall, and then crept silently from the room. But in the morning the youth saw the slit, and he marked the sleeves of his two companions in the same way, and all three went down to breakfast with the Sultan. The old witch was standing in the window and pretended not to see them; but all witches have eyes in the backs of their heads, and she knew at once that not one sleeve but three were cut, and they were all as alike as before. After breakfast, the Sultan, who was getting tired of the whole affair and wanted to be alone to invent some other plan, told them they might return home. So, bowing low with one accord, they went.|$|E

And divers, whereof I was one, alighted, and stood with swords drawne, to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> at him, at his {{coming out of the}} water. The staggs there being wonderfully fierce and dangerous, made us youths more eager to be at him. But he escaped us all. And it was my misfortune to be {{hindered}} of my coming nere him, the way being sliperie, by a falle; which gave occasion to some, who did not know mee, to speak as if I had falne for feare. Which being told mee, I left the stagg, and followed the gentleman who [first] spake it. But I found him of that cold temper, that it seems his words made an escape from him; as by his denial and repentance it appeared. But this made mee more violent in the pursuit of the stagg, to recover my reputation. And I happened to be the only horseman in, when the dogs sett him up at bay; and approaching near him on horsebacke, he broke through the dogs, and run at mee, and tore my horse's side with his hornes, close by my thigh. Then I quitted my horse, and grew more cunning (for the dogs had sette him up againe), stealing behind him with my sword, and cut his hamstrings; and then got upon his back, and cut his throate; which, as I was doing, the company came in, and blamed my rashness for running such a hazard' (Peck's Desiderata Curiosa, ii. 464)." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{system is}} {{inconsistent}} if it admits a {{proof of the}} absurd. If the system has a cut elimination theorem, then {{if it has a}} proof of the absurd, or of the empty sequent, it should also have a proof of the absurd (or the empty sequent), without cuts. It is typically very easy to check that there are no such proofs. Thus, once a system is shown to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> elimination theorem, it is normally immediate that the system is consistent.|$|E

5000|$|This cut {{represents}} the irrational number √2 in Dedekind's construction. To establish this truly, one must {{show that this}} really is a cut {{and that it is}} the square root of two.

Then we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> and it has a square no larger than 2, but to show equality requires showing that if r is any rational number less than 2, then there is positive x in A with r < x2.|$|E
