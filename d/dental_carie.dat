Because efforts directed toward oral health promotion and disease prevention are fundamentally superior to dental rehabilitation secondary to disease development, early preventive dental visits (EPDVs) are widely advocated by professional and academic stakeholders. The aim of this comprehensive review was to critically review and summarize available evidence regarding the effectiveness of EPDVs in improving children&# 39;s oral health outcomes. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search of the PubMed and Embase electronic databases was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed publications investigating the effectiveness of EPDVs on oral health outcomes, including clinical, behavioral, and cost end points up to October 30, 2013. Outcomes of the identified studies were abstracted and summarized independently by two investigators. Results: Four manuscripts met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All studies were conducted in the US and employed a retrospective cohort study design using public insurance-claims data, whereas one study matched claims files with kindergarten state dental surveillance data. That study found no benefit of EPDVs in future clinically determined dental caries levels in kindergarten. The other three studies found mixed support for an association of EPDVs with subsequent more preventive and fewer nonpreventive visits and lower nonpreventive service-related expenditures. Selection bias and a problem-driven dental care-seeking pattern were frequently articulated themes in the reviewed studies. Conclusion: The currently available evidence base supporting the effectiveness of EPDVs and the year 1 first dental visit recommendation is weak, and more research is warranted. The benefits of EPDVs before the age of 3 years are evident among children at high risk or with existing dental disease. However, EPDVs may be associated with reduced restorative dental care visits and related expenditures during the first years of life.

40|$|The {{infection}} by Helicobacter pylori {{is one of}} {{the most}} common in humans and despite having tropism by stomach, can be found in the oral cavity, maintaining a commensal relationship with the host, while dental caries is also an infectious disease and results from the metabolism of the bacterial plaque. Both infections are highly prevalent in developing countries, since these populations are more exposed to environmental risk factors, and are usually acquired during childhood. The prevalence of these infections was investigated in the oral cavity of school children with no symptoms of gastric diseases, from a population of Belém-Pa, in relation to some parameters of oral hygiene and health, socioeconomic conditions and genetic susceptibility factors like the ABO and Lewis blood groups. Were investigated 104 patients, with average age of 17 years. Of all the participants were collected saliva samples and dental plaque. Saliva was collected to identify the ABO and Lewis state secretor and estimation of salivary parameters, and both, saliva and plaque samples were collected for molecular analysis of 16 S rRNA genes of H. pylori and FUT 2. H. pylori was detected in 79. 8 % of the students, with a frequency of 66. 35 % in dental plaque and 58. 65 % in saliva. The caries prevalence was 82. 8 % in the population studied. The clinical evaluation of oral health showed that the average CPO-D found was 3. 53. It was observed that the caries experience tends to increase as in addition to age and the H. pylori infection was higher in early childhood. The education level and number of dentist visits showed significant differences in relation to the presence of H. pylori. The phenotypic distribution of ABO and Lewis blood groups did not differ significantly between infected and uninfected individuals, explaining there is greater genetic susceptibility to infection by H. pylori and dental caries. Throughout this analysis, the high frequencies found prove the need for care and treatment of dental diseases, such as caries and it is suggested that H. pylori in the oral cavity can contribute to infection and re-infection of the stomach after treatment. CAPES - Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorA infecção pela Helicobacter pylori é uma das mais comuns em humanos e apesar de possuir tropismo pelo estômago, pode ser encontrada na cavidade oral, mantendo uma relação comensal com o hospedeiro, enquanto a <b>cárie</b> <b>dental</b> também é uma doença infecciosa e resulta do metabolismo da placa bacteriana. Ambas as infecções apresentam alta prevalência em países em desenvolvimento, pois estas populações estão mais expostas a fatores ambientais de risco, e normalmente são adquiridas durante a infância. A prevalência destas infecções foi investigada na cavidade oral de escolares assintomáticos para doenças gástricas, provenientes de uma população de Belém-Pa, relacionando-se a alguns parâmetros de higiene e saúde bucal, condição socioeconômica e fatores de susceptibilidade genética como os grupos sanguíneos ABO e Lewis. Foram investigados 104 indivíduos, com idade média de 17 anos. De todos os participantes foram coletadas amostras de saliva e placa dental. A saliva foi coletada para identificação do estado secretor ABO e Lewis e estimação dos parâmetros salivares, e ambas, saliva e placa dental, foram coletadas para analise molecular dos genes 16 S RNAr da H. pylori e FUT 2. A H. pylori foi detectada em 79, 8 % dos escolares, com freqüência de 66, 35 % na placa dental e 58, 65 % na saliva. A prevalência de cárie foi de 82, 8 % na população estudada. A avaliação clínica da saúde bucal mostrou que o CPO-D médio encontrado foi de 3, 53. Observou-se que a experiência de cárie tende a aumentar à medida que acresce a idade e que a infecção por H. pylori foi maior na primeira infância. O grau de instrução e o número de visitas ao dentista mostraram diferenças significantes em relação a presença de H. pylori.

The {{objective of this}} study is to evaluate the influence of Alg 53 on the production of glucan from sucrose by glucosyltransferase and acid from glucose by Streptococcus sobrinus 6715. Glucosyltransferase was prepared from cultural medium of S. sobrinus using ultrafiltration and hydroxyapatite chromatography. In order to examine the inhibitory effect of Alg 53 for production of glucan by GTase, partially purified GTase, sucrose and Alg 53 solution were incubated at 37 °C. The influence of Alg 53 on the production of acid from glucose was evaluated by a degree of pH decline during the incubation for 60 min. The original Alg 53 solution markedly inhibited to 21 % of the synthesis of water-insoluble glucan from sucrose and that of 10 -fold diluted of Alg 53 solution was 23 %. However, the production of water-soluble glucan from sucrose by GTase was hardly affected by Alg 53. Furthermore, Alg 53 suppressed dose-dependently pH decline by organic acid converted from glucose. These results suggest that Alg 53 is expected as a functional food material which prevents or reduces dental caries.

Objetivou-se {{investigar}} as recomendações sobre o consumo de açúcares e identificar qual orientação deveria ser dada ao público e autoridades competentes sobre os níveis ideais de açúcares na dieta compatíveis com uma boa saúde. As informações foram obtidas de 116 publicações elaboradas por comitês de especialistas de 37 diferentes países e regiões do mundo, incluindo principalmente países desenvolvidos, mas também aqueles em desenvolvimento. Os resultados permitiram concluir que a grande maioria (84, 5 % das publicações analisadas) fazem recomendações sobre o consumo de açúcares extrínsecos ou livres, havendo consenso de que estes açúcares, principalmente a sacarose, devem ser reduzidos da dieta. A recomendação mais freqüente é 10 % de calorias a partir dos açúcares extrínsecos como um nível máximo. Tais recomendações são geralmente dirigidas à toda a população com a finalidade de manter a saúde geral, mas sobretudo prevenir a <b>cárie</b> <b>dental</b> e a obesidade. Concluiu-se que as recomendações sobre o consumo de açúcares contidas nas publicações editadas nas últimas três décadas são coerentes com a evidência científica da relação entre os açúcares e as doenças crônicas e, portanto, deveriam ser integradas às políticas de alimentação e saúde.

The aim is to identify what the reports recommend about the consumption of sugars and their relation to chronic diseases, and also what advice should be given to the public and appropriate authorities regarding levels of sugars in the diet. Information was gathered from 115 reports published by experts committees in 36 different countries and regions of the world, including developed and developing countries. The results showed that the great majority (84, 5 %) of the reports analysed make recommendations on the extrinsic consumption of sugar and that there is an agreement that these sugars, especially sucrose, must be reduced in the diet. The commonest level proposed is that 10 % of total calory intake from extrinsic sugars should be considered the maximun level. Such advice is often addressed to the general population and it is offered with a view to the maintenance of general health and especially to the prevention dental caries and obesity.

This condition in relation to individual seems feasible leading to a rational use of fluoride. Nevertheless, dealing with population and particularly non-EME countries (non-Established Market Economies or developing), the most suitable method of fluoride use will depend on each nation. On the other hand, each country should have a public health program to control dental caries as part of its health system. The choice between fluoridated dentifrice or fluoridated drinking water and the option for salt will depend on its applicability in each country. At the same time, it is important that either the appropriate exposure to a community method of fluoride use as well as the association with other methods and preventive measures in relation to risks-benefits are evaluated for each country. The determination of an appropriate exposure to fluoride in non-EME countries in the future will depend on critical analysis of how it has been used at present. Available data have shown that some non-EME countries have even been able to revert the dramatic situation of dental caries in their population, but in others caries experience continues a public health problem. Nevertheless, in other countries the increase in caries prevalence, which was expected, has not occurred but endemic fluorosis has been a concern. The challenges for non-EME countries are huge and identical solutions cannot be used for distinct problems. Uma exposição apropriada ao fluoreto é aquela capaz de interferir com o desenvolvimento de <b>cárie</b> <b>dental</b> (benefício) sem grandes preocupações com fluorose dental (riscos). Esta condição em termos de indivíduo parece factível levando ao uso racional do fluoreto. Entrentanto, em se tratando de população e particularmente países non-EME, o método mais adequado de usar fluoreto vai depender de cada nação. Por outro lado, é imprescindível que haja uma política nacional de um método coletivo para controlar cárie como integrante do sistema de saúde de cada país. A escolha entre dentifrício fluoretado ou água fluoretada e a opção por sal vai depender da sua aplicabilidade a cada país. Ao mesmo tempo, é importante que para cada país seja avaliada não só a exposição apropriada do método coletivo de usar fluoreto, assim como a associação com outros métodos e meios em termos de riscos-benefícios. A determinação da exposição apropriada a fluoreto nos países non-EME no futuro dependerá da análise crítica de como ele tem sido usado no presente. Dados disponíveis têm mostrado que alguns países non-EME têm inclusive conseguido reverter a situação dramática de cárie de sua população, mas em outros a experiência de cárie continua dramática. Entretanto, em outros países não tem ocorrido um aumento da prevalência de cárie que se esperaria, mas fluorose endêmica é uma preocupação.

40|$|Analysis {{of surface}} and tooth-specific data from NHANES I and HHANES {{shows that the}} pattern of dental caries differs greatly from tooth to tooth and surface to surface. Occlusal caries precedes all other types, and {{increases}} most rapidly and to the highest levels in the molars. Caries on the proximal surfaces comes later. For sealants to be of value, they must {{reduce the need for}} restorations. Therefore, the value of seal-ants will be determined by the balance between high enough levels of potential caries on occlusal surfaces to give them something to prevent, and low levels of, or sufficiently delayed, proximal le-sions to prevent the loss of the otherwise saved occlusal surface. The data presented demonstrate that as of the time of NHANES I, the number of permanent mo-lars that could have had surfaces saved from resto-ration, at least for a number of years, appears to be sufficient to warrant widespread use of sealants on those teeth. More recent data (HHANES) suggest that the current decline in caries prevalence is like-ly to reduce the value of sealants in the short run because there are fewer occlusal lesions in young children, but may increase the value of sealants in the long run because proximal caries in older chil-dren and adults is also declining.

' The apparent "cariogenicity " of norethandrolone under the conditions of that experiment was oppo-site to the effect anticipated, based on in-formation known about the metabolic activ-ity of the drug. 2 -' Since norethandrolone is known to pro-mote the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and collagenous tissue,' 0 which are im-portant in the induction of nucleation in the calcification process, " {{it was expected that}} the administration of norethandrolone to rats on a caries-test diet would either have no effect on caries incidence or would tend to decrease the caries incidence. Two possible explanations were offered to account for the unexpected increase in den-tal caries in norethandrolone-treated ani-mals. These explanations were (1) the slight androgenic effect resulting from the dosage of norethandrolone used may have influ-enced the caries incidence or (2) the nor-ethandrolone may have had a beneficial influence on the cariogenic microbiota in the oral environment of the rat. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the latter possibility-that norethandrolone has a beneficial influence on the oral flora of the rat.

40|$|Antrodia camphorata (A. camphorata) is a unique, endemic and {{extremely}} rare mushroom species native to Taiwan, and both crude extracts of and purified chemical compounds from A. camphorata {{have been reported}} to have a variety of significant beneficial effects, such as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity. However, reports on the effects of A. camphorata against dental pathogens have been limited. Oral health is now recognized as important for overall general health, including conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) are the most common bacteria associated with dental plaque and periodontopathic diseases, respectively. Thus, our study examined the ability of five various crude extracts of A. camphorata to inhibit the growth of dental bacteria and anti-adherence in vitro. Among the extracts, the ethanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts exhibited the lowest MICs against P. gingivalis and S. mutans (MIC = 4, 16 mg/mL). The MIC of the aqueous extract was greater than 2048 mg/mL against both P. gingivalis and S. mutans. In vitro adherence of S. mutans was significantly inhibited by the addition of either the ethyl acetate extract or chloroform extract (MIC = 16, 24 mg/mL), while the ethanol extract (MIC = 32, 64 mg/mL) exhibited moderate inhibitory activity. Based on the result of this study, the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of A. camphorata may be good candidates for oral hygiene agents to control <b>dental</b> <b>carie...</b>|$|E

Randomizou-se duzentos recém-nascidos para o grupo intervenção e trezentos para o grupo controle. O grupo intervenção recebeu orientações dietéticas no primeiro ano de vida. Os dois grupos receberam visitas aos 6 e 12 meses e acompanhamento de rotina pelos seus pediatras. Os resultados (n = 397) mostraram que a intervenção associou-se a maior proporção de aleitamento materno exclusivo aos 4 meses (RR = 1, 58; IC 95 %: 1, 21 - 2, 06) e 6 meses (RR = 2, 34; IC 95 %: 1, 37 - 3, 99) e amamentadas aos 12 meses (RR = 1, 26; IC 95 %: 1, 02 - 1, 55) e a menor proporção de crianças que apresentaram diarréia (RR = 0, 68; IC 95 %: 0, 51 - 0, 90), problemas respiratórios (RR = 0, 63; IC 95 %: 0, 46 - 0, 85), uso de medicamentos (RR = 0, 56; IC 95 %: 0, 34 - 0, 91) e <b>cárie</b> <b>dental</b> (RR = 0, 56; IC 95 %: 0, 32 - 0, 96) na faixa etária de 12 a 16 meses. Não houve efeito da intervenção sobre a ocorrência de anemia, internações hospitalares e estado nutricional. Os resultados sugerem que o programa de orientações dietéticas promoveu modificações positivas nas práticas alimentares e nas condições de saúde da criança, porém foi insuficiente para prevenir a anemia ferropriva.

Two hundred newborns were randomized to the intervention group and three hundred to the control group. Parents of the intervention group received nutritional orientation during the child's first year of life. Both groups received visits at 6 and 12 months and routine follow-up by their pediatricians. The results (n = 397) showed that the intervention {{was associated with a}} higher proportion of exclusive breastfeeding at 4 months (RR = 1. 58; 95 %CI: 1. 21 - 2. 06) and 6 months (RR = 2. 34; 95 %CI: 1. 37 - 3. 99) and breastfeeding at 12 months (RR = 1. 26; 95 %CI: 1. 02 - 1. 55) and a lower proportion of children with diarrhea (RR = 0. 68; 95 %CI: 0. 51 - 0. 90), respiratory problems (RR = 0. 63; 95 %CI: 0. 46 - 0. 85), use of medication (RR = 0. 56; 95 %CI: 0. 34 - 0. 91), and dental caries (RR = 0. 56; 95 %CI: 0. 32 - 0. 96) in the 12 - 16 month bracket.

Os dados obtidos foram analisados através dos testes X 2 e Mann-Whitney U. A média do ceo-s foi 3, 4 com 40 % das crianças livres de cáries, sendo que 36 e 24 % tinham um ceo-d maior que 0 e 4, respectivamente. Notou-se que 72 % das crianças eram alimentadas ao seio, 17 % apenas com mamadeira e 10 % pelos dois meios. Das crianças alimentadas apenas com mamadeira 70 % apresentaram cárie. A cárie de mamadeira foi observada em 20 % das crianças, sendo que 77 % destas tinham sido alimentadas por mais de 12 meses. As crianças, cujos pais eram profissionais com terceiro grau de escolaridade, tiveram significativamente menos cárie do que aquelas de pais com nível técnico ou pais operários. A prevalência de cárie na faixa etária estudada foi relativamente alta. As crianças com cárie de mamadeira tenderam a manter seus hábitos de aleitamento por mais de 12 meses, sendo que o uso de mamadeira açucarada estava presente em 100 % dos casos. This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the prevalence of caries in pre-school children and inquire into infant feeding history and associated factors. One hundred fifty six children of ages from 18 to 48 months were clinically examined for dental caries (dmf-t and dmf-s) by one investigator, who {{was unaware of the}} mother’s responses to the questionnaire administered by an interviewer. The results were analyzed using non-parametric tests, chi-squared and Man Whitney U. Overall mean dmf-s per children was 3, 4 with 40 % of the subjects being caries free. It was observed that of those with caries, 36 e 24 % had a dmf-t higher than 0 and 4 respectively. The percentage of caries free and not caries free subjects were 42 and 57 % for those only breast, 38 and 62 % for breast and bottle and 30 and 70 % for only bottle fed children. Nursing caries were seen in 20 % of the subjects. Bottle fed children {{were more likely to have}} nursing caries than those only breast fed. Of those with nursing caries, 77 % had been fed for more than 12 months. The mean dmf-t for children in social classes I, II and III were 1. 6, 3. 6 and 3. 1 with 50 %, 25 % and 29 % caries free, respectively. Similarly, children whose mothers had a post-graduation or a college degree had a mean dmf-t significantly lower than those whose mothers finished middle school (p < 0, 05). It was concluded that the prevalence of caries in early childhood is relatively high in Piracicaba.

40|$|Resumo: Streptococcus mutans (SM) são os principais patógenos da <b>cárie</b> <b>dental.</b> Neste estudo exploramos a influência do sistema imune de mucosa na infecção inicial pelo SM em crianças altamente expostas a este microrganismo. Cento e dezenove crianças, com idade inicial entre 5 a 13 meses de idade foram analisadas no início do estudo (T 0) e após 6 (T 6), 12 (T 12) e 18 (T 18) meses, amostras bucais foram coletadas para determinação dos níveis de infecção por SM, através do cultivo em mitis salivarius ágar com bacitracina. Os níveis de IgA, IgA 1 e IgM foram também determinados em amostras de saliva, através de ensaios de ELISA. Um subgrupo de 21 crianças infectadas por SM (entre T 0 e T 6) foram pareadas a outras 21 crianças da amostra sem níveis detectáveis de SM. As reações entre anticorpos IgA da saliva com antígenos (Ags) de SM foram comparadas entre estes subgrupos, através de ensaios de western blot. A intensidade das bandas reativas foi determinada através da densitometria e expressas como unidades arbitrárias (ua). A reatividade de IgA salivar com peptídeos derivados da seqüência da GbpB, preditos como regiões ligantes à MHC de classe II, foram também avaliados através de {{multiplex}} com o Luminex. Os níveis salivares de IgA aumentaram com a idade (de 82, 4 a 823, 4 µg/ml), enquanto que os níveis de IgM mantiveram-se baixos durante todo o estudo (média: 4, 2 - 2, 8 µg/ml). Os níveis de infecção por SM foram maiores em T 6 (média: 45 ufc/área) e uma forte resposta de IgA aos Ags de SM pôde ser detectada logo aos 6 meses de idade. A resposta de IgA anti-GbpB foi observada em 38 % das 21 crianças infectadas por SM, enquanto que 73 % dos pares não infectados apresentavam estes anticorpos (Qui-quadrado, p< 0. 03). Um pico de resposta de IgA a GbpB ocorreu durante a fase de maior desafio de infecção (T 6). Não houve diferenças significativas nos padrões de reatividade de IgA aos diversos peptídeos de GbpB testados, entre os grupos de crianças infectadas e não infectadas por SM. Os resultados indicam que uma resposta complexa de IgA a SM pode ocorrer a partir dos 6 meses e que a especificidade de resposta a Ags envolvidos na virulência podem influenciar na susceptibilidade à infecção por SM. Nenhum dos peptídeos da GbpB correspondeu às intensidades de resposta à GbpB nativa observadas entre os pares de crianças estudadosAbstract: Mutans streptococci (MS) are {{the main}} pathogens of dental caries. In this study we explored {{the influence of the}} muccosal immune system in the initial colonization by MS in children highly exposed to this microorganism. A total of 119 children, who were of 5 to 13 months of age, were enrolled in this prospective study. MS levels of infection were determined in cultures on mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin at baseline (T 0), 6 (T 6), 12 (T 12) and 18 months (T 18) -of follow-up. Saliva samples were also collected at all phases of the study for determination of the levels of antibodies IgA, IgA 1 and IgM in ELISA assays. A subset of 21 MS-infected early between T 0 and T 6 were matched to other 21 children, but who were not MS-infected. Patterns of IgA antibody reactivity to MS Ags were compared between these 21 pairs through assays of western blot. Intensities of IgAreactive bands were determined densitometrically and were expressed as arbitrary unit (au). Reactivities of salivary IgA antibodies to peptides derived from the GbpB sequence, which were predicted as having affinity to MHC of class II molecules were evaluated in multiplex {{with the help of the}} Luminex technology. Levels of antibody IgA in saliva increased with age (82. 4 - 823. 35 µg/ml), while levels of IgM remained at low levels (mean: 4. 2 - 2. 78 µg/ml). The highest levels of MS infection in the infected group were observed at T 6 (mean: 45 cfu/plate). Robust responses to SM antigens were detected in children as early as 6 months of age. Only 38 % of early-infected children carried IgA-reative GbpB while this antigen was recognized by the majority (73 %) of children that were not infected by these microorganisms (chi-square, p< 0. 03). A peak of IgA response to GbpB occurred during the phase of highest SM infectious challenge (by T 6). All the GbpB-derived peptides have shown reactivity with salivary IgA, independently of the status of MS infection. The results indicated that complex salivary IgA responses to MS Ags can occur by 6 months of age and that the patterns of salivary IgA specificities might influence in the susceptibility of initial infections to MS. Neither of the peptides tested corresponded to differences in response to the native protein observed between the pairs of children studie...|$|R

One hundred patients were analyzed. They were distributed into two groups: Group I (test) – 50 patients evidently HIV+, from whom information was collected and analyzed regarding age, gender, skin color, habits, general and oral diseases, levels of T-CD 4 lymphocytes, viral load and {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART); and Group II – (control) 50 HIV- patients, from whom information was collected and analyzed regarding age, gender, skin color, habits, general and oral diseases. In both groups, measurement of salivary flow, pH and buffer capacity was made. Group I presented high MDF, bacteria plaque and bleeding, with a greater susceptibility to the risks of oral cavities and periodontal disease. The salivary flow and the buffering capacity of the saliva were low, indicating a high level of xerostomy. Two important modifying factors influence these pathologies in an incisive way: one is immunossuppression and the other is HAART therapy.

40|$|The aim of this study was to {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} gingivitis, periodontitis and dental caries in individuals with type 2 – diabetes. The study was conducted in a form of a general literature review with the restricted to the following conditions: human studies, English, and articles published between 2007  - 2012.  Articles lacking a control group were excluded. The data were collected through searches of the medical database PubMed. A compilation of  11  scientific articles was examined. In individuals with diabetes mellitus type 2, the presence of gingivitis was identified in 3 articles, periodontitis in 10, and dental caries in 3 articles. The 3 articles that showed presence of gingivitis demonstrated that individuals with type 2 – diabetes had a higher prevalence of gingivitis compared to non-diabetic individuals.  A higher prevalence of periodontitis in individuals with type 2 – diabetes mellitus was found in 10 / 10 publications. Theses studies demonstrated in individuals with type 2 – a significantly higher incidence of deep pocket depths, attachment loss, recession defects and with higher plaque and gingival index scores. The three articles that showed the presence of dental caries also demonstrated a higher prevalence of dental caries in individuals with type 2 – diabetes mellitus.   The articles included in the literature study showed statistically significant higher prevalence of gingivitis, periodontitis, and dental caries in individuals with type 2 – diabetes mellitus than in individuals without a diagnosis of diabetes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Pediatricians are health {{professionals}} who treat the child {{during the first}} years of their life. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the conduct adopted by pediatricians regarding the oral health of children. METHOD: This was a descriptive cross-sectional observational study with a sample of 100 physicians specialized in pediatrics, working in the public and private sectors. A questionnaire was used for data collection, and the pediatricians were approached in their workplaces. RESULT: Most pediatricians (69 %) belong to the female gender, with an average age of 48 years, and work in both the public and private sectors of health and have over 20 years of professional experience. Regarding their level of knowledge on oral health, 59 % consider it to be good and 59 % said that they had not been approached about this issue during their training in pediatrics. Ninety-two percent routinely examine the oral cavity of the baby; 64 % recommend the use of fluoridated toothpaste, and 66. 7 % direct patients to a dental appointment in the first year of life. Regarding breastfeeding at night, 55. 6 % do not make the association between breastfeeding and the onset of early childhood caries. Furthermore, 74. 7 % do not justify the associations between the eruption of the first primary teeth and systemic manifestations, and 93 % contraindicate the use of a dummy.

40|$|Introduction: Bacterial {{adhesion}} on restorative materials {{may lead}} to gingival inflammation and secondary caries. Objectives: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the adhesion of streptococcus mutans to zirconia, Feldespatic porcelain, titanium alloy and Indirect composite resin In-vitro. The effect of surface roughness on bacterial adhesion was also studied. Materials and Methods: 10 specimens (5 mm diameter, 1 mm thickness) of each material, Zirconia, Indirect composite resin, Titanium alloy and Feldespatic porcelain were fabricated. Enamel was used as reference. Specimens were covered with artificial saliva and bacterial suspension (109 CFU/mL). Bacterial adhesion was determined using scanning electron microscope and culturing the specimens in blood agar. Data were analyzed with One way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test for roughness and Kruskal-wallis test for adhesion values. Results: The highest bacterial adhesion was recorded for composite specimens and the lowest was seen in Ziconia group (p< 0. 5). The mean value of adhesion for zirconia, feldespatic peocelain, Titanium alloy and indirect composite were 28 ± 6. 32, 40. 80 ± 8. 40, 75 ± 4. 47 and 386 ± 13. 75, respectively. The differences between zirconia and titanium alloy and also zirconia and indirect composite and porcelain and indirect composite were statistically significant (p< 0. 5). Conclusion: Zirconia showed the lowest bacterial adhesion in comparison to other tested materials and Enamel. The difference between zirconia and titanium alloy and also zirconia and indirect composite was statistically significant (p< 0. 5).

40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>dental</b> <b>carie</b> studies {{over the course}} of historical period underline mainly the prevalence evolution, the role of carbohydrates consumption and the impact of access to dietary resources. The purpose of the present investigation was to compare population samples from two archaeological periods the Chacolithic and Middle Age taking into account the geographical and socio economical situation. The study concerned four archaelogical sites in south west France and population samples an inlander for the Chalcolithic Age, an inlander, an costal and urban for the Middle Age. The materials studied included a total of 127 maxillaries, 103 mandibles and 3316 teeth. Data recorded allowed us to display that the Chalcolithic population sample had the lowest carie percentage and the rural inlander population samples of Middle Age the highest; in all cases molars were teeth most often affected. These ones differences could be explained according to time period, carious lesions were usually less recorded in the Chalcolithic Age than the Middle because of a lesser cultivation of cereals like in les Treilles Chacolithic population sample. In the Middle Age population samples, the rural inland sample Marsan showed the highest frequency of caries and ate more cereal than the coastal Vilarnau and the poor urban St Michel population samples, the first one ate fish and Mediterranean vegetal and fruits and the second one met difficulties to food access, in both cases the consumption of carbohydrates was lesser than Marsan population sample who lived in a geographical land convice to cereals cultivation...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{national}} agreement between dental surgeons and the healthcare funds introduced an oral-dental prevention measure in all 15 to 18 year-old adolescents. The medical evaluation of this measure {{was designed to}} analyse the oral-dental needs inventoried during the preventive examination and the care these patients received following the examination. Method: We performed a longitudinal descriptive study covering three years based on {{a random sample of}} adolescents who had just turned 15 during the first semester of 1999 and who received a preventive examination. Results: In this article, we give the results concerning the oral-dental health status of this cohort of 15 year-old adolescents and describe the care they received following the preventive examination after the first year of follow-up. The general health fund’s patient sample contained 18, 492 adolescents. 61 % of them had not consulted a dental surgeon for more than one year. Each adolescent had an average of 4. 08 teeth which either had caries, were absent or had an amalgam filling; of these, 1. 95 teeth had caries and 1. 68 had an amalgam filling. 45. 9 % of the patients studied received dental care following the preventive examination. 75 % of the care they received concerned permanent molars and 72 % consisted in surface amalgam fillings.

The baseline data of seven states were available for analysis. Representative probability samples were conducted statewide in both surveys. The World Health Organization (WHO) method was used to obtain the dental caries index (dmft, DMFT). At present, additional and more recent epidemiological data representative statewide in Mexico are unavailable. Results: The participants were 9798 schoolchildren in the 1988 ? 1989 survey and 16882 schoolchildren in the 1998 ? 2001 survey. The prevalence of caries in children ages 6 to 10 years was 86, 6 % in the first survey and 65, 5 % in the second survey, showing a 24, 4 % reduction. The primary teeth index in the first survey was dmft = 3, 86 (IC 95 % 3, 68 4, 04) and in permanent teeth, it was DMFT = 1, 03 (IC 95 % 0, 95 1, 11).
