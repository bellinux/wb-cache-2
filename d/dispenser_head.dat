5000|$|In Season 1 on the Comedy Channel, he {{was given}} a red color, longer black tube arms, squared white shoulders, a {{different}} hoverskirt, and the Carousel Snack Dispenser gumball machine head with a white beak. Around episode 105: The Corpse Vanishes, Servo's head was replaced with a slightly modified version of his [...] "Carousel" [...] head. The [...] "neck" [...] was slightly wider and the beak (now silver at this point) appeared smaller. This version of Servo's head would be used for the remainder of Season 1. For Season 2, the black tubing used for his arms was replaced by a pair of small silver springs and the more familiar Carousel <b>Dispenser</b> <b>head</b> design (KTMA/pre episode 105) returned with a silver beak. This physical form was pretty much the same throughout the remainder of the series, save for a brief flirtation (during episodes #205: Rocket Attack USA and #206: Ring of Terror) with a slim cylindrical gumball-machine head to try to reduce the screen area Servo's head obscured. It was introduced as a [...] "haircut" [...] that Joel gave Servo, but was quickly abandoned. By mid season 3 an extra cap from another Carousel Dispenser was added just below the [...] "bubble" [...] making Tom's head appear slightly taller and slimmer. Briefly in early season 4, Servo's white hands were changed to beige before returning to white after only a few episodes. During a host segment in the Sci-Fi era, he briefly acquired the body of a [...] "beautiful butterfly."Servo's voice and personality also changed during the show's early years. While Josh Weinstein operated Servo during the KTMA season, Servo originally spoke with a sleasy, Bullwinkle-type voice in episode K02 (the earliest seen of the regular Servo puppet), then a rather slow squeaky voice from K03-K05, and was somewhat immobile during host segments but oddly very active in the theater. In episode K06, Weinstein switched to a lower voice that Servo repeatedly proclaimed as his new [...] "MIGHTY VOICE!" [...] When Weinstein left at the end of Season 1, Kevin Murphy took over Servo's operation and tried to match Weinstein's Servo voice and personality, but gradually developed a somewhat new Servo sound and character (though Murphy has a fairly deep voice himself). This was explained as tinkering by Joel. During Murphy's tenure, Servo took many opportunities to showcase his excellent singing. He also has an extensive underwear collection (as seen in Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie), as well as a large number of duplicates of himself that he made in episode #420: The Human Duplicators (also seen in episode #612: The Starfighters, episode #910: The Touch of Satan, episode #913: Quest of the Delta Knights, episode #1003: Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders, episode #1004: Future War, and episode #1013: Diabolik). Female Servo duplicates were featured in The Touch of Satan and Quest of the Delta Knights.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{demonstrates}} {{the interest in}} using temperature compensation to stabilize drop-on-demand inkjet printing process. The influence of inkjet printing parameters on the droplet velocity and ejection stability is particularly discussed. Based on experimental results a relation between the printing parameters and kinetic property of drops is drawn. Adjusting the amplitude pulse applied to the <b>dispenser</b> <b>head,</b> the drop velocity is stable over a 15 °C variation, where as it increases by 5 m/s without compensation and the print quality is so optimized...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{microfluidic}} {{control method}} {{that uses a}} piezoelectric <b>dispenser</b> <b>head</b> is developed to fabricate microdots. A glycerol mixture {{was used as the}} test fluid to simulate conductive metallic solutions. The orifice diameter of the dispenser was 50 μm. Investigations were conducted at room temperature (25 °C). For each bipolar waveform, fluid was extruded {{in the form of a}} stretching liquid column, which eventually retracted into the dispenser orifice. Microdots were obtained by governing the liquid transfer process between the dispenser orifice and the target surface, where the gap was smaller than the maximum extrusion length during liquid column formation. Three fluid behaviors were observed using high-speed imaging, namely extrusion, impact on the target surface, and pinch-off of liquid ligament. For gaps of below 70 μm, some of the fluid sticking on the target surface resulted in a microdot diameter of 26 μm (about half of the orifice diameter) ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, three {{historical}} figures were created: Betsy Ross, Daniel Boone, and Paul Revere, which were released {{as part of}} the [...] series. These <b>dispenser</b> <b>heads</b> were not made to actually look like the people they represented, but instead used generic faces with different accessories.|$|R
5000|$|Early Pez {{dispensers}} did {{not have}} heads on them. They were what is known now as [...] "regulars". A regular dispenser is just a rectangular box with a contoured flip top for dispensing the candy. Toy character <b>head</b> <b>dispensers</b> were introduced in 1955, after the candy {{was introduced in the}} United States. There are over 550 unique <b>dispenser</b> <b>heads</b> with thousands of variations. The company formerly had a general rule against creating likenesses of real people.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Suggs's girlfriend Candace Williams filed a {{complaint}} against Suggs alleging he threw a soap <b>dispenser</b> at her <b>head,</b> struck her in the chest with his hand and held a bottle of bleach over her and their 1-year-old son. No criminal charges were filed against Suggs, and Williams' subsequent lawsuit was dismissed.|$|R
50|$|Baumann {{was born}} in Bodenseich near Lüneburg in Germany. He came to Norway and Kristiania in his youth, and was hired as <b>head</b> <b>dispenser</b> at a pharmacy. Baumann {{eventually}} became acquainted with Bernt Anker, who recommended the study of mining. Baumann carried through the studies, and became a mine superindendent for Southeastern Norway. In 1816, when the Kongsberg Silver Mines were reopened, Baumann was elected {{as a member of}} the board of directors.|$|R
30|$|The so-prepared ink {{was printed}} {{by means of}} a {{piezoelectric}} Jetlab® 4 printer from MicroFab Technologies Inc. (Plano, TX, USA) equipped with a 60 -μm nozzle diameter MJ-AT- 01 <b>dispenser.</b> The print <b>head</b> was heated at 60 °C, and the substrate was kept at room temperature during the deposition process {{to improve the quality of}} the deposit. The waveform used to expel a single droplet was a 35 V pulse lasting 18 μs, followed by a − 13 V pulse lasting 36 μs as echo dwell with the rise, fall, and final rise time of 25, 5, and 2 μs, respectively. The step size was set to 100 μm, and 6 layers were printed on top of each other.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1878, Hutchison {{was arrested}} and sent to Honolulu's Kalihi Hospital for examination. On January 5, 1879, {{he was sent to}} the leper {{settlement}} of Kalaupapa on the island of Molokaʻi. He worked as chief butcher and beef <b>dispenser</b> and <b>head</b> storekeeper of the Kalawao store until 1884 when he was appointed as resident superintendent succeeding Clayton Strawn and Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer. Hutchison became the first government appointed superintendent of Native Hawaiian descent. Although Hawaiians had held the positions as luna or resident superintendent prior to 1884, they were all subordinate to Meyer and not trusted with financial affairs. From 1884 to 1890, he served alone in this post with the continued support of Meyer. Between 1890 and 1892, he served as assistant superintendent with Maui sheriff Thomas Evans and his successor former head of Honolulu police William Tell. After 1892, Hutchison was reappointed as acting superintendent, a position he held until replaced by Board of Health official C. B. Reynolds {{after the death of his}} main supporter Rudolph Meyer in 1897.Hutchison was highly regarded by the Native Hawaiian patient community and the Board of Health in Honolulu. According to resident physician Dr. Arthur Albert St. M. Mouritz, he [...] "displayed marked ability and highly creditable administrative powers for a man so young." [...] In 1898, Hutchison and his wife along with more than seven hundred people at Kalaupapa signed the famous Kūʻē Petitions against the annexation of Hawaii to the United States.|$|R
60|$|Voices pitched {{cautiously}} low became audible in {{a minute}} more in the hall. The Resident <b>Dispenser</b> and the <b>Head</b> Nurse appeared, {{on their way to}} the dormitories of the attendants at the top of the house. The man bowed silently, and passed the doctor; the woman courtesied silently, and followed the man. The doctor acknowledged their salutations by a courteous wave of his hand; and, once more left alone, paused a moment, still whistling softly to himself, then walked to the door of Number Four, and opened the case of the fumigating apparatus fixed near it in the corner of the wall. As he lifted the lid and looked in, his whistling ceased. He took a long purple bottle out, examined it by the gas-light, put it back, and closed the case. This done, he advanced on tiptoe to the open staircase door, passed through it, and secured it on the inner side as usual.|$|R
40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{contingent}} developments {{that led to the}} feminization of hospital dispensing {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century in England. In the 1870 s, as a result of the campaign of the Women's Movement to open medicine to women, the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women found it possible to place some of its protégées in the dispensaries of hospitals founded by members of the Movement. Coincidentally, a radical member of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society smoothed the way for them to take the Society's examinations, thus setting up an expectation that these women should be qualified. By the 1880 s, the practice of employing female dispensers had spread to Birmingham, and the women here adopted a less difficult and expensive qualification, the Apothecaries' Assistant's Certificate, as the qualification of choice. The 1890 s also saw increasing pressure on mainstream hospital dispensaries to replace the untrained assistants in their dispensaries, customarily employed on the Babbage Principle to save money, with qualified ones. In consequence, hospital managements sought a new means of containing costs and, turning to the kind of women already shown to be competent in Women's Movement hospitals, found the solution in a vertical gender-segregation, where the lesser qualification of women dispensers made them ‘unpromotable’ to <b>head</b> <b>dispenser,</b> thus preserving the career ladder for more highly-qualified male dispensers...|$|R
5000|$|Tom Servo {{is a red}} puppet {{that has}} a gumball machine (Carousel Executive Snack <b>Dispenser)</b> for a <b>head,</b> a body {{composed}} of a toy [...] "Money Lover Barrel" [...] coin bank and a toy car engine block, and a bowl-shaped hovercraft skirt (a Halloween [...] "Boo Bowl") instead of legs. His arms are a pair of small white ventriloquist's dummy hands {{on the ends of}} springs that are not really functional as arms, a point that is commented on occasionally throughout the series (however, in the season eleven incarnation on Netflix his arms are shown to be functional, usually in the theater). Some episodes feature Tom with objects already in his hands, raising the unanswered question of how they got there. His shoulders are made from the front of an Eveready Floating Lantern. Because Servo's head is transparent, chromakeyed images appear projected through it, and thus a second puppet was built for use in the theater segments, entirely spray-painted black. This black Servo also appeared in a host segment in episode #609, The Skydivers. Tom moves about by hovering. In seasons one through ten he is unable to hover much higher than the ground, however in season eleven (and briefly in the film version) he is capable of hovering at apparently any height and with great agility. In episode #413 Manhunt in Space it is revealed that Servo suffers from red-green colorblindness.|$|R
