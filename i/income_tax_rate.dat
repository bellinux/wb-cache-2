5|$|Since the {{completion}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in 1977, the government of the state of Alaska has been reliant on taxes paid by oil producers and shippers. Prior to 1976, Alaska's personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> was 14.5 percent—the highest in the United States. The gross state product was $8billion, and Alaskans earned $5 billion in personal income. Thirty years after the pipeline began operating, the state had no personal income tax, the gross state product was $39billion, and Alaskans earned $25billion in personal income. Alaska moved from the most heavily taxed state to the most tax-free state.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{individual and}} corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> {{in order to}} identify the political and economic conditions that affect the rate of revenue extraction in the modern state. Specifically, it employs multivariate time-series analysis to study the average effective <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> paid by both individuals and corporations in the U. S. from 1916 to 1986. The results reveal that individual <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> and corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> are affected by many of the same variables. Indeed, both state-centered and society-centered variables influence the rate of revenue extraction, but societal-level variables are generally more important than organizational-level variables. In particular, macroeconomic conditions, state imperatives, and class organization affect the rate of revenue extraction, but political organization generally does not. Although individual <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> and, to a lesser extent, corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> are relatively stable over time, both federal <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> were altered dramatically as a result of World War II, indicating a tendency toward "punctuated equilibrium.

5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
