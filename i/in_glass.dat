5|$|In 1957-58 Littleton took a year’s leave. A {{university}} research grant {{allowed him to}} visit Europe to study the influence of Islamic culture on contemporary Spanish pottery. He first stopped in Paris to visit Jean Sala, who had been recommended to him as an artist who worked alone <b>in</b> <b>glass.</b> Though Sala was no longer active <b>in</b> <b>glass,</b> he took Littleton to his now-idle studio. Conditioned by all of his experience at Corning, Littleton knew only of glass-making in an industrial setting, {{by a team of}} workers.|$|E

25|$|Former: The major {{component}} of the glass is silica, which during the Roman period was sand (quartz), which contains some alumina (typically 2.5%) and nearly 8% lime. Alumina contents vary, peaking around 3% <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> from the western Empire, and remaining notably lower <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> from the Middle East.|$|R
40|$|High {{temperature}} optical {{spectra of}} Cr 3 + <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> show a systematic linear redshift of crystal-field transitions in the 300 – 800 K range, giving them thermochromic properties. Linear thermal expansion coefficients of Cr 3 + <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> of about 1510 - 6 K- 1 {{are derived from}} the spectroscopic data, using a point charge model. The values obtained are independent on glass composition and greater than the macroscopic thermal expansion coefficients of the glasses investigated. These observations help understand the structural evolution of glasses at high temperatures by a better comparison between thermal expansion processes <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> and crystals...|$|R

5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium reacts violently {{with water}} and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{synchrotron}} based x‐ray microbeam fluorescence (µ‐SYXRF) for {{the identification}} of relatively insoluble gas species <b>in</b> bubbles <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> is presented. The nondestructive method of SYXRF allows the in situ analysis of unopened inclusions with high spatial resolution and low detection limits. The example is given of {{the analysis of the}} noble gas Xe and Mo and Rb <b>in</b> an aluminosilicate <b>glass</b> matrix. The use of synchrotron based x‐ray micro beam fluorescence for the nondestructive identification and analysis of fluid inclusions (gas bubbles) <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> is recommended for applications <b>in</b> the <b>glass</b> industry and geochemistry of fluids...|$|R
40|$|We image local {{structural}} rearrangements <b>in</b> soft colloidal <b>glasses</b> under small periodic perturbations {{induced by}} thermal cycling. Local structural entropy $S_{ 2 }$ positively correlates with observed rearrangements <b>in</b> colloidal <b>glasses.</b> The high $S_{ 2 }$ {{values of the}} rearranging clusters <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> indicate that fragile regions <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> are structurally less correlated, similar to structural defects in crystalline solids. Slow-evolving high $S_{ 2 }$ spots are capable of predicting local rearrangements long before the relaxations occur, while fluctuation-created high $S_{ 2 }$ spots best correlate with local deformations right before the rearrangement events. Local free volumes are also found to correlate with particle rearrangements at extreme values, although the ability to identify relaxation sites is substantially lower than $S_{ 2 }$. Our experiments provide an efficient structural identifier for the fragile regions <b>in</b> <b>glasses,</b> and highlight {{the important role of}} structural correlations in the physics of glasses...|$|R

5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood held up by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{thallium}} {{is produced}} not from potassium ores, {{but as a}} byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production {{is used in the}} electronics industry, and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor <b>in</b> <b>glass.</b> In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only be done on the factory floor, separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E
5|$|Items include granite pavers {{that have}} {{memories}} of past Hillsboro citizens {{carved into the}} stone and photographs etched onto glass.

Mooberry, Mary Ramsey Wood, George Iwasaki, and Howard Vollum. Gunfights, hangings, funerals, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the Great Depression, and an outbreak of diphtheria in the 1890s are among the events represented. More recent photographs show the defunct Oregon Electric Railway, which the westside line often uses the old right-of-way of the former line, and employees at Intel dressed in cleanroom suits.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} {{differences between}} the behavior of glass and crystalline ceramic laser host materials {{are associated with the}} greater variation in the local environment of lasing ions in amorphous solids. This leads to a broadening of the fluorescent levels <b>in</b> <b>glasses.</b> For example, the width of the Nd3+ emission in YAG is ~ 10 angstroms as compared to ~ 300 angstroms <b>in</b> typical oxide <b>glasses.</b> The broadened fluorescent lines <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> {{make it more difficult to}} obtain continuous wave laser operation (CW), relative to the same lasing ions in crystalline solid laser hosts.|$|R

5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO2) {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> from trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber.|$|E

5|$|The 1810s were a {{critical}} decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat {{was built in}} Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. Also, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> products. When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of localized vibrations at low frequencies <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> {{and the notion}} and the properties of quasilocalized vibrations (QLVs) <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> have been debated in the recent literature.
