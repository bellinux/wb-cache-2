40|$|Site-specific DNA binding {{molecules}} {{offer the}} potential for genetic manipulation of mammalian cells. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are a DNA mimic in which the purine and pyrimidine bases are attached to a polyamide backbone. PNAs bind with high affinity to single-stranded DNA via Watson–Crick base pairing and can form triple helices via Hoogsteen binding to DNA/PNA duplexes. Dimeric bis-PNAs capable of both strand invasion and triplex formation can <b>form</b> <b>clamp</b> structures on target DNAs. As a strategy to promote site-directed recombination, a bis-PNA was coupled to a 40 -nt donor DNA fragment homologous to an adjacent region in the target gene. The PNA–DNA conjugate was found to mediate site-directed recombination with a plasmid substrate in human cell-free extracts, resulting in correction of a mutation in a reporter gene at a frequency at least 60 -fold above background. Induced site-specific recombination was also seen when the bis-PNA and the donor DNA were co-mixed without covalent linkage. In addition, the bis-PNA and the bis-PNA–DNA conjugate were found to induce DNA repair specifically in the target plasmid. Both the PNA-induced recombination and the PNA-induced repair {{were found to be}} dependent on the nucleotide excision repair factor, XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A protein). These results suggest that the formation of a PNA clamp on duplex DNA creates a helical distortion that strongly provokes DNA repair and thereby sensitizes the target site to recombination. The ability to promote recombination in a site-directed manner using PNA–DNA conjugates may provide a useful strategy to achieve targeted correction of defective genes...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{of major}} catastrophes in process {{industries}} {{have revealed that}} deficiency of good safety culture {{is one of the}} underlying causes of such disasters. Not only has safety culture been recognized as a root cause, but also it is increasingly accepted as an influential factor in a risk analysis and considered as a legal requirement. Most of current quantitative risk analyses (QRA) rely on technical factors but more and more effort is being made for the incorporation of human and organizational factors (HOFs). Especially, safety culture largely represents an organizational attitude towards safety. Thus, how to measure safety culture in more effective manners and how to utilize such assessment data in a QRA are chosen as major objectives of this research. For the measurement of safety culture, this study suggests an approach that assesses values and assumptions by looking through artifacts, e. g., management level and employee?s behavior. Such approach employs following two methods: a matrix structure composed of safety culture dimensions, and grading schemes that provide different levels of safety practices. Using such an approach and suggested methods, a safety culture assessment questionnaire is developed as a results. For the incorporation of such safety culture data into a risk analysis, this study employs a risk model based on Hybrid Causal Logic (HCL) and a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to represent cause and effect relationships among variables. Mock-up safety culture data is generated for this analysis. Findings from investigation of Universal <b>Form</b> <b>Clamp</b> incident (2006) are used to establish a case scenario upon which a fault tree and an event tree are constructed. To make a transition from qualitative knowledge about safety culture to quantitative probability data, some of the safety culture dimensions are selected as Risk Influencing Factors (RIFs), while Safety Culture Influencing Factors (SCIFs) are developed and introduced in this work. Using the established BBN, prior generic probability data are updated with newly obtained evidences such as mock-up safety culture assessment data. In addition, several analyses, e. g., predictive and diagnostic reasoning are conducted to determine how a change in safety culture affects the probabilities of safety-related events and also to identify which safety culture aspects need improvement...|$|E

The F 19 -D 46 and I 97 -D 124 hydrogen bonds link the N terminus of a beta-strand with the C terminus of the succeeding antiparallel alpha-helix, and the A 103 -D 130 hydrogen bond links the N terminus of an alpha-helix with the C terminus of the succeeding antiparallel beta-strand, <b>forming</b> <b>clamps</b> for the respective betaalpha or alphabeta hairpins. The individual replacement of these aspartic acid side chains with alanine leads to {{what appear to be}} closely related partially folded structures with significantly reduced far-UV CD ellipticity and thermodynamic stability. Comparisons with the effects of eliminating another main-chain-side-chain hydrogen bond, G 26 -S 33, and two electrostatic side-chain-side-chain hydrogen bonds, D 38 -H 92 and D 112 -H 146, all in the same N-terminal folding unit of alphaTS, demonstrated a unique role for the clamp interactions in stabilizing the native barrel conformation. Because neither the asparagine nor glutamic acid variant at position 46 can completely reproduce the spectroscopic, thermodynamic, or kinetic folding properties of aspartic acid, both size and charge are crucial to its unique role in the clamp hydrogen bond. Kinetic studies suggest that the three clamp hydrogen bonds act in concert to stabilize the transition state leading to the fully folded TIM barrel motif...|$|R
