500|$|Espinosa {{landed the}} lead role of the film Gloria in 2014. The film is a biopic about singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, and her {{relation}} with her manager, record producer Sergio Andrade. The movie chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure in a band, her rise to musical stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brazil. Espinosa won the role after a month-and-a-half casting process, stating that [...] "I do not know how many actresses were , or who they were, but once I got the role <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> big responsibility, because it is a character who is alive and has a lot of fans, I had to do it well. It is a very complex character, full of nuances, with great force". Espinosa took singing lessons and had to learn Trevi's accent. Also, to fully prepare for the role, the actress was assigned a choreographer and worked with the film director to find the right tone for the scenes. Espinosa watched Trevi's interviews, concerts and films to be able to play her. [...] "The role was meant for me", Espinosa said to Noticine.|$|E
500|$|As with Miley and Ray Cyrus's last duet, [...] "Ready, Set, Don't Go" [...] (2007), [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] {{describes}} a child's transition to adulthood. The song was written and produced by Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri for the 2009 film [...] According to the film, when main character Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus) was young, her father Robby Ray Stewart (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), would often {{tell her that}} while a caterpillar {{may not be able}} to move much, it can still dream about the butterfly it will one day be. This comment became a recurring motif in the film and provided the basis for the lyrics to [...] "Butterfly Fly Away", which use a caterpillar's metamorphosis as a metaphor for a child's coming of age. In Hannah Montana: The Movie, the Cyruses perform the song as their characters in [...] "a tender movie scene under a gazebo in the rain". Billy Ray said filming the scene was [...] "a pretty special moment. The song itself was written by Glen Ballard, a masterful songwriter who wrote 'Man in the Mirror' for Michael Jackson. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pretty special song [...] and it certainly comes at a nice spot in the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Reprise Records {{president}} Howie Klein {{spent a lot}} of time in {{the studio}} with the band during recording, and recalled that, [...] "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same. [...] There was so much growth in the band." [...] The musical maturation displayed on Nimrod was partially inspired by Bikini Kill's Reject All American (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance [...] "rough punk rock songs" [...] and [...] "delicate pretty songs". [...] Armstrong wrote [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the Dookie recording sessions in 1993. [...] During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on Dookie, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording, like [...] "Haushinka" [...] that was recorded for dookie, but omitted. [...] When the time came to record Nimrod, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. [...] He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took [...] "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most." [...] Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings [...] "I knew we had done the right thing. [...] <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hit the second I heard it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{breakthrough}} came in 1975 when Donald A. Wollheim purchased both manuscripts she had {{submitted to}} DAW Books, Gate of Ivrel and Brothers of Earth. Cherryh stated {{in an interview}} on Amazing Stories, [...] "It was the first time a book really found an ending and really worked, because I had made contact with Don Wollheim at DAW, found him interested, and was able to write for a specific editor whose body of work and type of story <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good match. It was a set of characters I’d invented when I was, oh, about thirteen. So it was an old favorite of my untold stories, and ended up being the first in print." [...] The two novels were published in 1976, Gate of Ivrel preceding Brothers of Earth by several months (although she had completed and submitted Brothers of Earth first). The books won her immediate recognition and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1977.|$|E

2500|$|A nervous Bhansali, who had met {{the media}} after a long time, said he was very afraid of {{handling}} a mic after so long. He thanked UTV Chairman Ronnie Screwvala for his unrelenting support. Bhansali made headlines {{for the day when}} he said that Aishwarya Rai was [...] ".. his muse, his jaan, and I get terribly excited when I make a film with her because she is very, very special. Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years". About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is that I think I understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director. Some deep thoughts are my concern, so whatever little music <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sort of experiment. But I am happy with what I have done,".|$|E
2500|$|Greg Vaughan, who had {{recently}} been let go from his role as Diego Guittierez on The Young and the Restless, was cast shortly thereafter and first appeared on February 20, 2003. Vaughan later described his screen test to Soap Opera Digest: [...] "I {{was a little bit}} intimidated. I knew about the character, the foundation of the story. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> difficult task that I was about to take on." [...] In July 2009, Vaughan denied rumors that he was being let go or put on recurring status. That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: [...] "It was a tough situation. I was not under any sort of headspace that someone was losing their job; it was that the role was opening up. (...) It was more of a confusing thing for me coming back and not knowing exactly what was going on, {{on the other end of}} things." [...] Vaughan last aired on October 20, 2009, while Jackson first aired on October 27, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E
