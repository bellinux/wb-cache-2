In 1912 it <b>handed</b> <b>part</b> of its recruiting area over to the newly formed 10th Battalion, London Regiment (Hackney Rifles) under its former commanding officer, Col G.T.B.

50|$|Process FMEA can be {{challenging}} for participants who have not completed many PFMEAS, often confusing FAILURE MODES with EFFECTS and CAUSES. To clarify, a Process FMEA shows how the process can go wrong. Using a detailed Process Map will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list {{the steps of the}} process being reviewed. The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step can go wrong. Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right <b>handed</b> <b>part.</b> Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.) FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and scrapped part, or hole drilled in wrong location. The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job. Why is it important to do a PFMEA with regard to the process? When a process is examined or if we ask what can go wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y. Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left <b>handed</b> <b>part</b> in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time. If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained. Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained. New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it can go wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, Adelbert W. Sprague, {{a sophomore}} at the University of Maine, {{discovered}} Opie, a march written by United States Army bandmaster E. A. Fenstad, while he was playing in an orchestra in Bar Harbor, Maine. In 1904, Sprague, then a senior and the school's band leader, was preparing for a concert {{to be held at}} the University. He <b>handed</b> <b>part</b> of Opie to his roommate, Lincoln Colcord, and asked him to provide some Maine-themed lyrics for the song. Colcord wrote the lyrics in half an hour and Sprague then rearranged the song slightly to fit the lyrics. The song was presented to the faculty advisor on music affairs, who disapproved of it {{on the grounds that it}} was a drinking song and it would be in poor taste for the state university of a state that prohibited the manufacture and sale of liquor to have its students singing such as song. However, Sprague had a chance meeting with University of Maine President George Emory Fellows, who told him that the lyrics were all right. The song was a hit at a concert and became popular with the student body.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{unification}} of the electro-weak and gravitational interactions {{based on the}} joining the weak SU(2) gauge fields with the left <b>handed</b> <b>part</b> of the space-time connection, into a single gauge field valued in the complexification of the local Lorentz group. Hence, the weak interactions emerge as the right handed chiral half of the space-time connection, which explains the chirality of the weak interaction. This is possible, because, as shown by Plebanski, Ashtekar, and others, the other chiral half of the space-time connection is enough to code {{the dynamics of the}} gravitational degrees of freedom. This unification is achieved within an extension of the Plebanski action previously proposed by one of us. The theory has two phases. A parity symmetric phase yields, as shown by Speziale, a bi-metric theory with eight degrees of freedom: the massless graviton, a massive spin two field and a scalar ghost. Because of the latter this phase is unstable. Parity is broken in a stable phase where the eight degrees of freedom arrange themselves as the massless graviton coupled to an SU(2) triplet of chirally coupled Yang-Mills fields. It is also shown that under this breaking a Dirac fermion expresses itself as a chiral neutrino paired with a scalar field with the quantum numbers of the Higgs. Comment: 21 page...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} the Fiduciary Glove Toolkit.

The toolkit is named after the Fiduciary Glove, which is its foundation. The Fiduciary Glove is an ordinary glove with fiduciary markers stuck onto 15 key <b>hand</b> <b>parts.</b> The tags are recognizable by the Microsoft Surface, each has a unique identifier. This way, the <b>hand</b> <b>part</b> and <b>hand</b> itself can be reliably identified when a tag touches the surface. Through assigning a glove to a particular person, user identification is possible and just as reliable. The API of the Fiduciary Glove Toolkit allows developers to easily integrate these capabilities in their applicationtogether with gestures and postures. Three utilities for the creation, adjustment and testing of glove configurations, gestures and postures complement the toolkit...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a novel hand gesture interface system via a depth imaging sensor for appliances control in smart home environments. To control appliances with hand gestures, {{we recognize the}} <b>hand</b> <b>parts</b> in a depth hand silhouette and generate control commands. In our methodologies, we first create a database (DB) of synthetic hand depth silhouettes and their corresponding hand parts-labelled maps and then train a random forests (RFs) classifier with the DB. Via the trained RFs, we recognize the <b>hand</b> <b>parts</b> in a depth silhouette. Then {{based on the information}} of the recognized <b>hand</b> <b>parts,</b> control commands are finally generated according to our implemented control interface. By testing our system on real hand gestures, we have obtained an average recognition rate of 98. 50 % from five different subjects. With the presented interface system, users can control smart home appliances such as TV, fan, lighting, doors and change channels, temperature, and volume by just hand gestures...|$|R
