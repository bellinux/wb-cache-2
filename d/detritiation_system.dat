40|$|Hydrogen {{explosion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dangerous accident phenomena in both nuclear fusion and fission reactor. In the typical fusion reactor, tritium and deuterium are fuel elements for fusion reaction, and they exist in condensed state around the cryo-pump in the normal operation condition. In the accident situation, increasing heat transfer system temperature can mobilize lots of tritium in the vacuum vessel. And then, coolant can react with high-temperature structures generating hydrogen gas inside vacuum vessel. In addition, air ingress into plasma terminates fusion reaction producing activated dust on the first wall plasma facing surfaces. Through these series of process, mobilized tritium and dust aerosol can explode in the vacuum vessel and damage the containment building integrity, making a sort of source term leakage to environment through various system volumes. In this paper, preliminary safety analysis for hydrogen and dust explosion accident for assumed design of Korean fusion demonstration reactor is conducted. An MELCOR system analysis code is used to simulate this accident and parametric analysis to investigate effect on the accident scale and safety systems like <b>detritiation</b> <b>system</b> such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning isolation system and pressure suppression system. As a result, aerosol distribution of each control volume and its release route are estimated, and final aerosol release to the environment is compared with release guideline for ITER. The amount of mobilized aerosol in demonstration reactor is evaluated conservatively using ITER normal operation conditio...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is related}} to the {{application}} of the CESI and EdF ECART code on the analysis of the tritium and dusts external releases for an in-vessel break in the helium cooling loop of the first wall / blanket for the Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS). In particular the influence on the releases of a <b>Detritiation</b> <b>System</b> (DS) and of a dust scrubber with constant decontamination factor, not implemented in the original PPCS design, are analysed. Furthermore, some parametrical analysis on the influence, on the external releases, of the mass fraction of dust resuspended inside the VV {{at the beginning of the}} sequence have been also performed. These analyses are the follow-up of a previous DIMNP study about the phenomenological behaviour of the PPCS containment (vacuum vessel walls and expansion volume walls), giving the first indications on the amount of the external radioactive releases. The activities have been also carried out in the general framework of the validation phase of the ECART code, initially developed for integrated analysis of severe accidents in LWRs, for its application on incidental sequences related to fusion plants. ECART was originally designed and validated for safety analyses of fission NPPs and is internationally recognized as a relevant nuclear source term code for these fission plants. It permits the simulation of chemical reactions and transport of radioactive gases and aerosols under two-phase flow transients in generic flow systems, using a built-in thermal-hydraulic model...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} that air emissions from tritium systems be kept as low as reasonably achievable. Thus, over the years a number of gas <b>detritiation</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed. Recently there has been interest in lower-cost, simpler systems which do not convert HT to the much more hazardous HTO form. Examples of such systems are (1) a bubbler/dehumidifier, (2) a bubbler/collector, and (3) an adsorber/collector. A computer model of each configuration was written and run. Each system's performance, including tritium buildup in liquid water, and tritium exhausted to the environment, are presented and compared...|$|R

40|$|The Exhaust <b>Detritiation</b> <b>System</b> (EDS) {{is one of}} the key {{safety related}} systems which allows {{operation}} of the JET machine. Its role is to detritiate the exhaust gases in case of an accident and to minimise the tritium release to the environment. EDS has also been used on JET during the last three years for maintenance purposes. During the main phase of the deuterium-tritium experiment (DTE 1), the EDS was the final stage for detritiation of gases coming from the Torus vessel. There is a regulatory requirement to prepare an ''Engineering Substantation'' of key safety related systems. Although this requirement applies to EDS when dealing with accidental tritium releases, it has been possible to investigate the efficiency of the system by analysing the experimental data obtained during maintenance. In 2000, during the shutdown, campaign measurements on EDS have been performed to determine its efficiency on a daily basis. Detritiation factors range between 20 and 80, 000. Results are presented and discussed in relation to the requirements of the JET safety case and the factors which cause apparent low detritiation factors. An enhancement of the system for tritium control tracking is proposed.

5000|$|Proponents {{believe that}} much of the ITER {{criticism}} is misleading and inaccurate, in particular the allegations of the experiment's [...] "inherent danger." [...] The stated goals for a commercial fusion power station design are that the amount of radioactive waste produced should be hundreds of times less than that of a fission reactor, and that it should produce no long-lived radioactive waste, and that it is impossible for any such reactor to undergo a large-scale runaway chain reaction. A direct contact of the plasma with ITER inner walls would contaminate it, causing it to cool immediately and stop the fusion process. In addition, the amount of fuel contained in a fusion reactor chamber (one half gram of deuterium/tritium fuel) is only sufficient to sustain the fusion burn pulse from minutes up to an hour at most, whereas a fission reactor usually contains several years' worth of fuel.Moreover, some <b>detritiation</b> <b>systems</b> will be implemented, so that at a fuel cycle inventory level of about 2 kg, ITER will eventually need to recycle large amounts of tritium and at turnovers orders of magnitude higher than any preceding tritium facility worldwide.|$|R
