25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain's {{ideas were}} {{influential}} {{in particular to}} Alfred Rosenberg, who became the Nazi Party's in-house philosopher. In 1909, some months before his 17th birthday, he went with an aunt to visit his guardian, where several other relatives were gathered. Bored, {{he went to a}} book shelf, picked up a copy of Chamberlain's The Foundations and wrote of the moment: [...] "I felt electrified; <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> the title and went straight to the bookshop." [...] In 1930 Rosenberg published The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a homage to and continuation of Chamberlain's work. Rosenberg had accompanied Hitler when he called upon Wagner's widow, Cosima, in October 1923 where he met her son-in-law. Hitler told the ailing Chamberlain he was working on his own book which, he intended, should do for the Third Reich what Chamberlain's book had done for the Second.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Brown {{recalled}} that [...] "Driftin' Blues" [...] was [...] "the first song that <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> {{and tried to}} sing". The music critic Dave Marsh noted that Brown wrote it while still in high school. The rhythm-and-blues singer Johnny Otis, who was in Bardu Ali's band with Brown in Los Angeles in the early 1940s, {{recalled that}} Brown was reluctant to record the song. Brown's inspiration for the tune was a gospel song his grandmother had taught him and he felt uneasy about mixing gospel and blues; Otis and others helped convince him {{to go ahead with}} it. [...] An earlier blues song, [...] "Walking and Drifting Blues", recorded by Bumble Bee Slim in 1935, includes the lyric [...] "Now I'm driftin', like a ship without a sail". The music writer Bryan Grove noted that Brown's original working title for the song was the same and that, although he was influenced by Slim's lyrics, the songs are otherwise dissimilar.|$|E

Featured in the only nude scene in the film, Shoop discussed filming the scene in an interview: [...] "Now that was hard! The water was freezing cold, and poor Leo Rossi and I could barely keep our teeth from chattering! The water was also pretty dirty and I ended up with an ear infection." [...] Gifford and Alicia played minor supporting roles as head nurse Mrs. Virginia Alves and orderly Janet Marshall. Actor Lance Guest played an EMS driver, Jimmy [...] The Last Starfighter director Nick Castle stated in an interview, [...] "When I {{was assigned to the}} film, Lance Guest was the first name <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> on my list for Alex after seeing him in Halloween II." [...] Castle adds, [...] "He possessed all the qualities I wanted the character to express on the screen, a kind of innocence, shyness, yet determination." [...] Future Saturday Night Live and Wayne's World star Dana Carvey also appears briefly in a non-speaking role, wearing a blue baseball cap and receiving instructions from the TV reporter.|$|E
2500|$|On day 2, Allan's 1984 diary was {{delivered}} to Carman's junior counsel and used against Allan in cross examination. The notebook contained details of Allan's sexual fantasies about a married Italian airline pilot named Ricardo and it cast doubt on her professed celibacy. Allan told the court that her relationship with Ricardo only included [...] "a degree of sexual foreplay". The judge said that any finding that Allan had lied {{about the extent of}} this relationship did not mean she had an affair with Terre'Blanche, whom she described as [...] "a very different man". The diary's disappearance was investigated by the police, but {{it was found that the}} diary had been left in the home of an English couple with whom Allan had resided in 1989. Allan revealed [...] "I was in a traumatic state and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> my worst fears and probably my worst desires," [...] continuing [...] "It was a way of dealing with my sexual problems. [...] This notebook is deeply embarrassing. I wrote it when I was under psychiatric care." [...] Later her former husband Gordon Schachat provided evidence supporting claims Allan had made about her disinterest in sex and citing it as a reason for the breakdown of their marriage. Schachat also rebuffed perceptions in the media about her image: [...] "her sexy public image is totally at odds with her real personality", continuing to describe her as [...] "shy". He insisted she was neither an extreme right-winger or anti-semitic.|$|E

The Lagrangian <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> is invariant under both the exotic gauge theory defined by the FTS and Freudenthal Duality. In prepration for discussing these topics, I review FTS and touch on their relationship to Lie algebras. I then discuss F-duality and present a novel proof that only depends on the axioms of the FTS on not on a direct calculation of any particular realization. I then review N= 2 Maxwell-Einstein Supergravity in 4 D (and 5 D) and go over how F-duality arose in the first place.
