25|$|On 2 June 1940 {{test pilot}} Mikhail Lipkin barely survived when, landing with engines out, his SPB (D) clipped a parked Tupolev SB. On 30 June the second SPB (D) {{disintegrated}} in flight. Lipkin and flight engineer Bulychov, instructed to test wing flutter at an extreme 600-km/h (373-mph) <b>diving</b> <b>speed,</b> {{were killed in}} the crash; the aircraft actually disintegrated in horizontal flight. Investigators initially blamed the accident on Polikarpov's deputy Zhemchuzhin, who allegedly failed to fit the balance weights into the leading edges of the ailerons, causing wild flutter. Later they also blamed Lipkin, already dead, for the alleged reckless increase of speed. TsAGI engineers and airfield staff voiced suspicion that other factors could have been involved, but these were not examined at all.|$|E
500|$|Frost {{considered}} {{the new design}} as an interim aircraft between the CF-100 and the more advanced C-104 project. The salient changes to the basic wing planform were in decreasing its chord and thickness, and adding a 42° sweep to the leading edge, creating a near-delta wing configuration. The tail surfaces were also swept back. [...] One version that was considered featured two streamlined fuel tanks blended into {{the leading edge of}} the wings near the three/quarter position. [...] Despite the use of more powerful engines, the redesign had very modest performance specifications, with a planned maximum <b>diving</b> <b>speed</b> of Mach 0.95, scarcely better than the placarded Mach 0.85 speed limit of the production CF-100 Mk 2 and Mk 3. Avro executives, recognizing that the company had already suffered due to the protracted development of the CF-100, determined that Frost's revised design would provide a [...] "hedge" [...] against the CF-100's failure to secure long-term contracts.|$|E

The shorter range proved a significant limitation during the Solomons Campaign, during which Zeros based at Rabaul had to travel nearly to their maximum range to reach Guadalcanal and return.

40|$|The world {{tendency}} is {{the increase of}} the productivity {{and the production of}} pieces more and more sophisticated, with high degree of geometric and dimensional tolerances, with good surface finish and low cost. Rectification is responsible for the final finish in the machining process of a material. However, damages generated in this production phase affect all the resources used in the previous processes. Great part of the problems happennig in the rectification process is due to the enormous temperature generated in this activity because of the machining conditions. The <b>dive</b> <b>speed,</b> which {{is directly related to the}} productivity, is considered responsible for the damages that occur during rectification, limiting its values to those that do not cause such damages. In this work, through the variation of the <b>dive</b> <b>speed</b> in the process of cylindrical grinding of type ABNT D 6 steel, rationalizing the application of two cutting fluids and using a CBN (cubic boron nitrate) abrasive wheel with vitrified blond, the influence of the <b>dive</b> <b>speed</b> on the surface damages of hardened steels was evaluated. The results allowed to say that the <b>dive</b> <b>speed,</b> associated to an efficient cooling and lubrication, didn't provoke thermal damages (including heated zones, cracks and tension stresses) to the material. Residual stresses and the roughness of rectified materials presented a correlation with the machining conditions. The work concluded that it is possible to increase the productivity without provoking damages in the rectified components...|$|R
2500|$|An all-metal, {{stressed-skin}} wing of duraluminium (a DERD specification {{similar to}} AA2024) {{was introduced in}} April 1939 and was used {{for all of the}} later marks. [...] "The metal skinned wings allowed a <b>diving</b> <b>speed</b> that was [...] higher than the fabric-covered ones. They were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings; one trials Hurricane, L1877, was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing. The great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath." [...] Several fabric-wing Hurricanes were still in service during the Battle of Britain, although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair. Changing the wings only required three hours work per aircraft.|$|E

The 56th used tactics it called [...] "dive, fire, and recover", attacking German fighters from a higher altitude, taking advantage of its tremendous <b>diving</b> <b>speed,</b> then zooming back to gain altitude advantage. In a running twenty-minute battle across Belgium, the 56th claimed 17 German fighters shot down (mainly of JG 3 and JG 26) for a loss of three P-47s and pilots. Three of those kills were made by Capt. Gerald W. Johnson of the 61st FS, who two days later (when the groups shot down 9 more) became the first ace in the group and the second in the ETO.|$|E
