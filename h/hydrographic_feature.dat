50|$|The Vaupés Arch is a <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> in the geology of Colombia. The Vaupés Arch {{forms the}} major {{drainage}} divide {{in the southern}} extent of the llanos region of eastern Colombia and the western slopes of the Guiana Shield in Venezuela. The Vaupés Arch {{is the result of}} an episode of tectonic uplift that occurred approximately 8 to 10 Ma. The rise of the Vaupés Arch divided the basin of the Amazon from the headwaters of the Orinoco for the first time. Much of the Arch is now buried under thick sediments washed from the Andes. Shifting meanders of the area's numerous waterways have spread these sediments evenly over the flat alluvial plain, which has very little relief. In modern times the Casiquiare canal, to the south of the Arch, reconnects the two headwater basins, the Upper Orinoco and the Upper Rio Negro, a major Amazon tributary.|$|E

40|$|Linear hydrographic features, such as coastlines, are {{geographic}} {{features that}} are difficult to define and portray in a geographic database because of their dynamic nature. What is portrayed in a database as a <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> many times depends on the specific definition adopted by an organization, and these definitions often reflect organizational, national, or international needs and/or agreements. Data collection of dynamic linear hydrographic features is difficult because it is done from static images showing the environment at a specific instant of time. Further, collection of linear features from these images is based on some type of generalization, because only “representative ” points along the continuous linear feature are taken to describe and represent the feature. There is no guarantee that even the same operator will collect exactly the same “representative ” points in two different data collection sessions or from two different images of the same area taken at different times. Because of these circumstances, generally, the portrait of a <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> in a geographic database is valid only for one particular slice of time and for one particular definition...|$|E
40|$|Detailed <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> {{extraction}} from high-resolution {{light detection}} and ranging (LiDAR) data is investigated. Methods for quantitatively evaluating and comparing such extractions are presented, {{including the use}} of sinuosity and longitudinal root-mean-square-error (LRMSE). These metrics are then used to quantitatively compare stream networks in two studies. The first study examines the effect of raster cell size on watershed boundaries and stream networks delineated from LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). The study confirmed that, with the greatly increased resolution of LiDAR data, smaller cell sizes generally yielded better stream network delineations, based on sinuosity and LRMSE. The second study demonstrates a new method of delineating a stream directly from LiDAR point clouds, without the intermediate step of deriving a DEM. Direct use of LiDAR point clouds could improve efficiency and accuracy of <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> extractions. The direct delineation method developed herein and termed “mDn”, is an extension of the D 8 method that has been used for several decades with gridded raster data. The method divides the region around a starting point into sectors, using the LiDAR data points within each sector to determine an average slope, and selecting the sector with the greatest downward slope to determine the direction of flow. An mDn delineation was compared with a traditional grid-based delineation, using TauDEM, and other readily available, common stream data sets. Although, the TauDEM delineation yielded a sinuosity that more closely matches the reference, the mDn delineation yielded a sinuosity that was higher than either the TauDEM method or the existing published stream delineations. Furthermore, stream delineation using the mDn method yielded the smallest LRMSE...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} raster cell size on <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> extraction and hydrological modeling using LiDAR derived DEMs. LiDAR datasets for three experimental watersheds were converted to DEMs at various cell sizes. Watershed boundaries and stream networks were delineated from each DEM and were compared to reference data. Hydrological simulations were conducted and the outputs were compared. Smaller cell size DEMs consistently resulted in less difference between DEM-delineated features and reference data. However, minor differences been found between streamflow simulations resulted for a lumped watershed model run at daily simulations aggregated at an annual average. These findings indicate that while higher resolution DEM grids may result in more accurate representation of terrain characteristics, such variations do not necessarily improve watershed scale simulation modeling. Hence the additional expense of generating high resolution DEM 2 ̆ 7 s {{for the purpose of}} watershed modeling at daily or longer time steps may not be warranted...|$|E

Fronts {{are a major}} <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> in Delaware Bay and in other estuaries. Horizontal salinity gradients of 4 % in one meter and convergence velocities {{of the order of}} 0. 1 m/sec were observed. Visibility improved from one meter to two meters as certain boundaries were crossed. Fronts near the mouth of the bay are associated with the tidal exchange with shelf water. The formation of fronts in the interior of the bay appears to be associated with velocity shears induced by differences in bottom topography with horizontal density difference in the deep water portion of the estuary.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Three successful ERTS- 1 satellite passes have produced synoptic imagery showing distribution of suspended matter and aquatic interfaces over Delaware Bay and adjacent Atlantic coastal regions. The interfaces {{are a major}} <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> in Delaware Bay and frequently include regions of high convergence. In the upper and middle bay the interfaces tend to align along the flow axis {{of the river and}} parallel to the shoreline. A correlation has been found between the concentration of sand particles in suspension and the depth, suggesting that most of the heavier particles are lifted into temporary suspension over shoals and shallow areas by currents and waves. The second type of interface is primarily a tidal intrusion of shelf water into the bay during incipient flood tide, with associated discontinuities in salinity and temperature. The convergence properties of such fronts attract heavy accumulations of foam which were found to contain strong concentrations of heavy metals and other toxic substances...|$|E

Strong southerly wind stresses were found responsible for relaxing the horizontal density gradients across the BSW-LIW frontal zone and displacing this front to the north of Lemnos Island, thus suppressing the Samothraki Anticyclone towards the Thracian Sea continental shelf. Under northerly winds, the BSW-LIW front returns to its regular position (south of Lemnos Island), thus allowing the horizontal expansion of the Samothraki gyre up to the Athos Peninsula. Present results indicate the importance of medium-term wind stress effects on the generation of Samothraki Anticyclone suppression/expansion events...|$|R

The eastern South Pacific (ESP) oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is a permanent <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> located directly off the coasts of northern Chile and Peru. The ESP OMZ reaches from coastal waters out to thousands of kilometers offshore, and can extend from the near surface to depths greater than 700 m. Oxygen minimum zones support unique microbial assemblages and play an important role in marine elemental cycles. We present results from two autonomous profiling floats that provide nine months of time-series data on temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, and particulate backscattering in the ESP OMZ. We observed consistently elevated backscattering signals within low-oxygen waters, which appear to be the result of enhanced microbial biomass in the OMZ intermediate waters. We also observed secondary chlorophyll a fluorescence maxima within low-oxygen waters when the upper limit of the OMZ penetrated the base of the photic zone. We suggest that autonomous profiling floats are useful tools for monitoring physical dynamics of OMZs and the microbial response to perturbations in these areas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAbsorption {{coefficients}} for mineral particles and phytoplankton {{cells in the}} 488 nm waveband, aMSS(488) and aCHL(488), and euphotic zone depths, z 1 %PAR, were determined for the Irish Sea and St. George's Channel from 8 years of MODIS remote sensing reflectance observations. The results are presented as composite maps of the entire region for the months of January, April, July and October and as time series averaged over 2 week intervals for three selected locations representing different mixing regimes. Annual cycles in aMSS(488) were observed in most areas, with maximum values occurring in winter when increased vertical mixing brought fine sediments to the surface. Euphotic depths were strongly influenced by aMSS(488) cycles, but sharp reductions were superimposed wherever phytoplankton blooms occurred. A key <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> of this region is {{the formation of a}} front in St. George's Channel between mixed and seasonally stratified water bodies. On the mixed side of the front, single peaks in aCHL(488) were observed in summer when the euphotic zone was at its deepest. On the stratified side, double peaks in aCHL(488) occurred in spring and autumn while low summer values of aCHL(488) coincided with high values of z 1 %PAR. The remote sensing evidence indicates, therefore, that phytoplankton growth (as reflected by net accumulation at the surface) in summer was limited by light availability in mixed waters, and nutrient availability in the stratified region. We conclude that observations of spatio-temporal patterns in phytoplankton and mineral particle absorption coefficients and euphotic depths derived from ocean colour sensors can provide insights into the processes determining the depth of penetration of solar radiation, and also the factors limiting near-surface primary production, in optically complex and spatially heterogeneous shelf seas...|$|E

The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the possible effects of seismic exploration sounds on distribution of cetaceans in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. The study consisted of ten Gulfier research cruises, surveying the Northern Gulf of Mexico from 1992 to 1997. Cetacean sighting rate (sightings per hour) were examined in relation to the low frequency sounds originating from oil exploration. Recordings of seismic pulses were collected via a towed passive hydrophone array, and grouped according to the signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) into levels of 12 do above ambient. Visual observations of cetaceans utilized 'big eye' binoculars to identify animals. Five hydrographic features were determined by analyzing sea surface height measurements obtained from satellite altimeter and by analysis of shipboard hydrographic measurements. The five defined hydrographic regions were: cold core rings (CCR), warm core rings (WCR), ring peripheries (PER), confluence zones (CON), and other (OTHER). Over 514 hours of recordings were analyzed, with seismic exploration pulses present 21 % of the overall time, with a high of 49 % in the last cruise. The sighting rates for Stenella attenuate were significantly higher in the > 12 dB above ambient region of "OTHER'' (x?= 10. 26, p= 0. 005); this was the only significant according to <b>hydrographic</b> <b>feature</b> for the overall sightings (x?= 8. 46, p= 0. 07), and for Physeter microcephalus (x?= 12. 13,p= 0. 016). Sighting rates were significantly higher in the CCR and the PER for these groups. It appears that cetacean distributions are related to environmental conditions and not to sound intensity level of seismic exploration. The CCR often occur on the continental margin of the mouth of the Mississippi River, an area of great oil exploitation. Tolerance of noise by cetaceans in this important cetacean habitat may impact these findings. Displacement of cetaceans away from immediate source of sound into regions of moderate sound intensity may also influence our ability to observe a change in cetacean distribution associated with seismic exploration...|$|E

In early summer (December) high density concentrations of krill frequently occurred {{in the vicinity of}} southerly positioned pack-ice edges and in the embayments surrounded by the pack-ice edge. In mid and late summer (January-March) when the ice-edge was at its southern-most limit, krill fishing data indicated that harvestable areas were associated with the continental and insular shelf breaks, not with the pack-ice edge. Minke whaling data also suggested that not only sea-ice but also topographical features such as the continental shelf breaks and banks may be important factors affecting minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostratci) distribution. Krill harvesting areas {{in the vicinity of the}} shelf breaks were often coincident with hydrographic fronts. These results suggested that <b>hydrographic</b> <b>features</b> caused by uneven bottom topography (e. g. shelf breaks or banks) may induce the formation of krill concentrations in mid and late summer.
