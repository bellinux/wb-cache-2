5|$|According to Muslim biographies, Muhammed, having {{received}} intelligence that Byzantine forces were concentrating in northern Arabia with alleged intentions of invading Arabia, led a Muslim army north to Tabouk in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia, {{with the intention}} of pre-emptively engaging the Byzantine army; the news, however, proved to be false. Though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> battle in the typical sense, nevertheless the event represented the first Arab attack on the Byzantines. It did not, however, lead immediately to a military confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead of false trails, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> commercial success {{due to the}} experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E

5|$|Aval Appadithan was {{released}} on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. Although the film received positive critical reception, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> box office success {{at the time of}} its release. However, the film began to develop an audience after directors P. Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen commented positively about it. The film was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay, and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English.|$|E

Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was {{the only}} active Yiddish theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country.

Keynes's main interest {{had been in}} trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world.|$|E
5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working programmable, fully {{automatic}} computer, with binary digital arithmetic logic, but it lacked the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, it was successfully presented {{to an audience}} of scientists of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was electromechanical rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> general-purpose machine.|$|E

Stein had stopped taking the diuretic medication prescribed for this {{in the days leading up}} to the game, which has been suggested as a contributory factor to his eventual collapse.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. Also, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.|$|E
