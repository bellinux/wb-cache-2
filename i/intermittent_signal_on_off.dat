50|$|Power {{processing}} units (PPUs) are circuit {{devices that}} convert an electricity input from a utility line into the appropriate {{voltage and current}} {{to be used for}} the device in question. They serve the same purpose as linear amplifiers, but they are much more efficient, since the use of linear amplifiers results in much power loss due to the use of a resistor to change the voltage and current. Instead of using a resistor, PPUs use switches to turn a <b>signal</b> <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> quite rapidly in order to change the average current and voltage. In this way, they could be conflated with dc-ac converters, but the frequency at which they switch the <b>signal</b> <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of ac signals. They are used to convert the current and voltage of both dc and ac signals.|$|R
50|$|Events are {{organized}} into Classes. A class {{is a collection}} of events that somehow belong together. There are classes for ALARM, MEASUREMENTS, CONTROL, INFORMATION, etc. Currently VSCP specifies about 25 classes, but has room for many more 1. Each class is on its turn subdivided into types. A type further specifies the event within the class. For instance, events of Class 20 (0x14) are INFORMATION events. In this class there is a subtype 1 (0x01) BUTTON signaling a button being pressed. In this same INFORMATION class there are also types to <b>signal</b> <b>ON,</b> <b>OFF,</b> BELOW LIMIT, etc. Likewise in class measurements there are types to signal temperature, current, voltage, etc. Having all these classes and types defined makes the nodes speak the same language.

In effect, the gatekeeper neuron acts as the transistor of a gated synapse by modulating the transmission of the signal between the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.|$|R
5000|$|As {{they became}} more cost-effective, digital-to-analog {{converter}} (often called [...] "D-to-A"—abbreviated [...] "D/A", or [...] "DAC") integrated circuits augmented and ultimately replaced FM synthesis devices. These devices enabled computers to play digital audio using an encoding technique known as pulse-code modulation ("PCM"). Unlike pulse-width modulation ("PWM"), which turns a <b>signal</b> <b>on</b> and <b>off,</b> pulse-code modulation also allows {{the level of}} a signal to be set to several intermediate levels; in this regard, PWM is similar to black-and-white images, PCM is similar to grayscale images.|$|R

40|$|SummaryG-protein-mediated {{signaling}} {{is intrinsically}} kinetic. Signal output at steady {{state is a}} balance of the rates of GTP binding, which causes activation, and of GTP hydrolysis, which terminates activation. This GTPase catalytic cycle is regulated by receptors, which accelerate GTP binding, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate hydrolysis. Receptors and GAPs similarly control the rates of signal initiation and termination. To allow independent control of signal amplitude and of the rates of turning the <b>signal</b> <b>on</b> and <b>off,</b> the activities of receptors and GAPs must be coordinated. Here, the principles of such coordination and the mechanisms by which it is achieved are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Functioning and {{efficient}} cell signalling {{is vital for}} the survival of cells. Over the years various components have been identified and recognised as crucial for the transduction of signals in cells. Many of the mechanisms allow for a relatively rapid switching of <b>signals,</b> <b>on</b> or <b>off,</b> with common examples being the G proteins and protein phosphorylation. However, recently it has become apparent that other modifications of amino acids are also important, and this includes reactions with nitric oxide, for example S-nitrosylation, and of particular relevance here, oxidation of cysteine residues. Such oxidation will be dependent on the redox status of the intracellular environment in which that protein resides, and this will in turn be dictated by the presence of pro-oxidants and antioxidants. Here, the chemistry of redox modification of amino acids is introduced, and a general overview of the role of redox in mediating signal transduction is given...|$|R
40|$|International audienceShapes and lengths {{are treated}} {{differently}} in cell biology and in physics. In cell biology, morphology {{is considered a}} powerful read-out for estimating protein activities and for classifying pathways. Spatial features are often viewed as binary <b>signals,</b> <b>on</b> or <b>off,</b> active or non-active. In contrast, in condensed matter physics, spatial dimensions are generally derived quantitatively with scaling relations using the mechanical properties of matter. This powerful approach allows predicting scales in new experiments. Here, we applied such a type of scaling method for specific organelles in cells: the cell adhesion structures. We show that simple relations allow one to derive measured lengths {{in a variety of}} situations and proteic complexes; if the molecular detail is not at play in such an approach, the mesoscopic equations allow one to quantitatively match the experimental observations. Based on these relations, we also predict simple rules for varying lengths of contacts and distances between contacts in future experiments...|$|R

We pose our <b>intermittent</b> <b>signal</b> detection (ISD) problem as an optimal stopping problem, and establish that its optimal solution can be expressed as a stopping rule with a threshold structure. We also show how our ISD problem reduces to the classical Bayesian quickest detection problem as a special case. We then propose a new conditional mean estimate filter to estimate {{time spent in the}} anomalous state when an alert is declared. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm in a simulation study...|$|R

50|$|For example, an amplified {{infrared}} photodiode may {{generate an}} electric signal that switches frequently between its absolute lowest value and its absolute highest value. This signal is then low-pass filtered {{to form a}} smooth signal that rises and falls corresponding to the relative amount of time the switching <b>signal</b> is <b>on</b> and <b>off.</b> That filtered output passes to the input of a Schmitt trigger. The net effect is that {{the output of the}} Schmitt trigger only passes from low to high after a received infrared signal excites the photodiode for longer than some known delay, and once the Schmitt trigger is high, it only moves low after the infrared signal ceases to excite the photodiode for longer than a similar known delay. Whereas the photodiode is prone to spurious switching due to noise from the environment, the delay added by the filter and Schmitt trigger ensures that the output only switches when there is certainly an input stimulating the device.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is not yet}} well {{understood}} how dopaminergic therapy improves cognitive and motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). One possibility is that it reduces the pathological synchronization within and between the cortex and basal ganglia, thus improving neural communication. We tested this hypothesis by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in PD patients when <b>On</b> and <b>Off</b> medication, during a brief resting state epoch (no task), and during performance of a stop signal task that is thought to engage two partially overlapping (or different) frontal-basal-ganglia circuits. For resting state EEG, we measured pair-wise coherence between scalp electrodes in several frequency bands. Consistent with previous studies, in the Off medication state, those patients with the greatest clinical impairment had the strongest coherence, especially in the beta band, indicating pathological over-synchronization. Dopaminergic medication reduced this coherence. For the stop <b>signal</b> task, <b>On</b> vs. <b>Off</b> medication increased beta band power over right frontal cortex for successful stopping and over bilateral sensorimotor cortex for going, especially for those patients who showed greater clinical improvement. Thus, medication reduced pathological coherence in beta band at rest and increased task related beta power for two potentially dissociable cortico-basal ganglia circuits. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} dopaminergic medication in PD improves neural communication both at rest and for executive and motor function...|$|R
