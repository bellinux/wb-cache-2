5000|$|Martempering (Marquenching): Martempering is not {{actually}} a tempering procedure, hence the term [...] "marquenching". It {{is a form}} of <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the [...] "martensite start temperature". At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the retained austenite which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases the impact resistance.|$|E

40|$|Super duplex {{stainless}} steels (SDSS), with a chromium content of 25 wt%, contain a duplex structure {{which consists of}} ferrite and austenite, and have a pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN) equal or higher than 40. SDSS {{are affected by the}} alloying elements, microstructure and fabrication processes. The high degree of alloying elements in SDSS can lead to formation of intermetallic precipitates and secondary phases during heat treatments. Detrimental phases, such as sigma (σ) - phase, the χ - phase, seconday austenite (γ _ 2) and chromium nitrides can form in the temperature range of 700 - 950 ^∘C. The phases can form during welding or due to improper heat treatments and affects localized corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of SDSS. The main objective with this work was to investigate the effect of isothermal heat treatments on localized corrosion properties of a high tungsten SDSS, UNS S 39274. The isothermal heat treatments were performed at 870 ^∘C, 820 ^∘C and 940 ^∘ to from intermetallic precipitates and secondary phases. The σ - phase, the χ - phase, γ _ 2 and chromium nitrides were emphasized in this thesis. To investigate the localized corrosion properties of UNS S 39274, electrochemical measurements were performed on isothermal heat treated samples. The electrochemical measurements consisted of critical pitting temperature (CPT) measurements and anodic cyclic potentiodynamic polarization measurements. Localized corrosion morphology was investigated by surface characterization with optical light microscope after electrochemical measurements. The objective with this was to determine the effect of isothermal heat treatments on localized corrosion morphology. Another objective was to determine a critical <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> time at a given <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> temperature, where a reduction in localized corrosion resistance of UNS S 39274 was observed. The solution annealing at 1110 ^∘C for 15 minutes lead to no formation of intermetallic precipitates and secondary phases, and was verified by surface characterization in SEM. The average CPT of solution annealed samples was determined to be 77, 5 ^∘C. At the <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> temperature 870 ^∘C, 820 ^∘C and 940 ^∘C, the average CPT was reduced by 32, 5 ^∘C, 22, 5 ^∘C and 15 ^∘C after 4 minutes of <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment.</b> E_p was generally found to decrease with increasing electrolyte test temperature.

In as cast samples,needle-like iron-rich intermetallics phases was observed, otherwise, plate-like and fine plate-like iron-rich intermetallics phases was observed for all samples heat treated in semi-solid state. Hardness values for semi-solid heat treated Al- 18 % Si Alloy for all heating time range (10 - 40 min) are relatively higher compared with the as cast one. Hardness value of 72. 5 HRB is achieved by heating Al- 18 % Si alloy at heating temperature of 585 C for 20 min. At {{the early stages of}} heating time (up to 20 min), a significant decreases of weight loss is observed in Al- 18 % Si alloy when semi-solid <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> was applied at 585 C heating temperature. However, semi-solid <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> performed above heating time of 25 min might result in increases of weight. The optimum semi-solid heating treatment condition wa...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{constructed}} {{a computer model}} of the precipitation kinetics of vanadium carbonitride in steel {{that takes into account}} the composition evolution of the precipitates with time. The model takes advantage of the fast diffusion of nitrogen and carbon compared to niobium to derive the composition, size and rate of formation of the precipitates during their nucleation. A local equilibrium condition is used at the precipitate–matrix interface to derive the growth rate of each precipitate as a function of its size and the current matrix composition. Coarsening occurs naturally on account of the Gibbs–Thomson capillarity effect. For <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatments,</b> the calculations show that the precipitates nucleate as almost pure vanadium nitrides. They subsequently grow at the expense of solute nitrogen. When nitrogen is exhausted, the solute carbon precipitates and progressively transforms the nitrides into carbonitrides. The coarsening stage leads to a steady-state size distribution of niobium carbonitrides of the equilibrium composition...|$|R
40|$|Thixoforming {{involves}} processing metallic alloys in the semi-solid state. The process {{requires the}} microstructure to be spheroidal when part-solid and part-liquid i. e. {{to consist of}} solid spheroids surrounded by liquid. The aim of this work was to investigate whether powder compacts {{can be used as}} feedstock for thixoforming and whether the consolidating pressure in the thixoformer can be used to remove porosity from the compact. The powder compacts were made from stellite 6 and stellite 21 alloys, cobalt-based alloys widely used for e. g. manufacturing prostheses. <b>Isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> of small samples in the consolidated state showed the optimum thixoforming temperature to be in the range 1340 ˚C- 1350 ˚C for both materials. The alloys were thixoformed into graphite dies and flowed easily to fill the die. Porosity in the thixoformed components was lower than in the starting material. Hardness values at various positions along the radius of the thixoformed demonstrator component were above the specification for both alloys...|$|R

In particular, it was shown that a giant magnetoelastic wave amplitude, obtained with a very low magnetising field, is a consequence of simultaneous very high values of permeability, magnetomechanical coupling factor, and Young's modulus. The importance of the new amorphous alloy, both for applications and basic research, is founded on its structural development by means of <b>isothermal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatments.</b> In particular, the tendency to maintain structural disorder at temperatures above where the first crystallisation occurrs is fundamental. X-ray analysis demonstrates that this property determines the presence of nanocrystalline phases after heating at a temperature well above that of the first crystallisation...|$|R
