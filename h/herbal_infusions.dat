2500|$|The {{most common}} {{preparation}} involves a careful {{arrangement of the}} yerba within the gourd before adding hot water. In this method, the gourd is first filled one-half to three-quarters of the way with yerba. Too much yerba {{will result in a}} [...] "short" [...] mate; conversely, too little yerba results in a [...] "long" [...] mate, both being considered undesirable. After that, any additional herbs (yuyo, in Portuguese jujo) may be added for either health or flavor benefits, a practice most common in Paraguay, where people acquire herbs from a local yuyera (herbalist) and use the mate as a base for their <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions.</b> When the gourd is adequately filled, the preparer typically grasps it with the full hand, covering and roughly sealing the opening with the palm. Then the mate is turned upside-down, and shaken vigorously, but briefly and with gradually decreasing force, in this inverted position. This causes the finest, most powdery particles of the yerba to settle toward the preparer's palm and the top of the mate.|$|E

50|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Spanish conquerors led by Pedro de Valdivia in 1540 came some of the {{products}} that would become staples of Chilean cuisine - wheat, pigs, sheep, cattle, chickens and wine - while the native peoples contributed potatoes, maize, beans, and seafood. Various combinations of these basic ingredients form the basis of most characteristic Chilean dishes.After the establishment of the colony, products and dishes like chuchoca (coarsely ground dry corn), Humitas, Locro and seaweeds like Cochayuyo and Luche served with boiled eggs became popular. Meals in colonial times tended to be heavy and rich. Lunch was always bigger than dinner, starting with a dish called “De Residencia” of fish, meat, or poultry, followed by a “Guiso” stew with Choclo (fresh sweet corn) and potatoes.There were 3 kinds of bread accompanying the meals: Tortilla de rescoldo, Spanish bread (made of fatty dough), and Chilean bread (flat and crunchy). Lunch and dinner ended with <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions,</b> generally Paico to help digestion, and finally fruit for dessert, mainly strawberries and Lucumas.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chinese herbal {{therapy has}} been shown to be {{effective}} in atopic eczema, although the <b>herbal</b> <b>infusion</b> is quite unpalatable. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and palatability of a new formulation utilizing a granular freeze-dried decoction coated in lacquer, which is more acceptable to patients. The study also monitered the effect of the treatment on activated circulating lymphocytes in order to elucidate possible mechanisms of action of the therapy. METHODS: A total of 32 patients were entered into the open, parallel group, comparative study. The eczema was assessed using a standard scoring system at the start and end of the 8 -week trial. Circulating activated lymphocytes were measured prior to treatment and at 8 weeks using a double-labelled fluorescent antibody technique for flow cytometer analysis. RESULTS: Only 26 patients completed the trial. There was a statistically significant reduction in erythema and surface damage scores with both treatments at 8 weeks. The percentage of CD 4 and CD 8 T-lymphocytes expressing the activation markers CD 25 and HLA-DR were reduced after treatment in those who clinically responded but were not in those who lacked a clinical response. This did not reach statistical significance however. CONCLUSION: The study has shown that the new freeze-dried preparation of Chinese herbal therapy is as effective as the <b>herbal</b> <b>infusion</b> in atopic eczema, The activation marker studies show a trend in reduction as the eczema improves, as is seen with conventional therapy for atopic eczema...|$|R

The effects of drinking coca tea are a mild stimulation and mood lift. It does not produce any significant numbing of the mouth nor does it give a rush like snorting cocaine. In order to prevent the demonization of this product, its promoters publicize the unproven concept that much of the effect of the ingestion of coca leaf infusion would come from the secondary alkaloids, as being not only quantitatively different from pure cocaine but also qualitatively different.|$|R
