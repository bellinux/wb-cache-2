5|$|Until 1295, Nicholas was {{referred}} to as Nicholas of St Andrews (de Sancto Andrea), but in February of that year he began to be called de Balmyle, one source referring to him as de Balmyll dictus de Sancto Andrea (de Balmyle called de Sanctoandrea). It is probable that he adopted de Sancto Andrea when he finished training at St Andrews and went elsewhere, and that he <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1295 when he moved back.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Neighbours is {{broadcast}} on TV2 at 6:30 pm weekdays. In October 2010, it began airing episodes {{at the same}} pace as Australia. The show was initially broadcast by TVNZ in 1988, but by 1996 it {{was removed from the}} schedule. TV4 (now C4) picked the show up and began broadcasting it from 1997. They <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 2000 and it returned to TV2 in 2002. Repeats of the previous day's episode of Neighbours were formerly shown at 2:30 pm weekdays and are now shown at 11.00 am weekdays. The show moved to 5:25 pm weeknights on TV One in late 2007. After a couple of months, the show moved to 3:50 pm weekdays. The show eventually moved back to TV2. The TV2 website offers viewers the chance to watch episodes online with its OnDemand service.|$|E

25|$|Although Williams {{attracted}} the attention and admiration {{of some of the}} most notable writers of his day, including T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden, his greatest admirer was probably C. S. Lewis, whose novel That Hideous Strength (1945) has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis's then-recently published study The Allegory of Love; he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of congratulation and <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams's novel The Place of the Lion and had written a similar note of congratulation. The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship.|$|E

Mélisande bursts into tears and says she feels ill and unhappy in the castle. She wants to go away with Golaud. He asks her the reason for her unhappiness but she refuses to say. When he asks her if the problem is Pelléas, she replies {{that he is not}} the cause but she does not think he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: Pelléas can behave oddly and he is still very young. Mélisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today {{was the first time she}} saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, Mélisande claims she <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold.

500|$|However, {{after the}} National Hockey League {{decided not to}} {{consider}} Houston {{as a location for}} an expansion team because of the indecision over the new arena, Lanier said that he would not have a referendum in November. The Rockets began an appeal in January 1998 against the court order to stay at the Summit, but then <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> May, because they felt that a new arena would be ready by the time they finished their lease. In January 1999, recently elected mayor Lee Brown guaranteed a referendum on the issue {{before the end of the}} year. After several months negotiating with the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, the Rockets finalized a deal to pay half of the constructions costs, and a referendum was set for November 2. The deal was approved by Brown and the Houston City Council, but Watson started an opposition group against the referendum, saying the arena was [...] "not in Houston's interest". On November 3, the results of the referendum were announced, and the arena proposal was rejected by 54% of voters. Alexander said [...] "we never thought we would lose" [...] and that they were [...] "devastated by the loss".|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} January 1950, a {{subcommittee}} of the California Republican Assembly, a conservative grassroots group, endorsed former Lieutenant Governor Frederick Houser (who had lost narrowly to Downey in 1944) over Nixon for the Senate candidacy by a 6–3 vote, only to be reversed by the full committee, which endorsed Nixon by 13–12. Houser eventually decided against running. Los Angeles County Supervisor Raymond Darby commenced a Senate run, but {{changed his mind and}} instead ran for lieutenant governor. Darby was defeated by incumbent Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight in the Republican primary. Knight had also been considered likely to run for the Senate, but decided to seek re-election instead. Actor Edward Arnold began a Senate run, but <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> late March, citing a lack of time to prepare his campaign. Nixon was opposed for the Republican nomination only by cross-filing Democrats and by two fringe candidates: Ulysses Grant Bixby Meyer, a consulting psychologist for a dating service, and former judge and law professor Albert Levitt, who opposed [...] "the political theories and activities of national and international Communism, Fascism, and Vaticanism" [...] and was unhappy that the press was paying virtually no attention to his campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Return to Ravenholm, {{sometimes}} referred to as Half-Life 2: Episode Four, was under development by Arkane Studios before its cancellation. The episode would have featured the Half-Life location Ravenholm, a town infested with zombies and headcrabs. As it was set before the end of Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Valve felt it was constrained creatively. Another abandoned episode was under development by Junction Point Studios, a studio led by Warren Spector. Spector said that the episode would have shown how Ravenholm became the town seen in Half-Life 2, allowing them to feature more of the character of Father Grigori; images of this setting in their game appeared in early 2017. The game included a [...] "magnet gun", which fired projectiles that would magnetize the metal surface they contract, drawing objects and enemies towards it, and would have been used both for combat and puzzles. Junction Point worked on it for a year, producing enough content to demonstrate one section of the game, and a vertical slice that demonstrated the mechanics of the magnet gun. Valve became uninterested in the project, and Spector <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> favour of Disney's Epic Mickey.|$|E
2500|$|Fancourt {{joined the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in May 1920 to succeed Frederick Hobbs, who had {{announced}} {{his decision to}} leave the company.

Pinafore, the Pirate King in The Pirates of Penzance, Colonel Calverley in Patience, Sir Roderic Murgatroyd in Ruddigore and Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard. In 1921, when Cox and Box and The Sorcerer were revived, Fancourt added the roles of Sergeant Bouncer and Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre to his repertoire. He also appeared as the Usher in Trial by Jury in 1926, but he thought himself [...] "simply bloody" [...] in the role and soon <b>dropped</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> 1921, his wife, Eleanor Evans, joined the company as a chorister, also playing some smaller principal soprano roles. [...] She was nicknamed [...] "Snookie" [...] in the company; and, according to fellow D'Oyly Carte performer Derek Oldham, [...] "she was so beautiful, was Snookie! [...] We all fell for her, and we gave Darrell a busy time keeping us 'off'." [...] Later in Fancourt's career, his wife was made the company's stage director and director of productions.|$|E
