5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E

There are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine, {{but it may}} not be easy to <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> because of several drawbacks of such devices. Nevertheless, progress on innovative materials and methodologies has been demonstrated with some patents granted about new nanomanufacturing devices for future commercial applications, which also progressively helps in the development towards nanorobots with the use of embedded nanobioelectronics concepts.|$|E
25|$|When Maddie {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{near the end}} of the fourth season, the writers tried to recreate the tension between Maddie and David by having Maddie spontaneously marry a man named Walter Bishop (Dennis Dugan) within a few hours of meeting him on the train back to LA. When Shepherd read the script she strongly voiced her objection that her character would not <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> but was overruled. The move failed to rekindle the sparks between the main characters or capture the interest of the audience, which led to an even further ratings decline.|$|E

25|$|Finding himself {{seated on}} a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed {{to sit next to}} the handsomest man in the room, Agathon, and that he is always doing such things (213c). Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Alcibiades says he will never <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> (213e). Wondering why {{everyone}} seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night's agreement (213e, c); after saying his drunken ramblings should not be placed next to the sober orations of the rest, and that he hopes no one believed a word Socrates said, Alcibiades proposes to offer an encomium to Socrates (214c-e).|$|E
25|$|Yoshiki's second solo {{classical}} tour commenced in Osaka Castle Hall on December 5, 2016 {{with three}} {{days at the}} Tokyo International Forum on December 6, 7 and 8, a performance at Hong Kong’s AsiaWorld-Expo scheduled for December 29 and Carnegie Hall, New York on Jan 12 and 13. The Carnegie Hall performances included the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The Tokyo concerts in December were an acclaimed success but the Hong Kong Concert on December 29 had to be canceled {{two hours before the}} show. The cancellation was due to an oversight by the promoter in applying for the entertainment license necessary to perform the show. However the date was fulfilled on the following day, December 30, by Yoshiki performing for free with ticket holders being refunded, the first time ever for a major music artist to <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in Hong Kong. The concerts in Carnegie Hall on January 12 and 13 were successful sellout shows. Yoshiki also included in the show a surprise performance of The Star-Spangled Banner after a heartfelt speech about his personal pursuit of the American Dream.|$|E
25|$|Hastings's {{appearances}} in Poirot's later novels {{are restricted to}} a few cases in which he participates on his periodic returns to England from Argentina. Poirot comments in The ABC Murders that he enjoys Hastings's visits because he always has his most interesting cases when Hastings is with him. In the course of The Big Four, Dulcie's life is threatened by members of an international conspiracy. Hastings is forced to risk Poirot's life in return for her promised safety. In other respects {{there is very little}} personal detail regarding Hastings in these novels, until , which takes place after World War II: With his wife now dead, Hastings rejoins Poirot at Styles to help tackle one last case. The novel culminates with Poirot dying of a heart attack, leaving Hastings a confession explaining his role in events as he tracked a criminal who manipulated others to commit murder for him. Poirot's friendship with Hastings is further referenced when the murderer's attempt to manipulate Hastings in such a manner leaves Poirot resolved to kill his adversary, despite his disapproval of murder, as he knew that his friend would normally never <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ross {{first went}} to Washington, D.C. in 1816 {{as part of a}} Cherokee {{delegation}} to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator, despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, {{he was elected to the}} National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross, who were wealthy, educated, English-speaking and of mixed blood. Even the traditionalist full-blood Cherokee perceived that he had the skills necessary to contest the whites' demands that the Cherokee cede their land and move beyond the Mississippi River. In this position, Ross's first action was to reject an offer of $200,000 from the US Indian agent made for the Cherokee to voluntarily relocate. Thereafter Ross made more trips to Washington, even as white demands intensified. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, the first time a tribe had ever shown the audacity to <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> Along the way, Ross built political support in the capital for the Cherokee cause.|$|E

500|$|The Drapier {{does not}} {{directly}} attack Isaac Newton's assay of Wood's coin, but instead attacks the process behind the assay and the witnesses who testified before the Privy Council. In his criticism of the Privy Council's report, the Drapier claims that the report is part of Wood's propaganda and lies, because Wood released three proposals concurrent with the report: lowering the patent production quota from £100,800 to £40,000 worth; {{that no one is}} obliged to accept more than five pence halfpenny per transaction; and to sell the coin at 2s 1d a pound or his raw copper at 1s 8d a pound. Wood's choice of wording, that the Irish would be [...] "obliged" [...] to accept the coin, was criticised by the Drapier who then accused Wood of [...] "perfect High Treason" [...] for obliging the people to take any copper coin when the king lacked the constitutional authority to <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

500|$|Many sources {{claim that}} the 42-reel version was only ever {{intended}} to be a rough cut, and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights. The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, [...] "I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child's play. But I can't do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> you have illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture." [...] Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been a bad dream. While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who {{was the head of the}} Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of Greed by January 21, 1924. She ordered even more cuts to be made on January 29, but then left for Rome in early February to oversee the production of Ben-Hur and was uninvolved in the film's editing for several months.|$|E
500|$|After {{hearing from}} {{immigrants}} how European strikers had used this tactic during prolonged strikes, Haywood {{decided to take}} the gamble in Lawrence, a first in American Labor history. [...] He and the IWW used announcements in socialist newspapers to solicit host families, then screened strikers to see who might be willing to send their children into the care of strangers. [...] On February 10, 1912, the first group of [...] "Lawrence Strike Children" [...] bid tearful goodbyes to their parents and, with chaperones to guide them, boarded a train for New York. [...] The children arrived safely in Manhattan that evening where they were taken to a Labor hall. [...] They were soon lavished with food and clothes and would stay in New York another seven weeks. [...] Despite their excellent treatment, officials in Lawrence and elsewhere were shocked by the move. [...] "I could scarcely believe that the strike leaders would <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as this," [...] Lawrence mayor Michael Scanlon said. [...] "Lawrence could have very easily cared for these children." [...] Though also denounced in the press, the children's exodus gained widespread publicity and made the city of Lawrence look bad. [...] While police and the mayor allowed smaller contingents of children to leave on two more occasions, plans were made to crack down).|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would <b>do</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
