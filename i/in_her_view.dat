5|$|Magda (Anna Crilly) is the Spleens' morose Eastern European housekeeper, who {{is often}} puzzled by British attitudes, {{language}} and, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> softness. She is a willing worker and generally suffers Rick's selfish eccentricities in sullen silence.|$|E
5|$|Rand's {{political}} philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights), and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>view</b> {{it was the}} only system based on the protection of those rights.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} the Singapore Government {{inclines}} towards a discretionary rather than rules-based approach {{when it comes to}} by-election decisions. In support of this, Halimah has argued that the interests of minority communities are protected so long as other minority MPs are present. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> allowing by-elections to be triggered by minority members vacating their GRC seats will undermine the concept on which GRC is premised. Furthermore, the system was also designed to prevent an MP holding his or her GRC to ransom. If by-elections had to follow the vacation of every minority seat, minority MPs would possess significant power in determining the fates of GRCs.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian {{columnist}} and foreign correspondent Jonathan Steele {{published an article}} based on this line of reasoning. In an in-depth study of Iranian attitudes to Jews {{and the state of}} Israel, Hamburg professor of Islamic studies, Katajun Amirpur has argued that, in context, Ahmadinejad had been quoting Ayatollah Khomeini's words about the imminent appearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and had tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. It follows, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> that the text could not imply any intention to destroy Israel or annihilate the Jewish people, since Khomeini's quoted statement preceding it prophesied that the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime would disappear, not that the Russian or Iranian people would thereby be extinguished.|$|E
25|$|The Ford Motor Company was {{the last}} Detroit automaker to {{recognize}} the United Auto Workers union (UAW). A sit-down strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the River Rouge Plant. Sorensen recounted that a distraught Henry Ford {{was very close to}} following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.|$|E

25|$|Various historiographers {{note that}} the concept of dreamed world precedes the German school by several generations, finding its {{literary}} expression in Calderón de la Barca's 1635 allegory, before arriving at Gautier. Eminescu's own perception of spacetime, as apparent in the story and in some poems (La steaua, for instance), has intrigued Romanian students of physics, particularly after they became aware of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1928, Einstein received a letter from his Romanian admirer, Melania Șerbu, who informed him that Poor Dionis had anticipated his finds; Einstein kept corresponding with Șerbu, but did not show an interest in reading the story. In addition to investigating such connections herself, critic Ioana Em. Petrescu believed that the modern interest of Poor Dionis, and of Eminescu's work in general, was given by its multiple levels, and especially by its hermeneutic suggestions. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> Zoroaster's book is a mirror of the world symbol, as in the deconstruction terminology coined by Jacques Derrida.|$|E
500|$|Angela Breitenbach, {{looking at}} the {{question}} of teleology in biology from a Kantian perspective, argues that teleology is important as [...] "a heuristic {{in the search for}} causal explanations of nature and... an inevitable analogical perspective on living beings." [...] <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view</b> of Kant, teleology implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy.|$|E
500|$|Hill's {{system was}} based on closely {{managing}} not only the buildings but the tenants; she insisted, [...] "you cannot deal with {{the people and their}} houses separately." [...] She maintained close personal contact with all her tenants, and was strongly opposed to impersonal bureaucratic organisations and to governmental intervention in housing. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> [...] "municipal socialism and subsidized housing" [...] led to indiscriminate demolition, re-housing schemes, and the destruction of communities.|$|E

50|$|Greatly {{influenced}} by Voltaire, {{his father was}} an educated man that considered himself a freethinker and expressed great skepticism towards religion. Nikolai's mother, Orthodox by birth, was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>views</b> on religion more Catholic than Orthodox. He spent a solitary childhood at home, where his father's library allowed him to read widely. He read Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Kant {{when he was only}} 14 and excelled at languages.|$|R

500|$|Cusack {{compares the}} Church of the SubGenius to the Ranters, a radical 17th-century pantheist {{movement}} in England. She notes {{that they made}} statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has [...] "legitimate pedigree {{in the history of}} Western religion". The American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight likens the Church to the Moorish Orthodox Church of America, a 20th-century American syncretic religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom.|$|E
500|$|Regarding his {{decision}} not to have Talia Shire reprise her role as Adrian, Stallone told USA Today that, [...] "in the original script, she was alive. But it just didn't have the same dramatic punch. I thought, 'What if she's gone?' That would cut Rocky's heart out and drop him down to ground zero." [...] Shire herself said that, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> [...] "The film has great regard for the process of mourning. Sly utilizes mourning to empower Rocky, and Adrian is made very mythical." ...|$|E

Geller, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The American Biology Teacher, thought the book meticulously researched; no one would take exception to its thesis, but {{for the inclusion of}} man. [...] " [...] is well aware of the difficulties this presents." [...] Geller called the last chapter, relating biology to sociology, a [...] "step from scientific study to speculation". <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> the most controversial and disturbing thing was the call for scientist and humanists to [...] "temporarily" [...] remove ethics [...] "from the hands of the philosophers and biologize" [...] it. She called it [...] "dangerous to say that biologists should have a monopoly on truth and ethics." ...|$|E

500|$|Sue Walsh {{observed}} in 2007 that critics have rigidly categorised Just So Stories as [...] "Children's Literature", and have in consequence given it scant literary attention. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> if critics mention {{the book at}} all, they talk {{about what kind of}} reading is good for children and what they are capable of understanding. The stories are discussed, she argues, by critics such as Elliott Gose [...] "in terms of ideas about the child’s pleasure (conceived of in sensual terms divorced of intellectual understanding) in the oral aspects of the text which are said to prompt an ‘active Participation’ which seems largely to be understood in terms of the ‘oral savouring’ of repetition".|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 debates, Sylvia Lim, {{then the}} sole NCMP in Parliament, commented that having NCMPs [...] "make a bad {{situation}} better, but increasing NCMPs is not the solution towards a more robust political system". She identified an NCMP's lack of any official capacity to represent the people or write letters on their behalf as a drawback of the scheme. Moreover, an NCMP has no physical base to organize activities or dialogues with the people. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> {{it would be better}} for politics in Singapore if the NCMP scheme was regarded merely as a [...] "stop-gap measure" [...] to deal with the lack of alternative voices in Parliament as a result of the ruling party's alleged abuse of the GRC system and gerrymandering.|$|E
500|$|Al-Balawi's wife, Defne Bayrak, a {{journalist}} who lives in Istanbul, Turkey, has translated several Arabic books into Turkish, including Osama bin Laden: Che Guevara of the East. She said the radicalization of al-Bawali started in 2003 because of the Iraq War. She doubted that al-Balawi worked as a double agent for the CIA and Jordan's intelligence agency or {{that he was an}} al-Qaeda member. Bayrak said that al-Balawi would have acted of his own volition because he regarded the United States as an adversary. She also said that she was proud of her husband. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> al-Balawi had carried out a [...] "very important mission in such a war." [...] Turkish police questioned and released Bayrak on January 7, 2010.|$|E

500|$|The {{botanist}} Sandra Knapp {{writes that}} [...] "Buffon's prose was so purple that the ideas themselves are almost hidden", observing {{that this was}} also the contemporary academic opinion. She notes that some quite radical ideas {{are to be found in}} his work, but they are almost invisible, given the language they are cloaked in. She quotes Buffon's dramatic description of the lion, which along with the engraving <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>view</b> [...] "emphasized both the lion's regal bearing and personality not only in his text but also in the illustration... A reader was left in no doubt as to the importance and character of the animal." [...] She concludes [...] "No wonder the cultured aristocratic public lapped it up – the text reads more like a romantic novel than a dry scientific treatise".|$|E
500|$|Eunice Chua argues against {{adopting}} the subjective test and limiting judicial review to breaches {{of the procedures}} stated in the ISA. Her argument {{is based on the}} premise that courts should consider notions of substantive democracy in performing their judicial role. Chua argues that in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal should have considered whether there were sufficient safeguards for the protection of detainees after the curtailment of judicial review through constitutional and legislative amendments. She suggests that Article151, which provides for restrictions on preventive detention, should be read liberally in favour of detainees, bearing in mind the exclusion of fundamental liberties by Article149. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view,</b> the curtailment of judicial review should therefore be rejected, as it does not accord with the [...] "spirit" [...] of Article151 of the Constitution which ensures safeguards for detainees.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{argues that}} most {{charters}} {{were based on}} genuine originals, including the First Decimation of 844. She says: [...] "Commentators have been unkind the 844 version has not been given {{the benefit of the}} doubt". <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>view</b> Æthelwulf then gave a 10% tax reduction on bookland, and ten years later he took the more generous step of [...] "a widespread distribution of royal lands". Unlike Finberg, she believes that both decimations were carried out, although the second one may not have been completed due to opposition from Æthelwulf's son Æthelbald. She thinks that the grants of bookland to laymen in the Second Decimation were unconditional, not with reversion to religious houses as Stevenson had argued. However, Keynes is not convinced by Kelly's arguments, and thinks that the First Decimation charters were 11th or early 12th century fabrications.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had last}} seen Muriel Gascoyne he had {{considered}} her a comely English girl without imagination or sensibility. She had, in fact, appeared to him narrow <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>views,</b> totally unemotional, {{and more than a}} little dull, certainly not the kind of young woman to inspire or reciprocate passionate admiration in any discerning man. Now, as she came towards him with her eyes shining and the soft colour <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face, which was very gentle, she seemed transfigured and almost radiant. She stooped and kissed Jacinta impulsively.|$|R

Millicent had noticed Bella's sudden change of demeanor upon her hostess's entrance, with something between amusement and faint disgust.
