5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation.

Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
