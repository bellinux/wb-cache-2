40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} model describing the <b>diphasic</b> <b>jet</b> of gas/powder issued from a coaxial nozzle used in laser cladding is presented. The model {{is based on}} the discrete phase model (DPM), and is applied in the case of turbulent fluid flows with solid dispersed phase. The study concerns the jet geometrical characteristics (the core zone width), and as results, we made evident the importance of the {{numerical model}}ing for a better efficiency of laser cladding processing in industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decades, {{numerous}} in vitro experiments {{have been proposed}} to mimick airflow dynamics and deposition patterns of inhaled aerosols in models of lower airways. These experimental developments are needed to assess and validate the computational works employed to quantify diphasic flows features in complex realistic geometries with high spatio-temporal resolutions. So far, most in vitro {{studies have focused on}} airflow dynamics characterization. Previous aerosol deposition experiments have mainly provided total or regional deposition efficiency in human or animal models. Yet, the individual particle trajectories and local deposition patterns have been barely investigated, and tracking particle dynamics together with local flow structures still represents a challenging task. The objective of the present work is to characterize unsteady local deposition patterns of aerosols within in vitro simple geometries, as a function of airflow properties. The instantaneous flow velocity fields are obtained using 2 D Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV). The measurement of aerosol concentration fields on the wall is achieved using Rhodamine water solution to provide tracer particles and the Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) technique. Two experimental phases will be presented. The first phase will be dedicated to the case of a round turbulent <b>diphasic</b> <b>jet</b> impinging on a plate under steady flow conditions. This standard case will allow the setting and optimization of the experimental set-up. The second phase will study the case of a diphasic flow generated in a bend geometry using a controlled mechanical ventilation. The deposition patterns obtained for different breathing conditions will be discussed...|$|E
