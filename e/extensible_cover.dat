We describe FamilyNet, our solution to the latter problem, which uses public key encryption and a tangible interface simple enough for even children to use, yet <b>extensible</b> to <b>cover</b> a variety of use scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Aspect-oriented {{programming}} (AOP) eases {{the development}} of profilers, debuggers, and reverse engineering tools. Such tools fre-quently rely on calling context information. However, current AOP technology, such as AspectJ, does not offer dedicated support for accessing complete calling context within aspects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to calling context reification that reconciles flexibility, efficiency, accuracy, and portability. It relies on a generic bytecode instrumentation framework ensuring com-plete bytecode coverage, including the standard Java class library. We compose our program transformations for calling context reifi-cation with the AspectJ weaver, providing the aspect developer an efficient mechanism to manipulate a customizable representation of the complete calling context. To highlight the benefits of our ap-proach, we present ReCrash as an aspect using a stack-based call-ing context representation; ReCrash is an existing tool that gener-ates unit tests to reproduce program failures. In comparison with the original ReCrash tool, our aspect resolves several limitations, is <b>extensible,</b> <b>covers</b> also the standard Java class library, and causes less overhead...|$|R

50|$|Some Chiropterans consume nectar instead, {{for which}} they have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, <b>extensible</b> tongues <b>covered</b> in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than {{any other type of}} bat.|$|R
50|$|Like other anteaters, the {{northern}} tamandua is highly adapted to its unusual diet. The tongue is long, <b>extensible,</b> and <b>covered</b> in sticky saliva {{able to pick}} up ants and termites. It has unusually well developed muscles, attached to a large hyoid bone and rooted {{to the top of the}} sternum. The entire oral cavity is modified to accommodate this tongue, and is so elongated that the back of the soft palate is level with the fifth cervical vertebra near the base of the neck, rather than at the top of the pharynx as in most other mammals. The jaw muscles and mandible are reduced, and the latter is particularly fragile. Like other anteaters, {{the northern}} tamandua has no teeth.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} bits of every search engine is the query interface. Complex interfaces may cause users to struggle in learning the handling. An example is the query language SQL. It is really powerful, but usually remains hidden to the common user. On the other hand the usage of current languages for Internet search engines is very simple and straightforward. Even beginners are able to find relevant documents. This paper presents a hybrid query language suitable for both image and text retrieval. It is very similar to those of a full text search engine but also includes some extensions required for content based image retrieval. The language is <b>extensible</b> to <b>cover</b> arbitrary feature vectors and handle fuzzy querie...|$|R

5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, <b>extensible</b> tongues <b>covered</b> in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the vast}} volume of {{collected}} digital data obliges us to employ processing methods like pattern recognition and data mining {{in order to}} reduce the complexity of data management. In this paper, we present the architecture and the logical foundations for the management of the produced knowledge artifacts, which we call patterns. To this end, we first introduce the concept of Pattern-Base Management System; then, we provide the logical foundations of a general framework based on the notions of pattern types and pattern classes, which stand for the intensional and extensional description of pattern instances, respectively. The framework is general and <b>extensible</b> enough to <b>cover</b> a broad range of real-world patterns, each of which is characterized by its structure, the related underlying data, an expression that carries the semantics of the pattern, and measurements of how successful the representation of raw data is. Finally, some remarkable types of relationships between patterns are discussed. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003...|$|R
40|$|We {{have defined}} an XML {{language}} for astronomy, called AML (Astronomical Markup Language), able to represent meta-information for astronomical objects, tables, articles and authors. The various AML documents created have links between them, and an innovative tool can cluster the documents with a graph-partitioning algorithm using the links. The result is {{displayed on a}} density map similar to Kohonen Self-Organising Maps. AML and its advantages will be briefly described, {{as well as the}} clustering program, {{which is one of the}} many possible applications of AML. 1. Introduction XML (<b>Extensible</b> Markup Language; <b>Cover</b> 1998; Bray, Paoli, & SperbergMcQueen 1998) is a new markup language similar to SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language), but simpler and having other advantages over SGML. It is becoming a new standard for publishing information on Internet and will in many cases replace HTML.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{new methods}} for path planning of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for adaptive sampling. The problem is approached in an optimization framework and two methods are developed {{to solve it}} based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). The first method is predicated on network-flow ideas and is shown to have similarities to the Selective Traveling Salesman Problem. An important classification of the set of path-planning problems to be solved {{is the number of}} days that are involved in the complete sampling mission. Intrinsic limitations of the first network-flow-based method limit it to single day adaptive sampling missions. The second method emerged by taking into consideration the limitations of the first method and is based on a general MIP formulation. It is a more powerful formulation as it can handle multiple-day adaptive sampling missions, it is scalable as it can address the multiple vehicle case with ease, and it is more easily <b>extensible</b> to <b>cover</b> unforeseen situations that might arise as adaptive sampling concepts and needs evolve. The second formulation also allowed solution of auxiliary problems, required to determine suitable initial conditions for the main method. The method is applied to various test problems including evaluation of performance issues. (cont.) A real-world problem is also solved by the second method taking two different approaches. The first approach (static approach) involves a three-day-long adaptive sampling mission using the uncertainty information available on the first day. The second approach (dynamic approach) involves updating of the uncertainty information for each day using data assimilation features of the Harvard Ocean Prediction System and the Error Subspace Statistical Estimation system. The dynamic method is illustrative of how path planning for adaptive sampling fits into modern dynamic data driven oceanography. The results from the dynamic approach show that the uncertainty of the forecast decreases and becomes confined to a smaller region, indicating the strength of the method. by Namik Kemal Yilmaz.
