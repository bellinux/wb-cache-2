25|$|Although <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> {{continue}} {{to represent a}} major medical advance for angioplasty, evidence has always shown new clot thrombosis formation with stents to be a problem, thus clotting suppressant agents are routinely given during placement, and anticlotting agents should be continued; the question is for how long. Coronary arterial healing occurs after the placement of a drug-eluting stent, but complete healing of the vessel takes time.

This was primarily driven by higher need for repeat revascularization procedures in the PCI group with no difference in repeat infarctions or survival. Higher rates of strokes were seen in the CABG group.|$|E

2500|$|A stent is {{a foreign}} {{object in the}} body, and the body {{responds}} to the stent’s presence {{in a variety of}} ways. [...] Macrophages accumulate around the stent, and nearby smooth muscle cells proliferate. [...] These physiological changes, which can cause restenosis, are limited by the drugs released by the stent, but these drugs also limit formation of a new endothelial layer over the new stent to inhibit clot formation. Endothelialization is a hallmark of vascular healing and is important for the prevention of thrombus formation. Lack of healing caused by antiproliferative drugs can make the stent an exposed surface on which a clot, sometimes life-threatening, can form. For <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> (which, by design, delay formation of a new endothelium cover over the stent), the incidence of clot formation within the stent may persist {{for a longer period of}} time, perhaps as long as five years after treatment. <b>Drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> have been associated with delayed arterial healing and the prevalence of latent thrombus after five years, suggesting patients may continue to be at risk for stent thrombosis for an extended period of time.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> {{has been}} shown {{to reduce the risk of}} {{repeated}} revascularization. However, as shown for first-generation <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent,</b> they may be counterbalanced by a potential higher risk of stent thrombosis, especially among ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients. In addition, diabetes {{has been shown}} to be an independent predictor of poor survival and repeated target vessel revascularization. No data have been reported so far on the long-term benefits and safety of new-generation <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction according to diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether diabetes may impact on the benefits from everolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> versus first-generation <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> in patients undergoing primary angioplasty. METHODS: We combined data from two randomized trials (PaclitAxel or Sirolimus-Eluting Stent vs Bare-Metal Stent in Primary Angioplasty and randomized comparison of everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction) including consecutive ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients admitted within 12 h of symptom onset undergoing primary angioplasty and stent implantation at a tertiary centre with 24 -h primary percutaneous coronary intervention capability. Primary endpoint of this study was major adverse cardiac events at 3 -year follow-up. Secondary endpoints were as follows: (1) death, (2) reinfarction, (3) definite or probable ST and (4) target vessel revascularization at 3 -year follow-up. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS: Our population is represented by 680 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients treated with <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> (180 enrolled in the PaclitAxel or Sirolimus-Eluting Stent vs Bare-Metal Stent in Primary Angioplasty trial, treated with first-generation <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent,</b> and 500 patients in the randomized comparison of everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, randomized to everolimus-eluting stent or sirolimus-eluting stent). Diabetes was observed in a total of 178 patients (26. 1 %) and associated with higher major adverse cardiac events, mortality, reinfarction, stent thrombosis and target vessel revascularization. Similar outcome was observed in terms of overall major adverse cardiac events, mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, with everolimus-eluting stent as compared to first-generation <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, whereas everolimus-eluting stent was associated with a significantly lower rate of stent thrombosis only in diabetic patients (1. 6 % vs 9. 6 %, hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 0. 15 (0. 02 - 0. 98), p = 0. 04) whereas no difference was observed in non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows that among ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary angioplasty, diabetes is associated with a significantly worse outcome at 3 -year follow-up. A similar outcome was observed between everolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> and first-generation <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> in non-diabetic patients, whereas among diabetic patients everolimus-eluting stent was associated with a significant reduction in stent thrombosis...|$|R
2500|$|Clinical {{trials have}} shown the {{benefits}} of coronary stenting with bare-metal stents over other methods of angioplasty, including balloon angioplasty and atherectomy. [...] <b>Drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> (DES) have also been extensively studied, and are generally superior to bare-metal stents with respect to occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE, generally defined as death, myocardial infarction, or {{the need for a}} repeat revascularization procedure). Stents are indicated to improve the diameter of the coronary artery lumen, when narrowing (generally because of atherosclerosis) causes ischemia (reduced oxygen delivery to the muscle supplied by that artery).|$|E
2500|$|One {{to three}} or more layers of polymer {{can be used in}} the coating, e.g., a base layer for adhesion, a main layer that holds and elutes (releases) the drug into the {{arterial}} wall by contact transfer, and sometimes a top coat to slow down the release of the drug and extend its effect. The first few <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> to be licensed used durable coatings. [...] The first generation coatings appear to have caused immunological reactions at times and some possibly led to thrombosis, which has driven experimentation and development of new coating approaches.|$|E
2500|$|Whether <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> are {{at higher}} risk than bare-metal stents for late {{thrombosis}} is intensely debated. [...] In meta-analyses of the sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stent trials, a small but statistically higher risk of thrombosis was shown after the first year, compared to bare-metal stents. [...] Late stent thrombosis often causes myocardial infarction and sometimes death. [...] In other analyses, the late thrombosis risk is offset by drug-eluting stents' markedly reduced risk of restenosis and its complications including myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis concluded the mortality risk associated with drug-eluting and bare-metal stents is similar.|$|E

40|$|SummaryLate {{adverse events}} {{including}} late stent thrombosis and late catch-up phenomenon after percutaneous coronary intervention {{have been a}} serious clinical problem in the <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> era. Recently, peri-stent contrast staining, namely extension of incomplete stent apposition was reported following <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stent</b> implantation. Here, we report a case of late incomplete stent apposition with late stent restenosis 3 years after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation. We evaluated this restenotic site by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Though IVUS demonstrated irregular structure within stent at the stenotic site, OCT detected unusual bell-shaped image of late stent restenosis with extension of incomplete stent apposition...|$|R
2500|$|Though it {{occurred}} less frequently than with balloon angioplasty or other techniques, stents nonetheless remained vulnerable to restenosis, caused almost exclusively by neointimal tissue growth. To address this issue, developers of <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> used the devices {{themselves as a}} tool for delivering medication directly to the arterial wall. [...] While initial efforts were unsuccessful, the release (elution) of drugs with certain specific physicochemical properties from the stent was shown in 2001 to achieve high concentrations of the drug locally, directly at the target lesion, with minimal systemic side effects. [...] As currently used in clinical practice, [...] "drug-eluting" [...] stents refers to metal stents that elute a drug designed to limit the growth of neointimal scar tissue, thus reducing the likelihood of stent restenosis.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the results}} of the first trials of <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stents</b> were published, there was a general feeling in the interventional {{cardiology}} community that these devices would be part of the perfect revascularization regimen for coronary artery disease. [...] With the very low restenosis rates of the RAVEL and SIRIUS trials, interventions were performed on more complex blockages in the coronary arteries, under the assumption that the results in real life would mimic the results in the trials. [...] The antiplatelet regimens that were advised for the drug eluting stents were based on the early trials of these stents. [...] Based on these trials, the antiplatelet regimen was a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 months when Cypher stents were used, and 9 months when Taxus stents were used, followed by aspirin indefinitely.|$|E
2500|$|Though less {{frequent}} with <b>drug-eluting</b> <b>stents,</b> neointimal proliferation can still occur in DES and cause restenosis. Stent occlusion because of thrombosis may occur during the procedure, {{in the following}} days, or later. [...] The presence of thrombi around the stent may, in turn, affect the drug-eluting performance of the stent. [...] Treatment with the antiplatelet drugs aspirin and clopidogrel {{appears to be the}} most important factor reducing this risk of thrombosis, and early cessation of one or both of these drugs after drug-eluting stenting markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. A recent histopathology study showed very late DES thrombosis is associated with histopathological signs of inflammation and intravascular ultrasound evidence of vessel remodeling. Compared with other causes of myocardial infarction, eosinophilic infiltrates are more common in thrombi harvested from very late DES thrombosis and correlate with the extent of stent malapposition.|$|E
