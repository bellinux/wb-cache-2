40|$|Like many {{developing}} countries in Southeast Asia, Vietnam has experienced {{a significant increase in}} its electricity needs as it has developed. Since coal is a major source of energy in the country, this has led to a rise in coal mining and coal-powered electricity generation.

This study has shown that these environmental costs represent a significant share of the overall cost of electricity generation. To deal with this problem, the study proposes that the costs of dealing with pollution and other environmental problems associated with power generation be incorporated into the country's electricity pricing mechanism.

40|$|The {{financial}} cost of private <b>industry’s</b> <b>pollution</b> is often unfairly {{transferred to the}} public. Decades can pass between a pollution release and its discovery, making {{it very difficult for}} regulators to hold responsible parties accountable. In North Carolina, a prime example of the public shouldering this burden is the primarily publicly financed State Trust Fund for cleaning up after leaking underground storage tanks. One way to ensure polluters pay for remediation is to require financial assurances prior to permitting. There are several mechanisms available that do this, including surety bonds, environmental insurance, and cash accounts signed over to the regulator. In this study, the most commonly used assurance mechanisms were evaluated using a multi-criteria decision analysis and the criteria most important to regulators and industry: contractual strength, verifiability, flexibility, ease of acquisition, and availability/control of funds. These criteria were derived using each party’s core objectives. For regulators, these are protecting the environment and the public and doing so in the least costly way. For industry, these are making profit and meeting the necessary environmental regulations in the least costly way, so that they are allowed to do continuing business. Using North Carolina’s underground storage tank issue as an example, the mechanisms were then ranked by their performance for each criterion. Surety bonds ranked as the best instrument to meet both parties’ needs, providing regulators {{with a high degree of}} contractual strength while allowing industry freedom from needing to cover its entire environmental liability up front. Like surety bonds, insurance and letters of credit provide adequate contractual strength and flexibility, but they are not as easily verified by the regulator. Financial self-tests and corporate guarantees were found to be insufficient because they performed at the least preferable level for regulators in all criteria and provided industry with little flexibility. This evaluative framework should prove useful to policymakers as they try to address the unfair liability private <b>industry’s</b> <b>pollution</b> creates for the public. A statewide assurance program is a feasible solution to this problem given the satisfactory performance of several assurance instruments...|$|R
40|$|In {{numerous}} studies, {{economists have}} found little empirical evidence that environmental regulations affect trade flows. In this paper, we propose and test several common explanations for why {{the effect of}} environmental regulations on trade {{may be difficult to}} detect. We demonstrate that whereas most trade occurs among industrialized economies, environmental regulations have stronger effects on trade between industrialized and developing economies. We find that for most <b>industries,</b> <b>pollution</b> abatement costs are a small component of total costs, and are unrelated to trade flows. In addition, we show that those industries with the largest pollution abatement costs also happen to be the least geographically mobile, or footloose. After accounting for these distinctions, we measure a significant effect of pollution abatement costs on imports from developing countries, and in pollution-intensive, footloose industries. © 2005 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

The purpose of this research is to study the variables of α-cellulose conversion kinetics as the balancing factor between α-cellulose conversion and energy and mass consumptions. The value of energy and mass consumptions, along with temperature and acid concentration, can be minimized to get higher conversions.
