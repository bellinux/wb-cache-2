5|$|By {{the time}} of Soul Reaver, 1500 years later, Kain is a despotic emperor, his vampires {{dominate}} the land, and Nosgoth <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brink of collapse. The Elder God, a demiurge-like entity, lurks beneath Nosgoth and controls the cycle of reincarnation; the vampires, whose biological immortality opposes his doctrine, are his enemies. In Soul Reaver, Raziel—Kain's lieutenant—is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the CUT domain (also {{known as}} ONECUT) is a DNA-binding motif which can bind independently or {{in cooperation with}} the homeodomain, which is often found downstream of the CUT domain. Proteins display two modes of DNA binding, which <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> homeodomain and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> linker that separates it from the CUT domain, and two modes of transcriptional stimulation, which <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> homeodomain.|$|R

25|$|Much of {{the debate}} over their {{importance}} <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> definition of the term, and various philosophers emphasize or deny the existence of certain features of qualia. Consequently, the nature and existence of various definitions of qualia remain controversial {{in light of the fact}} that the existence of qualia has never been independently and scientifically proven as fact.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{idea that}} a satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by Sir Roger Penrose.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the secularization hypothesis. His argument <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> premise that religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development {{of social and economic}} security in Europe explains its corresponding secularization {{due to a lack of}} need for religion. However, religion continues in the third world where social and economic insecurity are rampant. The overall effect is expected to be a growing cultural disparity.|$|E

The majority of FDI continues to derive from the EU, specifically France. Morocco is also a source of foreign investments. In 2007, it has injected $652 million in projects abroad, which put the kingdom in the third position in Africa.|$|E
25|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the top that is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden door frame consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is a bevel between the outermost frame member and a semi-round molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by strap <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside.|$|E

Jonathan Galassi, {{president and publisher of}} Farrar, Straus & Giroux, described Purity as a multigenerational American epic that spans decades and continents. The story centers on a young woman named Purity Tyler, or Pip, who doesn't know who her father is and sets out to uncover his identity. The narrative stretches from contemporary America to South America to East Germany before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mystery of Pip's family history and her relationship with a charismatic hacker and whistleblower.|$|E
25|$|The chancel {{is of the}} 1856 rebuild and restoration. It is of {{ironstone}} and limestone {{work with}} a Collyweston slate roof. Ashlar {{is used in the}} east wall above the spring of the east window, and in the cornerstones and plinth. Twin stepped diagonal buttresses are at the south-east and north-east corners, with a further angled buttress on the south wall. A moulded plinth runs below windows on the east wall, and on the south wall where at the west, it is broken by a pointed doorway with chamfered opening and hood mould; the door is planked with decorative metal face <b>hinges.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> south side are three windows of identical style and construction, with twin lights and 'Y' tracery set within a chamfered pointed arch. The north side contains two identical plain lancet windows. The chancel east window with hood mould is of three lights with intersecting 'Y' tracery within a double-chamfered surround. Immediately to the east of the east window is a table tomb within iron railings, to Mary Skelton (died 1767).|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E

500|$|Sophus Bugge {{theorized that}} the name Ratatoskr is a loanword from Old English meaning [...] "Rat-tooth." [...] Bugge's basis <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fact that the -toskr element of the {{compound}} does not appear anywhere else in Old Norse. Bugge proposed that the -toskr element is a reformation of the Old English word tūsc (Old Frisian tusk) and, in turn, that the element Rata- represents Old English ræt ("rat").|$|E
500|$|... In [...] view, {{the tribes}} either are {{or are not}} {{separate}} sovereigns, and our federal Indian law cases untenably hold both positions simultaneously." [...] Thomas further questioned the law ending the practice of making treaties with the tribes, noting {{that this was the}} one clear constitutional provision that provides for dealing with other sovereigns. Thomas noted that a delegation of prosecutorial power is always to an executive branch and that the tribes are not part of any executive branch of the Federal government. Therefore, the case <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tribes' inherent sovereignty, and based on precedent, the tribes possess that power.|$|E
