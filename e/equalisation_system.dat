To compensate for their lack of capsize-preventing leverage, they are also allowed to extend the boat's rack outwards, effectively making the boat wider. Conversely, heavier crews will carry fewer weights, but must sail with narrower racks. Thus each team's total weight and leverage is equalised.

Therefore, this paper tests the hypothesis of the ineffectiveness of fiscal <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> in Croatia. The Gini coefficients are used to measure inequalities in fiscal capacities of local government units before and after the application of fiscal equalisation instruments.

40|$|Thesis (LLD (Public Law)) —University of Stellenbosch,In this {{dissertation}} {{a comparative}} study {{is made of}} the constitutional accommodation {{of the distribution of}} financial resources and constitutional obligations to the various spheres of government in Germany and South Africa. Both countries have decentralised or multi-level systems of government and can be classified, in terms of current studies on federalism, as integrated or cooperative federal systems. An overview of the historical developments, the political contexts, the fundamental principles and the constitutional frameworks for government in Germany and South Africa is provided as a basis for the in-depth analysis regarding the financial intergovernmental relations in these countries. This study has shown that economic theory is important in the design of decentralised systems of government and that political and socio-economic considerations, for example, the need for rebuilding Germany after World War II and the need to eliminate severe poverty in South Africa after 1994, often play a dominant role in the design and implementation of decentralised constitutional systems. The economic theory applicable to decentralised systems of government suggests a balanced approach to the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations with a view to obtaining the most efficient and equitable solution. In both countries the particular constitutional allocation of obligations and financial resources created a fiscal gap that required some form of revenue sharing or financial equalisation. The German financial <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> has been developed over fifty years and is quite complex. It attempts to balance the constitutional aim of reasonable equalisation of the financial disparity of the Länder with the financial autonomy of the Länder as required by the Basic Law. The huge financial and economic demands from the eastern Länder after unification in 1990 placed an additional burden on the available funds and on the financial <b>equalisation</b> <b>system.</b> Germany currently faces reform of its financial <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> and possibly also bigger constitutional reform. The South African constitutional system is only a decade old and the financial <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> that is less complex than the German system, is functioning reasonably well but needs time to develop to its full potential. The system may however require some adjustment in order to enhance accountability, efficiency and equity. A lack of sufficient skills and administrative capacity at municipal government level and in some provinces hampers service delivery and good governance and places additional pressure on the financial <b>equalisation</b> <b>system.</b> The Bundesverfassungsgericht and the Constitutional Court play important roles in Germany and South Africa in upholding the principle of constitutional supremacy, and make a valuable contribution to the better understanding of the constitutional systems and the further development thereof. This study has shown that clear principles in constitutional texts, for example, such as those contained in the Basic Law, guide the development of applicable financial legislation and add value to the provisions on financial equalisation and how they are implemented. These principles in the Basic Law are justiciable and give the Bundesverfassungsgericht an important tool to adjudicate the financial equalisation legislation. The study of the constitutional accommodation of the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations in Germany and South Africa is not an abstract academic exercise and should be seen in the particular political and socio-economic contexts within which the respective constitutions function. The need to give effect to the realisation of socio-economic rights, for example, the right of access to health services, places additional demands on the financial <b>equalisation</b> <b>system.</b> The South African society experienced a major transformation from the apartheid system to a democratic constitutional order that in itself has had a significant influence on financial intergovernmental relations. This dissertation focuses on a distinct part of constitutional law that can be described as financial constitutional law. This comparative analysis of the two countries has provided some lessons for the further development of South Africa’s young democracy, in particular the financial intergovernmental relations system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{practical}} single-carrier (SC) {{block transmission}} with frequency domain <b>equalisation</b> (FDE) <b>system</b> can generally be modelled by the Hammerstein system {{that includes the}} nonlinear distortion effects of the high power amplifier (HPA) at transmitter. For such Hammerstein channels, the standard SC-FDE scheme no longer works. We propose a novel B-spline neural network based nonlinear SC-FDE scheme for Hammerstein channels. In particular, we model the nonlinear HPA, which represents the complex-valued static nonlinearity of the Hammerstein channel, by two real-valued B-spline neural networks, one for modelling the nonlinear amplitude response of the HPA {{and the other for}} the nonlinear phase response of the HPA. We then develop an efficient alternating least squares algorithm for estimating the parameters of the Hammerstein channel, including the channel impulse response coefficients and the parameters of the two B-spline models. Moreover, we also use another real-valued B-spline neural network to model the inversion of the HPA’s nonlinear amplitude response, and the parameters of this inverting B-spline model can be estimated using the standard least squares algorithm based on the pseudo training data obtained as a byproduct of the Hammerstein channel identification. Equalisation of the SC Hammerstein channel can then be accomplished by the usual one-tap linear equalisation in frequency domain as well as the inverse B-spline neural network model obtained in time domain. The effectiveness of our nonlinear SC-FDE scheme for Hammerstein channels is demonstrated in a simulation study. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} CSF, {{a general}} equilibrium model encompassing factors of relevance to economic efficiency in Federal/State funding including: interstate differences in tax bases and unit costs of State-provided goods; factor mobility; congestion; State-government behaviour incorporating the possibility that governments in subsidised States embark on expenditures with low benefit/cost ratios (flypaper effects); fiscal externalities; and non-discretionary expenditures in each State associated with special national responsibilities. The model is applied to Australia where Federal/State funding is a major political and economic issue. Welfare effects of moving from the present Australian funding system based on fiscal <b>equalisation</b> to a <b>system</b> of equal-per-capita grants are calculated. CSF implies that the welfare gain from this move would be small. The most important source of potential welfare gain is a reduction in flypaper effects. The recognition of congestion externalities can eliminate the small welfare gain, but only under seemingly extreme assumptions. The results are not very sensitive to variations in assumptions concerning population mobility and fiscal externalities. ...|$|R

40|$|Provision {{for risk}} {{equalisation}} was first {{made in the}} Health Insurance Act, 1994, section 12 of which empowered the Minister to prescribe a scheme for risk equalisation. A Risk Equalsiation Scheme was introduced in 2003. In December 2005, the Minister decided, on the Authority’s recommendation, which referred to risks now materialising, to commence risk equalisation payments under the Scheme as from 1 January 2006, but in the event the relevant legislation was overturned by the Courts in 2008. Since 1994, {{there have been a}} number of studies and reports in relation to risk equalisation in Ireland. As such, the issue of risk equalisation has been the subject of extensive analysis and debate over many years.

40|$|A {{method for}} the design of {{arbitrary}} minimum or linear phase FIR filters is developed for audio applications by using the Tuneable Approximate Piecewise Linear Regression (TAPLR) method to smooth the required FIR magnitude frequency response from a prototype Bode plot model. The TAPLR method incorporates a set of contiguous piecewise linear (affine) sections, which are coupled and smoothed by a single tuning parameter associated with a set of amplitude weighted Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) assigned to each linear section. The Bode plot also consists of a set of contiguous linear asymptotes plotted on a log-log scale, which makes it a perfect candidate for modelling and smoothing by the TAPLR method. The TAPLR smoothing turns the artificial asymptotic magnitude plot into a realisable magnitude response curve, which can be made to be band-limited with a finite impulse response by the appropriate degree of smoothing. A typical FIR filter design example for audio <b>system</b> <b>equalisation</b> is provided to show the value and versatility of the method.

40|$|Receiving {{satellite}} signals indoors gains {{importance in}} research and industry. Especially for positioning applications using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) a rising market can be observed. Low cost navigation receivers are currently capable of tracking the Global Positioning System (GPS) C/A signal down to a power of − 159 dBm without the need of assistance. But position errors due to signal blocking, diffraction and reflection make indoor navigation with an accuracy of 1 − 2 m still impossible. To mitigate errors introduced by the wireless propagation channel by <b>equalisation</b> for communication <b>systems</b> or improved time of arrival estimation for GNSS receivers, channel propagation characteristics need to be known to aid the design process for algorithms and receivers. One possible approach to gain knowledge about the propagation channel is to perform channel sounder measurements. In such a measurement campaign the transmit signal is known to the receiver and the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) can be estimated straightforward. Because a measurement is affected by all details of the real propagation medium, channel sounder measurements for the satellite navigation multipath channel are substantially needed. For GNSS application the L-band is of most interest, where almost all GNSS based navigation signals are operating. Therefore the frequency band is crowded, which motivates investigations in other frequency bands. Currently the European Space Agency (ESA) explores the possibility of satellites-to earth transmissions operating at 5 GHz. To obtain insights into the wireless propagation channel at L and C-band the German Aerospace Center (DLR) conducted channel sounder measurements at center frequency of 1. 51 GHz (L-band) {{as well as at}} 5. 2 GHz (C-band).
