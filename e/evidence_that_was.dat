5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

In April 1783, he sent {{an account of the}} {{massacre}} to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had asked to see <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> critical of the slave trade. The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.|$|E

Thus, the appeals court reversed the district court's order suppressing the <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> found as the fruit of Willman's illegal, but private, search.

Luang Por Dhammajayo had fallen ill and was hospitalized with throat and lung infections. In the 2000s, the controversies gradually lost the interest of the public, as the news focused on other topics, although in 2002 a fifth charge against the abbot was added to the list. The trials proceeded slowly, as the hearings were postponed because of <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not ready, and because of the abbot's illness.|$|E

Such was the level of public and media interest {{in the outcome of}} the case, on 13 September 2007 the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament took the unusual step of allowing the then Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, to address parliament on the matter. The Lord Advocate read a prepared statement to the chamber setting out the narrative of the Crown case and explaining her reasoning for deciding to prosecute. She is recorded in the official transcript of her address as saying that she was 'disappointed' with the result, and that she 'was of the clear opinion that the <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> made available to the court was sufficient to put before the jury to allow it the opportunity to decide on the case against Sinclair'.|$|E

25|$|On 16 January 2007, a {{criminal}} investigation was initiated against Olmert. The investigation focused on suspicions that during his tenure as finance minister, Olmert tried to steer the tender {{for the sale of}} Bank Leumi in order to help Slovak-born Australian real estate baron Frank Lowy, a close personal associate. Israeli Finance Ministry Accountant General Dr. Yaron Zelekha was as a key witness, according to the State Comptroller's office. The state comptroller testified against Olmert. Israeli Police who investigated the case eventually concluded that the <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> collected was insufficient for indictment, and no recommendations were made to press charges. In October 2007, he was questioned for five hours by three officers from the National Fraud Investigations Unit in his Jerusalem residence. State Prosecutor Moshe Lador closed the case in December 2008 due to lack of evidence.|$|E
25|$|The Tribune {{confirmed}} that {{the judge in the}} Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. However, the paper also examined court documents detailing the <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One of the items listed was a laboratory blood test which concluded with over 99 percent certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying that same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone. According to the Tribune, Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case regarding the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.|$|E

Though police had previously searched over half the 1,754-acre main section of the park (2.74mi2, 7.10km2), the wooded slope where Levy's remains were eventually found had not been searched. Police commanders ordered the search perimeters to 100 yards of each road and trail but a miscommunication had the officers only searching within 100 yards of every road. The remains were found about four miles [...] (6km) from Levy's apartment.|$|E
