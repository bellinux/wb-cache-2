Streibel was traded by the Wings to the New York Saints in February 2003. He never {{appeared in a}} game for the Saints. Striebel has also played professional soccer for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1881 and the fall of 1882, {{geologist}} Israel Russell studied the area as a side-trip during <b>his</b> <b>field</b> research of Lake Lahontan, a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last glacial period. His Quaternary History of the Mono Valley (1889), which included a topographic survey by Willard D. Johnson, was the first thorough scientific description of Mono Lake and its volcanic features.|$|E
5|$|Ross's biggest {{contribution}} to <b>his</b> <b>field</b> was not through his research, but through his mathematics education programs.

5|$|A {{few days}} afterwards, Blamey became seriously ill and {{received}} <b>his</b> <b>field</b> marshal's baton from McKell in a bedside {{ceremony at the}} Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. Blamey died there of hypertensive cerebral haemorrhage on 27 May 1951. His body lay in state at the Shrine of Remembrance, where 20,000 people filed past. Crowds estimated at 300,000 lined the streets of Melbourne at his state funeral. Ten of his lieutenant generals served as pallbearers: Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, John Northcott, Sydney Rowell, Stanley Savige, Vernon Sturdee and Henry Wells. His body was cremated at the Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|After he had {{realized}} {{the validity of}} this geometric analogy, it took Einstein a further three years to find the missing cornerstone of his theory: the equations describing how matter influences spacetime's curvature. Having formulated what are now known as Einstein's equations (or, more precisely, <b>his</b> <b>field</b> equations of gravity), he presented his new theory of gravity at several sessions of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in late 1915, culminating in his final presentation on November 25, 1915.|$|E

5|$|Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell {{completed}} 11 of 16 {{passes for}} 189yards, one touchdown, and one interception, {{and was named}} the game's most valuable player. Despite his performance, he was neither the leading scorer on his team nor the overall best performer in the game. Auburn kicker John Vaughn was successful on all three of <b>his</b> <b>field</b> goal attempts and also succeeded on his sole extra point kick in the game, resulting in 10Auburn points. On {{the opposite side of}} the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall completed 21 of his 38passes for 299yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. Virginia Tech kicker Branden Pace missed his sole field goal attempt of the game, a 23-yard kick.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge ordered <b>his</b> <b>field</b> {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Good {{also made}} a {{separate}} seed collection, which included B.coccinea, and the species was drawn by Bauer. Like nearly all of Bauer's field drawings of Proteaceae, the original field sketch of B.coccinea was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945. However a watercolour painting by Bauer, based on <b>his</b> <b>field</b> sketches, still survives at the Natural History Museum in London, and a hand-coloured copper engraving from that painting was published as Plate 3 of Bauer's 1813 Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae. German botanist Adalbert Schnizlein described B.purpurea in 1843, now regarded as a synonym of B.coccinea. Common names include scarlet banksia, waratah banksia and Albany banksia.|$|E

5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but it seems to happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing <b>his</b> <b>field</b> test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|He {{abandoned}} {{the study of}} medicine and changed to English, history, and theology. Because he switched <b>his</b> <b>field,</b> however, he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees. He received a government bursary, and his family also donated money– his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home {{from his job as}} a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies. From its inception, the university had a strong Arts faculty; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni. These include Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, poet and playwright John Pepper Clark, and poet Christopher Okigbo. Elechi Amadi is also another famous writer who studied at the university in the 1950s, although he was in the faculty of sciences.|$|E

5|$|Nowitzki is a {{versatile}} frontcourt player who mostly plays the power forward position, but has also played center and small forward throughout his career. An exceptional shooter for his size, Nowitzki has made 88% of his free throws, nearly 50% of <b>his</b> <b>field</b> goal attempts and nearly 40% of his 3-point shots, {{and won the}} 2006 NBA All-Star Three-Point Shootout competition. In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} task which Gaudí faced, not {{in terms}} of the number of works, but in terms of their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen. Gaudí always led the way, but allowed expression of the individual abilities of all of his collaborators. A test of his expertise both in <b>his</b> <b>field</b> and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.|$|E
5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} in <b>his</b> <b>field</b> {{for his work}} at the Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E

5|$|Alfred P. Maudslay visited Iximche in 1887 and {{referred}} to it both as Patinamit and Iximche. He carried out a site survey and published a plan of the ruins. Robert Wauchope carried out a ceramic study of Iximche in the 1940s {{on behalf of the}} Middle American Research Institute of Tulane University and published his work in 19481949. Historian Janos de Szecsy began excavations at the ruins in January 1956. The remains of the city were excavated by Swiss-Guatemalan archaeologist George (Jorge) Guillemín from 1959-1972. Guillemín published his work in 1959, 1967 and 1969. The excavation and restoration of the ruins was funded by the Guatemalan Committee for Reconstruction of National Monuments until July 1961, after 1963 the investigations were funded by the Swiss National Foundation for Scientific Research. Guillemín died before his investigations could be completed and his full report published. <b>His</b> <b>field</b> notes were finally published in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Blamey is honoured in Australia {{in various}} ways, {{including}} a square {{named after him}} which is situated outside the Russell Offices headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and Department of Defence in the national capital, Canberra. A statue of Blamey stands in Kings Domain, Melbourne, {{on the corner of}} Government House Drive and Birdwood Avenue, opposite that of John Monash. It was sculptured from granite and bronze by Raymond B. Ewers and presented to the city in February 1960. Controversially, Blamey is mounted on a jeep instead of the traditional horse. Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, where the Army Recruit Training Centre is located, is also named in his honour, as is Blamey Street and Blamey Park in North Ryde, New South Wales. His papers are held in the Australian War Memorial, where <b>his</b> <b>field</b> marshal's baton is on display.|$|E
