40|$|ObjectiveTotal arch {{replacement}} with an <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> is {{a standard}} treatment for arch aneurysm, but serious complications, such as paraplegia and peripheral embolization caused by flapping of the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk,</b> remain. Moreover, dilation of the descending aorta and retrograde flow into the peri-graft space at the distal <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> are frequent problems. We hypothesized that optimal graft diameter and location would reduce complications after total arch replacement with a long <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> by achieving complete thrombosis and minimal dilation of the descending aorta around the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk.</b> MethodsWe treated 65 patients with arch aneurysm by total arch replacement with a long <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> anastomosed {{at the base of}} the innominate artery. The graft diameter was undersized (10 %– 20 % of the distal aorta’s diameter). <b>Elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> length was determined by preoperative computed tomography to locate the distal end at Th 6 to Th 8. Thrombosis around the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk,</b> diameter of the descending aorta, and distance between the descending aorta and the graft near the distal end of the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> were evaluated using computed tomography. ResultsThe distal end of the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> was located at Th 8 ± 1. There were no operative deaths, 3 patients (5 %) died in the hospital, and 3 patients (5 %) experienced spinal cord injury, including 1 in whom permanent paraplegia developed. Computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis around the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> in 58 patients (89 %). The descending aorta did not dilate further, and distance between the descending aorta and the graft progressively decreased.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> {{technique}} for aortic dissection {{is useful for}} reducing false lumen pressure; however, a folded vascular prosthesis inside the aorta can cause haemolysis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether an <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> in a small-calibre lumen can cause haemolysis. METHODS: Inpatient and outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Two cases of haemolytic anaemia after aortic surgery using the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> technique were identified from 2011 to 2013. A 64 -year-old man, who underwent graft replacement of the ascending aorta for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection, presented with en-largement of the chronic dissection of the descending aorta and moderate aortic regurgitation. A two-stage surgery was scheduled. Total arch replacement with an <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> in the true lumen and concomitant aortic valve replacement were performed. Postoperatively, he developed severe haemolytic anaemia because of the folded <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk.</b> The anaemia improved after the second surgery, including graft replacement of the descending aorta. Similarly, a 61 -year-old man, who underwent total arch replacement for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection, presented with enlargement of the chronic dissection of the descending aorta. Graft replacement of the descending aorta with an <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> inserted into the true lumen was performed.

40|$|ObjectivesThe <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> {{method was}} {{introduced}} to treat aortic disease. There {{are a variety of}} modified <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> methods, including the stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk.</b> We retrospectively reviewed our experience and evaluated the effectiveness of surgical treatment for acute aortic dissection using the Chinese CRONUS stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> technique. MethodsFrom August 2005 to December 2012, 252 patients with acute aortic dissection underwent surgical treatment using the Chinese CRONUS stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> technique at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We review the characteristics of the patients, the surgical method, and the prognosis. Furthermore, we modified the stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> technique to simplify the surgical procedure using stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> fenestration in 81 patients. ResultsThe procedure was technically successful in all patients. The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial ischemia, and circulatory arrest was 158 ± 34 minutes, 98 ± 24 minutes, and 27 ± 9 minutes, respectively. The mean stay {{in the intensive care unit}} was 74 ± 11 hours. The in-hospital mortality rate was 3. 2 % (8 / 252). A 92. 2 % (225 / 244) follow-up rate was achieved. Five patients died during follow-up. The diameter of the descending aorta significantly decreased in 173 patients (78. 6 %), did not change 39 patients (17. 7 %), and dilated in 8 patients (3. 7 %). ConclusionsIn surgery for acute aortic dissection, the Chinese CRONUS stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> technique had a low prevalence of morbidity and mortality in our patients. The satisfactory effects demonstrated that the technique is safe and effective in closing the residual false lumen of the descending aorta.

40|$|ObjectivesSpinal {{cord injury}} in {{patients}} undergoing total arch replacement via median sternotomy {{is a rare}} but catastrophic complication. With recent surgical advances, including the long <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> technique or open stent procedure, the incidence of spinal cord injury is increasing. In our institute, the long <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> procedure is routinely performed when appropriate to the patient’s status. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} risk factors for spinal cord injury during total arch replacement. MethodsSince April 2004, 61 patients underwent total arch replacement with a 4 -branched prosthetic graft. The study population included 44 men and 17 women (mean age, 69. 8 ± 11. 1 years). Thirty-three patients underwent the long <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> procedure with a mean length of 12. 0 ± 3. 5 cm (range, 7 - 21. 6 cm). The Adamkiewicz artery was detected by computed tomography in 11 patients. We assessed the perioperative factors associated with spinal cord injury. ResultsFour (6. 6 %) patients had spinal cord injury (3 cases of paraplegia and 1 case of paraparesis). This constitutes 12 % of all patients having the long <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> procedure. No patients with direct distal anastomosis had a spinal cord injury. Univariate logistic regression analysis identified female gender, <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> more than 10 cm from the left subclavian artery, and nonpreserved Adamkiewicz artery as significant independent risk factors for spinal cord injury. Both female gender (P = . 017) and long <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> (P = . 005) were significant by multivariate analysis. ConclusionsElephant trunk more than 10 cm from the left subclavian artery was associated with increased risk of spinal cord injury.

MethodsFrom January 2006 to December 2011, 197 {{patients with}} acute type I aortic dissection were identified without an intimal tear in the arch. Of the 197 patients, 71 underwent hemiarch replacement with stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> implantation (hemiarch group) and 84 underwent ascending aorta and total arch replacement with stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> implantation (total arch group). ResultsThe incidence of postoperative transient neurologic dysfunction, low cardiac output syndrome, and prolonged ventilation was lower in the hemiarch group (P . 05). The risk of an aortic event was similar for both groups (P = . 62). ConclusionsFor patients with acute DeBakey type I dissection without an intimal tear in the arch, hemiarch replacement with stented <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> implantation was easily performed, with satisfactory early and midterm outcomes.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> {{technique}} with a free-floating {{vascular prosthesis}} was originally developed {{to facilitate a}} subsequent operation on the downstream aorta. We present here our experience with further developments of this technique, which we call the reversed <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> and bidirectional <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk.</b> Methods: Between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2000, 505 adult and adolescent patients underwent operations of the thoracic aorta. A reversed <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> procedure in 13 patients and a bidirectional <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> procedure in 4 patients was performed to facilitate either subsequent proximal or proximal and distal aortic replacement. Nine patients underwent subsequent aortic arch replacement with the reversed prosthetic portion after a mean interval of 8 ± 5. 5 months, and 2 patients received distal extension by use of the distal portion of the free-floating graft. Results: There was no hospital mortality (30 days) in this small group of patients, and no patient had aortic rupture, malperfusion caused by the technique itself, or thromboembolic complications during the waiting interval {{between the first and}} the second operations. Five patients are still being observed until the contiguous aortic size is large enough to require an operation, and one 74 -year-old patient declined a second-stage operation. Conclusion: The reversed and bidirectional <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> techniques are interesting options that may be suitable for patients having complex abnormalities of the thoracic aorta and thoracoabdominal aorta when the proximal portion of the descending aorta has to be replaced before the aortic arch with or without the ascending aorta or the distal descending aorta with or without the thoracoabdominal aorta...|$|R

50|$|Other {{vertebrates}} sometimes utilize {{a modified}} hydrostatic skeleton called a muscular hydrostat. Muscular hydrostats {{do not contain}} a fluid-filled cavity. These structures are constructed of muscle and connective fibers, densely packed into a 3-D structure. In many cases, the muscular hydrostat can be manipulated in all three dimensions. This allows for more precise movement compared to a typical hydrostatic skeleton. While in typical hydrostatic skeletons, movement is generated by applying force to a fluid-filled cavity, muscular hydrostats generate movement by muscle contractions. When one muscle contracts and decreases in area, other muscles within the structure must expand in response. Helical muscles may be present, which can create torsion, an ability that is restricted in hydrostatic skeletons. Muscular hydrostats are found in mammalian, reptilian, and amphibian tongues. Mammalian tongues have {{the structure of a}} central core of muscle fibers surrounded by bundles of longitudinal muscles and alternating parallel sheets of transverse muscle fibers. <b>Elephant</b> <b>trunks</b> and tapir proboscises also utilize a muscular hydrostat.

40|$|Background—Although a staged <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> {{procedure}} {{has been}} widely used, the early mortality of the first stage operation {{as well as the}} interval mortality between operations remains unsatisfactory. We developed an alternative <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> procedure to reduce mortality and morbidity. Methods and Results—Ascending aorta and arch vessels were minimally dissected. During systemic cooling, a four-branched arch graft with a sewing “collar ” and a long “elephant trunk ” was prepared. The ascending aorta was opened under selective brain perfusion with moderate hypothermia (25 °C), and the <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> was then pulled down into the descending aorta using the catching catheter introduced via a femoral artery. The <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk</b> anastomosis using the collar was made {{at the base of the}} innominate artery.
