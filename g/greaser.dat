Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles {{on the walls and}} floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, a Conquistador who searched for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there.|$|E

50|$|The weak {{structural}} {{foundation of the}} <b>greasers</b> {{can be attributed to}} the subculture's origins in working-class youth with few economic resources with which they could participate in American consumerism. <b>Greasers,</b> unlike motorcyclists, did not explicitly have their own interest clubs or publications. As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group. Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly-dressed individuals. Some <b>greasers</b> were in motorcycle clubs or in gangs (and some gang members and bikers dressed like <b>greasers)</b> though this was not an inherent principle of the subculture.|$|R

5000|$|Ethnically, {{original}} <b>greasers</b> {{were mostly}} composed of mostly Italian Americans in the Northeastern United States and Chicanos in the Southwest. Since {{these people were}} mostly olive-skinned, the [...] "greaser" [...] label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban lower class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor Italian Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City in the 1950s and 1960s. <b>Greasers</b> were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating sexual violence, stoking fear among middle class males and arousal among middle class females. <b>Greasers</b> were also heavily associated with the culture surrounding rock n' roll, a musical genre which had induced feelings of a moral panic among older, middle class generations. To many of them, <b>greasers</b> epitomized the connection between rock music and juvenile delinquency professed by several important social and cultural observers at the time.|$|R

25|$|Engineer boots, {{also known}} as engineer's boots or {{engineering}} boots, are an American type of leather boots. Their lace-less, rugged construction has made them popular among motorcycle riders. Originally developed in the 1930s for firemen working on steam locomotives, the boots gained substantial popularity in the post–World War II era among a burgeoning motorcycling culture. They became popular symbols of teenage rebellion in the 1950s and a common component of <b>greaser</b> wear. They were later adopted by skinheads and punks in the 1970s. By the 2010s, engineer boots were being popularly worn for fashion purposes, especially by non-traditional customers such as women, young urban professionals, and hipsters.|$|E

On the February 2 episode of SmackDown!, they defeated WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a non-title match. They earned a chance at the championship at No Way Out, but failed to win the title. On the April 13 episode of SmackDown!, Deuce and Domino got a chance at the tag titles again, but lost after Deuce got them disqualified. The next week on SmackDown!, they defeated London and Kendrick to win the tag team titles. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown!, London and Kendrick competed against William Regal and Dave Taylor, but Deuce and Domino interfered, resulting in Regal and Taylor being disqualified. This made both teams the number one contender, {{which led to a}} triple threat tag match the next week where Deuce and Domino retained the titles. On June 24, Deuce and Domino issued an open challenge at the pay-per-view event, , which was accepted by Jimmy Snuka (Deuce's father) and Sgt. Slaughter. Deuce and Domino retained their title.|$|E
500|$|Shia LaBeouf plays Mutt Williams/Henry Jones III, Indiana's sidekick and son. The {{concept of}} Indiana Jones having {{offspring}} {{was introduced in}} The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles; in the episode [...] "Princeton, February 1916", Indy and {{his high school sweetheart}} discuss having a child and naming him [...] "Henry Jones III." [...] (This scene was deleted from the VHS and DVD releases.); additionally, in several episodes, an elderly Indy is shown to have a daughter. During the film's development, the latter was incorporated into Frank Darabont's script, with Indiana and Marion having a 13-year-old daughter. Spielberg found this too similar to , so a son was created instead. Koepp credited the character's creation to Jeff Nathanson and Lucas. Koepp wanted to make Mutt more academic, but Lucas likened Mutt to Marlon Brando's character in The Wild One: [...] "he needs to be what Indiana Jones' father thought of – the curse returns in the form of his own son– he's everything a father can't stand." [...] LaBeouf was Spielberg's first choice for the role, having been impressed by his performance in Holes. Excited at the prospect of being in an Indiana Jones film, LaBeouf agreed without reading the script and did not know what character he would play. He later gained fifteen pounds of muscle for the role, and also repeatedly watched the other films to acquire character. LaBeouf also watched Blackboard Jungle, Rebel Without a Cause, and The Wild One to develop his character's personality, copying mannerisms and words including the use of a switchblade as a weapon. Lucas also consulted on the <b>greaser</b> look, joking that LaBeouf was [...] "sent to the American Graffiti school of greaserland." [...] LaBeouf pulled his rotator cuff when filming Mutt's duel with Spalko; an injury that worsened throughout filming. He later pulled his groin.|$|E
