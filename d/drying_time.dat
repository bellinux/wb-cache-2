5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaporation}} of picoliter {{water and}} ethanol droplets generated by drop-on-demand inkjet printing was investigated on substrates with apparent contact angles between 10 ∘ and 135 ∘ and thermal conductivities between 0. 25 and 149 Wm− 1 K− 1. <b>Drying</b> <b>times</b> were calculated from a diffusion-limited model for droplets with both pinned and moving contact lines {{as a function}} of droplet diameter and apparent contact angle. Droplets with a moving contact line take longer to dry on hydrophilic substrates than pinned droplets. The difference in <b>drying</b> <b>times</b> between evaporative modes vanishes at large apparent contact angles. Hence similar <b>drying</b> <b>times</b> are obtained for both modes on hydrophobic substrates. The predicted <b>drying</b> <b>times</b> for glass and silicon substrates were in good quantitative agreement with experimental data, suggesting that thermal effects are negligible for substrates of these base materials. However, on a PTFE substrate which has a lower thermal conductivity more relevant to inkjet printing, evaporative cooling reduces the evaporation rate causing <b>drying</b> <b>times</b> to be underpredicted by isothermal models...|$|R

These waterproof covers allow for bathing and showering while wearing either a plaster or fiberglass cast. The waterproof cast cover stays tightly around the cast and prevents water from ever reaching it while the patient is in contact with water. The cover can easily be removed to dry, and can be re-used often.|$|E
25|$|NASCAR {{restructured}} {{the penalties}} and appeals system allowing penalties {{to be more}} consistent. The appeals process also makes NASCAR's basis for issuing the penalty public at the first appeal instead of the last. Minor changes {{were made to the}} Gen-6 race car. Rules on ride height were loosened, and the top of the rear spoiler is now made of clear material to give drivers more visibility. After a six-hour delay at the first Chase race in 2013 at Chicagoland, NASCAR will now make the Air Titan available at all Sprint Cup Series races and accompanying races at no extra charge. The Air Titan has also been improved to Air Titan 2.0 shortening track <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> even further.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} {{method was}} introduced by Louis Seutin, (1793–1865) of Brussels. In 1815 Seutin {{had served in the}} allied armies in the war against Napoleon and was on the field of Waterloo. At the time of the development of his bandage he was chief surgeon in the Belgium army. Seutin’s “bandage amidonnee” consisted of cardboard splints and bandages soaked in a solution of starch and applied wet. These dressings required 2 to 3 days to dry, depending on the temperature and humidity of the surroundings. The substitution of Dextrin for starch, advocated by Velpeau, the man widely regarded as the leading French surgeon {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century, reduced the <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> to 6 hours. Although this was a vast improvement, it was still a long time, especially in the harsh environment of the battlefield.|$|E

40|$|Summary A {{system was}} {{developed}} for grouping tropical wood species for kiln drying based on similar estimated <b>drying</b> <b>times.</b> Six tropical species were subjected to drying and water soaking tests; variables were test temperature and specimen thickness. Soaking time, specimen thickness, and test temperature were used in an empirical model to predict <b>drying</b> <b>times.</b> The capability of the model to predict <b>drying</b> <b>times</b> was considered acceptable based on an adjusted coefficient of determination equal to 0. 929 and an average error of 14 percent. The overall capability of the method proposed for grouping tropical hardwoods for drying is considered promising and worthy of further investigation...|$|R

25|$|Van Eyck {{used the}} {{technique}} of applying layer after layer of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world. Van Eyck {{took advantage of the}} longer <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.|$|E
25|$|When {{the pasta}} leaves the dies {{it has the}} {{moisture}} content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried pasta is about 12% which helps the pasta to be hard and retain its shape and have a long storage life. Drying process is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, pasta is exposed to hot air to lose the excess moisture in two stages. “Pre-drying” starts immediately after extrusion where the pasta hardens on the outside but still soft on the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole <b>drying</b> <b>time,</b> and {{one third of the}} excess moisture is lost in this stage. “Final drying” removes most of the moisture and gives the pasta a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing help the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through the pasta and prevents cracking.|$|E
25|$|Air {{circulation}} rate: <b>Drying</b> <b>time</b> {{and timber}} quality {{depend on the}} air velocity and its uniform circulation. At a constant temperature and relative humidity, the highest possible drying rate is obtained by rapid circulation of air {{across the surface of}} wood, giving rapid removal of moisture evaporating from the wood. However, a higher drying rate is not always desirable, particularly for impermeable hardwoods, because higher drying rates develop greater stresses that may cause the timber to crack or distort. At very low fan speeds, less than 1m/s, the air flow through the stack is often laminar flow, and the heat transfer between the timber surface and the moving air stream is not particularly effective (Walker et al., 1993). The low effectiveness (externally) of heat transfer is not necessarily a problem if internal moisture movement is the key limitation to the movement of moisture, as it is for most hardwoods (Pordage and Langrish, 1999).|$|E

2500|$|The {{benefits}} of ultrasonic welding {{are that it}} is much faster than conventional adhesives or solvents. [...] The <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> is very quick, and the pieces {{do not need to}} remain in a jig {{for long periods of time}} waiting for the joint to dry or cure. [...] The welding can easily be automated, making clean and precise joints; the site of the weld is very clean and rarely requires any touch-up work. The low thermal impact on the materials involved enables a greater number of materials to be welded together.|$|E
2500|$|By 1918, {{half of all}} cars in America were Model T's. All {{new cars}} were black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Any {{customer}} can have a car painted any color that he wants {{so long as it}} is black". Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker <b>drying</b> <b>time,</b> Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908).|$|E
2500|$|The fish is {{prepared}} immediately after capture. After gutting the fish, {{it is either}} dried whole, or split along the spine leaving the tail connected. [...] The fish is hung on the hjell from February to May. Stable cool weather protects the fish from insects and prevents an uncontrolled bacterial growth. A temperature just above zero degrees Celsius, with little rain, is ideal. Too much frost will spoil the fish, as ice destroys the fibers in the fish. The climate in northern Norway is excellent for stockfish production. Due to the stable conditions, the stockfish produced in Lofoten and Vesterålen {{is regarded as the}} best. The traditional cod harvest in Lofoten also takes place during the best <b>drying</b> <b>time.</b> Due to a milder and more humid climate, salted/dried whitefish (klippfisk) was more common in the fisheries districts of Western Norway.|$|E

Jackson's life experience (for example his military service, and his peaceful dealings with Indians) was welcomed. [...] The weight of the glass plates and the portable darkroom limited the number of possible exposures on any one trip, and these images were taken in primitive, roadless, and physically challenging conditions. [...] Once when the mule lost its footing, Jackson lost a month's work, having to return to untracked Rocky Mountain landscapes to remake the pictures, one of which was his celebrated view of the Mount of the Holy Cross.|$|E
2500|$|In {{more modern}} applications, {{microbial}} cellulose has become relevant {{in the medical}} sector. [...] It [...] has been tested and successfully used as a wound dressing, especially in burn cases. [...] Studies have shown that burns treated with microbial cellulose coverings healed faster than traditional treatments and had less scarring. [...] The microbial cellulose topical applications are effective due to the cellulose's water holding ability and water vapor permeability. [...] The high water holding ability provides a moist atmosphere at the injury site, which is critical in healing, while the wicking ability allows seepage from the wound {{to be removed from}} the site. [...] Also, the microbial cellulose molds very well {{to the surface of the}} skin, providing a conformal covering even in usually difficult places to dress wounds, such as areas on the face. [...] This technique has been so successful that commercial microbial cellulose products, such as Biofill ®, have been developed. [...] Another microbial cellulose commercial treatment product is XCell produced by the Xylos Corporation, which is mainly used to treat wounds from venous ulcers. [...] Studies have also been performed where traditional gauze dressings are treated with a microbial cellulose biopolymer to enhance the properties of the gauze. [...] In addition to increasing the <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> and water holding abilities, liquid medicines were able to be absorbed by the microbial cellulose coated gauze, allowing them to work at the injury site.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra {{can be made}} by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying system [...] is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce <b>drying</b> <b>time.</b> In hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. [...] Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. [...] After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). [...] Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. [...] This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun. [...] In India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. [...] Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. [...] Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. [...] The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intracanal}} anti-inflammatory medicaments on external root resorption of replanted dog teeth after extended extra-oral <b>dry</b> <b>time</b> The prognosis of replanted teeth depends on several factors, {{the most important}} being the length of extra-oral <b>dry</b> <b>time</b> (1, 2). Studies show that after 60 min <b>dry</b> <b>time,</b> {{the viability of the}} periodontal ligament cells is almost zero, thus external root resorption is predicted (2). The first reaction after replantation of a tooth with a damaged root surface is inflammation, which includes osteoclast-mediated root resorption in proportion to the initial damage (3). If the initial damage is small, aswhen anavulsed tooth is replanted immediately, and no additional inflammatory stimulus is present, the damaged root surfacewill healwith cementum (Favorable healing) (4, 5). On the other hand, if the damaged area is large, or additional inflammatory stimulus is present as after extended <b>dry</b> <b>time,</b> direct bone to root fusion (ankylosis) or osseous replacement will take place (4, 5). Thus, if we can minimize or shut down the initial inflammatory response, we will minimize the size of the damaged root and therefore promote favorable (rather than unfavorable) healing (3) ...|$|R
