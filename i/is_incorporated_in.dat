5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it <b>is</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in {{roughly the same}} proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
