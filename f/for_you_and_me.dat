500|$|... "Lighters" [...] {{is mainly}} an {{alternative}} hip hop track. [...] It {{has also been}} described as a blend of rap/hip-hop and pop, further incorporating parts of a synth ballad. The record differs from the hardcore hip hop style used in other songs by Bad Meets Evil in the EP, as it takes influences from synthpop ballad and soul music, mainly on the track's chorus. The song opens with piano chords while Mars sings with his [...] "warm" [...] and [...] "pleasing" [...] vocals in a tenor tone on top of a pop and soul chorus, [...] "This one's <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> living out our dreams". The singer finishes his verse saying, [...] "All I want to see is a sky full of lighters". Afterwards, the bass drops along with synth chords and Eminem starts to rap with his [...] "crescendos build up to fist-pumping levels", [...] being followed by Royce.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his acting career, David Carradine was a musician. He sang and played the piano, the guitar and the flute among other instruments. In 1970, Carradine played one half of a flower power beatnik duo in the season 4 Ironside episode [...] "The Quincunx," [...] performing the songs [...] "I Stepped on a Flower," [...] "Lonesome Stranger," [...] and [...] "Sorrow of the Singing Tree." [...] He recorded an album titled Grasshopper, which was released in 1975. His musical talents were often integrated into his screen performances. [...] He performed several of Woody Guthrie's songs for the movie Bound for Glory. For the Kung Fu series he made flutes out of bamboo that he had planted on the Warner Brothers lot which he played on the program. [...] He later made several flutes for the movie Circle of Iron, one of which he later played in Kill Bill. Carradine wrote and performed the theme songs {{for at least two}} movies that he starred in, Americana and Sonny Boy. The first line from the Sonny Boy theme, [...] "Paint", which he wrote while filming Americana in Drury, Kansas, in 1973, is engraved on his headstone. He wrote and performed several songs for American Reel (2003) and wrote the score <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me.</b> He and his brother, Robert, also performed with a band, the Cosmic Rescue Team (also known as Soul Dogs).

2500|$|Thiers {{proposed}} a new cabinet, but de Broglie {{and the right}} wing objected that the new government was not conservative enough. A debate and vote of confidence in his government was scheduled for 23 May. The diplomatic corps was in the audience, along with the Thiers family, and Marshal MacMahon, in civilian clothes. De Broglie began the debate, warning that the country needed a firm government of the right because without it the radical party, which had never repudiated the Commune, would win. [...] "Posterity is merciless", he said, [...] "to governments and ministers who by weakness surrender to the enemy the laws and societies they are charged to defend." [...] Under the new rules of the Assembly, Thiers, as President, {{was not allowed to}} respond directly {{on the floor of the}} Assembly. However, he demanded and received the right to reply. He spoke emotionally at length, explaining that he, a longtime supporter of the monarchy, had decided that, [...] "considering the way of things today in the civilized world, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> in practice a monarchy is absolutely impossible." [...] He described accomplishments and policies, and concluded, [...] "What I am describing is a policy of conservatism; the path of our policy is the policy between two extremes." [...] The Assembly then voted, resulting in a declaration of no confidence in the Thiers government by a vote of 362 to 348. The next day, on 24 May, Thiers submitted his resignation as President. The same day, the Assembly voted to replace Thiers with Marshal MacMahon. De Broglie became the head of the new President's council of ministers. De Broglie proclaimed that the new government's priorities would be [...] "to prevent the he invasion of the radical element", and [...] "to strengthen the base of the social order." ...|$|E
