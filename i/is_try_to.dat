[...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can do about that as a band. All we can do <b>is</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E

[...] What the government can do is work to protect cultural exports where they flourish, by utilizing trade agreements or gaining access for foreign telecommunication networks.|$|E
