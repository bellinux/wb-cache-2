Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 52). In the age of modern civilization bank is playing a vigorous characterby its spending role to keep the economic development wheel moving. It’s a combination of various economic activities those are meting out not only inside of the bank but also with some external operations. In fact there is hardly some aspects of development activity to inspire the state where bank do not have role to play. Standard Bank Limited is a third generation bank in Bangladesh. Standard Bank has incorporated on May 11, 1999 in head office at 122 - 124 Motijheel,Chamber building, Dhaka, Bangladesh as a public limited company {{with the permission of}} the Bangladesh Bank. The founder of SBL committed with the goal that “setting a new standard of banking”. The Authorized capital of the bank is BDT 15000 (million) and its Shareholders equity is BDT 9289 (million) in 2013. The bank provides a broad range of financial services to its customers and corporate clients in retail banking, corporate banking, and international trade. The whole banking activities are divided into 3 parts,General banking, Loan & Advances and <b>Foreign</b> <b>Exchange.</b> One of the largest businesses carried out by the commercial bank is foreign trading. The trade among variouscountries falls for close link between the parties dealing in trade. The situation calls for expertise in thefield of foreign operation. I have worked as an Intern in the Standard Bank limited, Gulshan Branch which is known as a Corporate Branch. Basically, I served in the department of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Exchange</b> so I have instructed to prepare my report based on the “Foreign Exchange” operations. The <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> department divides into three parts export, import and remittance. The export department deals with export L/C, Amendment of L/C, Transfer of L/C,EXP issue charge. When the L/C amounts have to be changed, then the amendments of L/C are needed. The expense sectors of export are –Courier/mailing cost, Stationary cost, Parenting cost, Salary of the employees. Salary of the employees is the administrative cost. But here to analyze the actual earning of export, I’ve to find out the total expenses to operate export department. Import sector is the most profitable sector in <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> department of SBL [...] The import earning sectors are commission for L/C opening, Amendment of local L/C Service charges, Collection of credit report of the beneficiary. From commission for L/C opening and service charge, import department earns most. the expense of export, import, and remittance is almost the same. The remittance earning consists from-Issuance of cash and endorsement of passport, remittance by TT, Cash incentives handling charge etc. The ratio of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> 5 <b>earnings</b> from total earning is also pleasing and profitable.

25|$|The rupee {{was linked}} to the British pound from 1927 to 1946, and then to the US dollar until 1975 through a fixed {{exchange}} rate. It was devalued in September 1975 and the system of fixed par rate was replaced with a basket of four major international currencies: the British pound, the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche mark. In 1991, after the collapse of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, India faced the major foreign exchange crisis and the rupee was devalued by around 19% in two stages on 1 and 2 July. In 1992, a Liberalized Exchange Rate Mechanism (LERMS) was introduced. Under LERMS, exporters had to surrender 40 percent of their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>earnings</b> to the RBI at the RBI-determined exchange rate; the remaining 60% could be converted at the market-determined exchange rate.

25|$|In November 1958, Eagle {{applied to}} the Air Transport Advisory Council (ATAC), the {{contemporary}} UK Government department in charge of air transport economic regulation, for permission to offer low fares on existing and planned scheduled routes to Cyprus, Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore, the Bahamas, the Caribbean as well as East and West Africa. For instance, Eagle's £19 proposed fare to Malta compared with BEA's £52.60 and its £199 Singapore fare compared with a £351 fare charged by BOAC. This marked the first occasion on which a private British airline sought approval to offer scheduled fares that undercut the equivalent published fares of the state-owned airlines by a substantial margin. Eagle's low fares were designed to increase the British market share on routes the state airlines had monopolised by stimulating demand. The airline argued that the British {{economy as a whole}} would benefit if it was granted permission to offer these fares, as a consequence of additional <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>earnings</b> accruing to the UK Exchequer that resulted from boosting Britain's share of total traffic. Loss-making BEA and BOAC lodged objections with ATAC against Eagle's low-fare proposals, which were upheld.|$|E

25|$|The nation's {{need for}} U.S. made capital goods increased, though ongoing {{limits on the}} Central Bank's {{availability}} of hard currency hampered access to them. Argentina's pound Sterling surpluses earned after 1946 (worth over US$200million) were made convertible to dollars by a treaty negotiated by Central Bank President Miguel Miranda; but after a year, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee suspended the provision. Perón accepted the transfer of over 24,000km (15,000mi) of British-owned railways (over half the total in Argentina) {{in exchange for the}} debt in March 1948. Due to political disputes between Perón and the U.S. government (as well as to pressure by the U.S. agricultural lobby through the Agricultural Act of 1949), Argentine <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>earnings</b> via its exports to the United States fell, turning a US$100million surplus with the United States into a US$300million deficit. The combined pressure practically devoured Argentina's liquid reserves and Miranda issued a temporary restriction on the outflow of dollars to U.S. banks. The nationalization of the Port of Buenos Aires and domestic and foreign-owned private cargo ships, as well as the purchase of others, nearly tripled the national merchant marine to 1.2million tons' displacement, reducing the need for over US$100million in shipping fees (then the largest source of Argentina's invisible balance deficit) and leading to the inauguration of the Río Santiago Shipyards at Ensenada (on line to the present day).|$|E
