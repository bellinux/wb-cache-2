5000|$|A biocide {{is defined}} in the European {{legislation}} as a chemical substance or microorganism intended to destroy, deter, render harmless, or exert a controlling <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> any <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> by chemical or biological means. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses a slightly different definition for biocides as [...] "a diverse group of poisonous substances including preservatives, insecticides, disinfectants, and pesticides used for the control of <b>organisms</b> that are <b>harmful</b> to human or animal health or that cause damage to natural or manufactured products". When compared, the two definitions roughly imply the same, although the US EPA definition includes plant protection products and some veterinary medicines.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{biocidal}} products is regulated in the European Union {{based on the}} {{biocidal products}} directive 98 / 8 /EC (BPD) and the biocidal products regulation (BPR). By definition biocidal products are "preparations intended to destroy, render harmless, prevent the action of, or otherwise exert a controlling <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> any <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> by chemical or biological means". This already includes a toxic action which should ideally be directed only against the target organisms (e. g. bacteria) and not against humans and the environment. Since the actual <b>effect</b> depends <b>on</b> specific use concentrations, several endpoints {{have to be addressed}} for final evaluation: * Testing of biocidal efficacy * DBL Risk assessment for humans (consumer and worker) and the environment. Whereas the requirements for toxicological studies used for risk assessment are well known and defined, this is not given for all efficacy studies. Here different study requirements are based on the specific application, which would include different matrices (e. g. cooling liquids), residence times and a varying spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms. (Table see in PDF-File) Especially in the area of disinfection (hygiene, hospital) the requirements for efficacy testing are well established and the benefit of biocidal use is evidenced. In the area of preservation the testing methods are not yet standardized. Many biocides are therefore not tested according to comparable conditions and the effective use concentration is difficult to derive. In consequence this might lead to ambiguous results and hence to a possibly overestimation in risk assessment. However, generally a risk-benefit analysis would be desirable for products, especially for those which display unique properties (essential use) in preventing infectious diseases in humans evoked by pathogenic microorganism and/or bacterial toxins. In summary for the evaluation of biocides the testing guidance's regarding microbial efficacy have to be further developed. Additionally guidance's on risk-benefit analysis would help to ensure a justified use of biocides...|$|R
40|$|Phytoplankton {{growth and}} loss rates {{are governed by}} several factors and in many cases, when growth control fails, algal blooms are established. Such blooms can be formed by {{different}} phytoplankton species {{and some of them}} have <b>harmful</b> impacts <b>on</b> marine ecosystems. One of these negative impacts by some bloom-forming phytoplankton is the ability to produce toxic or inhibitory compounds with broad <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> aquatic <b>organisms.</b> <b>Harmful</b> <b>effects</b> can also reach humans if food or water contaminated with toxins is consumed. Copepods {{are one of the most}} numerous consumers of phytoplankton in marine environments. These invertebrates can also obtain their nutrition from other food resources such as single cell animals (e. g. ciliates), which could be an important alternative under bloom conditions. The aims of this thesis were to assess 1) to which extent toxic or inhibitory phytoplankton is consumed (or avoided) by copepods; 2) whether ciliates and other food types could contribute to the diets of copepods when toxic food is present; 3) if copepods accumulate toxins and excrete them with faecal pellets when toxic phytoplankton is ingested; and 4) the effect of toxic diets on the reproductive success of copepods. Based on some of the results obtained, the role of cellular mechanisms in the detoxification of toxins from the ingested toxic diets was investigated. In addition, the importance of the transport of toxins via copepods to higher consumers such as fish was evaluated. In some cases, toxic phytoplankton was not consumed by copepods. In other cases, copepods fed actively upon toxic phytoplankton. Reproduction was not sustained if toxic phytoplankton was the only food available, or when compared to an adequate diet. This was related to a decrease in the numbers of oocytes produced or in the degree of maturation of these cells. Toxins were detected in copepods and in their faecal pellets after ingestion of the toxic cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena. However, the amount of toxins found in the copepods was far lower than the amount of ingested toxins, which could indicate that copepods might have metabolic mechanisms to get rid of these compounds. High metabolic activity (GSH transferase activity) was, however, detected in well-fed copepods and not related with the ingestion of toxic food. More sensitive studies (e. g. at the molecular level) are needed. Calculations indicated that part of the phytoplankton toxins detected in the copepods could be transferred to fish populations in the Baltic Sea. In some cases, this toxin transfer could be low, but in others it could considerable and threaten both fish and humans. Therefore, frequent monitoring of phytoplankton toxins in fish stocks is needed to assure safe consumption of fish by us...|$|R

In this research, {{the effect}} of {{modified}} bentonite <b>on</b> removing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in ballast water was discussed using HDTMA+ modified bentonite as flocculating material, and Alexandrium tamarense, Nitzchia closterium, and Photobacterium phosphoreum as the objects of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms,</b> and also through an observation of the reaction mechanism between HDTMA+ and bentonite with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The result showed {{that there was an}} effective combination of HDTMA+ with bentonite, and the modified organic bentonite possessed a powerful ability to remove <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms.</b> The removal rate against Alexandrium tamarense within 24 h was greater than 85 % if the dosage of the organic bentonite was 0. 03 g/L; the removal rate against Nitzchia closterium was approximate to 80 % if the dosage was 0. 06 g/L; the luminous intensity could not be displayed by luminescent bacteria under the condition of concentration 0. 30 g/L, and also the original soil with modification did not shown a significant removal effect under the same dosage. Therefore, it was concluded that the conditions such as aging time, organic bentoniteâs particle size, and HDTMA+ dosage were the important factors affecting the harmful biological removal efficiency...|$|R

This organism was identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing as a strain with close affinities to Pseudoalteromonas peptidysin. This bacterium caused rapid cell lysis and death (within 3 h) of gymnodinoids (including Gymnodinium catenatum) and raphidophytes (Chattonella marina and Heterosigma akashiwo). It caused ecdysis of armored dinoflagellates (e. g., Alexandrium catenella, Alexandrium minutum, and Prorocentrum mexicanum), but the algal cultures then recovered over the subsequent 24 h.

40|$|Technical Session IIMaillard {{reaction}} {{is of great}} importance in food industry. Some flavonoids from natural plants {{have been found to}} possess inhibitory <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>harmful</b> advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). However, few studies paid attention to effects of these natural AGE inhibitors on the Maillard reaction happening under thermal conditions. In the present work, we aimed to investigate effects of the two apple phenols, phloretin and phloridzin, on the Maillard reaction taking place in both thermal and non-thermal models. It was found that either phloretin or phloridzin could inhibit the formation of Maillard-type volatiles in various thermal Maillard model systems (glucose-lysine, glucose-lysine derivatives with Î±-amino group blocked, and ribose-cysteine, respectively). In addition, both phloretin and phloridzin could obviously affect color development induced by Maillard reaction. For the study of non-thermal Maillard reaction, effects of phloretin and phloridzin were evaluated in methylglyoxal (MGO) -induced glycation systems consisting of amino acids, peptides and protein (creatine kinase), respectively. Arginine residue was found as an active site for glycation, and the addition of phloretin and phloridzin could significantly inhibit the arginine-site glycation. Interestingly, the addition of phloretin could promote the consumption of cysteine residue exposed to MGO, while cysteine residue kept unchanged when incubated solely with MGO. The promoting <b>effect</b> of phloretin <b>on</b> cysteine residue consumption is caused by the condensation reaction among phloretin, MGO and cysteine residue. Based on findings given in the work, phloretin and phloridzin could play multiple roles in the Maillard reaction by trapping reactive carbonyl species, which may give us an alternative way to better understand the potential effects of natural flavonoids on food processing and human health...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Effectiveness of {{strategies}} to counter injurious risk-taking in adolescents {{depends on the}} degree to which behaviors are modifiable or intrinsic to a sensation-seeking personality. Alcohol consumption is often targeted because it is seen as a modifiable determinant. This study sought to clarify the relative importance of engagement in heavy episodic drinking (HED) independently of sensation-seeking tendency (SS), as a predictor of potentially harmful (and protective) behaviors. Methods. A written survey was administered to students aged 15 â 17 years in 40 high schools in New South Wales (NSW), Australia to measure HED, SS, and harmful and protective behaviors associated with drug and alcohol use, driving, and celebrating. Results. Of 2705 respondents, 60 % reported HED, 36 % failed to wear a seatbelt, 23 % rode with an alcohol-impaired driver, 23 % rode with a drug-impaired driver and 9 % had been alcohol impaired while driving. Two-thirds (65 %) had engaged in harmful behaviors and 99 % had engaged in protective behaviors while celebrating. SS, gender, income, and age were significant predictors of HED. HED and SS were significant, independent predictors of every harmful or protective behavior. HED had the greatest <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>harmful</b> celebrating behaviors, riding with an alcohol-impaired acquaintance, and riding with a drug-impaired driver. HED had a stronger effect than SS, for alcohol-impaired driving, riding with an alcohol-impaired acquaintance, riding with a drug-impaired driver, and harmful celebrating behaviors. Conclusions.

40|$|To develop {{eco-friendly}} diesel engines, accurate combustion {{phase control}} is important {{due to its}} significant <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>harmful</b> emissions and fuel efficiency. In order to accu-rately control the combustion phase, the detection of the combustion phase should pre-cede control system design. Currently, combustion phase detection {{is done by the}} location of 50 % mass fraction burned (MFB 50), because of its close correlation with emissions and fuel efficiency. However, this method is not easily implemented in real-time applications because the calculation of MFB 50 requires a large amount of in-cylinder pressure data and an excessive computational load. For this reason, a com-bustion phase indicator with a simple algorithm is required for real-time combustion con-trol. In this study, we propose a new combustion phase indicator, called the âCentral normalized difference pressures (CNDP). â The CNDP indicates the center of the two crank angles where the normalized difference pressure between firing pressure and motoring pressure (NDP) reaches 90 % of the maximum value before peak (NDPbp 90), and 70 % of the maximum value after peak (NDPap 70). The NDPbp 90 and NDPap 70 are highly correlated with MFB 50 and the correlation is enhanced as the center between the two points obtained. The CNDP is represented by a fixed quadratic polynomial with MFB 50 that robust to changes in various engine operating conditions such as engine speed, main injection timing, injected fuel quantity, fuel-rail pressure, exhaust gas recir-culation (EGR) rate and boost pressure. Furthermore, in performance evaluation, the CNDP requires remarkably fewer in-cylinder pressure data samples, calculation steps and less computation time compared to MFB 50. These results show great potential for the CNDP to be a substitute for the MFB 50 since the proposed combustion phase detec-tion algorithm can be used effectively for real-time combustion phase detection and con-trol.

Therefore, we studied changes in trends in harmful drinking among Dutch working-age men and women after the post- 2008 economic crisis started. We also assessed whether these trend changes differed across age and socioeconomic groups. We used repeated cross-sectional data from the Dutch Health Interview Survey conducted by Statistics Netherlands. Representative samples were independently drawn each month (January, 2004 -December, 2013). Our working-age study population consisted of 20, 140 men and 22, 394 women aged 25 - 64. For men and women, episodic drinking was defined as drinking â¥ 6 glasses on one day at least once a week. Chronic drinking was defined as consuming â¥ 14 glasses/week for women and â¥ 21 for men. Segmented logistic regression was used to model trend changes separately in men and women. A downward trend in episodic and chronic drinking before the crisis slowed down after the crisis started. For episodic drinking, we observed a ceasing-of-decline among men aged 35 - 44 / 45 - 54 / 55 - 64, compared to a start-of-decline among those aged 25 - 34 (p-interaction= 0. 042 / 0. 020 / 0. 047).

40|$|The {{world trade}} {{of plants and}} plant {{products}} is gradually increasing in both quantity and variety. Also, {{as more and more}} citizens are nowadays travelling to distant destinations, there is an increased risk of unintentionally importing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> and invasive species. Governments respond to increased phytosanitary risks by imposing trade-restricting measures. However, they are under increasing pressure of the private sector and the World Trade Organization to justify costly and trade-restricting phytosanitary policies. On the other side, current phytosanitary policies are required to account for impacts on the environment. This book presents a number of recent scientific developments regarding the economic analysis of impacts that <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> have <b>on</b> agriculture and the environment, and of measures to control these organisms. It also contains a number of new approaches that integrate economic and epidemiological modelling and economic approaches for measuring these impacts...|$|R
40|$|Barley {{is one of}} the {{economically}} important crops. Its production is primarilly used as fodder barley and also in brewery and food industry. Particularly the part of its production intended for malt production must be of high quality. There are some important factors which can influence the quality of the crops, such as <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> â diseases, pests and weed. In order to regulate the occurence of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms,</b> agricultural measures are taken in the integrated protection system and resistant variants and pesticides are used. The higher the demand on the production quality, the bigger is the volume and the spectrum of pesticides used. The increasing extent of pesticide use also poses a risk for internal production quality and the environment. This fact makes it necessary to monitor unfavourable influences, including the contents of the pesticide residues in barley. This work studies the possibility of multiresidual determination of some selected pesticides in malting barley...|$|R
