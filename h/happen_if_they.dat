5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of what would <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
25|$|The {{discrepancies}} {{in the various}} figures {{can be attributed to}} several factors: first of all, entire families were killed, and many of the survivors were subsequently scattered across the country. The absence of relatives made tallying the dead more difficult, as did the severe warnings the villagers received in the immediately ensuing years about what would <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> discussed the massacre. The fact that many of the victims were burnt alive in a single, small enclosure complicated the identification of remains and, to date, it is not certain that all the clandestine graves in the vicinity of Plan de Sánchez have been found.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{have been}} genetically {{modified}} in laboratories {{so they can}} grow faster. There is opposition to the commercial use of these fish, and, as of 2006, no approval has been given. A Canadian company, , has developed a modified Atlantic salmon which grows nearly twice as fast (yielding a fully grown fish at 16–18 months rather than 30), and is more disease resistant and cold tolerant. It also requires 10 percent less food. This was achieved using a chinook salmon gene sequence affecting growth hormones, and a promoter sequence from the ocean pout affecting antifreeze production. Normally, salmon produce growth hormones only {{in the presence of}} light. The modified salmon doesn't switch growth hormone production off. The company first submitted the salmon for FDA approval in 1996. In 2015, FDA has approved the AquAdvantage Salmon for commercial production. A concern with transgenic salmon is what might <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> escape into the wild. One study, in a laboratory setting, found that modified salmon mixed with their wild cohorts were aggressive in competing, but ultimately failed.|$|E

40|$|Least squares {{estimation}} {{is discussed}} {{from the point}} of view of a statistician. Much of the emphasis is on problems encountered in application and, more specifically, on questions involving assumptions: what assumptions are needed, when are <b>they</b> needed, what <b>happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are not valid, and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are invalid, how that fact can be detected...|$|R

500|$|In March 2012, it was {{speculated that}} all seven members would reform for seven one-off gigs and appearances, with {{possibility}} of a two-album record deal. On 30 April, Barrett spoke out about the speculations on Radio 5. She revealed that the group had been [...] "talking about it" [...] and stated that a reunion is likely to <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{come up with a}} [...] "good plan". She was also pursuing her solo career at that time, she was the only group member who didn't during the break-up. In spring 2012 the group, now renamed 'S Club Party' set out on a tour of Australia with other noughties' hit group, Big Brovaz. On 30 May 2012, S Club featured on Australia's Channel 7 The Morning Show, announcing they are in the country for a national tour from 23 May to 2 June 2012. Subsequent to this appearance, a video of the performance was uploaded to YouTube, where the reaction was largely negative with many viewers expressing the opinion that the performance was uncomfortable to watch, with the absence of the four other members of the original band causing some disillusionment among childhood fans of the group.|$|E

Reportedly, Lenin also urged the Transnistrian delegate to personally to sabotage the war effort on the Caucasus Front, fraternize with the Ottomans and demand [...] "peace without annexations or indemnities". As some Romanian historians have noted, [...] "Lenin was not about to curb , but did not specify in sufficiently clear terms what would <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should want to achieve self-determination in any social order other than communism." ...|$|E
2500|$|On a new {{installation}} of Windows, a default set of handler applications are {{registered with the}} AutoPlay system. The following are the defaults with Windows XP SP2. The Action and Provider are simply strings stored within the Handler, they can vary to give the user {{a better idea of}} what will <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> choose that action. They can also change to suit a user's preferred language. Many Handlers use the same Windows application; for example, Windows Media Player is used to play Music files as well as DVD movies. The word [...] "using" [...] is added by AutoPlay to join the two strings neatly.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{interests}} {{have to be}} constantly mediated and defended in everyday behaviour, {{with the aid of}} character masks; these masks exist to mediate conflict. It means that people are obliged or forced to express certain qualities and repress other qualities in themselves. In doing this, however, their own consciousness and personality is altered. To be part of an organization, or [...] "rise to the top" [...] of an organization, they {{have to be able to}} [...] "act out" [...] everything that it requires in a convincing way, and that can only <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> either have, or acquire, real characteristics which are at least compatible with it. That requires not just an [...] "acculturation" [...] process, but also sufficient behavioral flexibility, intelligence, acumen and creativity – so that a person does not inappropriately [...] "fall out of the role". Discord between identity and function is tolerated only in contexts where it does not matter.|$|E
2500|$|Grossman {{informs the}} reader that she appreciates [...] "the fact that {{in this age of}} polite {{political}} correctness there is a place in the world where people feel free to speak their minds, even offensively". She gives an analogy for the reader regarding those who would discuss and comment on the phenomenon of the Internet-based community without prior experience: [...] "Journalists who don't use the Net themselves routinely make such egregious technological and cultural errors that you can only compare the results to what would <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were assigned to write about the interstate highway system based on their experiences at sea.... f the police told you that prostitutes routinely and openly solicited truckers and other visitors to roadside rest areas and that therefore they were risky places for families to visit, you would probably believe them and write the story.... At the same time, after a while it's easy to lose perspective and forget that behavior which is common and tolerated on the Net seems shocking to newcomers." ...|$|E
2500|$|This shift {{has already}} {{commenced}} in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded {{services such as}} medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and {{this is because of}} pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. [...] In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of [...] "senior care pharmacy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elements of {{the history}} of Star Wars are {{commonly}} disputed, as George Lucas' statements about it have changed over time. One of the claims is that he intended to make the film a Space Western. Lucas has said that it was early as 1971—after he completed directing his first full-length feature, THX 1138—that he first had an idea for a space fantasy film, though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then. In the 2010 coffee table book Star Wars: Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle produced by DK Publishing and Lucasfilm, George Lucas is said to have made his film as a direct contrast to THX 1138. He felt that the bleak tone of the film led to it being poorly received, and therefore chose to make Star Wars a more optimistic film. This is what led to the fun and adventurous tone of the space opera. Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young. In 1979, he said, [...] "I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials... Of course I realize now how crude and badly done they were... loving them that much when they were so awful, I began to wonder what would <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were done really well." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{incident}} near KLCC, 15 protesters, {{believed to be}} from PAS' Unit Amal were recorded charging and broke through a human barricade formed by police personnel.

60|$|That {{the birds}} {{know what would}} <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were caught, and are even a little {{undecided}} about which is the better life, is obvious to every student of them.
