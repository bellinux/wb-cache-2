5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is taken up by foraging for <b>food</b> <b>for</b> their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing <b>food</b> <b>for</b> their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide <b>food</b> <b>for</b> the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E

5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, probably from material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, {{although it has}} been known to hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south as far as Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides <b>food</b> <b>for</b> a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of <b>food</b> <b>for</b> honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.|$|E

5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Peace program was {{operating}} in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school lunch program thanks to <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Food {{security}} and food power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough <b>food</b> <b>for</b> an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of <b>food</b> <b>for</b> its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E
