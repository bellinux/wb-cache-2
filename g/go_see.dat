5|$|Rei finds {{a heavily}} injured man and races {{to try to}} save his life, but the man shortly dies after he brings him to the church. The whole town shows up to show their respects at the funeral. Worried about Tipi's state of mind in dealing with the man's death, Rei {{repeatedly}} tries to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> Tipi, but Shiona keeps preventing him from going to see her. Rei eventually makes it to the library, but Shiona merely tells Tipi that her parents, who she has been waiting to return, are dead and that she will always be alone. Enraged at Shiona's behavior, Rei gets her to leave the library and Rei stays with Tipi overnight. Rei and Tipi wake up the next morning to find that the town is under attack. When Rei leaves to investigate, he finds humans have infiltrated the town and are killing the townspeople. Rei is nearly killed by them, but Shiona protects him from a gunshot, which leaves her unconscious, but alive. Rei takes Shiona back to the library where they regroup with Tipi before leaving through the sewer system to make it back to the church. A lone man comes to the church, and while Rei is fighting him, the man uses a grenade, but Shiona protects Rei from the blast.|$|E

50|$|At panel, Hosanna and Christobelle are {{praised for}} their {{photographs}} while Laura {{is said to}} have had a bad week. Hosanna gets first call out; Ruby and Victoria lands in the bottom two, Victoria because she didn't embody the personality for the photoshoot and not getting booked for any <b>go</b> <b>sees.</b> And Ruby, because the judges felt that she was cruising through the competition and then disappointed at <b>go</b> <b>sees.</b> Ultimately, Victoria is sent home because of her inconsistency.|$|R
25|$|Gene {{had sent}} us a phoney press release and press packet. Listing all the places they had been playing and 'Reviews' of their performances. All were bogus.

25|$|The Baudelaires <b>go</b> <b>see</b> the Quagmires {{and tell}} them what happened. Then the Quagmires plot a plan. The Quagmires {{disguise}} themselves as Klaus and Violet, get a sack of flour to represent Sunny, and do the exercises (at night) so that the Baudelaire orphans can study and make staples (Coach Genghis doesn't know that it's the Quagmires that are running because it is night time and he can't see them.) The Quagmires leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus so that they can study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{waited a}} month before {{striking}} again. Meanwhile, Bundy was still infatuated with Jack Murray. She would <b>go</b> <b>see</b> him sing {{and after a few}} drinks, her conversation would turn to things she and Clark were doing. Murray was alarmed and implied that he might tell the police. In order to avoid this from happening, in August 1980, Bundy lured Murray into his van after a show to have sex. Once they were inside, she shot him and decapitated him. She left various clues behind, however, such as the fact {{that the two of them}} were seen together in the bar, and she had left shell casings in the van. Bundy couldn't take the pressure and two days later she confessed to her co-workers that she had killed Murray. They called the police and she began to give them a full and to-the-point confession about her and Clark's crimes.|$|E

25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and <b>go</b> <b>see,</b> and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E
25|$|After being {{reunited with}} old colleagues like Klein, Clem and Oscar, Judith becomes obsessed with freeing Celestine from her prison below Roxborough Tower. She and Oscar {{eventually}} head to Roxborough Tower {{after all of}} the Tabula Rasa end up being killed. When they split up, Oscar ends up getting attacked by Dowd (still alive, with pieces from the Pivot shoved into his body), who slices him up much {{in the same way}} that Oscar did to him near the start of the book. Judith arrives just as Oscar dies. After speaking with Dowd, Judith returns to the basement of the tower and frees Celestine, who then fights and defeats Dowd. Celestine tells Judith that she wants to see Maestro Sartori. Clem one night while helping the homeless finds Gentle and helps him get his senses back. Gentle heads off with him, and Monday tags along. Sartori meanwhile reveals to Judith (who still thinks he's Gentle) that he has impregnated her when she tries to get him to see Celestine. Judith tells him to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> Celestine. The real Gentle arrives shortly afterwards with Clem and Monday, and they head to Roxborough Tower, where Sartori has already met Celestine, who reveals that he was the child she bore when she was raped by Hapexamendios hundreds of years before. Gentle and Sartori do battle while the others help Celestine out of the tower.|$|E
500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I read somewhere that kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I want people to laugh. I want people to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> the film and have fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Cole {{initially}} {{looked for}} original songs to {{record for the}} album, but said [...] "the songs being sent were pretty bad." [...] A writer from Vibe said Cole's decision to create a covers album was a marketing strategy to breed [...] "a connection between song and interpreter and between singer and audience" [...] and appeal to [...] "fans yearning for {{the good old days}} before they had to hire a sitter to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> a show". Cole later clarified she could not afford to record an album of original material, explaining [...] "we're doing a contemporary urban record on a jazz budget".|$|E
500|$|... "Push the Button" [...] was conceptualised after {{group member}} Keisha Buchanan {{developed}} an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you <b>go</b> <b>see</b> it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say." [...] Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to [...] "push that button" [...] or she would eventually move on.|$|E

500|$|Downey {{has been}} {{a close friend of}} Mel Gibson since they starred in Air America. Downey defended Gibson during the {{controversy}} surrounding The Passion of the Christ, and said [...] "nobody's perfect" [...] in reference to Gibson's DUI. Gibson said of Downey: [...] "He {{was one of the first}} people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's <b>go</b> <b>see</b> what we can do to work on ourselves.'" [...] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.|$|E
500|$|As {{with most}} episodes of The Simpsons, {{the music was}} {{composed}} by Alf Clausen and edited by Chris Ledesma.

The episode features several other references to popular culture as well. For example, Homer skips work to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> a film called Paul Flart: Water Park Cop, a parody of the 2009 film [...] In addition, there is a brief shot of the character Bender from the animated television series Futurama.|$|E
500|$|Several United States Senators {{screened}} the film. New Mexico Democratic Senator Jeff Bingaman and Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid saw {{the movie}} at its Washington premiere at the National Geographic Society. New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall planned to see the film saying [...] "It's such a powerful statement {{because of the way}} the movie is put together, I tell everybody, Democrat or Republican, they've got to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> this movie." [...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress. Bingaman disputed this saying, [...] "It seems to me we were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie." ...|$|E

500|$|In his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema, Randor Guy {{described}} Kalidas as a [...] "crude experiment" [...] {{that had}} poor lip sync; when characters opened their mouths {{there was no}} sound, and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public did not care about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy, in his review of the film for Ananda Vikatan, noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying {{that she had to}} <b>go</b> <b>see</b> a doctor to get her vocal chords fixed. The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could <b>go</b> <b>see</b> them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E
