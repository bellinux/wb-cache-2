2500|$|In May 1992, Fred {{asked his}} 13-year-old {{daughter}} {{to bring some}} bottles to a room {{on the first floor}} of their home. Rose was not present in the home at the time. Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, [...] "No, don't!" [...] Later, Fred returned downstairs. The girl was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her. When Rose returned home, the girl confided <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> that she had been raped by Fred, although Rose simply replied, [...] "Oh well. You were asking for it." [...] Over the following weeks, the girl was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, [...] "Well, what did you expect?" [...] Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, the girl garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend would divulge what had happened to her own mother on 4 August. In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of {{emulation}} {{learning are}} well documented among primates. [...] Notable examples include Japanese macaque potato washing, chimpanzee tool use, and chimpanzee gestural communication. In 1953, an 18-month-old female macaque monkey was observed taking sandy pieces of sweet potato (given to the monkeys by observers) to a stream (and later, to the ocean) to wash off the sand. After three months, the same behavior was observed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and two playmates, {{and then the}} playmates' mothers. Over {{the next two years}} seven other young macaques were observed washing their potatoes, {{and by the end of}} the third year 40% of the troop had adopted the practice. Although this story is popularly represented as a straightforward example of human-like learning, evidence suggests that it is not. Many monkeys naturally brush sand off food; this behavior had been observed in the macaque troop prior to the first observed washing. Moreover, potato washing was observed in four other separate macaque troops, suggesting that at least four other individual monkeys had learned to wash off sand on their own. Other monkey species in captivity quickly learn to wash off their food. Finally, the spread of learning among the Japanese macaques was fairly slow, and the rate at which new members of the troop learned did not keep pace with the growth of the troop. If the form of learning were imitation, the rate of learning should have been exponential. It is more likely that the monkeys' washing behavior is based on the common behavior of cleaning off food, and that monkeys that spent time by the water independently learned to wash, rather than wipe their food. This explains both why those monkeys that kept company with the original washer, and who thus spent a good deal of time by the water, also figured out how to wash their potatoes. It also explains why the rate at which this behavior spread was slow.|$|E
