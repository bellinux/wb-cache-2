5|$|A {{member of}} the Roman Catholic minority, Phát joined the French-backed Vietnamese National Army which became the ARVN after the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) was established. After having {{been sent to the}} U.S. for further {{training}} in 1958, Phát returned home to head the Civil Guard, a paramilitary force then mostly used to protect the ruling family of President Ngô Đình Diệm, rather than to counteract the communist Việt Cộng insurgency. Later commanding the 2nd Division, he was known for his loyalty to Diệm, who favored fellow Catholics. In 1963, Diệm <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> of the generals were about to launch a coup against him. He appointed Phát to command the 7th Division, located near the capital, Saigon, so he could help in the fighting, but the plotters successfully used delaying tactics so that the paperwork for the transfer of the division leadership could not occur before they proceeded to overthrow and execute Diệm. Despite Phát's pro-Diệm allegiance he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 7th Division.|$|E
5|$|The attackers {{had planned}} the attack several months {{ahead of time}} and <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> areas well enough to vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E

The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E

25|$|In {{the region}} of pure mathematics, De Morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox; {{but he was not}} so {{proficient}} in the field of physics. His father-in-law was a paradoxer, and his wife a paradoxer; and in the opinion of the physical philosophers De Morgan himself scarcely escaped. His wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism, table-rapping, table-turning, etc.; and De Morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> of the asserted facts, believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know whether they were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. From this alternative he left out ordinary material causes. Faraday delivered a lecture on Spiritualism, in which he laid it down that in the investigation we ought to set out with the idea of what is physically possible, or impossible; De Morgan did not believe this.|$|E
25|$|The three missionaries {{arrived in}} Tubuai on April 30, 1844. Pratt stayed {{alone on the}} island and had success during his first year. He was able to baptize 60 people in his first year there. Eventually he baptized enough people to {{establish}} a small congregation, known in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as a branch, in 1844. Pratt's early success may have been {{due to the fact that}} he <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> Hawaiian and was, therefore, able to recognize some cognate words between the two languages, allowing him to gain favor with natives. The first member of the church in French Polynesia was a convert that Pratt baptized, Ambrose Alexander. He was baptized on June 15, 1844; he was joined by ten more members five weeks later. The missionaries not only taught principles of church teachings and doctrines, but emphasized the export of cash crops and economic autonomy.|$|E

25|$|While the theorem {{that now}} {{bears his name}} was known and {{previously}} utilised by the Babylonians and Indians, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. It must, however, be stressed that {{the way in which}} the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem. For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems. Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of Plato over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras. This attribution has stuck down the centuries up to modern times. The earliest known mention of Pythagoras's name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch.|$|E

Crawford and Knight <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> of these Delawares, who were part of a band led by a war chief named Wingenund. Crawford and Knight were taken prisoner, but the other four Americans escaped. Two of them were later tracked down, killed, and scalped.|$|E

Gens attended a Russian-language primary school and then a secondary school in Šiauliai. He was fluent in Lithuanian, Russian, German, and Yiddish, and <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> Hebrew, Polish, and English. In 1919, Gens enlisted in the newly formed Lithuanian Army. He was sent to officers' school and completed the training as a junior lieutenant. N. Karni, who was a cadet with Gens, said that he [...] "had great personal charm. I do not remember him ever being in a bad mood." [...] Karni also felt Gens had [...] "leadership qualities, he had personality, {{he was a man of}} principles". Gens' participation in the Polish–Lithuanian War and the completion of his secondary schooling earned Gens a promotion to senior lieutenant.|$|E

500|$|Hilson {{later told}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV News {{that she was}} indeed a little bit {{surprised}} by the reaction she was getting concerning [...] "The Way You Love Me". She clarified that the song was not just sexual: [...] "In that record I'm talking about one guy, I'm talking about one night {{and this is what}} I want on this one night, and I'm not afraid to say it. Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] is not meant for children.|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} albums {{received a}} mixed response from critics.

Luc Nadeau of Game Music Online, who reviewed all three releases of the soundtrack, was mixed to positive in his opinions. He generally liked the music, but noted, like the RPGFan reviewer, that it was highly experimental {{and would not be}} to everyone's taste. He also cited his preference for the 2011 two-disc re-release over the original albums. Reviewing the re-release, Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version called it [...] "one of the most experimental and disturbing soundtracks I've heard in a while". He praised the soundtrack despite not finding it memorable, and commented that he found it more appealing when he <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> of the plot details that were censored in the game's western release.|$|E
500|$|The {{international}} use of Greek was {{one factor}} enabling {{the spread of}} Christianity, as indicated for example {{by the use of}} Greek for the Epistles of Paul. Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, presumably <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> Greek, but Latin was spoken in his court, and he used an interpreter to address Greek-speaking bishops at the Council of Nicaea. In the Christian Latin West, Greek became associated with [...] "paganism" [...] and regarded as a foreign language (lingua peregrina). Saint Augustine confessed that he loathed Greek and found it hard to learn. By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a [...] "Hellene" [...] in matters of religion and culture. In {{the first half of the}} 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated, and the Acta Conciliorum ("Acts of the Church Councils") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into Latin, Syriac, or Coptic. During this period, Latin played only a subordinate role in the ecumenical councils, as did representatives from the Western empire. Although traditionally Armenian is regarded as having been established as a Christian language by this time, it does not appear in the Acta. There are hints that Coptic might be spoken at the councils, but no secure record. On-the-spot translation into Greek was available for the participant who used his own language, including some who are referred to as [...] "Arabs", [...] "Saracens" [...] or [...] "Ishmaelites". Christian content has been found in a few Arabic inscriptions from the 6th century.|$|E
