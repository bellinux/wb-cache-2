50|$|Under a VPA, {{the partner}} country agrees to export only legal timber {{products}} to the EU. The EU agrees to give verified legal ('FLEGT-licensed) timber products from the country free access to the EU market. The EU also commits to denying entry to any timber shipments from a VPA partner country that lack <b>FLEGT</b> <b>licences</b> and must therefore be illegal.|$|R
50|$|The core of each VPA is the {{description}} of a timber legality assurance system the partner country will implement in order to verify the legality of timber products and issue verified legal products with <b>FLEGT</b> <b>licences.</b> Each timber legality assurance system must have the following five components: a legality definition, supply chain controls, verification of compliance, FLEGT licensing and independent audit of the whole system.|$|R
5000|$|Critics of the FLEGT Action Plan {{point out}} that no FLEGT-licensed timber has yet arrived in the EU and that some EU member states {{have not yet fully}} {{implemented}} the EU Timber Regulation. Supporters of the FLEGT Action Plan say the time taken to deliver <b>FLEGT</b> <b>licences</b> indicates the rigour and credibility of the process. For instance, Saskia Ozinga of the campaigning organisation FERN described the FLEGT Action Plan as [...] "the EU's best-ever policy on tropical forests, since it's the first scheme of its kind to address the root causes of illegal logging", and gave evidence of improved governance in Ghana, Liberia and Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|Under the FLEGT Action Plan, in 2005, the EU {{adopted the}} FLEGT Regulation. The FLEGT Regulation {{empowers}} the European Commission to negotiate bilateral trade deals called Voluntary Partnership Agreements with timber-exporting countries. Under a VPA, the partner country agrees to export only legal timber {{products to the}} EU, while the EU agrees to give verified legal ('FLEGT-licensed) timber products automatic access to the EU market. VPAs are also intended to strengthen forest governance in timber-exporting countries by improving transparency, accountability and stakeholder participation. The core of each VPA is the description of a timber legality assurance system the partner country will implement to verify the legality of timber products and issue verified legal products with a <b>FLEGT</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
