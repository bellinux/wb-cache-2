30|$|The payload assumed {{for each}} flight could be {{calculated}} based on the aircraft’s maximum payload multiplied by a <b>flight’s</b> <b>weight</b> load factor. While flight schedules contain information on payload capacity available on each flight, actual passenger numbers and the (total) payload transported had to be estimated. For this purpose, each flight in the schedules was supplemented by load factor data from different sources. The sources used to determine both seat load factors and overall weight load factors include the ICAO Traffic by Flight Stage databank and ICAO’s Air Carrier statistics [19]. By combining such data with the available seats and payload capacities from the schedules, an estimation of the relevant transport performance for the years 2004 – 2008 could be provided.|$|R

50|$|These {{vehicles}} {{have used}} wings to provide aerobraking {{to return from}} orbit and to provide lift, allowing them to land on a runway like conventional aircraft. These vehicles are still designed to ascend to orbit vertically under rocket power like conventional expendable launch vehicles. One drawback of spaceplanes {{is that they have}} a significantly smaller payload fraction than a ballistic design with the same takeoff weight. This is in part due to the weight of the wings — around 9-12% of the weight of the atmospheric <b>flight</b> <b>weight</b> of the vehicle. This significantly reduces the payload size, but the reusability is intended to offset this disadvantage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The stratospheric balloon {{magnetic}} gradiometer system is developed and maintained at IZMIRAN already about 20 years. This system {{consists of three}} instrumental containers uniformly placed along a vertical 6 km line. System allows measuring parameters of the geomagnetic field along the whole flight trajectory. The GPS-receivers, located in each instrumental container, fix the flight coordinates. The developed launching technology, deployment in flight, assembly, data, transfer and processing, landing the containers with the equipment {{can be used for}} other similar problems of monitoring and sounding an environment. Useful <b>flight</b> <b>weights</b> of each instrumental container may be reaching 50 kg. received from Ukraine and Kazakhstan). With the appearance of GPS receivers, it has become possible to locate the balloon during its flight at an accuracy of a few meters. Various azimuths of the balloon motion, due to variations {{in the direction of the}} carrier air flow, allow the balloon to perform a detailed magnetic survey of large regions. The instability of the balloon flight altitude does not prevent a high-quality magnetic survey, because, if the data on the vertical gradient of the magnetic field are available, the field can be recalculated to any specified level within the altitude range 20 - 40 km...|$|R

The key technologies are multilayer insulation, capillary propellant acquisition, zero-g gaging, orbital chilldown, and possibly large <b>flight</b> <b>weight</b> dewars.

A brief summary and bibliography are presented of the research that has been conducted by NASA, its predecessor NACA, and by industry under U. S. Air Force sponsorship.

40|$|Through {{the study}} of airport network of China (ANC), {{composed}} of 128 airports (nodes) and 1165 flights (edges), we show the topological structure of ANC conveys two characteristics of small worlds, a short average path length (2. 067) and {{a high degree of}} clustering (0. 733). The cumulative degree distributions of both directed and undirected ANC obey two-regime power laws with different exponents, i. e., the so-called Double Pareto Law. In-degrees and out-degrees of each airport have positive correlations, whereas the undirected degrees of adjacent airports have significant linear anticorrelations. It is demonstrated both weekly and daily cumulative distributions of <b>flight</b> <b>weights</b> (frequencies) of ANC have power-law tails. Besides, the weight of any given flight is proportional to the degrees of both airports at the two ends of that flight. It is also shown the diameter of each sub-cluster (consisting of an airport and all those airports to which it is linked) is inversely proportional to its density of connectivity. Efficiency of ANC and of its sub-clusters are measured through a simple definition. In terms of that, the efficiency of ANC's sub-clusters increases as the density of connectivity does. ANC is found to have an efficiency of 0. 484. Comment: 6 Pages, 5 figure...|$|R

50|$|It was {{determined}} that the location where the flight crashed was beyond the effective range of the Robertsfield beacon. This, combined with the report from the crew that the Dakar beacon was interfering with the Robertsfield beacon, resulted {{in the frequency of}} the Robertsfield beacon being changed to provide greater separation of frequencies between the two beacons. Investigation of the wreckage revealed no indications of mechanical malfunction, the aircraft had enough fuel for another eight hours of <b>flight,</b> the <b>weight</b> and disposition of the payload was within allowable limits, and the weather was above minima.|$|R
40|$|A polyphenylane oxide insulated, <b>flight</b> <b>weight,</b> subscale, {{aluminum}} {{tank was}} monitored for acoustic emissions during a proof test and during 100 cycles of environmental test simulating space flights. The {{use of a}} combination of frequency filtering and appropriate spatial filtering to reduce background noise was found to be sufficient to detect acoustic emission signals of relatively small intensity expected from subcritical crack growth in the structure. Several emission source locations were identified, including the one where a flaw was detected by post-test X-ray inspections. For most source locations, however, post-test inspections did not detect flaws; this was partially attributed to the higher sensitivity of the acoustic emission technique than any other currently available NDT method for detecting flaws...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} directed, {{weighted}} and evolutionary Austrian airline flight network. It is shown {{that such a}} specific airline flight network displays features of small-world networks, namely large clustering coefficient and small average shortest-path length. We study the detailed flight information both in a week and on a whole. In both cases, the degree distributions reveal power law with exponent value of 2 ∼ 3 for the small degree branch and a flat tail for the large degree branch. Similarly, the <b>flight</b> <b>weight</b> distributions have power-law for the small weight branch. The degree-degree correlation analysis shows the network has disassortative behavior, i. e. the large airports are likely to link to smaller airports...|$|E
40|$|The Augmented Deflector Exhaust Nozzle (ADEN) {{was tested}} in PSL- 3 at NASA-Lewis Research Center using an F 404 engine. The ADEN is a <b>flight</b> <b>weight</b> Single Expansion Ramp Nozzle with thrust vectoring, an {{internal}} cooling system utilizing the available engine fan flow, and a variable area throat {{controlled by the}} engine control system. Test conditions included dry and max A/B operation at nozzle pressure ratios from 2. 0 to 15. 0. High nozzle pressure loading was simulated to verify structural integrity at near maximum design pressure. Nozzle settings covered the full range in throat area and + or - 15 deg deflection angle.

40|$|Variation in {{timing of}} {{breeding}} in Eastern Kingbirds (Tyrannus tyrannus) was correlated only weakly with external morphological characters, but was correlated positively and significantly with estimates of body size based on measurements of skeletons and muscle weights. Small females apparently held a reproductive advantage {{in being able}} to mobilize resources for reproduction before large females. Egg weight was independent of all measures of female size, but was directly and significantly (P = 0. 03) correlated with standard <b>flight</b> muscle <b>weight,</b> a relative index of body condition. Egg size was thus a function more of female body condition than size. On average, shell, yolk, and albumen comprised 5. 6 %, 21. 9 %, and 72. 5 %, respectively, of fresh egg weight. Dry albumen and dry shell increased proportionately with fresh egg weight, but dry yolk did not. Total protein, lipid, and energy of fresh eggs all increased proportionately with weight. Comparison of egg composition and standard <b>flight</b> muscle <b>weight</b> of laying females indicated moderate positive, although nonsignificant, correlations between body condition and measures of egg quality, especially lipid content. Based on postegg- laying body composition and nutrient requirements for the production of one egg, it appeared that most females probably could have laid an additional egg almost solely from body reserves. Clutch size thus appears to be independent of body condition...|$|R

Because the cosmonauts were so weakened from six months in zero gravity (a bouquet of flowers presented to them reportedly felt like [...] "a ton of bricks"), a system of slides and chutes had to be deployed for them to exit the Soyuz descent module.

The design and analysis of <b>flight</b> <b>weight</b> primary and secondary beam builder structures proceeded satisfactorily but remains curtailed until further funding is made available to complete the work. The induction fastening effort remains within cost and schedule constraints. Tests of the LARC prototype induction welder is continuing in an instrumented test stand comprised of a Dumore drill press (air over oil feed for variable applied loads) and a dynamometer to measure actual welding loads. Continued testing shows that the interface screening must be well impregnated with resin to ensure proper flow when bonding graphite-acrylic lap shear samples.

A lighter weight system is required to transition the membrane mirror technology to space hardware applications. Using electrostatic forces to tension and figure the membrane is one promising approach to developing a <b>flight</b> <b>weight</b> membrane mirror system.

40|$|Most astronauts {{in orbit}} suffer {{physically}} during space <b>flight,</b> experiencing <b>weight</b> loss, muscle atrophy, bone mineral density depletion, fluid loss, motion sickness, olfactory and gustatory changes, and radiation damage. While these physical changes are minor in short space missions, astronauts in compromised health {{will be unable}} to complete, or will fail to recover from, more lengthy spaceflights. It is imperative that astronauts maintain health while in microgravity, particularly by maintaining a positive energy balance.
