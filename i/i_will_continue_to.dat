25|$|Master Sergeant Woodrow W. Keeble {{served with}} bravery and dignity, {{going beyond the}} call of duty not for notoriety or recognition-but for the mission he {{believed}} in and the country he loved. Keeble's legacy is a great source of pride for his family, his fellow Dakota Sioux, and all Americans. The Secretary of the Army's recommendation is wonderful and long-awaited news. I began working with Master Sergeant Keeble's family and tribal officials on resolving this long overdue issue in the spring of 2002, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> work with Defense officials to ensure that this legendary soldier receives the final and most distinguished honor he deserves.|$|E

House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson said, [...] "... {{to think that we}} can credibly measure the impact of international indirect land use is completely unrealistic, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> push for legislation that prevents unreliable methods and unfair standards from burdening the biofuels industry." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown {{personally}} clarified his position. He said, [...] "We {{will not}} allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have got to remember that the relationship between Britain and America and between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> work, as Tony Blair did, very closely with the American administration." ...|$|E

I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note.

U2, <b>I</b> guess, <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> 'move' in live performance, but they will only move on the lightest surface. Their music does 'soar'... But then 'God' knows, there are other religions".|$|R
500|$|In July 2014, Nash {{announced}} that the 2014–15 season would be his last. During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage. On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now. I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health." ...|$|E
500|$|In the off-season, it was speculated {{by many in}} {{the media}} whether Luongo should remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added {{pressure}} of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be a leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal." [...] Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, The Register {{reported}} {{on an ongoing}} case involving Scientology before Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee, [...] "According to site administrators, several pro-Scientology accounts have been editing the site using Scientology-owned computers." [...] The Arbitration Committee on Wikipedia is composed {{of a group of}} volunteers elected by the editing community to resolve especially difficult conflicts. During the Arbitration case, the page about Scientology was modified by members of the organization. Scientology members had doctored entries in order to advertise for their cause. The Register noted that one of the Wikipedia users admitted he had edited from computers operated by the Scientology organization, [...] "One of these pro-Scientology editors [...] who once used the handle 'COFS' [...] has admitted as much.

500|$|The fifth {{servicing}} {{mission to}} Hubble, HST-SM4, was originally scheduled to launch in late 2005 or early 2006. On 16 January 2004, then-NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe canceled the mission, {{as well as}} any future missions to Hubble, citing safety constraints imposed by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. During the announcement, O'Keefe stated that it was his decision alone, and not a recommendation from any other departments. The decision was widely criticized by the media, the science community, and those in NASA. Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, a member of the Senate subcommitte that oversees NASA's budget, publicly accused O'Keefe of making a decision outside the transparency process against the wishes of the science community, and stated she would work to reverse the decision. In March 2004, Representative Mark Udall introduced a bill to the House of Representatives that requested an independent panel of experts review O'Keefe's decision to cancel the servicing mission. Also in March 2004, Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Director Stephen Beckwith released the results of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field survey to the entire science community, which helped show the public how important Hubble was to science. The data showed the deepest images ever taken by a telescope and revealed approximately 10,000 galaxies, some of which most likely dated back to when the universe was just five hundred million years old. With Beckwith when he released the data to the scientific community was Mikulski, who said of the results, [...] "I think it's just amazing... this is why <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> stand up for Hubble." ...|$|E

Some examples of these exercises include the usage of resistance/stretch bands, stationary biking, and elliptical. During this phase the patient may begin performing more strenuous exercises such as half-squatting and partial lunges.|$|R
