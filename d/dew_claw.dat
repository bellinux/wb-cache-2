50|$|The breed {{characteristics}} of the Briard, are of a medium-sized, rugged, agile dog, having harsh coat and double dewclaws mounted low on each rear leg, resembling additional toes. Each double <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> should have bone substance and nail, giving {{the appearance of a}} wider rear foot. Bred for centuries to herd, the additional digits on each rear foot give the Briard the ability of pivoting on one foot for quick turns and complete turn-arounds, which are necessary when herding and guarding their flocks. Throughout history, the Briard has retained an appropriate balance of size and build that is required for both herding and protection of their flocks. They are not too large to tire during herding yet large enough to fend off predators such as fox and wolves.|$|E

5000|$|Most carnivorans are terrestrial; {{they usually}} have strong, sharp claws, {{typically}} with five, but never fewer than four, toes on each foot, and well-developed, prominent canine teeth, cheek teeth (premolars, and molars) that generally have cutting edges. The last premolar {{of the upper}} jaw and first molar of the lower are termed the [...] carnassials or sectorial teeth. These blade-like teeth occlude (close) with a scissor-like action for [...] and [...] meat. Carnassials are most highly developed in the Felidae and the least developed in the Ursidae. Carnivorans have six incisors and two conical canines in each jaw. The only two exceptions to this are the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), which has four incisors in the lower jaw, and the sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), which has four incisors in the upper jaw. The number of molars and premolars is variable between carnivoran species, but all teeth are deeply rooted and are diphyodont. Incisors are retained by carnivorans and the third incisor is commonly large and sharp (canine-like). Carnivorans have either four or five digits on each foot, with the first digit on the forepaws, {{also known as the}} <b>dew</b> <b>claw,</b> being vestigial in most species and absent in some.|$|E
25|$|The first, tentative, {{recorded}} {{breed standard}} {{was published in}} 1922. This standard only reflected the functional features naturally found in the best dogs of the time, although it did mention having <b>dew</b> <b>claws</b> as reflecting a “perfect” dog. The characteristic hooked tail and turned-back (rosed) ears, which later {{became part of the}} official standard, were not mentioned in this preliminary standard.|$|R
25|$|The first {{official}} breed standard {{was written in}} 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double <b>dew</b> <b>claws</b> becoming a requirement. All colors were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, <b>dew</b> <b>claws</b> became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited {{a few times to}} achieve today’s current set.Prior to World War II, the Estrela breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed standard, if they even knew one existed. But by the early 1950s, interest in the breed returned, and the annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was most popular at shows, but “show dogs” represented (and still do) {{only a small portion of}} the Estrela population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) short-haired.|$|R
500|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a compact, solidly built dog, bred {{for hard}} work and endurance.

5000|$|It {{could have}} preyed upon {{anything}} from small, contemporary muntjac deer and mountainous ibex, to elk and possibly sambar, prey that was considerably {{larger than the}} modern cheetah's ideal prey, the Thomson's gazelle. The modern cheetah uses a specific hunting style seen nowhere else in the cat family: on open plains, it locates prey and walks directly towards a group or individual, without crouching, with head and tail down. When it comes within suitable distance (usually 50 yards,) it sprints forward. The chase is fast and takes many turns until the cheetah uses an enlarged <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> to hook the hind leg of the prey or smack its flanks to either knock it off balance or damage its Achilles tendon. When the prey falls to the ground, the cheetah suffocates it with a throat clamp, and after resting, eats {{as much as it}} can on the spot before being chased off by larger predators or occasionally having eaten all it can. This sequence of a chase over an open area and the hooking of the back leg is unique and often necessary for the cheetah: prey that does not flee is addressed {{with a great deal of}} confusion on the cheetah's part and is often left unharmed if it cannot be coaxed to flee[...]|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{skeletal}} structure of Acinonyx pardinensis, the larger species very likely used {{a similar approach}} to hunting; it, too, bore a large <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> and the lean form was definitely built for running. A stalk, sprint, trip, and kill was probably a commonality of the large species' hunting tactics. The modern cheetah almost always uses a throat clamp to suffocate prey and this species of Acinonyx likely used this method of killing. Due to the small canines and weaker jaw muscles of both species, a muzzle clamp (seen in lions) or severing of the spinal cord (seen in jaguars) is generally not an option, so a throat clamp would have been used most prominently. The giant cheetah, being more powerful and possessed of a stronger set of jaws as evidenced by Geraads et al, probably was also able to crush the bones in the neck and skull of its victims. As it was heavier too, it would likely have been a slower runner than modern cheetahs, despite its longer legs. The giant cheetah, like the modern cheetah, seemed to avoid eating bone {{based on the evidence}} of its carnassial teeth, and it was a fast eater that likely could consume a great deal of flesh before another predator, such as hyenas, the machairodont Homotherium, or wolves arrived to drive the cat from its kill.|$|E
40|$|Lameness {{has been}} {{incorrectly}} labeled as a “cow {{and not a}} sow” concern, and this has possibly arisen due {{to the majority of}} sows being far more stationary over their productive lifetime compared to dairy cows. Therefore, the objectives of this study were record hoof lesion frequency, proportion, type and severity from sows housed in gestation stalls during a one month period. A total of 30 sows were used (Yorkshire [n = 3], Duroc [n = 14] and Yorkshire x Duroc crosses [n = 13]). All sows were individually housed in stalls that had concrete flooring and manure fell into a holding pit. Sows were feed at 0600 h once a day a commercially available ground feed. Caretakers observed all sows twice daily, at 0600 h and 1600 h. Hoof lesion and severity was scored (medial and lateral toes, dew claws and the sole) and recorded once a week by a single observer using the FeetFirst lesion scoring guide produced by the FeetFirst™ Team. Lesion severity was scored as, one (mild), two (moderate) and three (severe) which occurred on any anatomical area of the hoof (toes, <b>dew</b> <b>claw,</b> heel and sole). Lesion severity scores was reported numerically (actual number of hooves involved) and presented as a proportion {{of the total number of}} hooves in the study.

40|$|No {{wild animal}} in North Carolina is as {{recognizable}} as the white-tailed deer. Whether a mature buck with splendid antlers, a graceful doe or a spotted fawn running with its mother, the white-tailed deer {{is one of}} the most pop-ular of animals. The five species of deer in North America are: the mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, caribou and moose. The white-tailed deer is prevalent in North Carolina, and the National Park Service has released elk in the mountains. Description A deer’s coat is usually a tannish brown, or some shade of brown, ranging almost to gray. It usually has a white patch on its neck and large prominent ears. Its eyes are circled with white and a white band rings the muzzle. The belly is white, with white running down the inside of the legs. The tail, about 9 to 11 inches long, is mostly brown although the underside is all white. The hooves have two toes covered with a hard fingernail-like material, and another toe, called the <b>dew</b> <b>claw,</b> appears about 3 inches high on the back of each leg...|$|E
40|$|Lameness is a multi-factorial {{condition}} {{that depends on}} managerial as well as genetic variables, but often is related to legs and feet condition of the animals. The aim {{of the study was}} to give an overview of legs and claws condition and the presence of lameness in sows at one industrial farm. Total 130 animals (90 dry i. e. pregnant and 40 lactating sows) were observed. The occurrence of leg joints swellings, than claws condition (toes length, <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> condition, cracked wall) and lameness (in animals in group boxes) were visually recorded and then classified according to the appropriate protocols. Findings proved the occurrence of one or more of examined conditions in 40 % of pregnant sows and in 45 % sows in lactation. In more than 20 % of pregnant sows lameness was presented. There was statistically significant positive correlation between the occurrence of lameness and leg swellings and between lameness and claw condition in pregnant sows (in both cases p< 0. 0001). The results show that lameness is a significant problem in the studied farm. In general, more attention should be given to monitoring of sows' physical condition and behaviour, to minimize the occurrence of welfare problems and to reduce production losses...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{characterize}} foot lesions, estimate their {{frequency and}} severity, and investigate {{their association with}} parity and lameness in three Greek farrow-to-finish swine herds. Materials and methods: The studied sows, which had been individually stalled during previous gestations, were examined for foot lesions upon entry into the lactation facilities. Lesions scored included heel hyperkeratinization, erosions or cracks, and toe and <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> overgrowths. When exiting the farrowing facilities, the sows were observed while walking along an alley and their degree of lameness was scored. Results: The proportion of sows {{with at least one}} lesion on any foot was very high and similar among herds, with 121 of 125 (96. 8 %), 123 of 125 (98. 4 %), and 377 of 386 (97. 7 %) sows affected in herds A, B, and C, respectively. The most frequent lesions were those located on the heel, and overgrown toes and dew claws. For these sites, lesion severity increased with sow parity. The concurrent presence of lesions on more than one foot site, on the same or different feet or both, had a multiplicative effect on the likelihood of lameness. Implications: Under the conditions in the herds participating in this study, sow foot lesions are extremely common, with older sows more likely than younger sows to have lesions on the heel and overgrown toes and dew claws. The degree of lameness may be affected by a causal interface among foot lesions...|$|E
50|$|The McNab Dog is bred for its working {{ability and}} is not {{recognized}} by the American Kennel Club (AKC). For this reason, {{the appearance of the}} McNab can vary considerably. The dog is medium sized with females standing 16-21 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30-50 pounds and males standing 18-25 inches at the shoulder and weighing 35-65 pounds. The dogs have a variety of ear sets from pricked ears to floppy ears and everything in between. Most McNabs are black or brown with white feet, white collars, white facial strips and white tipped tails, but tricolor McNabs are well known as well as mostly black McNabs. Some McNabs sport random white patches on their bodies and faces. Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored with occasional marble flecked or powder blue eyes. The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant. They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long. One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their cat-like feet which contribute to their agility. Another distinctive trait of the McNab is that it lacks <b>dew</b> <b>claws</b> on the rear feet, as opposed to the Border Collie where this is a common occurrence (per Gary Williams).|$|R

40|$|An online survey, using {{open and}} {{prompted}} response questions, was undertaken to collate {{the views of}} stakeholders on the priority welfare issues currently facing companion dogs (Canis familiaris) in Great Britain and on dogs' general quality of life. The stakeholder sectors targeted broadly comprised Education, Government, Industry, Charity and Veterinary. Overall, respondents described companion dogs as, at minimum, having a life worth living. Whether welfare issues were openly described or ranked within a set list, those of high priority in the perceptions of stakeholders matched those cited in published scientific literature; particularly, exaggerated physical features, inherited disease, obesity and inappropriate socialisation. Puppy farming and status dogs, which have been highlighted recently in the media, were also viewed as important. Lack of appropriate mental stimulation, irresponsible ownership and inappropriate environment were raised as priority issues by stakeholders and are underreported in scientific literature. Significant differences between stakeholder sectors in ranking of welfare issues perceived importance, urgency to rectify, impact (on the individual) or prevalence in Britain {{may be explained by}} vested interests, organisational roles, differences in terminology and the contexts within which stakeholders came into contact with companion dogs. Pet travel, <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> removal and complementary and alternative medicines were amongst those issues thought to be of least urgent welfare concern.

40|$|Claw lesions, {{which are}} {{nowadays}} {{very common in}} sows, {{are associated with a}} high risk of early culling and compromised welfare. In this study, we investigated the associations between the severity of claw lesions and three of the most important reproductive indicators, the number of live-born and weaned piglets and the wean-to-first service interval in three Greek farrow-to-finish herds. All studied sows were individually housed during their previous gestations. Sows were examined for lesions, which were scored on a severity scale, on several anatomical sites of the claws, before farrowing. Data on the examined reproductive indicators were retrieved from productivity databases of the herds. Because scoring of lesions on several claw sites resulted in many correlated variables for each sow examined, we employed factor analysis to create a smaller set of uncorrelated variables (factors) which contained all the information in the original variables and produced the corresponding factor scores. The number of live-born and weaned piglets was associated with the produced factor scores in two multivariable linear regression models, whereas the possible associations between the wean-to-first service interval and the factor scores was modelled with the use of zero-inflated negative binomial regression. The number of live-born piglets was negatively associated with factor scores representing lesions on heel (P <= 0. 001) and sole of front feet (P = 0. 019). The number of weaned piglets was also negatively associated with factor scores representing lesions on heel (P = 0. 003) of any foot, on sole of front feet (P = 0. 001) and on white line, sole and wall of rear feet (P = 0. 008), while the wean-to-first service interval was associated with factor scores representing lesions on heel of any foot (P = 0. 02), on sole of front feet (P = 0. 02) and of <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> length of front feet (P = 0. 009).

40|$|For swine {{production}} {{to be as}} efficient as possible and to value animal welfare, {{it is important to}} have robust and healthy pigs. A breeding sow that can thrive and nurture healthy piglets in different environments is a robust sow. There are very different ways to produce pork meat around the world, and to provide a healthy and hearty pig is essential to Topigs Norsvin to succeed in the world market. It is important to find traits that have an influence on production and are vital for economics, breeding and animal welfare, and to acquire an overview of the animals’ strengths and weaknesses. Records were used to estimate correlation and genetic parameters to find out whether the new traits in this project might be suitable to use in the breeding selection or not. Over a four-month-period, 1, 243 Norsvin Landrace breeding sows were recorded in this project in the US. The phenotypes used in this study are partly from my own data collection during my stay and partly from the InGris registration done at the same farm. The recording was divided in two phases; in the first phase, 34 traits were recorded, and after an evaluation, 23 traits were recorded in the second phase. In this MSc. Thesis, 19 traits were analyzed with a focus on leg and hoof traits. A medium heritability was estimated for the traits of dewclaw and toe length, at 0. 26 and 0. 49 respectively. Other leg traits, including assessment and swellings (bursitis tenosynovitis) was estimated to a low to medium (0. 17 and 0. 22) heritability. Traits indicating pain, as well as sow performance traits, gestation length and number of born piglets, was low h 2 (0. 16 and 0. 12). The traits may be genetically related to each other, so correlations were estimated. The genetic correlation between toe length and dewclaw length was highly positive (0. 95). The leg assessments were negatively correlated to hoof length (- 0. 09 and - 0. 44), while the front and hind assessment were highly correlated with each other (0. 74), and also correlated to bursitis/tenosynovitis. The arching of the back was correlated to hoof length and <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> length (0. 35 and 0. 61), whereas the gestation length and number of piglets born were negatively correlated (- 0. 49). Of the 19 traits investigated, the front and hind leg assessment had a low heritability, and majority of the pigs were too soft in the joints at full growth, and negatively correlated to hoof soundness. Looking at the results from the breeding values in this study, we can conclude that it is possible to include hoof length traits in the breeding goal. M-H...|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had <b>dew</b> <b>claws.</b> Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|R
40|$|For the {{investigation}} of the microvasculature of the bovine claw, an improved microcorrosion casting technique was developed. The new method was particularly adapted to surmount the difficulties of the examined vascular system, and rendered a complete vascular filling in all segments of the claw. Various injection media and techniques were tested and compared regarding filling degree and quality of the resulting microcorrosion cast. Completeness of vascular filling including the capillary bed was verified by histological examination of serial sections of plastic-injected specimens. Using the improved microcorrosion technique, 46 fore resp. hind limbs of adult cattle and three fore resp. hind limbs of calves aged eight to twelve weeks were cast. The arterial and venous blood supply of the fore and hind claw, particularly the vascular supply of the different segments of the claw and potential haemodynamic bottlenecks, were studied on the resulting microcorrosion specimens. Additionally, postmortal section-angiogramms of healthy and pathologically altered adult hind claws (heel horn erosion, double sole, digital dermatitis) were examined. By systematic scanning-electron-microscopic examination of the microcorrosion casts, the dermal and - if developed in the respective segment - subcutaneous microvascularisation of all segments of the claw was demonstrated for the first time. Special emphasis was laid on demonstrating the angio-architecture of the dermal papillae and lamellae, and differences between main and <b>dew</b> <b>claws</b> resp. between adult and juvenile claws. The results gained by scanning-electron-microscopy and the relation of subepidermal vessels and papillary body were verified by serial sections of all segments of the bovine claw. The angioarchitecture of the dermal papillae and lamellae of the different segments of the claw was closely related to the segment-specific formation of the papillary body. The basic pattern of the papillary vascular supply, comprising a centrally situated A. and V. papillaris which give rise to a segment-specific, subepidermal capillary net and form a peripheral capillary loop {{at the tip of the}} papilla, was confirmed for all segments of the claw. This basic vascular pattern showed segment-related modifications regarding size, form, direction and density of the vascular papillae, occurrence and density of the subepidermal capillary net and regarding length and contortion of the peripheral loop. In the dermal papillae, arteriovenous anastomoses could be demonstrated only sporadically. The marked two-dimensional laminar angioarchitecture was demonstrated in all areas of the wall segment. It consisted of centrally situated, axially orientated Aa. and Vv. lamellares, which branched in an arcadiform fashion and gave rise to a dense capillary and venular net at the base and ridge of the lamellae. At the base of the lamellae, direct and indirect arteriovenous anastomoses were demonstrated, but no regularity in their occurrence was detected. Arteriovenous anastomoses apparently do not play such an important role in the microcirculation of the pododerma as suggested in the literature. On six fore resp. hind limbs, histamine or lactate was administered before injection of the polymerising methacrylates. The influence of these vasoactive substances on the ungular vessels was studied on the resulting microcorrosion casts. In the papillae of all segments, only the central vascular loop of the dermal papillae is perfused under the influence of either histamine or lactate, whereas the circulation of the lamellae remains unaltered. But due to a dilation of the anastomosis between the dorsal branch of the arcus terminalis and the coronary vessels, the blood volume is partly shunted away from the wall segment. Comparing the results on main and dew resp. juvenile and adult claws, a relation between burdening of the claw and density and differentiation of the dermal papillary and lamellar blood vessels was detectable. Additional microcorrosion casts of five adult hind claws showing pathological alterations (heel horn erosion, double sole, white-line-disease, haemorrhages, wax-like consistency and yellow discoloration of the horn shoe, horn rings, digital dermatitis) were examined by scanning-electron-microscopy. The pathologically altered specimens featured an enlargement of the papillary surface by further partitioning of the papillary body, presumably as compensational adaptation to local ischaemia caused by improper or over-burdening of the claw. <br...|$|R
40|$|Sow {{productive}} lifetime {{continues to}} challenge U. S. commercial swine herds and worldwide pork operations in general. The increased prevalence of hoof abnormalities (e. g. hoof and <b>dew</b> <b>claw</b> overgrowth, hoof wall cracks, and foot pad abrasions) in cull sow populations observed at harvest lend {{evidence to the}} hypothesis that these abnormalities are detrimental to sow performance. The objectives of this thesis were four-fold. The first objective was to summarize sow behaviors associated with increased sow welfare productive lifetime, specifically maintenance (feed and drink), social (aggression, sow-piglet interaction, and expression of sexual behaviors), and stereotypical behaviors. Results from this review suggest that detrimental behaviors were stereotypical behaviors such as bar bitting, aggression between sows through lower feed intake, aggression toward caretakers, and piglet savaging and cannibalism. The second objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of excessive toe growth, presence of cracks in the outer hoof wall, and the difference in length between the medial and lateral toe of the hoof on lactation performance and sow behavior in mid-lactation. This study concluded that sows with overgrown toes stand less than sows with normal hooves, and those findings are consistent with other studies. Sows were observed standing and eating between 3. 3 and 9. 1 % of the observation period, and, of the variables collected, eating was the primary activity performed while standing. Post feeding, each OG lesion score increase was associated with a 40. 0 % decrease in time spent standing and eating. This observation held true for total time spent standing and eating during the observation period [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0. 45]. Results from this study demonstrate that foot lesions can impair productivity and behavior of lactating sows. The degree to which foot lesions impair production and behavior is dependent on lesion type and severity. The third objective {{of this study was to}} estimate observer accuracy and repeatability of body condition scoring sows when scorers have different levels of prior experience. Participants body condition scores were positively associated with body condition scores (BCS) derived by backfat measurements. Averaging over all participants, the ultrasonic trait of last rib backfat yielded the greatest correlation (0. 58) with BCS using a 9 -pt scale, followed by tenth rib backfat (0. 51), tenth rib loin eye area (0. 47), and last rib loin eye area (0. 43). Similar trends were observed for the BCS 5 scale. Therefore, practice assigning independent BCS should lower repeatability variance, but training to calibrate specific participants may only influence total test variance to a relatively small degree. The final objective of this study was to estimate the amount of feed and associated costs of adding body weight to cull sows, in an evaluation to improve producer profitability. Adding BW to cull sows could be profitable in the presence of $ 0. 11 / kg feed prices and labor and housing costs of $ 0. 25 / d per sow...|$|E
