40|$|External bonding of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{composites}} is now {{a well-established}} technique for the strengthening/retrofit of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. In particular, confinement of RC columns with FRP jackets {{has proven to be}} very effective in enhancing the strength and ductility of columns, and has become a key technique for the seismic retrofit of RC structures. Despite the large amount of research on the behavior of RC columns confined with FRP, little research has been conducted on the behavior of RC frames with FRP-confined columns. For the seismic retrofit of RC frames with FRP, apart from the structural response of a retrofitted frame, an important issue is how to deploy the least amount of the FRP material to achieve the required upgrade in seismic performance. With these two issues in mind, this paper presents an optimization technique for the performance-based seismic FRP retrofit design of RC building <b>frames.</b> The <b>thicknesses</b> of FRP jackets used for the confinement of columns are taken as the design variables, and minimizing the volume and hence the material cost of the FRP jackets is the design objective in the optimization procedure.

To this end, a local ice load model is re-evaluated using a probabilistic analysis of full scale data, probabilities of failure for plating are calculated and plate thickness is optimised. [...] Full scale data for the MV Canmar Kigoriak and USCGC Polar Sea were ranked; curves were fitted through the tail of each data set; and Type-I extreme probability, distributions were derived for the three panel sizes. The Canmar Kigoriak data were then subdivided based on contact area and a simulation was performed to derive the load distributions on subregions of the instrumented panel. Finally, a local ice load model which accounts for annual number of impacts and exposure was confirmed. [...] To evaluate the strength of bow plating, three limit states (three-hinge collapse, permanent set and membrane collapse) were selected.

We explored the potential of a new AQ approach for defining regional WMA. This approach processes RF and integrated backscatter data on-line and displays the endocardial motion as it moves from diastole through systole in a color-encoded manner. Triggered by R wave, as the LV contracts, the automatically extracted border is given designated colors for each frame. As the wall moves {{during the first few}} millisec (first frame) it is given one color; then as it moves further during the subsequent frames, various color layers are added on-line. If the wall moves outwards (dyskinesis), a bluish-gray color is displayed. The thickness of a given color layer represents the magnitude of excursion during that <b>frame.</b> The overall <b>thickness</b> of all layers represent the overall wall motion from diastole to systole. By looking at the end-systolic frame alone, the extent of regional wall motion and the temporal characteristics can be ascertained. We employed this color-encoded AQ approach in 17 patients with CAD. WMS, based on conventional methods was derived by an experienced echocardiographer from a total of 172 segments from 2 D Echo images alone. This was compared to WMS derived by another observer from the end-systolic frame of color-encoded AQ. In addition, inter-observer variability for each method was evaluated. ResultsMean WMS was 1. 4 ± 0. 8 by 2 DE alone, and 1. 4 ± 0. 7 by color-encoded AQ. Correlation between Color-encoded AQ (y) and 2 DE WMS (x) was y= 0. 6 x+ 0. 6, r= 0. 71, P< 0. 001. Inter-observer concordances were: 83 % for 2 DE: r= 80; 88 % for Color-encoded AQ: r= 0. 86. Besides displaying the overall extent of motion, color-encoded AQ allowed easy appraisal of the temporal abnormalities in regional contraction. We conclude that color-encoded AQ offers for the first time an on-line method for semi-quantitative evaluation of spatial and temporal abnormalities in regional LV function with less interobserver variability...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{reaction}} to fire performanceof wood and other building products, andparticularly thematerial fire properties time to ignition, rate of heat releaseand smoke production. These properties have been measured by asmall-scale fire test method, the Cone Calorimeter, andpresented for different types of building products. Uncertainty analysis, included instrument and assumptionuncertainty, has been performed for the case that both O 2 andCO 2 are measured for calculation of {{the rate of heat}} release inthe Cone Calorimeter. The partial derivatives for theuncertainty analysis are given. The relative uncertainty forthe rate of heat release measurements in the Cone Calorimeteris between ± 5 % to ± 10 % for rate of heat releasevalues larger than about 50 kW/m 2. The time to ignition in the Cone Calorimeter is compatiblewith the time to ignition in the ISO Ignitability test, whichis the main test method for measuring time to ignition. Thetime to ignition is an increasing linear function of density. The rate of heat release in the Cone Calorimeter is dependentof material thickness and of use of retainer <b>frame.</b> Thematerial <b>thickness</b> gives the heat release curve duration andshape. Thin materials have short burning time and two maximumvalues. Thick materials have long burning time and when thematerial is thicker than about 35 mm no second maximum appears. When the retainer frame is used the actual exposed surface isreduced from 0. 01 m 2 to 0. 0088 m 2, the rate of heat release isreduced and the burning time is increased. A comparison ofresults with and without use of the retainer frame gives thenequal results when the exposed area is set to 0. 0088 m 2 in thecase of using the retainer frame. The time to flashover in the full-scale room corner test waspredicted on the basis of Cone Calorimeter data at 50 kW/m 2 bya power law of ignition time, the total heat release calculatedover 300 s after ignition and the density of the product. Therelation gives a simple relation to evaluate if a productreaches flashover in the room corner test. The smoke production has also been measured in the ConeCalorimeter. The white light and the laser smoke measurementsystems have shown similar results. There is a correlationbetween Cone Calorimeter and room corner test smoke productionwhen the products are divided into groups: those that reachflashover in the room corner test in less than 10 min and thosethat have more than 10 min to flashover. Temperature profilesin wood have been measured in the Cone Calorimeter by a simpletechnique. The effect of fire protective gypsum plasterboardson the charring of wood frame members has been determined andcompared with fullscale furnace wall tests. The protectiveeffects of twenty different boards have been presented. ConeCalorimeter and furnace tests show similar charring of wooduntil the boards fall down in furnace tests. After that, thecharring of wood is higher in the furnace, because the wood isexposed directly to the fire.

40|$|The Asakusa metro line is my {{response}} to our collective semester 2 project 'Nine Quarter city' - a generic city comprised of 9 actual cities to create distinct 'quarter's' all woven into an overall urban order. Being assigned none other than Tokyo - a major global city and technology hub - my design aims to reflect the unique atmosphere of Japan's capital, home to twelve million people. Bearing this in mind, I decided {{that it would be}} near impossible to recreate the complexity and bustle of the megacity. Thus early on, my concept was one of simplicity. In developing my design, it was key that the station be close to roads and walkways as well as central with respect to other sites. I decided on this particular location for these reasons, especially as it is situated on the major diagonal axis of our generic 'nine quarter city'. After deciding on the location of my site, the next step really was to understand my context. Using google earth as a guide, I noticed that the surrounding buildings were of similar height (a characteristic particularly of Asakusa) and confined to an order - making up the 'hard edge' of the streetscape. I tried to embody simplicity in numerous ways, essentially: - using a rectangle as the basis of my design - to emphasise straight, clean lines - double height ground floor - so the vastness and openness of the space is appreciated - inclusion of a Schwedler dome - a pure geometric form to which the eye can be drawn, while also symbolising the hub of the building. It that it is here the circulation takes place and movement can be seen notably through the criss-cross arrangement of escalators through the floors. - the use of a steel <b>frame</b> and double <b>thickness</b> glass. However, though I didn't want to compete vertically with the surrounding buildings, I felt {{at the same time there}} was a need for my building to be a part of what train stations typically symbolise - ie a recognisable meeting point for social interaction. I felt one way that I could make it stand out was not only by the inclusion of a glass space framed dome, but an interesting façade. I wanted the final facade to de different from the normal high tech Tokyo façade - in that it represents calm and simplicity in such an energetic city. I tried to achieve this by use of delicate, tessellating shapes and repeating the pattern on the glass façade. - not to block off the surrounding world, but merely screen the brutality of it.

40|$|This thesis {{document}} was issued {{under the authority}} of another institution, not NPS. At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library collection for reasons not now known. It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. The objective of this thesis is to obtain an understanding of the variation in stress on the cardinal axes of a circular penetration with elliptical reinforcements in a simulated stiffened cylindrical pressure vessel. The size and location of the circular penetration is such that the continuity of one of the ring frames has been destroyed. The biaxial compressive loading of a pressure vessel has been obtained by superimposing the stress distribution obtained on the free boundary with a loading parallel to the ring frames representing hoop stress and the stress distribution obtained with a loading at right angle to the ring frames representing longitudinal stress. By a systematic variation of the reinforcement geometry and the weight of reinforcement materials, the relationship between the stress concentration factors, geometry and weight of material has been investigated. The photoelastic method of experimental stress analysis was chosen as the means of carrying out the investigation. The standard crossed circular polariscope was used in studying the isochromatic fringe patterns. The two-dimensional models were constructed with PS- 5 material from Photoelastic, Incorporated. All models were built upon a basic foundation of 4 " x 4 " x 1 / 4 " material with a central 1 - 1. 4 " diameter circular hole. The effects of the various geometries and weights of reinforcement were investigated by using three basic families of geometrical shapes in which a sequence of five steps in the reinforcement thicknesses were made for each family. For the particular series of geometries investigated, the best geometry for the reinforcement is the circular family which consisted of models 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. This series shows the lowest stress concentration factors for a given thickness or weight of reinforcement material. A comparison was made between the stress obtained by a strain gage and the stress obtained by photoelastic analysis. the result showed close agreement between the two techniques of experimental stress analysis. The complicated interrelationships if all the variables that ultimately specify the geometries associated with a penetration in a stiffened cylindrical pressure vessel indicate that today each specific configuration must be analyzed on an individual basis. To attempt to interrelate such parameters as pressure vessel <b>thickness,</b> <b>frame</b> size, frame shape, frame spacing and penetration size in order to obtain an all inclusive design procedure for optimum reinforcement would appear to require an extensive model testing program. These results might then serve as a basis from which to derive design procedures. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} work {{is to develop a}} velocity dependent ice flexural failure model through numerical investigation of ship icebreaking process. In addition, the present work involves development of Excel-VBA software using this flexural failure model to determine ice impact load, minimum plate <b>thickness,</b> <b>frame</b> dimensions and safe speed methodology for Polar ships. First of all, individual material models of ice crushing, ice flexure and water foundation are developed using the FEM software package LS DYNA. Two different material models of ice are used to represent the ice crushing and ice flexure. The input parameters of these ice material models are selected from numerically conducted ice crushing test and four point bending test. The water foundation effect is modeled using a simple linear elastic material. The material models are incorporated into the numerical models of ship icebreaking. Two collision scenarios are considered for the ship icebreaking models; a head-on collision with a flat inclined ship face and a shoulder collision with an R-Class ship. In these models, the rigid ship impacts a cantilever ice wedge. The ice wedge rests on the water surface. Both collision scenarios are investigated with and without considering radial cracks in the level ice. The ice impact force and wedge breaking length are extracted from these numerical models of ship ice wedge breaking. Results indicate that the ship velocity, normal ship frame angle, ice wedge angle, ice thickness and radial crack significantly affect the breaking process. At higher ship velocities, the bending crack location shifts toward the ice crushing zone and results in a higher impact force. Higher impact force is produced for thicker ice, higher wedge angle and lower ship normal frame angle at a particular ship velocity. The existence of radial cracks reduces the magnitude of impact force and influences the breaking patterns. A methodology is presented to estimate the dynamic ice failure load using existing static failure models and dynamic amplification factors. The comparative study with these dynamic failure loads indicates that the developed numerical model results are in good agreement. A flexural failure model is developed based on validated numerical model results. The model provides velocity dependent force required to break an ice wedge in flexure. The developed model is validated with full scale test data and with non-linear finite element based dynamic bending model results. Application of this model is demonstrated to estimate the limit bow impact load and design ice load parameters. Finally, the Excel-VBA software “Safe Speed Check for Polar Ships” is developed using the velocity dependent flexural failure model and Polar Rules based limit state equations. This software and the velocity dependent flexural failure model are believed to help in establishing a rational basis for safe speed methodology as well as in improving ship structural standards and assessing ice management capability...|$|R
