He was a blacksmith and farmer who grew and sold eucalyptus trees {{used to protect}} crops from the seasonal Santa Ana winds that originated inland and brought strong, hot, extremely dry winds to the treeless plain. Settlers Gottfried Maulhardt and Christian Borchard along with Christian's son, John Edward, and nephew, Caspar began farming with 30 acres of wheat and barley in 1867. New markets for the grain opened up when a shipping wharf was first constructed in 1871 at Hueneme. Irish immigrant Dominick McGrath arrived in 1874 {{with his wife and}} children to begin farming on the plain. Johnnas Diedrich, with his bride, Matilda, began a new life of farming in 1882 having come from Hanover, Germany. Lima beans eventually became the dominant crop but farmers were actively <b>growing</b> <b>trial</b> fields of sugar beets in 1897. New Jerusalem was founded in 1875 along the south bank of the Santa Clara River. The community, eventually renamed El Rio, was along the route between Ventura and Hueneme.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of feeding olive trees pruning {{by-products}} (leaves and twigs) treated biologically and chemically on ewe lambs performance, nutrients digestibility and some rumen and blood parameters. Three <b>growing</b> <b>trials</b> were carried out using female lambs (about 12. 8 Kg and 4 months old) as followed: T (1) : CFM + berseem hay (control). T (2) : CFM +olive leaves and twigs treated with urea and T (3) : CFM +olive leaves and twigs treated with T. viride+ S. cerevisiae.

Initial body weight was almost the same for the different lamb groups (12. 84 kg). However, the final body weight was differed among treatments, urea treatment T 2 and biological treatment T 3 showed higher final body weight than the control group (T 1) being 38. 70, 37. 77 and 37. 25 kg, respectively, but, average daily gain had the same trend of live body weight. Economic conversion was highest for urea treatment (T 2) followed by treatment with T. viride and S. cerevisiae (T 3) than control group. (T 2) and (T 3) were less slightly efficient in converting TDN and DCP into gain compared to control group. Concerning the chemical composition of olive by-products, the data showed that urea and biological treatments increased CP content and decreased CF content and its fraction.

40|$|Efficiency of {{methionine}} hydroxy analog as {{a source}} of metabolizable methionine was examined in a growing and a grazing trial. In the <b>growing</b> <b>trial,</b> a basal diet of 44 % corncobs and 44 % sorghum silage (Sorhum bicolar (L.)) with 12 % supplement (DM basis) was fed individually to yearling crossbred steers. Steers were supplemented with urea, meat and bone meal (MBM), and MBM plus methionine hydroxy analog (MHA). Methionine hydroxy analog was added to MBM at gradually increasing levels up to 17 g/d/head. The grazing trial was conducted with yearling steers grazing smooth bromegrass (Brontus inermis Leyss.) from May 8 to August 1, 1997. Steers were individually supplemented daily with energy control, energy control + gradually increased MHA, and SoyPass (escape protein source) + MHA. Supplementing with MHA did not improve gains of steers in either trial. Methionine hydroxy analog did not affect feed intake in the <b>growing</b> <b>trial,</b> but supplement consumption was decreased at 17 g/d level in the grazing trial. Blood plasma methionine levels of treatments were not effected by MHA. Increased levels of MHA up to 17 g/d/head failed to provide an adequate level of metabolizable methionine in both trials. ^ Three experiments were conducted with ruminally cannulated steers to evaluate neutral detergent insoluble protein (NDIP) content of omasal samples as an escape protein estimation technique. In experiment 1, smooth brome hay escape protein (EP) values were determined with the NDIP technique and omasal sampling purine technique (OSPT). The escape protein values were not different as measured by these two techniques. In experiment 2, smooth bromegrass EP values were estimated in June and August, 1996. In situ and OSPT estimated similar EP values, but EP estimates from NDIP were lower. Experiment 3 was conducted from May through July, 1997. Omasal sampling purine technique estimated the highest EP values. In experiments 2 and 3, NDIP had better correlation with OSPT than with the in situ technique. Coefficients of variation of OSPT were higher than for NDIP. Escape protein content of forages can be estimated more precisely by NDIP. ...|$|E

Pigs administered pST during the growing phase continued to have 10 % less backfat, which resulted in a 1. 6 % greater yield of lean cuts. Postinjection growth rate of pST-treated pigs was significantly reduced for the initial 2 wk to cause an overall reduced ADG during the finishing period. Days to reach slaughter did not differ with treatment because those pigs previously receiving pST were heavier initially.

The levels of all 7 PAHs in chemically amended soil, both planted and unplanted, fell significantly (> 80 % reduction) over the 12 weeks of the <b>growing</b> <b>trial.</b> In the coal tar treated soils all PAHs were significantly reduced.

The 3 - 4 ringed compounds demonstrated strong evidence of phytoremediation but not the 5 - 6 ringed. The coking soil showed limited reduction (7 - 24 %) of all 12 PAHs present. There was little difference in dissipation between the PAHs and little evidence of a phytoremediation effect in coking soil.

40|$|Four {{research}} {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate the influence of dietary enzyme inclusion (phytase and NSPase) on broiler performance parameters, processing yields, and bone mineralization. In Experiment 1, a 35 -day <b>grow</b> out <b>trial</b> was conducted to investigate the effect of three commercially available phytase enzymes on growth performance and bone mineralization in phosphorus deficient corn/soy based diets. Increasing the level of available phosphorus (aP) in the control diets resulted in improved bird performance and bone ash data. The presence of dietary phytase in phosphorus deficient diets resulted in improvements in growth parameters and bone mineralization. Regression analysis confirmed that phytase supplementation can potentially increase the bioavailability of phosphorus in broiler diets up to 0. 15 to 0. 20 percent, however, the responses varied according to the enzyme used and inclusion level. In Experiment 2, a 42 -day <b>grow</b> out <b>trial</b> was conducted to analyze the effects of NSPase inclusion on broiler performance and processing parameters when supplemented in diets with varying protein and energy concentrations. Reduced protein and energy levels reduced bird performance throughout the trial. The inclusion of both NSPase enzymes resulted in improvements in feed conversion throughout the starter and grower periods (day 26 of age). The results from this trial showed that NSPase inclusion can improve broiler performance and processing parameters. In Experiments 3 and 4, a battery trial and a floor trial {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of phytase and NSPase enzyme co-administration on growth and bone ash in low phosphorus diets. Increasing the level of available phosphorus resulted in increased bird performance and bone ash. The inclusion of phytase enhanced bird performance and bone mineralization.

The enhanced effects associated with dual administration of phytase and NSPase were not observed in a full <b>grow</b> out <b>trial</b> during later stages of growth.

One approach is the use of growing trials in pots with various mixtures of the material. In extract-based tests, seeds are germinated in petri dishes and exposed to an exudate from the material to be tested. In this study, one of these methods, the Phytotoxkit microbiotest, was compared to the standard phytotoxicity test with Lactuca sativa as used by the RHP foundation. The Phytotoxkit test was performed in transparent test containers which allow for direct observation and length measurements of the seedlings by means of image analysis. Two dicotyles (Lepidium sativum and Sinapis alba) and one monocotyle (Sorghum saccharatum) were used.
