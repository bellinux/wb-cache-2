5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} Serial {{originated}} with {{an experiment in}} Koenig's basement. Koenig and Snyder had pitched a different idea at a staff meeting for a weekly program on events during the previous seven days, which staff members received without enthusiasm. When Ira Glass asked Koenig <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> other ideas, she mentioned podcasting a story that unfolded over time, a serialized narrative. In an interview with Mother Jones, she explained that each episode {{would return to the}} same story, telling the next chapter of a long, true narrative.|$|E
500|$|One of Steinholt's {{campaign}} promises {{was to put}} an end to the activities of the petroleum industry close to Lofoten and Vesterålen because of potentially hazardous effects on the environment. When asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> political allies in parliament who could help her, Steinholt replied, [...] "Our most important partners are not in Parliament [...] those organisations whose main goal is to improve conditions for the Norwegian people. We must ensure that the Public Action For an Oil-Free Lofoten and Vesterålen will be heard".|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time that she {{approached}} Carter about writing an episode, Anderson was also receiving offers from several television networks to direct shows. She, however, had never directed before, and decided that she would first attempt to helm an episode of The X-Files before branching out into other series. Anderson thus expressed her wish to direct the episode when she pitched the original idea for [...] "all things". Carter accepted her story, but did not appoint her as director until all the revisions and rewrites had been completed. Anderson worked with series director Kim Manners {{for the majority of the}} episode, later noting that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> questions, she would approach Manners first. To help Anderson, Manners gave her directing exercises, such as making a list of shots for every scene. The episode also marked the first time that a woman had helmed the direction of an episode of The X-Files.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{then asked}} Ono <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{unreleased}} recordings by Lennon, so she sent him cassette tapes of four songs. [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was recorded by Lennon in 1977, {{in his and}} Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, [...] "Free—as a boid" [...] (bird). The other songs were [...] "Grow Old With Me", [...] "Real Love", and [...] "Now and Then". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: [...] "People have said it was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, {{but it was all}} settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} can," [...] said Miss Cushing, [...] "and I say that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> friends in Plainton,--and {{everybody}} knows she has,--it's {{time for them}} to do something!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>she,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> of the Sergeant's {{spirit in}} her. She doesn't {{look like a}} skeary thing, at all. Leave it to me, then, Eau-douce, and I will manage the affair alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you would}} be so good. I would give it up at once <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> feeling against it, and go somewhere else--and of course <b>she</b> <b>has!</b> <b>She</b> never can forget what I did!" ...|$|R
500|$|Alongside {{a series}} of unpopular films, {{problems}} arose from Hepburn's attitude. She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative. When asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> children, she snapped back, [...] "Yes I have five: two white and three colored." [...] She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname [...] "Katharine of Arrogance". The public was also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure. Hepburn sensed {{that she needed to}} leave Hollywood, so she returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. It had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, [...] "I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Boys and Girls" [...] was {{directed}} by Dennie Gordon; {{it was written by}} B. J. Novak, who plays Ryan Howard on the show. The genesis for the episode came from cast members Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer. The two originally formulated an idea while spending time together on the set of The Office: [...] "What if Jan came into the office and did a 'Women in the Workplace' seminar, and Michael got all jealous?" [...] They presented their idea to executive producer Greg Daniels, who liked the idea. Daniels subsequently assigned the idea to Novak, who crafted the final episode. Pam's monologue on reading about a girl who lived in a house with a terrace was based on a real book from the Choose Your Own Adventure series, although not specifically identified as such in the episode read by Jenna Fischer when she was a child. When the show's cast and crew appeared at the Paley Center, Fischer related that Novak asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> personal stories that could relate to what Pam was feeling at the time the episode was being written. She then came up with the storybook idea, which was immediately written and filmed for the episode.|$|E
500|$|In season five, Mary Alice {{appears in}} {{multiple}} flashbacks in [...] "The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened", including when handyman Eli Scruggs (Beau Bridges) was first starting out and approached Mary Alice on the street, asking her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> work for him. After initially declining, she notices {{a hole in}} his shoe and says she has a broken vase that he can glue back together for her. Years later, on the day Mary Alice committed suicide, Eli was at her house dropping something off. He asks if she is alright, to which she says she is, and just as he is about to leave she picks up the vase he glued for her and says she wants him to have it. Eli asks again if she is alright, and she politely asks him to leave. Later that day, after Mary Alice had shot herself, Eli watches police cars and neighbors gossiping from afar, regretting that he did nothing to save her. He then makes a vow to God to not only fix people's belongings but their lives as much as he can as well. In season six, Mary Alice again appears in a flashback in [...] "Epiphany", when she notices four-year-old Eddie Orlofsky (Davin Ransom) witnessing his father leave their family. Mary Alice continues to check on Eddie and his mother Barbara (Diane Farr), bringing them a hot meal and later to bring a teddy bear for Eddie, where she finds the young child left home alone. Mary Alice finds Barbara in a bar, brings her home and scolds her for her poor parenting skills.|$|E
50|$|Aoi Senoh as with Chie, she is {{very similar}} to her My-HiME incarnation, and still hangs around Chie. She is also very {{friendly}} towards Mayo, and is friends with Akane. It is unknown <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> MiKO powers.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's good as that, {{but better}} as seasoning," [...] said Hetty. [...] "You come and stand {{outside the door}} till I ask my lady friend <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> objections. And don't run away with that letter of {{recommendation}} before I come out." ...|$|R
50|$|Jimmy {{requests}} {{an immediate}} mistrial. The judge denies a mistrial and rules {{that the jury}} may consider Sharon's outburst and that <b>she</b> will <b>have</b> waived her Fifth Amendment right and can be subjected to cross-examination by the prosecution <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> more such outburst in the courtroom.|$|R
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
2500|$|Asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{advice for}} young women, Wilkie said: [...] "If {{you want to}} serve your country, your gender is not an issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once, {{asked what}} was her {{favourite}} role, she answered: [...] "Isolde made me famous. Turandot made me rich". When long-time Metropolitan Opera director Sir Rudolf Bing was asked if she was difficult, he reportedly said, [...] "Not at all. You put enough money in, and a glorious voice comes out". When Nilsson was preparing her taxes and was asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> dependents, she replied, [...] "Yes, just one, Rudolf Bing".|$|E
50|$|Haruka Suzushiro is the Secretary General of Fuuka Academy, {{and just}} like her My-HiME incarnation, she deals with all the discipline. It is not yet known <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> MiKO powers, though it was stated that {{she is one of}} the most {{powerful}} telekinetic wielders of the Academy.|$|R
50|$|Gwen {{is asked}} by O' Mara <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> clue on who the killer might be {{and she tells}} him about a guy that Rosie called Mr. Creepy.

50|$|Knight Light - (voiced by Noël Wells) Represents England. Has a lot {{in common}} with Prock, both being the team lead and falling a bit short in the powers department. Her powers (<b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any)</b> are unknown, though her name {{indicate}} that they might be low level light powers, possibly the power to glow.|$|R
2500|$|Orbison {{also began}} collaborating with Bill Dees, {{whom he had}} known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote [...] "It's Over", a {{number one in the}} UK, and a song that would be one of his {{signature}} pieces {{for the rest of his}} career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> money. Dees said, [...] "A pretty woman never needs any money". Just 40 minutes later, [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman" [...] was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet [...] "mercy" [...] Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the US and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It hit number one in the UK as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies. Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as Billboard magazine noted, [...] "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the only American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "See," [...] she added, [...] "what {{we found}} within. A Popish relic, is it not? Colet and Mistress Gale were for making {{away with it}} at once, {{but it seemed to}} me that it was a token whereby the poor babe's friends may know her again, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> kindred not lost at sea." ...|$|R
5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who is {{preparing}} for her first date with Mark (Paul Schneider), worriedly asks Leslie (Amy Poehler) <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> reservations, since Leslie previously had feelings for him.

6000|$|... "You are, I've no doubt," [...] {{said her}} mother. [...] "Mary is a good-natured, {{accommodating}} girl,--always {{ready to do}} kindnesses, and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> unwillingness to lend any thing to you, it must be that you have created it yourself, by some misconduct. So that it will prove, no doubt, {{that you are the}} one to be punished." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I should wish {{to say to}} you, sir, before you go upstairs," [...] the woman went on. [...] "Don't trust the lady with more money at a time than the money that is wanted for the day's housekeeping. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> to spare, it's as likely {{as not to be}} wasted on her good-for-nothing husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We heard {{a report}} of Betty Lapthorn's child having another fit," [...] said Agnes, [...] "and set off to see; {{but it turned out}} to be a false alarm.
