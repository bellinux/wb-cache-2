5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention with David Brinkley. [...] "I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years," [...] Jennings said, [...] "so here was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to co-anchor with David Brinkley in 1984, and he wasn't even sure I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right."

500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue.

[...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to work this and still make it read?'

Writing for Los Angeles Times, David Gritten opined Madonna's voice sounded [...] "pitch-perfect and clear as a bell". Greg Morago, from the Hartford Courant, felt that [...] "By giving her 'Another Suitcase' with its heartbreaking 'Where am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to?' refrain, Madonna adds a necessary, fragile vulnerability to her ambitious, rags- to-riches Eva Peron". Neil Strauss from The Herald Journal, said that [...] "Madonna radiates on 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall'". Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, described the track as [...] "a poignant, winsome exploration of pathos, defilement, and resolution sung by a young, struggling Eva forced into prostitution {{with a series of}} drab johns".|$|E

In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described [...] "City of Angels" [...] as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, [...] "It's the story of my brother and <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land." [...] Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams.
