5|$|The {{brain is}} not fully understood, and {{research}} is ongoing. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the human brain works. The boundaries between the specialties of neuroscience, neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> and are much more difficult to study.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, {{it is impossible to}} do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E

5|$|This is {{repeated}} until (2:32), when the drumbeat gradually fades out, {{leaving only the}} ride cymbal keeping the beat, and the guitars, which repeat a melody based around the chord of A major, using harmonics. At (3:11), the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at (3:42) into a distortion-laden chord progression, using the chords F♯ minor, D major, and A major. At (3:46), a guitar solo is played over these chords. This continues until (5:09), after all instruments <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> out except for the tremolo-laden feedback of the guitar.|$|E
5|$|Traditional hunters {{used all}} parts of the walrus. The meat, often preserved, is an {{important}} winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets, and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, Sultan Bayezid {{arrived with}} a large army {{to the south of}} the town and took up a strong {{defensive}} position, challenging the crusaders to meet him. The crusader army moved to confront him on 24 September, but poor discipline and fractured leadership between the national factions resulted in a premature assault by the French force against the bluffs controlled by Ottoman troops. With the allied army strung out, Bayezid marshaled his reserves and defeated the crusaders in a furious engagement in which fell most of the allied army. Thousands more were captured and executed after the battle by the victorious Turkish troops. The exact fate of Sir Jean de Carrouges {{in the midst of this}} melee is unknown but it is probable that he fell close to his commander Jean de Vienne, whose forces were trapped in a gully and decimated by Turkish cavalry. Following his death, his estates passed to his ten-year-old son Robert and a mural of Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges was painted in the Abbey of St. Etienne in Caen to celebrate his memory. Since that time however, both the family and mural <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> into obscurity.|$|E

25|$|In February 1795, Babeuf {{was arrested}} again, and the Tribun du peuple was solemnly burnt in the Théatre des Bergeres by the jeunesse dorée, young men whose {{mission was to}} root out Jacobinism. Babeuf might <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> into obscurity like other agitators, but for the appalling {{economic}} conditions caused by the fall {{in the value of}} assignats.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{present at}} the time of Mozart's death {{eventually}} committed their memories to writing, either on their own or through interviews by others. The stories they told are not entirely mutually compatible, which may be due in part to some of the events not being recorded until the 1820s, when the witnesses' memories might <b>have</b> <b>faded.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Communist Party {{has sought}} to {{play an active role}} in the U.S. labor {{movement}} since its origins as part of its effort to build a mass movement of American workers to bring about their own liberation through socialist revolution. As the prospects for such a social cataclysm <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> over time, the party has increasingly emphasized the ameliorative value of trade unions in capitalist society.|$|E
25|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{immediately}} {{came under}} fire from some critics for altering Boris, particularly in France, where his revision was introduced. The defense usually made by his supporters was that without his ministrations, Mussorgsky's opera would <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> from the repertory due to difficulty in appreciating his raw and uncompromising idiom. Therefore, Rimsky-Korsakov was justified in making improvements to keep the work alive and increase the public's awareness of Mussorgsky's melodic and dramatic genius.|$|E
25|$|Hancock married Margaret Hay Sweet Escott in 1899 and {{the couple}} had four children. He {{suffered}} from abdominal pain for 18 months, which in December 1909 became worse and {{he was forced to}} rest in bed for four weeks. Initially the symptoms appeared to <b>have</b> <b>faded,</b> but the acute pain returned, and Hancock required an operation for appendicitis. The operation was successful, and Hancock was making a good recovery until four days later. He died of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis the following day.|$|E

25|$|Politicians {{frequently}} {{discuss their}} religion when campaigning, and fundamentalists and black Protestants are highly politically active. However, {{to keep their}} status as tax-exempt organizations they must not officially endorse a candidate. Historically Catholics were heavily Democratic before the 1970s, while mainline Protestants comprised {{the core of the}} Republican Party. Those patterns <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> away—Catholics, for example, now split about 50–50. However, white evangelicals since 1980 have made up a solidly Republican group that favors conservative candidates. Secular voters are increasingly Democratic.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} residents' {{associations}} {{have been established}} over time but many <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> as housing areas have matured. One of those still functioning, the St. Anne's Residents' Association (SARA), with some allied bodies, operates a community hall on All Saints' Drive, while the Grange Woodbine Association has hall facilities on Station Road. An umbrella body, the Federation of Raheny Residents, was very active up to the 1980s but has been little seen in recent times, aside from working on a (decorative but working) millennium clock, sited in the village centre.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{commonly}} used today, half dollar coins {{have a long}} history of heavy use alongside other denominations of coinage, but <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> out of general circulation for many reasons. They were produced in fairly large quantities until the year 2002, when the U.S. Mint ceased production of the coin for general circulation. As a result of its decreasing usage, a large amount of pre-2002 half dollars remain in Federal Reserve vaults, prompting the change in production. Presently, collector half dollars can be ordered straight from the U.S. Mint, and pre-2002 circulation half dollars may be ordered through most U.S. banks.|$|E

25|$|Snowdrops are hardy {{herbaceous}} {{plants that}} perennate by underground bulbs. They {{are among the}} earliest spring bulbs to bloom, although a few forms of G. nivalis are autumn flowering. In colder climates, they will emerge through snow (see illustration). They naturalise relatively easily forming large drifts. These are often sterile, found near human habitation, and also former monastic sites. The leaves die back {{a few weeks after}} the flowers <b>have</b> <b>faded.</b> Galanthus plants are relatively vigorous and may spread rapidly by forming bulb offsets. They also spread by dispersal of seed, animals disturbing bulbs, and water if disturbed by floods.|$|E
25|$|Emerson Bainbridge died in 1892 and {{his sons}} took over the business. In that same year, Bainbridge's {{employed}} a staff of 600 in Newcastle, and the store had 11,705 square yards of floor space. In 1897 the business became a private limited company. During the Depression, which hit the Newcastle area badly, the store introduced agents who operated in less prosperous areas, collecting payments in weekly instalments. This meant that people on low incomes could continue to buy from the shop and it kept the Bainbridge name and reputation known in areas where otherwise it might <b>have</b> <b>faded</b> away.|$|E
25|$|After being rescued and {{returning}} to Lestat's home with him, Nicki pleads to become a vampire. Lestat refuses, but is finally convinced to turn Nicki into a vampire. As Lestat feeds from Nicolas, he is plunged into the darkness in which Nicolas resides. He describes the scene as a seamless black sea, where all colours <b>have</b> <b>faded,</b> and that he sees only a bird soaring over the void expanse. He describes a feeling of having lost all that was once cherished. He describes it also as worse than his moment of darkness at the Inn, and tries to recoil from it. He finally turns Nicki into a vampire, which strains their friendship.|$|E
