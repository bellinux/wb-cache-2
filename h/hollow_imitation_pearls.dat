A variety of methods are used to create <b>imitation</b> <b>pearls</b> from starting materials that include glass, plastic, and actual mollusc shell.

50|$|Natural and {{cultured pearls}} can be {{distinguished}} from <b>imitation</b> <b>pearls</b> using a microscope. Another method of testing for imitations is to rub two pearls against each other. <b>Imitation</b> <b>pearls</b> are completely smooth, but natural and cultured pearls are composed of nacre platelets, making both feel slightly gritty.|$|R

50|$|The most {{valuable}} pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare. These wild pearls {{are referred to}} as natural pearls. Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold. <b>Imitation</b> <b>pearls</b> are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry, but the quality of their iridescence is usually very poor and is easily distinguished from that of genuine pearls. Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry, but in the past were also used to adorn clothing. They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics, medicines and paint formulations.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{cultured pearls}} are less {{valuable}} than natural <b>pearls,</b> whereas <b>imitation</b> <b>pearls</b> have almost no value. One way that jewelers can {{determine whether a}} pearl is cultured or natural {{is to have a}} gemlab perform an X-ray examination of the pearl. If X-rays reveals a nucleus, the pearl is likely a bead-nucleated saltwater pearl. If no nucleus is present, but irregular and small dark inner spots indicating a cavity are visible, combined with concentric rings of organic substance, the pearl is likely a cultured freshwater. Cultured freshwater pearls can often be confused for natural pearls which present as homogeneous pictures which continuously darken toward the surface of the pearl. Natural pearls will often show larger cavities where organic matter has dried out and decomposed.|$|R

What I want to point out to you is, though, if you'll allow me, that the necklace I had on the table before me at Stephano's when Mr. Cullen suddenly popped round the screen--the necklace you are now looking at, sir--is of <b>imitation</b> <b>pearls,</b> valued at about ten pounds. I bought it in the Burlington Arcade; it belongs to my daughter, and I was simply examining the clasp, which is scarcely safe." ...|$|R

She moved to Hollywood and became a secretary for 20th Century Fox in 1926, and sold her first script in 1931. In 1933, she collaborated on the screenplay of Sailor's Luck, directed by Raoul Walsh. That year she signed {{the first of a}} string of contracts with MGM, which made her one of the best paid screenwriters of Hollywood at $2500 per week. She explained how she preferred to write scenarios for tough men: [...] "I was weaned on stories about gunfighters and their doings, and I know all the lingo too.

6000|$|It was on {{the evening}} of the second day that a chance remark from Peters turned her mind to the {{extensive}} possibilities of liquidation that lay close at hand. She was discussing her dinner dress with Peters, she wanted something very plain and high and unattractive, and Peters, who disapproved of this tendency and was all for female wiles and propitiations, fell into an admiration of the pearl necklace. She thought perhaps by so doing she might induce Lady Harman to wear it, and if she wore it Sir Isaac might be a little propitiated, and if Sir Isaac was a little propitiated it would be much more comfortable for Snagsby and herself and everyone. She was reminded of a story of a lady who sold one and substituted <b>imitation</b> <b>pearls,</b> no one the wiser, and she told this to her mistress out of sheer garrulousness.

50|$|Mazrim Taim is ruling {{the black}} tower {{with an iron}} fist. Logain has been absent from the Black Tower for some time. Several of the Aes Sedai who have {{traveled}} to the tower originally sent by {{the leader of the}} Red Ajah have been given permission to bond some of the Soldiers and Dedicated, however, none have been bonded. The entirety of the Tower is guarded, entry and exit are strictly monitored, and the behavior of many Aes Sedai and Asha'man have changed significantly and disturbingly; some of Taim's most ardent detractors seem only to sing his praises, and behave as if in <b>hollow</b> <b>imitation</b> of themselves. Gateways fail upon construction, confining those within Tower grounds to the watch of Taim and his faithful. A small group of Soldiers and Dedicated, denied the Dragon even though their skills may warrant it, take notice of the darkness that seems to grip the Tower and its inhabitants, and desperately try to glean Taim's intentions while managing their own escape to Logain and the Dragon Reborn.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose for}} this garment {{was to create}} an evening dress, {{inspired}} by Italian cityscapes at night, that could be worn in the evening while on a trip touring Italy. I designed it {{with the intentions of}} creating a classy and feminine romantic piece that shows both the colors, textures and nostalgia of the blinking lights of a coastal Italian city against the night sky. Process: I began by sketching renderings of ideas for the piece. During this process, I did image research on Italy and gathered images from multiple Italy destinations. From these, I established the looks and colors that I wanted to use. After a trip to Fabric Depot in Oregon to get fabric and many draping, patterning and fitting sessions later, I stitched each piece together to fit my model. Technique: I used the draping method to create Moonlight. Bed sheets were my primary material for draping the garment on a mannequin. After getting the draped piece to look the way I desired it, I moved to creating the paper pattern. I used bedsheets again to sew a sample of the garment to establish correct fit on my model and solidify the look of the design. When the sample fit correctly, I started on the fashion fabric. Carefully, I stitched the pieces together being conscious of every detail. When the base of the garment was completed, I added the final embellishments including trims and buttons. Materials: 100 -percent polyester satin, silver chain, <b>imitation</b> <b>pearls,</b> polyester lining fabric, 100 -percent cotton thread, invisible zipper, shank buttons...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was almost}} sorry {{that she had}} put her {{resolution}} in effect when she rang at the door, and Marcia herself answered the bell, {{in place of the}} one servant who was at that moment hanging out the wash. It seemed wicked to pretend to be showing this pretty creature a social attention, when she meant to palm off a <b>hollow</b> <b>imitation</b> of society upon her. Why should she not ask the very superfinest of her friends to meet such a brilliant beauty? It would serve Olive Halleck right if she should do this, and leave the Hallecks out; and Marcia would certainly be a sensation. She half believed that she meant to do it when she quitted the house with Marcia's promise that she would bring her husband to tea on Wednesday evening, at eight; and she drove away so far penitent that she resolved at least to make her company distinguished, if not fashionable. She said to herself that she would make it fashionable yet, if she chose, and as a first move in this direction she easily secured Mr. Atherton: he had no engagements, so few people had got back to town. She called upon Mrs. Witherby, needlessly reminding her of the charity committees they had served on together; and then she went home and actually sent out notes to the plainest daughter and the maiden aunt of two of the most high-born families of her acquaintance. She added to her list an artist and his wife, ("Now I shall have to let him paint me!" [...] she reflected,) a young author whose book had made talk, a teacher of Italian with whom she was pretending to read Dante, and a musical composer.|$|R

6000|$|There was a shop {{the like}} of which I {{had never seen}} before. Its windows were filled with dress-coats for men, and dresses for women. But the studs of the shirts were made of stamped cloth upon the shirt front, {{and there were no}} {{trousers}} to those coats--nothing but a sweep of cheap black cloth falling like an abbé's frock. In the doorway sat a young man reading Pollock's Course of Time, and by that I knew that he was an undertaker. His name was Gring, which is a beautiful name, and I talked to him on the mysteries of his Craft. He was an enthusiast and an artist. I told him how corpses were burnt in India. Said he: [...] "We're vastly superior. We hold--that is to say, embalm--our dead. So!" [...] Whereupon he produced the horrible weapons of his trade, and most practically showed me how you [...] "held" [...] a man back from that corruption which is his birthright. [...] "And I wish I could live a few generations just to see how my people keep. But I'm sure it's all right. Nothing can touch 'em after I've embalmed 'em." [...] Then he displayed one of those ghastly dress-suits, and when I laid a shuddering hand upon it, behold it crumpled to nothing, for the white linen was sewn on to the black cloth and--there was no back to it! That was the horror. The garment was a shell. [...] "We dress a man in that," [...] said Gring, laying it out tastily on the counter. [...] "As you see here, our caskets have a plate-glass window in front" [...] (Oh me, but that window in the coffin was fitted with plush like a brougham-window!), [...] "and you don't see anything below the level of the man's waistcoat. Consequently ..." [...] He unrolled the terrible cheap black cloth that falls down over the stark feet, and I jumped back. [...] "Of course a man can be dressed in his own clothes if he likes, but these are the regular things: and for women look at this!" [...] He took up the body of a high-necked dinner-dress in subdued lilac, slashed and puffed and bedeviled with black, but, like the dress-suit, backless, and below the waist turning to shroud. [...] "That's for an old maid. But for young girls we give white with <b>imitation</b> <b>pearls</b> round the neck. That looks very pretty through the window of the casket--you see there's a cushion for the head--with flowers banked all round." [...] Can you imagine anything more awful than to take your last rest as much of a dead fraud as ever you were a living lie--to go into the darkness one half of you shaved, trimmed and dressed for an evening party, while the other half--the half that your friends cannot see--is enwrapped in a flapping black sheet? ...|$|R

It is often fitted with a second resonator, a small tumba (pumpkin or pumpkin-like wood replica) on the neck. This style is usually fully decorated, with floral or grape carvings and celluloid inlays with colored (often brown or red) and black floral or arabesque patterns. It typically has thirteen sympathetic strings. It is said that the best Burma teak sitars are made from teak that has been seasoned for generations. Therefore, instrument builders look for old Burma teak that was used in old colonial-style villas as whole trunk columns for their special sitar constructions.The sources of very old seasoned wood are a highly guarded trade secret and sometimes a mystery.There are various additional sub styles and cross mixes of styles in sitars, according to customer preferences. Most importantly, there are some differences in preferences for the positioning of sympathetic (taraf) string pegs (see photo).|$|R
