30|$|The {{inventory}} theory {{helps to}} minimize costs of warehouse stock given {{the relevant market}} situation (Harris 1913). 1 To investigate the firms’ decisions on producing skilled workers, we apply a model from the inventory theory to apprenticeship training. This model assumes that firms decide in advance on how much inventory of skilled workers to produce. Moreover, firms are bound to their decision for the training period of approximately 3  years, the expected demand for skills cannot be predicted with certainty, and firms face some probability {{to end up with}} too many or not enough apprentices in the future.

This paper focuses on the second alternative and examines two types of flexibility using two examples based on the automobile industry. First, process flexibility {{is defined as the}} ability of a single manufacturing plant to make more than a single product (in this case products are different car models), and its is shown that a limited degree of process flexibility is very valuable for dealing with variations in demand. Second, machine flexibility is defined in terms of a changeover cost, measured in terms of the capacity or production which is lost when a plant must produce more than a single car model. Machine flexibility is shown to have a moderating effect on process flexibility, but one which does not necessarily cancel out the benefits of process flexibility. manufacturing flexibility strategy product changeover...|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>inventories</b> <b>in</b> making prices "sticky" is {{studied by}} {{analyzing}} a dynamic linear-quadratic {{model of a}} monopoly firm facing stochastic demand, but able to store its finished <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>inventory.</b> It is shown that, {{in contrast to the}} usual presumption, firms that exhibit the smallest output responses to demand fluctuations may also exhibit the smallest price fluctuations. Specifically, firms which have very flexible inventory storage facilities or are subjected to very transitory demand shocks will rely on inventories as buffers, and will change neither production nor price very much. On the other hand, firms which have very inflexible storage facilities or whose demand shocks are quite permanent will display large swings in both price and output. The standard assumption about inventory carrying costs that has been used in the literature (that they are linear) is shown to imply that production is impervious to fluctuations in demand. It is also established that prices may respond more strongly to positive demand shocks than to negative ones if it is impossible to hold negative inventories (i. e., to have unfilled orders). The model offers an explanation for "stickiness" in relative prices. However, under certain circumstances, it may help explain the persistence of inflation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the long run, profit maximizing strategy of a distributor that holds a <b>good</b> (<b>good</b> 1) <b>in</b> <b>inventory</b> for immediate delivery and {{that offers a}} second good (good 2) for delayed delivery. When the two goods are substitutes, an out-of-stock situation for good 1 will cause some consumers ("walkers") to seek the good elsewhere, other consumers ("waiters") to accept a raincheck for later delivery of good 1, and others still ("switchers") {{to place an order}} for good 2. It is shown that a profit maximizing strategy may entail setting a price for the delayed delivery item so as to encourage switching behavior. The rationale is that the distributor can hold a smaller inventory, thereby incurring lower holding costs, because out-of-stock situations are less costly than they would be without some consumers being willing to switch. marketing: channels of distribution, pricing, inventory management...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVery often must {{be taken}} into account the gradual {{deterioration}} of <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>inventory</b> management. This fact is not taken into account in multiple management systems. Traditional inventory models at the same time assume that a retailer pays for the goods the moment they are received. Nowadays, however, it is becoming a common practice that a supplier offers a retailer the option to pay for the goods with a certain delay. If the retailer is not able to meet his obligations within the deadline, he is charges an interest. In this study we introduce a newly constructed suitable model which enables a retailer to set an optimal price of deteriorating goods under permissible delay in payments, and to determine the maximum repayment term. We considered a deterministic inventory model with time-dependent demand, holding costs variable in time where deterioration is directly proportional to the time. The model is based on the assumption of time-dependent demand and has been developed for deteriorating goods. The paper further analyses a situation in which the retailer sell all the <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> time, and a situation in which the deadline was not met. Further assumption is that the inventory is depleted only by demand. The scientific aim is to verify if such an optimizing problem can be solved. Theoretical results are illustrated with numerical example for the model. Results show that the developer model is capable of solving the theoretical problem illustrated by an example. It helps to the retailer to set the selling price and the replenishment interval in order to maximize profit. The authors of the paper used methods of analysis and synthesis, and the method of mathematical analysis (differential calculus of multivariable functions, solution of ordinary differential equations, Taylor series). The model suggested in the paper can be expanded in the future. One option is generalization of the model, allowing for the lack of goods, bulk discounts, time value of money, inflation etc...|$|R

To do so, a multi-method approach was performed using three parts, namely a literature review on e-commerce sporting goods retail and various dynamic pricing strategies, an analysis of empirical sales data, and an interview segment amongst experts from e-commerce sporting goods retail.

In double-entry bookkeeping, every transaction is recorded by paired entries, and typically a transaction will result in two or more pairs of entries.

Thus, there are two pairs of entries: an addition to revenue balanced by an addition to cash; a subtraction from inventory balanced by an addition to expense. The cash and inventory accounts are asset accounts; the revenue and expense accounts will close at the end of the accounting period to affect equity.|$|R

This work represents {{an extension of the}} Kiyotaki & Wright’s model [24] in which traders must have a relationship, or ”link”, to engage in exchange. We explore a simple economy using an agent-based simulation where traders are matched in pairs and the exchange can only be bilateral and quid pro quo. Agents update their trading strategies using an evolutionary approach. Properties of the trading network topology can drive the system towards monetary equilibria with either one or multiple currencies. In particular, we discover a significant and positive correlation between the shortest path, the diameter of the trading network and the number of currencies in the system. If the network is highly connected, a single good emerges as the medium of exchange. As connectivity decreases, more than one medium of exchange can exist si-multaneously. When agents are allowed to reconfigure their links to other traders without additional costs, the networks tend toward specific characteristic configurations, regard-less of the initial topology, where the majority of agents have only a few linkages to others nd the rest are quite connected. These latter traders own the same characteristics of the Middlemen agents reported in Rubinstein & Wolinsky [40] and Gilles et. al.
