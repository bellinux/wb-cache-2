It is much debated if {{one single}} associative learning mechanisms accounts for such learning or if an additional rule-extraction mechanism {{needs to be}} assumed. A previous study by Pena et al. (2002) highlighted the importance of acoustic cues for triggering rule extraction. In the present study we recorded ERPs for correct and <b>incorrect</b> <b>sequences</b> of synthetic speech after short familiarization phases during which participants listened to speech strings which could be rule-based or not and contain an additional phrase-bracketing cue (500 ms pause) or not. Correct sequences contained the structure AXC. <b>Incorrect</b> <b>sequences</b> were violated on the last element and had the structure AXX. Behavioural data suggested that rules were reliably extracted only if the cue was present. In the cued condition, <b>incorrect</b> <b>sequences</b> elicited an early anterior negativity and a later positivity. In the non-cued condition, only the negativity was observed. We interpret the early negativity as correlate of the automatic detection of the incorrect phoneme categories while the positivity {{is seen as a}} reflection of a later, more controlled process during which the critical element is related to the preceding elements of the sequence. The results indicate that acoustic cues may be crucial for the emergence of conscious rule-integration processes, while more automatic mechanisms of violation detection emerge even when only distributional information is present during familiarization...|$|R

Then the maximum is recomputed. The best offer is computed in a similar fashion. This differs significantly, however, from the BBO defined and computed in Wharton Research Data System (WRDS) documentation and sample programs distributed prior to October 2010.

40|$|An insufficiently {{appreciated}} paradox in {{the origin}} of life is that the replication of information-carrying molecules requires the molecules to be very specifically shaped; but such specific molecules are hard to produce without natural selection. We demonstrate and investigate this problem by building a physical model of self-replication out of specifically shaped plastic pieces with embedded magnets, which float around on an airhockey type table. We use a mechanism known as template replication, which works by the joining of complimentary strands, roughly analogous to the biological replication of DNA, except without the involvement of enzymes. Building a physical rather than a computational model forces us to confront several issues that have analogues in the microscopic, chemical world. In particular, in order to achieve a low mutation rate we must reduce as much as possible the formation of <b>incorrect</b> <b>sequences,</b> which can happen both spontaneously {{and as a result of}} strands joining in a misaligned way. The latter results in ever-lengthening sequences in a process known as the “elongation catastrophe”. We present an overview of our design process, illustrating the many interdependent adaptations that had to be made to the pucks’ shapes in order to solve these problems while maintaining a high rate of template replication. The chicken and egg question is how, in the pre-biotic world, could template replication be achieved without the presence of enzymes that require template replication in the first place? By building a real physical model a new answer to this question is suggested. We propose that early pre-biotic monomers required structural specializations that reduced the rate of formation of <b>incorrect</b> <b>sequences,</b> without the need of an encoded enzyme...|$|R

Applying this method, a test response sequence of a device under test is compressed by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR, for short).

40|$|International audienceGymnopus dichrous {{exists in}} the {{southern}} Appalachians (USA) as two distinct entities with essentially identical nuclear ribosomal ITS 1 sequences but differing ITS 2 and LSU sequences (for convenience, called G. dichrous I and II). F 1 ITS heterozygotes between the two are routinely collected from nature. Cloning of ITS PCR products from F 1 heterozygotes produced sequences of both parental haplotypes but also numerous chimeric sequences (21. 9 %). The location of template switching was non-random leading to recovery of the same chimera several times and the chimeric region varied from 45 bp to 300 bp. By comparison, single-basidiospore isolates from heterozygote F 1 fruitbodies showed no recombinant haplotypes within the ITS + LSU span and clones derived from P 1 homozygotes were identical to the P 1 parent. Thus, chimeric sequences are likely an artifact of the PCR-cloning process and not a consequence of natural recombination events found in nature, nor are they due to hidden existing variation within the ribosomal repeat.

Measurements of the molecular weight and subunot stoichiometry show that the enzyme is a trimeric complex of 162 kDa consisting of two subunits of HsdlM (58 kOa) and one subunit of HsdS (46 kDa). The purified enzyme can methylate a DMA fragment bearing its cognate recognition sequence. Binding of the methylase to synthetic DNA fragments containing either the EcoR 124 recognition sequence GAAN 6 RT-CG, or the recognition sequence GAAN 7 RTCG of the related enzyme EcoRH 24 / 3, was followed by fluorescence competition assays and by gel retardation analysis.

When distinguishing morphological characters are no longer present (e. g., cultures or dried specimen fragments), characterizing true sequences of Bjerkandera is crucial for accurate identification and application of the species. To build a framework for molecular identification of Bjerkandera, we carefully identified specimens of B. adusta and B. fumosa from Korea based on morphological characters, followed by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region and 28 S nuclear ribosomal large subunit. The phylogenetic analysis of Korean Bjerkandera specimens showed clear genetic differentiation between the two species. Using this phylogeny as a framework, we examined the identification accuracy of sequences available in GenBank.

It is wellknown that gene trees inferred from molecular sequences can be partly erroneous due to <b>incorrect</b> <b>sequence</b> alignments as well as phylogenetic reconstruction artifacts such as long branch attraction.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{focuses on}} the linear planning method. The method is particularly useful when planning linear objects, such as roads, pipelines, tunnels, railways, sewerage {{and in some instances}} multi-storied buildings. The advantage of linear planning is primarily its two-dimensionality. One axis shows time and the other location, which enables a clear comparison between the planned and {{the current state of the}} plan. When using the network planning method, the linear object must be divided into sections, and each section must have a network structure of activities applied. The more sections, the more precise and complex the plan, which can lead to difficulties monitoring the project. Computer support has an important role in schedule-planning. It enables fast updating or correcting the plan, the use of an existing similar plan and working with a distant-access simultaneously. In the program Tilos, which supports linear planning, I analyzed the existing schedule-plan for the Kidričevo- Rogatec pipeline that was made in MS Project.

We compared thirteen enzymes in three different marker systems: simple, single copy nuclear gene and complex multi-gene family.

We find that enzyme choice has a large impact on the proportion of correct sequences recovered. The most complex marker systems yielded fewer correct reads, and the proportion of correct reads was greatly affected by the enzyme used. Modified cycling conditions did reduce the number of <b>incorrect</b> <b>sequences</b> obtained in some cases, but enzyme had a much greater impact on the number of correct reads. Thus, the coverage required for the safe identification of genotypes using one of the low quality enzymes could be seven times larger than with more efficient enzymes in a biallelic system with equal amplification of the two alleles. Consequently, enzyme selection for downstream HTS has important consequences, especially in complex genetic systems. Peer reviewe...|$|R
