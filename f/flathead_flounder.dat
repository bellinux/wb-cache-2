50|$|Fishing is also {{a popular}} pastime, with species such as bream, whiting, <b>flathead,</b> <b>flounder,</b> tailor, cod, and snapper, amongst others, {{to be found in}} the waters around the island.|$|E
50|$|The <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> {{spawning}} season is from February to April, and spawning {{takes place at}} depths of 180 and 200 m. Females undergo one reproductive cycle per year and produce between 90,000 and 950,000 eggs during each cycle.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a good}} {{selection}} of aquatic fauna, like the <b>flathead</b> mullet, righteye <b>flounder</b> and Anguillidae. Amphibians found here are the green frog, palmate newt and natterjack toad.Mammals are not as frequent in the area, but like in other places with the same type habitat there are some species of shrew, common vole, mice and the least weasel (an introduced species).|$|R
40|$|Whole-gear {{efficiency}} (the {{proportion of}} fish passing between the otter doors of a bottom trawl that are subsequently captured) was estimated from data collected during experiments {{to measure the}} herding efficiency of bridles and doors, the capture efficiency of the net, {{and the length of}} the bridles sufficiently close to the seafloor to elicit a herding response. The experiments were focused on four species of flatfish: arrowtooth <b>flounder</b> (Atheresthes stomias), <b>flathead</b> sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus), and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). Whole-gear efficiency varied with fish length and reached maximum values between 40 % and 50 % for arrowtooth <b>flounder,</b> <b>flathead</b> sole, and rex sole. For Dover sole, however, whole-gear efficiency declined from a maximum of 33 % over the length range sampled. Such efficiency estimates can be used to determine catchability, which, in turn, can be used to improve the accuracy of stock assessment models when the time series of a survey is short...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{subsistence}} {{strategies of}} coastal Neolithic groups in eastern Arabia, reliant upon {{the exploitation of}} marine and terrestrial animal resources, are not yet fully understood. A central question in relevant literature {{is the issue of}} mobility. This is the reason for excavations in Umm al-Quwain (UAQ 2), UAE, from 2011 by the French Archaeological Mission. UAQ 2 is a site with obvious potential, occupied for 1500 years from the mid-sixth millennium BC. It has an area of approximately 6 ha with 3. 2 m or more of imposing and unusual stratigraphy. A large quantity of faunal remains, including terrestrial and marine vertebrates, was recovered from UAQ 2. The terrestrial mammals are composed mainly of domestic herbivores including caprines, cattle, and dogs. The most striking feature is the number of newly born and young animals among the small herbivores, a clear indication of occupation during late winter/spring. As for the fish bones, the following taxa were identified: requiem sharks, shark-suckers, marine catfish, needlefish, jacks/trevallies, milkfish, mojarra, emperors, snappers, mullet, <b>flatheads,</b> shortfin <b>flounders,</b> parrotash, kawakawa, tuna, groupers, sea bream, barracuda, puffer, and tripod fish. These indicate that most fishing was carried out in the shallow lagoon area, but some fishing for tuna may have been carried out in the open seas beyond the local lagoon. Besides fish were also the remains of cuttlefish and swimming crabs. This assemblage provides new information on the mixed exploitation of inland and marine resources during the sixth to fifth millennium BC. The integrated study of the faunal remains contributes to the proposal of a possible year-round residency, not excluding coastal mobility...|$|R
50|$|The <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder,</b> Hippoglossoides dubius, is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that lives on bottoms in shallow coastal waters, at depths of between 10 and 600 m. Its native habitat is the northwestern Pacific, particularly the seas of Japan and Okhotsk, and the coastlines of Kamchatka and Korea. It grows up to 45 cm in length.|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the {{mechanism for the}} annual fluctuation of year class strength of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> Hippoglossoides dubius in Funka Bay, Hokkaido, annual changes in age composition, spawning period, egg abundance, food availability at the first feeding stage, and hydrographic conditions were investigated from 1988 to 1999. Strong year classes occurred in 1989, 1991, and 1995. Comparison between annual fluctuations of commercial catch of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> and the abundance of eggs {{suggests that there is}} no relationship between the spawning size and the resultant year class strength of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> in Funka Bay. The density of copepod nauplii, the primary food for larval <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder,</b> was 7. 8 individuals・l^[- 1] in January and then increased in February (18. 1 individuals・l^[- 1]) and March (12. 9 individuals・l^[- 1]) in 1991. High densities of copepod nauplii in January were also found in 1994 (13. 1 individuals・l^[- 1]), 1995 (12. 3 individuals・l^[- 1]), and 1996 (13. 8 individuals・l^[- 1]). However, the strong year class of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> did not occur in 1994 and 1996. Therefore, the high density of copepod nauplii does not determine the magnitude of the year class strength of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> in this area. During the study period the spawning period varied widely among years from January to March and early spawnings were found in the years when the high water temperatures were observed from November to December. The high water temperatures at the surface layer in January were observed in 1991. Relatively warm water were also observed from January to February in 1995, while temperatures during January and February were low in 1989. From the results, it is considered that the early spawning and relatively high water temperature affect the magnitude of the year class of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> in this area. For the 1989 -yaer-calss, high water temperature in mid December 1988 might reduce the mortality during the early life period of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> in Funka Bay in spite of low temperature after the intrusion the Oyashio Coastal Water (cold water) in January. アカガレイHippoglossoides dubiusは噴火湾における産業的重要種であり，顕著な年級群変動を示すことが知られており， 1980 年および 1983 年に卓越年級群が発生している．年級群強度を決定する要因を明らかにする目的で， 1989 年から 1999 年までの期間，噴火湾においてアカガレイを採集し，海洋環境を測定した．調査期間中，卓越年級群は 1989 ， 1991 ，および 1995 年に発生した．これらの年において年級群強度と産卵群の来遊量および産み出された卵の豊度との間に相関がみられないことから，当海域において年級群強度の決定に産卵来遊量および産卵量は大きな影響を及ぼさないと考えられる．摂餌開始期の仔魚の主要餌生物である橈脚類ノープリウスの豊度は 1 月から 3 月にかけて増加するが，その逆の年も認められた．橈脚類ノープリウスの豊度と年級群強度との関係から，生活史初期の餌生物環境が年級群強度を支配しているとは考えられない．調査期間中，産卵盛期は 1 月から 3 月まで変化しており，産卵直前の 11 月から 12 月にかけての海底水温が高い年には産卵期が早くなる傾向が確認された．卓越年級群が発生した年の産卵盛期はいずれも 1 月で， 1 月の表層水温は 1991 年で高く， 1995 年も比較的暖かかったが， 1989 年は低かった．過去の調査結果から卓越年級群が発生した 1980 年および 1983 年も冬期間の表層水温が高かったことから，摂餌開始期仔魚にとって水温が高いことが生き残りに重要な影響を持つと考えられる． 1989 年は沿岸親潮の流入が早く， 1 月の水温が低かったが，前年 12 月の水温が高かったことから，早期に産み出された仔魚の生き残りが高かったのではないかと予想される...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the importance of}} Oikopleura as prey for flatfish larvae, we investigated species composition of appendicularians in the diets of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> Hippoglossoides dubius and stone flounder Platichthys bicoloratus larvae in Funka Bay in winter and spring (January-May) from 2006 to 2010. 0 ikopleura dioica and 0. longicauda were abundant in the bay in January, and 0. labradoriensis increased its population density in February and March. Preflexion, flexion, and small postflexion larvae of <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> fed mainly on invertebrate eggs and copepod nauplii, and large postflexion larvae fed on Oikopleura. Stone flounder larvae fed mainly on Oikopleura through their larval stages, especially in the large larvae. Based on comparison of the inlet filter-like structure in house rudiments of Oikopleura in the flatfish guts, we could identify to species level with a house-rudiment length greater than 550 μm. The flatfish larvae fed heavily on 0. labradoriensis. This species can feed on smaller organisms, has a longer life span than other Oikopleura and may {{have an important role}} as a trophic shunt from primary producers to the larvae...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{granules}} {{of heart}} atrial and ventricular muscle cells obtained from vertebrates, especially Pisces, were investigated by electron microscopy. The heart muscle cells of Pisces were generally smaller {{than those of}} other vertebrates, and the ratio of nucleus to cell body was large. The cells could be classified into three types according {{to the degree of}} development of cell organella: cells with long myofibrils, many Golgi apparatus and many mitochondria; cells with short myofibrils, a few Golgi apparatus and a few mitochondria, and cells with few myofibrils and a few mitochondria. In Pisces, specific granules were only found in a small population of heart muscle cells and most cells had no granules in contrast to mammals. The distribution of granules was diffuce, and granules did not gather. The mean diameter of these granules was as follows: 124 nm (lamprey), 200 nm (ray), 110 nm (sillago), 130 nm (Sebastes), 160 nm (flathead), 130 nm (goby), 97 nm (flounder), 110 nm (turbot), 160 nm (sea bream), 124 nm (gray mullet), 180 nm (eel), 110 nm (loach), 110 nm (ayu), 120 nm (carp), 120 nm (crucian), 110 nm (gold fish), 120 nm (Rana), 133 nm (Geoclemmys), 146 nm (snake), 144 nm (chicken), 260 nm (rat), 170 nm (dog) and 210 nm (pig). The number of specific granules distributed in heart atrial muscle cells was large in the rat, medium in Geoclemmys, the snake, Rana and lamprey, and small in the chicken, dog and pig. The number in Pisces was large in gray mullet, medium in <b>flathead,</b> goby, <b>flounder,</b> turbot, sea bream, loach, ayu, carp, crucian, gold fith and eel, and small in ray, sillago and Sebastes. The number of specific granules distributed in heart ventricular muscle cells was large in Geoclemmys, the snake and Rana, medium in lamprey, the chicken and dog, and small in the rat and pig. In Pisces, the number was large in gray mullet and flathead, medium in goby and flounder, and small in ray, sillago, Sebastes, turbot, sea bream, eel, loach, ayu, carp, crucian and gold fish. Specific granules were present in heart atrial muscle cells and heart ventricular muscle cells in all vertebrates studied...|$|R
40|$|Positional {{distribution}} of fatty acids in triacyl-sn-glycerols (TAG) of the <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> Hippoglossoides dubius has been reinvestigated {{in order to}} accurately determine the contents of tetracosahexaenoic acid (24 : 6 n- 3) in the sn- 1, sn- 2, and sn- 3 positions. Flesh TAG obtained from three flounders were subjected to stereospecific analysis using a suitable procedure for fish TAG analysis. The 24 : 6 n- 3 acid {{was found in the}} three positions at the concentrations of 0. 3 [...] 5. 5 mole% (the sn- 1 position), 1. 6 [...] 23. 3 mole% (the sn- 2 position), and 0. 6 [...] 8. 9 mole% (the sn- 3 position). In contrast to a previous analysis, the present analysis revealed that 24 : 6 n- 3 is preferentially esterified in the sn- 2 position followed by the sn- 3 and sn- 1 positions. Other polyunsaturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3; DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (22 : 5 n- 3; DPA), showed a similar distribution pattern. These results indicate that the general tendency observed for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in marine fish TAG can be extended to the {{distribution of}} 24 : 6 n- 3 in <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> TAG. Because the use of flathead flounders is entirely for human food, we thus intake 24 : 6 n- 3 concentrated in the sn- 2 position of their TAG...|$|E
40|$|Effects of hypoxia on the {{principal}} prey {{and growth of}} <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> Hippoglossoides dubius were studied in Funka Bay. Of the three dominant year-classes that occurred in recent years, the 1995 year-class was small in total length at age ≥ 3 and low in condition factor at age ≥ 2. Ophiuroids (almost Ophiura sarsi), which were the dominant prey in the 1980 s, were of little importance and instead, crustaceans such as mysids, natant decapods and pelagic amphipods, bivalves and fish were important prey items for H. dubius in 2000 - 2001. In addition, the feeding intensity of H. dubius in 2000 - 2001 was lower than that in the 1980 s. These facts {{are closely related to}} a reduction of prey abundance, particularly ophiuroids. It seems that the hypoxia that occurred in {{the central part of the}} bay during the summer and autumn of 1995 - 1997 caused the poor food supply and low growth rate at ages 2 - 4 of the 1995 year-class...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of a Japanese fishery’s MSC {{certification}} on the related seafood markets. In September 2008, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified the Kyoto flat-head flounder Danish seine fishery (KDSFF) as the first sustainable fishery in Asia. Assuming the MSC certification has an impact on the fishery, the overall goal is to examine the benefit of the KDSFF from the MSC certification. The benefit is examined by a cointegration and structural break test whether the KDSFF experiences market segregation by the certification. The monthly ex-vessel price is analyzed compared with the prices of the adjacent prefectures: Fukui and Hyogo prefectures. The structural break test showed that the significant impact on the structure of the <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> fisheries while there is no increase in price. In conclusion, the KDSFF benefits from the MSC certification in that the market used to be easily influenced by the other larger markets, but became less influenced by them after the introduction of the MSC certification. ...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) of cis-eicosenoic acid (20 : 1) positional isomers {{has been}} investigated on a capillary column of ionic liquid 1, 9 -di(3 -vinyl-imidazolium) nonane bis(trifluoromethyl) sulfonylimidate stationary phase (SLB-IL 100). A test mixture of isomeric 20 : 1 methyl esters was prepared from <b>flathead</b> <b>flounder</b> flesh lipids. On a 60 -m column operated at 150 - 180 °C, six peaks appeared in the elution order of 20 :ln- 15 → 20 :ln- 13 → 20 :ln- 11 → 20 :ln- 9 → 20 :ln- 7 → 20 :ln- 5. These peaks were baseline resolved within 20 min at 180 °C. The 20 :ln- 13 and 20 :ln- 11 isomers, poorly resolved on conventional polar polysiloxane stationary phases, were completely separated from each other with separation factor α = 1. 02 and peak resolution (Rs) >- 1. 57. When equivalent chain length (ECL) values were compared between the SLB-IL 100 and CP-Sil 88 (biscyanopropyl polysiloxane), those of 20 :ln- 15 and 20 :ln- 13 exceptionally tended to be lower on the SLB-IL 100. The excellent separation of 20 : 1 isomers seems due to less retention of 20 :ln- 15 and 20 :ln- 13 on SLB-IL 100 rather than simply due to its high polarity. Analysis of herring oil 20 : 1 revealed the occurrence of 20 :ln- 13 in the Pacific herring {{but not in the}} Atlantic herring. The ionic liquid stationary phase, SLB-IL 100, is effective for analyzing 20 : 1 isomers occurring in fish and other natural oils...|$|E
