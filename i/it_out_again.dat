Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>again</b> in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first [...] "modern" [...] edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.|$|E

[...] "Instead of sending the money {{back to where it}} came from, he would dole <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>again</b> to whomever he had on his waiting list," [...] allowing the program to become a sort of need-based scholarship. As assistant dean of men, Griffin established a central placement office in the early 1930s.|$|E

2500|$|The ANO's {{official}} newspaper Filastin al-Thawra regularly carried stories {{announcing the}} execution of traitors within the movement. Each new recruit of the ANO was given several days to write his entire life story by handincluding names and addresses of family members, friends, and loversand was then required to sign a paper agreeing to his execution if anything {{was found to be}} untrue. Every so often, the recruit would be asked to rewrite the whole story. Any discrepancies were taken as evidence that he was a spy and he would be made to write <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>again,</b> often after days of being beaten and nights spent forced to sleep standing up.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{hope the}} editor'll think so,' Ernest answered, dubiously. 'If not, {{what a lot}} of {{valuable}} tenpenny foolscap wasted all for nothing! Now I must write <b>it</b> all <b>out</b> <b>again</b> clean, Edie, on fresh pieces.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I took some, providentially, as <b>it</b> turned <b>out.</b> <b>Again,</b> I was declining tea-cake, when I {{could have}} sworn I heard the same voice (so low that {{it seemed like the}} admonition of a passing spirit) say-- ...|$|R

60|$|While Columbine held Moore's head {{upon her}} lap the hunter bathed the bloody face. It was {{battered}} and bruised and cut, {{and in some}} places, as fast as Wade washed away the red, <b>it</b> welled <b>out</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... “Suffragettes,” said Elinor promptly; “didn’t {{you hear}} about it? They broke in and made hay {{of the whole thing}} in about ten minutes.

60|$|As {{soon as he}} was out of {{the lane}} Davy stopped and twisted his countenance into such an unearthly and terrific contortion that Dora, {{although}} she knew his gifts in that respect, was honestly alarmed lest he should never in the world be able to get <b>it</b> straightened <b>out</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
