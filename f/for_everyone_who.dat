5|$|The SaGa Series 20th Anniversary Original Soundtrack -Premium Box- is a soundtrack album {{collection}} {{of music from}} every released SaGa game. The compilation features 515 tracks on 20 CDs with a total length of 19:02:45, and includes a DVD of developer interviews, a stand display showing an illustration painted by Tomomi Kobayashi, and materials to build a display box for the CDs. The set consists {{of all of the}} soundtrack albums from the SaGa series, with All Sounds of SaGa broken up into one disc per game, rather than the original two discs. The set was published on August 26, 2009 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the release of the first SaGa video game with the catalog numbers SQEX-10145~65. Patrick Gann described it as an excellent collection that was worth the purchase for anyone who wanted to own the entire set and did not already have most of the albums, though he noted that as it included multiple composers and styles the compilation box would not be justified <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> liked just some of the music of the SaGa series.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} asserted, {{with varying degrees}} of sincerity, that winning the award is a curse, as several award winners (particularly from the late 1970s and early 1980s) were never able to duplicate the success they experienced in their debut year. This viewpoint was expressed by former Starland Vocal Band member Taffy Danoff in a 2002 interview for VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders: [...] "We got two of the five Grammys - one was Best New Artist.

25|$|Charlie Prince is {{an outlaw}} highwayman and the {{right-hand}} {{man of the}} outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford in 1957 and Russell Crowe in 2007) and his gang. Unlike other characters, Prince appears in both films. Prince is portrayed as a cold-blooded killer who attacks people for merely insulting him. Throughout the film he employs intelligence and wit to overcome his enemies; for example, he makes a deal with Contention's sheriffs with promises to spare them only to kill them after all, and he turns the whole city of Contention against its lawmen by promoting a reward of $200 <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> can kill even a single of Wade's captors.

25|$|Kristiansen's mother testified {{during the}} trial that she saw her son {{arriving}} and walking in the backyard {{on the evening of}} the murders, and as such could not have been at the murder-site. This statement also matched the measurements in the telecommunication reports since the cell cite connected to Kristiansen's phone was close to his home, a fact Kristiansen's mother couldn't have known about since the cell phone alibi wasn't discovered until the trial was almost over. Furthermore, a witness saw a man together with two girls right before the crime. The description he gave matched Andersen and the victims. He did not see a second man, and it's unlikely that the witness saw Kristiansen instead of Andersen since Kristansen is a short and thin while Andersen is tall and big. Despite extensive public outreach <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> was in the area to contact the police, no other people matched this description. This witness, a commercial airline pilot, was not called as witness to the trials. Additional 5 people that heard or saw relevant activity that did not fit the timeline created by the police were not called as witness to the court either.|$|E

Tracy wears a short skirt, tight-fitting top, and high-heels to the party, while Leigh wore ordinary shorts, a jumper, and sand-shoes. Tracy's body is found that night by a girl; Leigh's body was found the next day by a boy. Tracy's mother packs up her daughter's bedroom the following day, whereas Leigh's mother left her room untouched for months. In the film, police labour until every boy involved in the rape and murder is punished, whereas no one was convicted for raping Leigh and police received criticism for alleged incompetence.

[...] Vazaleen became a launching pad for such musical acts as Peaches and Lesbians on Ecstasy. Other bands performing at Vazaleen early in their careers were The Hidden Cameras, Crystal Castles, and The Gossip.
