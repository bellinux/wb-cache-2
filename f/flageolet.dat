Rembrandt's Self-Portrait {{is part of}} the Clowes Fund Collection, which comprises a number of significant Old Masters pieces. Part of the Neo-Impressionist collection, The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe by Georges Seurat {{was one of the first}} works to be donated by Caroline Marmon Fesler in the 1940s. Fesler would go on to donate a number of important works, including her bequest in 1961 of notable 20th-century modernism pieces that included Pablo Picasso, Chagall, and Matisse. Pieces in the American collection represent American Impressionism and Modernism, including works by Georgia O'Keeffe and George Inness. Significant pieces include Hotel Lobby (1943) by Edward Hopper and Boat Builders by Winslow Homer.|$|E

25|$|Pepys {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} civil servants of his age, and was also a widely cultivated man, taking an interest in books, music, the theatre, and science. He was passionately interested in music; he composed, sang, and played for pleasure, and even arranged music lessons for his servants. He played the lute, viol, violin, <b>flageolet,</b> recorder, and spinet to varying degrees of proficiency. He was also a keen singer, performing at home, in coffee houses, and even in Westminster Abbey. He and his wife took <b>flageolet</b> lessons from master Thomas Greeting. He also taught his wife to sing and paid for dancing lessons for her (although these stopped when he became jealous of the dancing master).|$|E

25|$|Almost all {{primitive}} cultures had {{a type of}} fipple flute and is {{most likely}} the first pitched flute type instrument in existence. A possible Neanderthal fipple flute from Slovenia dates from 81,000-53,000 B.C., a German flute from 35,000 years ago, and flute made from sheep's bone in West Yorkshire dating to the Iron Age. Written sources that describe a fipple-type flute include the Roman and Greek aulos and tibia. In the early Middle Ages peoples of northern Europe were playing the instrument as seen in 3rd-century British bone flutes, and Irish Brehon Law describes flute like instrument. By the 12th century Italian flutes came {{in a variety of}} sizes, and fragments of 12th-century Norman bone whistles have been found in Ireland, and an intact 14cm Tusculum clay whistle from the 14th century in Scotland. In the 17th century whistles were called flageolets; a term to describe a whistle with a French made fipple headpiece (common to the modern penny whistle) and such instruments are linked {{to the development of the}} English <b>flageolet,</b> French <b>flageolet</b> and recorders of the renaissance and baroque period. The term <b>flageolet</b> is still preferred by some modern tin whistle who feel this better describes the instrument, as this characterises a wide variety of fipple flutes, including penny whistles.|$|E
25|$|Berlioz {{was not a}} child prodigy, {{unlike some}} other famous composers of the time; he began {{studying}} music at age 12, writing small compositions and arrangements. As {{a result of his}} father's discouragement, he never learned to play the piano, a peculiarity he later described as both beneficial and detrimental. He became proficient at guitar, <b>flageolet</b> and flute. He learned harmony from textbooks alone—he was not formally trained. The majority of his early compositions were romances and chamber pieces.|$|E
500|$|Having {{previously}} {{been drawn to}} other musical women, Shelley greatly appreciated her talents. Jane could skilfully play the flute, harp, and guitar. Shelley was particularly captivated by Jane's singing voice, {{to the extent that}} some commentators have suggested it had a hypnotic effect on him. Shelley once purchased a guitar for Jane, and commemorated the gift in the poem [...] "With a Guitar, to Jane". In this poem, he ascribes to her voice the ability to alter the consciousnesses of her audience. Jane kept the guitar for her entire life and played it often. Shelley also purchased her a <b>flageolet</b> and wanted to give her a harp, but abandoned that plan due to its expense.|$|E

2500|$|The translator's role as {{a bridge}} for [...] "carrying across" [...] values between {{cultures}} has been discussed at least since Terence, the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, {{by no means a}} passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an artist. [...] The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as Cicero. Dryden observed that [...] "Translation is a type of drawing after life..." [...] Comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to Samuel Johnson's remark about Alexander Pope playing Homer on a <b>flageolet,</b> while Homer himself used a bassoon.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its most}} basic form, a flute is an open tube which is blown into. After focused study and training, players use {{controlled}} air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across {{the edge of the}} mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the whistle, gemshorn, <b>flageolet,</b> recorder, tin whistle, tonette, fujara, and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a [...] "fipple"). These are known as fipple flutes. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.|$|E
2500|$|The satire in {{the opera}} {{is focused on}} old-fashioned customs, {{pastoral}} opera conventions, the [...] "popularity of curates, the pose of aristocratic benevolence, and the inebriety of the working man" [...] rather than the broad political satire that would feature {{in many of the}} later Savoy opera librettos. For example, [...] "Sir Marmaduke, my dear young friend Alexis", a recitative among Alexis, Sir Marmaduke and Dr Daly, is a skit on the excessive politeness associated with early nineteenth-century aristocracy, and the incantation scene is a parody of the similar scene in Weber's Der Freischütz. Dr Daly accompanies his Act II song on a <b>flageolet.</b> Gilbert satirises the Victorian temperance movement by introducing a non-alcoholic brindisi with jorums of tea; this is also a dig at Italian operas, many of which contained a brindisi scene. Another burlesque of Italian opera is [...] "Prepare for sad surprises", which is similar to Alfredo's denunciation of Violetta in Verdi's La traviata. Gilbert's satire of these subjects, like most of his satire in the operas, was blunted with gentle humour. [...] As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert characteristically combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, {{while at the same time}} underlining their truth: [...] "By laughing at a joke you show that you accept its premise." [...] Theatrical critic Allardyce Nicoll compared J. W. Wells' speech about blessings being less popular than curses to Mr. Hen's satiric auction speech in The Historical Register for the Year 1736 by Henry Fielding.|$|E
5000|$|English <b>flageolets</b> {{that may}} qualify as {{recorders}} are of two types: those early instruments, called [...] "English flageolets," [...] which were actually recorders, and 19th century instruments with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. These instruments are not typically regarded as recorders, however Tarasov has argued for their {{inclusion in the}} family.|$|R
5000|$|Similarities in {{fingering}} {{and design}} make the csakan {{at least a}} close relative of the recorder. Accounts of Krähmer's playing, which report his [...] "diminishing and swelling the notes, up to an almost unbelievable loudness" [...] imply a developed technique using shading and alternate fingerings, far beyond a purely amateur culture of house music. Additionally, Tarasov reports that some recorders by Baroque makers were modified, around 1800, through the addition of keys, including a J. C. Denner (1655-1707) basset recorder in Budapest and an alto by Nikolaus Staub (1664-1734) with added G keys, like the D key on a baroque two-key flute. Another modification is the narrowing of the thumb hole, by way of an ivory plug on the J. C. Denner basset and an alto by Benedikt Gahn (1674-1711), {{to allow it to}} serve purely as an octaving vent, as found on many <b>flageolets</b> and csakans. These changes may be archetypal to those found on csakans and <b>flageolets,</b> and constitute an inchoate justification for the continuous development of the Baroque recorder into its 19th-century relatives.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fingering}} {{system for}} the saxophone closely resembles the Boehm system. A key system inspired by Boehm's for the clarinet family {{is also known as}} the [...] "Boehm system", although it was developed by Hyacinthe Klosé and not Boehm himself. The Boehm system was also adapted for a small number of <b>flageolets.</b> Boehm did work on a {{system for the}} bassoon, and Boehm-inspired oboes have been made, but non-Boehm systems remain predominant for these instruments. The Albert system is another key system for the clarinet.|$|R

50|$|Heinrich Christian Eisenbrandt (H. C. Eisenbrandt) was a German-born {{manufacturer}} of brass and woodwind instruments. He {{was born in}} Göttingen, Germany, and moved to Philadelphia in 1811, followed by Baltimore in 1819. His factory produced clarinets, fifes, drums, basset-horns, bassoons, oboes, flutes, <b>flageolets</b> and brass instruments. He was praised for technical innovations in the valves of the saxhorn, and owned two patents used for brass instruments. He also invented a method of drilling fife bores {{that allowed him to}} underbid his competition, and he may have been the first woodwind maker to use rosewood.|$|R

60|$|But as {{everyone}} knows that idleness is the hardest work in the world, so our Commodore was specially provided with a gentleman to assist him. This gentleman was called the Commodore's secretary. He was a remarkably urbane and polished man; with a very graceful exterior, and looked much like an Ambassador Extraordinary from Versailles. He messed with the Lieutenants in the Ward-room, where he had a state-room, elegantly furnished as the private cabinet of Pelham. His cot-boy used to entertain the sailors with all manner of stories about the silver-keyed flutes and <b>flageolets,</b> fine oil paintings, morocco bound volumes, Chinese chess-men, gold shirt-buttons, enamelled pencil cases, extraordinary fine French boots with soles no thicker than a sheet of scented note-paper, embroidered vests, incense-burning sealing-wax, alabaster statuettes of Venus and Adonis, tortoise-shell snuff-boxes, inlaid toilet-cases, ivory-handled hair-brushes and mother-of-pearl combs, and a hundred other luxurious appendages scattered about this magnificent secretary's state-room.|$|R
40|$|My work {{concerns}} wind {{instruments of}} the symphonic orchestra {{seen from the}} perspective of the current period ? that is instruments which in unconventional ways offer new sound possibilities. In the opening three chapters I will briefly outline common features of wind instruments, of their principles of sound creation, sound characteristics and the function of the wind instrument in the orchestra. I will focus on their notation, and on air consumption and breathing. The following chapters cover dynamic possibilities of wind instruments, articulation, sound effects and muting. The focal point of the work lies in the chapter about special possibilities of wind instruments, for instance, multiphonics, bisbigliando, double-trill, <b>flageolets,</b> slap-tones, echo-tones etc. In the closing chapter I sum up the results of my experiments of tremolo of all tone combinations in the main representative family of wooden wind instruments (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and saxophone).

Meanwhile, Strephon's lodger, Astrologos, owes him three months' rent, but as an Arcadian, Strephon can't ask him to pay it, since Arcadians don't care about money. Astrologos notes that he has four magic items, a stick, a ring, a cloak, and a cap, each of which grants one wish, but that he has used up the wishes.|$|R
