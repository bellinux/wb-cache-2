5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove {{of giant}} sequoia trees were {{transferred}} from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> people {{and access to}} the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanians were {{generally}} less <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> Jews {{than their counterparts}} in Albania. Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, they tended to be more unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. Claims have been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the protection that Jews received in Kosovo {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the oceans have gradually become more <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> life over the last 500 million years, and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions, but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level {{does not appear to}} make mass extinctions more or less probable.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{courts were}} less <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> union {{activities}} during the 1920s {{than in the}} past. In this decade, corporations used twice as many court injunctions against strikes than any comparable period. In addition, the practice of forcing employees (by threat of termination) to sign yellow-dog contracts that {{said they would not}} join a union was not outlawed until 1932.|$|E
50|$|A {{history of}} the OrigamiUSA convention, which was started by Shall, {{describes}} him as a fine teacher and leader, resourceful, <b>hospitable,</b> energetic <b>to</b> the point of seeming hyperactive, but a poor planner.

25|$|In the 19th century, {{hundreds}} of tourists visited Shaker villages, {{and many of}} them later wrote about their experiences there. Outsiders were invariably impressed by Shaker cleanliness, prosperity, and agriculture. Shaker food was delicious, and they were <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> outsiders. Shakers had a reputation for honesty and their products were the best of their kind.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the heart}} of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental {{reflection}} arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances — a method <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification. Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, though he himself was a mathematician of logic and a founder of statistics.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Cornwall {{are involved in}} the manufacture of tin ingots. They mine the ore, smelt it and then work it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones, after which it is transported to the island of Ictis by wagon, which can be done at low tide. Merchants purchasing it there pack it on horses for 30days to the river Rhône, where it is carried down to the mouth. Diodorus says that the {{inhabitants of}} Cornwall are civilised in manner and especially <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> strangers because of their dealings with foreign merchants.|$|E

50|$|O'Flanagan {{states that}} from the little that is known of him {{he seems to have}} been popular and <b>hospitable.</b> According <b>to</b> Smyth, during his tenure as Lord Chancellor a serious fire {{destroyed}} all the Irish Chancery records; this is probably a reference to the Great Fire of Dublin of 1304, which destroyed much of the medieval city.|$|R

25|$|Fermentation {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to {{preserve}} food and alter its quality. Yeast, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is used to leaven bread, brew beer and make wine. Certain bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria, are used to make yogurt, cheese, hot sauce, pickles, fermented sausages and dishes such as kimchi. A common effect of these fermentations is that the food product is less <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> other microorganisms, including pathogens and spoilage-causing microorganisms, thus extending the food's shelf-life. Some cheese varieties also require molds to ripen and develop their characteristic flavors.|$|E
25|$|Cephalus, his father, was {{a native}} of Syracuse, and on the {{invitation}} of Pericles had settled at Athens. The opening scene of Plato's Republic is set at the house of his eldest son, Polemarchus, in Piraeus. The tone of the picture warrants the inference that the Sicilian family were well known to Plato, and that their houses must often have been <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> such gatherings. Further, Plato's Phaedrus opens with Phaedrus coming from conversation with Lysias at the house of Epicrates of Athens: he meets Socrates, with whom he will read and discuss the speech of Lysias he heard.|$|E

Madame Montour continued to have influence as a friend of the British, representing the Iroquois and other native peoples of the area. She was <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> the white men who were beginning to migrate into the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. She had a great amount of influence with the various Indian tribes in the area, who were feeling the pressure of colonial expansion.|$|E

25|$|In 1971 {{the state}} briefly closed the tower, {{but it was}} reopened the next year due to {{problems}} with communications in that region. The Dibbles sold their farm in the early 1980s, and the new owner was not as <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> hikers, closing it off to all but state access per its easement. Shortly afterward it was closed, as the fire risk to the region had declined since the early 20th century due to {{the decline of the}} railroads and logging and the public's greater vigilance in reporting fires. But a renewed period of heavy fires led the state to reopen it in 1987. This time it remained in use until 1990, the last fire tower in the Catskills to be closed.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} Poland is closely {{connected}} with its intricate 1,000-year history Its unique character {{developed as a}} result of its geography at the confluence of European cultures. With origins in the culture of the Proto-Slavs, over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the Germanic, Latinate and Byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland. The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries. In the 19th and 20th centuries the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity. These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.|$|E
25|$|Planetary {{habitability}} is {{the measure}} of a planet's or a natural satellite's potential to have habitable environments <b>hospitable</b> <b>to</b> life, or its ability to generate life endogenously. A planet in the habitable zone has no guarantee of actually being habitable, and habitable environments {{do not need to}} contain life. Life may develop directly on a planet or satellite or be transferred to it from another body, a hypothetical process known as panspermia. As the existence of life beyond Earth is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the Sun and Solar System which appear favorable to life's flourishing—in particular those factors that have sustained complex, multicellular organisms and not just simpler, unicellular creatures. Research and theory in this regard is a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology.|$|E
