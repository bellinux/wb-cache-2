5000|$|Traditionally, Japanese landlords collect both a damage deposit and [...] "key money" [...] {{before the}} renter takes occupancy, {{and the real}} estate agent is also paid a month's rent for {{services}} provided. <b>Key</b> <b>money</b> is a non-refundable payment to the landlord.

In recent years many landlords have begun demanding smaller amounts of <b>key</b> <b>money,</b> equal to two or three months' rent or none at all. An industry of no-deposit apartments, called monthly mansion and weekly mansion, has also sprouted up in major cities: these generally charge higher rents than traditional leases, and may offer some hotel-style amenities such as linen service.|$|E
