5000|$|As {{a member}} of the <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>Unit,</b> I had the great honour to meet with a genius thinker in the Silicon Valley: Willis Harman. According to Willis Harman in the late Middle Ages, the civilization shifted to the Renaissance because Copernicus {{proposed}} a new way of conceiving the Earth and the sky. Similarly today, the culture shift is happening around a new definition of consciousness and matter. We are leaving metaphysics [...] "M1", which says that matter exists and that consciousness emanates from matter and some quantic scientists are already in a new metaphysics [...] "M3" [...] who discovers that consciousness is first and allows the emergence of matter. According to Harman, this conceptual earthquake, transforms the scientific method itself. And the [...] "new science" [...] is increasingly similar to the latest developments in quantum physics. Harman considers that this transmodern science resembles the vision of Humanity’s Perennial Wisdom and that opposition between science and philosophy will disappear slowly.|$|E

The Portuguese Presidency notably succeeded in securing a compromise on the so-called Lisbon Strategy, a comprehensive plan that was aimed at boosting growth and employment level in the EU. The strategy was adopted at an extraordinary European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, a meeting in which Maria João Rodrigues acted as a sherpa for the Prime Minister. She notably contributed to build a compromise between the delegations of the British and French governments, by resorting to the open method of coordination.Maria João Rodrigues continued to monitor closely the developments of the Lisbon Strategy, in particular as Special Advisor to the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union for the Mid-term Review of the Lisbon Strategy (2005) and special advisor to the European Commission and Jean-Claude Juncker on the Lisbon strategy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illuminates}} {{the limits of}} a cosmopolitan deliberative governance via an analysis of EU practices and theories of ‘governance’. Analysing {{the point at which}} the term ‘governance ’ became prominent in the institutions, via a consideration of the European Commission’s 2001 White Paper and the various proposals for ‘new governance ’ produced by its in-house think-tank, the <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>Unit</b> (FSU), in the late 1990 s, it detects in this turn a Habermasian discourse ethic, which has informed much contemporary social, legal and political theorising on governance and deliberative democracy. In these reports an open, pluralist and procedural rationality and practice of governance is advocated as thirdway between state and market. However, the implicit conditions required for consensus or learning are constitutive of important closures. Turning to recent practice, the EU’s ‘Open Method of Co-ordination ’ (OMC) – much vaunted by certain deliberative scholars- while ostensibly embodying an inclusive procedural rationality, is significantly circumscribed by an extant market constitution which excludes certain forms of welfare or social policy. More generally, it is suggested that advocates of a deliberative post-national governance fail to scrutinise the ways in which their key agent, civil society, has been intimately connecte...|$|E

40|$|Ven, Karin H. J. Van Der (Dogus Author) The role {{of future}} {{exploration}} {{as a type}} of expertise in the policy-making process has increased in the past decades. Research about the relationship between future exploration and policy-making is largely limited to national policy-making processes, and there has not been much research of the European Union in this context. The aim of this empirical study is to provide insights about future exploration and policy-making in the European Union structures. Its main focus is on the Turkey-EU accession dossier; a topical issue on the European agenda today, as well as one with certain presumed orientation towards the future, namely Turkish membership. On the basis of the Turkey-EU dossier, closely related to EU enlargement policy at large, the ambition {{of this study is to}} derive meaningful conclusions for the wider realm of European policy-making. The study focuses both on the formal (institutionalized) methods of future exploration, as well as the informal ways in which the future plays a role in European policy making. Qualitative methods are employed to detect and analyse relevant policy-documents from the European Parliament, European Commission, and Council, as well as those from their subunits dedicated to enlargement policy. In addition, an inquiry of external future explorative bodies in the field of Turkey-EU relations is made to contribute to a comprehensive view of the existence of future explorations, as well as their role in policy-making. Interviews with three officials, active in the EU-Turkey policy-making process in different ways, serve to complement the analysis. Theoretical insights in relation to expertise and policy-making, as well as the more specific field future exploration and policy-making are employed to position the findings within their proper field. The realization that future exploration plays a very limited role in policy making regarding the Turkey-EU accession dossier is among the most important fınding of this study in relation to the formal role of future explorations in the EU. Furthermore, the practice of future exploration seems to be closely intertwined with the actual policy-making process, and the involvement of external agencies is marginal. About the more in formal relationship between future exploration and policy-making, it can be said in this dossier, the EU seeks to plan its future rather than explore it, primarily by establishing objectives and creating policy for the long-term.
