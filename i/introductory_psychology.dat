25|$|Educational {{psychology}} can in part {{be understood}} through {{its relationship with}} other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous {{to the relationship between}} medicine and biology. It is also informed by neuroscience. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education, classroom management, and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences.

40|$|The {{stated purpose}} of this study was to measure the effects of a public school field {{experience}} upon the achievement, educational philosophy, and attitudes of teacher trainees enrolled in an <b>introductory</b> educational <b>psychology</b> course. The study centers on a new approach used in organizing and teaching <b>introductory</b> educational <b>psychology</b> which required the student's participation in a directed field experience that was to be coordinated with the campus class. For purposes of comparative research the students enrolling in the course were randomly assigned to (a) a lecture-recitation section or to (b) a lecture-recitation-field experience-team taught section. This paper describes the measuring instruments used in the study and the course itself. Results of the data from each group by itself and in comparison with each other indicated that adding a field experience in the public schools to a university class did not appreciably affect achievement but did, at times, affect student attitudes and philosophical values.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} {{of academic and}} scientific achievement and impact is important for many reasons, including assessment of individuals and groups of individuals (such as academic departments), identification of unusually accomplished individuals and departments, and resource allocation among departments within a given university. Of course, {{there is no single}} “best ” operational method of measurement. Institutional research productivity, reputation rankings and citation analyses have all been operationalized {{in a number of different}} ways. Within social and personality psychology, impact and eminence have been assessed in several ways, including counts of publications in key journals and citation counts from Social Science Citation Index (Dialogue, 2005). An additional technique is to count citations within psychology textbooks (e. g., Gordan & Vicari, 1992). Such citations give a unique picture of achievement and influence, as textbooks are the basic learning tools for <b>introductory</b> undergraduate <b>psychology</b> students. Because of the high proportion of college students (both psychology majors and non-majors) who take <b>introductory</b> social <b>psychology</b> courses, the potential for influence on the next generation is enormous.
