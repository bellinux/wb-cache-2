Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E

25|$|Second {{trimester}} losses {{may be due}} to maternal {{factors such}} as uterine malformation, growths in the uterus (fibroids), or cervical problems. These conditions also may contribute to premature birth. Unlike first-trimester miscarriages, second-trimester miscarriages {{are less likely to be}} caused by a genetic abnormality; chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases. Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage. These include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, and <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> use, among others.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{miscarriage}} include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, thyroid problems, and <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> use. About 80% of miscarriages {{occur in the}} first 12 weeks of pregnancy (the first trimester). The underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve {{checking to see if}} the cervix is open or closed, testing blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and an ultrasound. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{abuse is}} that {{involving}} contact intended to cause fear, pain, injury, other physical suffering or bodily harm. The dynamics of physical abuse {{in a relationship}} are often complex. Physical violence can be the culmination of other abusive behavior, such as threats, intimidation, and restriction of victim self-determination through isolation, manipulation and other limitations of personal freedom. Denying medical care, sleep deprivation, and forced <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> use, are also forms of physical abuse. It can also include inflicting physical injury onto other targets, such as children or pets, in order to cause emotional harm to the victim.|$|E

25|$|Of 17 high-income {{countries}} {{studied by}} the National Institutes of Health in 2013, the United States ranked {{at or near}} the top in obesity rate, frequency of automobile use and accidents, homicides, infant mortality rate, incidence of heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, recreational <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> deaths, injuries, and rates of disability. Together, such lifestyle and societal factors place the U.S. at the bottom of that list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country, though Americans who reach age 75 live longer than those who reach that age in peer nations.|$|E

An investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found that the driver was not wearing spectacles {{at the time of the}} accident, despite it being a requirement on his medical certificate to do so when driving. No testing was carried out by the GCR on the train crew for <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> use. There was no first aid kit carried on the locomotive, although this was recommended by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate for all locomotives. The RAIB made four recommendations as a result of the accident.|$|E
25|$|The National Center for Health Statistics {{says that}} {{national}} birth rates for teenagers are at historic lows – during 2007–2010, teen birth rates fell 17% nationally;. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. A study by West Virginia's Marshall University showed that 19% of babies {{born in the}} state have evidence of <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure. This is several times the national rate, where studies show that about 5.9% of pregnant women in the U.S. use illicit drugs, and about 8.5% consume any alcohol. An Institute for Health Policy Research study determined that mortality rates in Appalachia are correlated with coal production. In twenty West Virginia coal counties mining more than 1 million tons of coal per year and having a total population of 850,000, there are about 10,100 deaths per year, with 1,400 of those statistically attributed to deaths from heart, respiratory and kidney disease from living in an Appalachian coal county.|$|E

25|$|The {{court can}} impose a {{condition}} that a defendant not consume alcohol. Courts can prohibit use of other legally-obtained intoxicants as well. But the condition must be reasonably related to the crime for which the defendant pleaded guilty. The court can order outpatient drug abuse treatment and alcohol testing even if the defendant has no history of <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> abuse, if the defendant has attempted suicide by overdosing on medication and {{has a history of}} unstable behavior. The court may waive the statutory drug testing requirement if the presentence report or other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future substance abuse, but in some circuits is not required to do so although at least one defendant was not required to under mandatory drug testing as part of his probation where the offense was not drug-related and the defendant did not have a history of drug abuse. Nearly 680,000 federal offender urine samples were tested for drugs in 1992. Consuming 12 beers over a weekend does not constitute excessive use of alcohol as a matter of law.|$|E
25|$|Drug abuse, {{including}} {{alcohol and}} prescription drugs, can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness, {{which can make}} it difficult to differentiate between substance induced psychiatric syndromes and pre-existing mental health problems. More often than not psychiatric disorders among <b>drug</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> abusers disappear with prolonged abstinence. Substance induced psychiatric symptoms can occur both in the intoxicated state and also during the withdrawal state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or depression after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Abuse of hallucinogens can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use and cannabis may trigger panic attacks during intoxication and with use it may cause a state similar to dysthymia. Severe anxiety and depression are commonly induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence. Even moderate sustained use of alcohol may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases these drug induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence. A protracted withdrawal syndrome can also occur with psychiatric and other symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. Benzodiazepines are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use.|$|E
