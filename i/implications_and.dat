Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax <b>implications,</b> <b>and</b> that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic <b>implications</b> <b>and</b> technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E

The class of projected join dependencies is a proper subclass of the above class, and it generalizes slightly embedded join dependencies.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper deals with the cognitive theories of graphical representations. Two experiments were carried out to investigate the production and comprehension of a neglected type of graphical representations: tables. The first experiment aimed at assessing whether the way people arrange pieces of information in table depended {{on the type of}} semantic relation they convey. Two relations were used: <b>implication</b> <b>and</b> genealogy. In a second experiment, we compared two arrangements of information in tables and their effect on a description task. The same relations as those used in the first experiment were presented: <b>implication</b> <b>and</b> genealogy. The results of these two experiments showed that the optimal arrangement of elements in tables was dependent on the relation: in the first task, participants tended to plot horizontally elements that were linked by an <b>implication</b> relation, <b>and</b> vertically elements that were linked by a genealogy relation. In the second task, the horizontal arrangement for <b>implication</b> <b>and</b> the vertical arrangement for genealogy improve readers’ processing of the information 1...|$|R
