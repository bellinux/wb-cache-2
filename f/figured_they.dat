25|$|There is an {{abandoned}} donkey engine {{in the forest}} near {{the west bank of}} the Clearwater River at Marcus Falls. It can be seen from the viewpoint in late fall when leaves are off the trees, but otherwise it is not accessible. It was moved here in the winter of 1912-13 when the Canadian Northern Railway was being planned and some loggers <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> could get the contract for the Clearwater River bridge at Bailey's Chute if they had a donkey on site. The 10-ton machine was skidded over the ice of Canim Lake, rafted along Mahood Lake in the spring, then winched to this location. The men had already cut 9000 cubic meters of timber when the railway was confirmed along a different route.|$|E
500|$|At first, Nevermind did {{not receive}} many reviews, and many {{publications}} ignored the album. Months after its release and after [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] garnered airplay, print media organizations were [...] "scrambling" [...] to cover the phenomenon the album had become. However, by that point, much of the attention fell on Cobain rather than the album itself. The reviews that did initially appear were largely positive. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, [...] "With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." [...] Schoemer concluded, [...] "'Nevermind' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind, Nirvana [...] "never entertain the notion" [...] of wanting to sound [...] "normal," [...] compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that [...] "When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> {{had the potential to}} make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right." [...] Spin gave Nevermind a favorable review stating that [...] "you'll be humming all the songs {{for the rest of your}} life—or at least until your CD-tape-album wears out." [...] Select compared the band to Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies, stating that the album [...] "proves that Nirvana truly belong in such high company." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Twins <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> had a 50–50 {{chance of}} losing Breslow when they placed him on waivers in May 2009 to clear space on their 25-man roster for fellow {{left-hander}} Sean Henn. [...] Oakland needed bullpen help and claimed Breslow before his 72-hour waiver period expired. [...] Had he cleared, the Twins could have {{sent him to}} Triple-A Rochester. [...] "We were hoping to keep him", said assistant general manager Rob Antony. [...] "We lost a bullpen guy without trying to lose a bullpen guy", manager Ron Gardenhire said. [...] "I kind of got shocked when they told me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nolan <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> {{had missed}} Silver Lake {{and they had}} no choice but the set a compass course back to Double Lakes. There was no sign of the men sent out for water. Nolan figured his {{position}} some [...] north-west of Double Lakes. He knew for a fact that water was there. Now the Comanche were forgotten and the primary struggle was for survival. The hunters disagreed and the expedition began to break up. Nolan argued the best course was to stay together. The hunters strode off then went their different ways focusing on their own goals for survival. Amazingly the hunters still had two quart bottles of [...] "high-proof brandy." [...] They divided it and went their ways. The smartest ones dipped a cloth to moisten the lips and to inhale its vapors and so refreshed they moved onward into the wilderness.|$|E
2500|$|The Texan {{officials}} {{began the}} treaty talks with demands that were unacceptable or impossible to fulfill for the Comanches, {{such as the}} Comanche return all white captives, including the famous captive Cynthia Parker. Other white captives were with bands of the Comanche not represented at the talks. [...] As a show of good faith the Comanche chiefs brought in two captives, a Mexican boy and an adolescent girl named Matilda Lockhart. The Texans {{thought they were going}} against their word, because the Comanche chiefs did not return all of the white captives and <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> held back some of their white captives to guarantee their own safety. Exercising a premeditated plan of violating the immunity of the peace delegation, the Texas militiamen told the chiefs it was they that would indeed be held hostage to guarantee the release of their other white captives. Everyone panicked and drew their weapons. The militia began firing and the entire Comanche peace delegation was killed.. Oklahoma Press. 1952.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{a special}} finish was {{witnessed}} at the Stadium as Alexander Vasquez outdueled twenty {{of his peers}} to win a field sprint. 1981 saw the arrival of Alpheus Williams, a precocious youngster who {{would go on to}} win three Classics before leaving Belize in 1985. Teammate Lindy Gillett set a record and became the youngest winner of a Classic at 18 in 1983; Robert Mossiah and Matthew Smiling took titles in 1985 and 1986, respectively. But in 1987, cyclists from the United States imported by Belizean team owners would {{put an end to the}} homegrown dominance. Ward Zauner broke Gillett's record in his 1987 win; Steve Steward and David Licker swept the top positions in 1988, and Frank [...] "Mac" [...] McCannon took the roses in 1989. These American winners rode a faster pace and were better sprinters, but Belizean sports fans <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> had the right person to beat them-if they could find out who that was.|$|E

2500|$|Ed Roberts {{received}} a letter from Traf-O-Data asking if he would be interested in buying its BASIC programming language for the machine. He called the company and reached a private home, where no one had heard of anything like BASIC. In fact the letter had been sent by Bill Gates and Paul Allen from the Boston area, and they had no BASIC yet to offer. When they called Roberts to follow up on the letter he expressed his interest, and the two started work on their BASIC interpreter using a self-made simulator for the 8080 on a PDP-10 minicomputer. They <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> had 30 days before someone else beat them to the punch, and once they had a version working on the simulator, Allen flew to Albuquerque to deliver the program, Altair BASIC (aka MITS 4K BASIC), on a paper tape. The first time it was run, it displayed [...] "READY" [...] then Allen typed [...] "PRINT 2+2" [...] and it immediately printed the correct answer: [...] "4". The game Lunar Lander was entered in and this worked as well. Gates soon joined Allen and formed Microsoft, then spelled [...] "Micro-Soft".|$|E

6000|$|... "The thing," [...] said Lewson quietly, [...] "was simple. It {{was dark}} and hazy, and raining quite hard, {{and the first thing}} we did was to run the boat down and leave her nearly afloat. Then we crawled back, and lay by {{listening}} outside that store. We were figuring how we were to break it in when two men came along. They went in and came out with a bag or two, and as they left the door open we <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> were coming back for more. We humped out a moderate load, and had just got it down to the boat when we saw those men, or two others, in the haze. I was for lying by, but Charly would get out then." ...|$|E

60|$|Karaguus, the black-eyed pigeon, brought tidings to the Queen of the Ansarey, {{from her}} agent Darkush, that two young princes, one a Syrian, {{the other a}} Frank, wished to enter her territories to confer with her on grave matters, {{and that he had}} reason to believe that one of the princes, the Frank, strange, {{incredible}} as it might sound, was one of themselves. On the evening of the next day, very weary, came Ruby-lips, the brother of Black-eyes, with the reply of her Majesty, ordering Darkush to grant the solicited pass, but limiting the permission of entrance into her dominions to the two princes and two attendants. As one of these, Baroni <b>figured.</b> <b>They</b> did not travel very rapidly. Tancred was glad to seize the occasion to visit Hameh and Aleppo on his journey.|$|E
6000|$|Alton nodded gravely, {{but there}} was a subdued {{brightness}} in his eyes, and the girl wished he would open them fully. She fancied he was putting considerable restraint upon himself. [...] "I don't know about Charley. He can talk better than I can for himself, but I shall miss you all the time," [...] he said. [...] "This has been a revelation to me, and I feel that it is good for me to talk to you. Then, before you came I had a kind of bitter feeling against all my father's folks in England. I <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> were wrapped up in their cast-iron pride, and ready to trample on anybody who got in their way; but you have started me thinking differently, and it seems my duty to know more of them. After all, I am an Alton of Carnaby." ...|$|E
60|$|Of the {{internal}} organs, whilst the Cirripede is still within the larva, I have already mentioned the stomach with its pair of cæca: from the retracted {{position of the}} thorax and rudimentary abdomen, and consequently of the anus, compared with these parts in the larva, the alimentary canal is not above half its former length. There is, as yet, {{no trace of the}} filaments supposed by some to act as branchiæ, {{at the base of the}} first pair of cirri. Nor could I perceive a trace of the testes or vesiculæ seminales: the penis is represented by a minute, apparently imperforate projection. I have already briefly described the pair of large, gut-formed bodies in the larva, into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts ran, and evidently derived their slightly opaque, cellular contents. At a very early age, before the young Cirripede can be distinctly made out, the posterior ends of these gut-formed bodies are absorbed, so as not to pass beyond the cæca of the stomach. When the young Cirripede is plainly developed within the larva, these bodies in a relatively reduced condition are still distinct near the cæca, and at the opposite or anterior end (i. e. lower, in the position in which Cirripedes are usually <b>figured),</b> <b>they</b> have branched out into a sheet of delicate inosculating tubes; these could be traced by every stage, until, in the young perfected Cirripede, they filled the peduncle as ordinary ovarian tubes. In the larva, the two gut-formed bodies or incipient ovaria keep of equal thickness from one to the other end, but in the mature Cirripede, the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and the small, glandular, grape-like masses, near the stomach-cæca, are connected only by a delicate tube; this I failed in tracing in specimens in the very immature condition of those now under description.|$|E

50|$|Almost 75% of Red Ball Express {{drivers were}} African Americans, able-bodied {{soldiers}} who had been previously attached to various units for other duties.

50|$|There was a {{passenger}} revolt aboard the brigantine Hope {{while it was}} bringing slaves from the coast of Senegal and Gambia to Connecticut. How did that happen? -Well, the captain, who had beaten several of his crewmen, had been killed and his body thrown overboard, and so the black cargo, seeing such discord among their captors, <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> maybe had a chance. In their revolt they killed one crew member and wounded several others. On this day their revolt was suppressed by killing seven of them.|$|E
50|$|Bangs and his penniless friends <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> could {{finance a}} return trip or two by taking clients along.

Sobek became a river-running exploratory company via which Bangs and fellow guides racked up 35 first descents. Sobek Expeditions merged with Mountain Travel to become Mountain Travel Sobek in 1991.

50|$|Beneath the Shadows being {{rejected}} by the hardcore scene was the final straw for me, after many, many straws. Here was this most fascinating outgrowth of punk — they could've been our Damned or Siouxsie and the Banshees — retaining the original guts and drive, taking it into this unique direction. The hardcore audience rejected them, the rock & roll audience <b>figured</b> <b>they</b> were still hardcore, {{so there was no}} audience for the music. They broke up. It was a very bad time. It became a rugby game with no meaning.|$|E
