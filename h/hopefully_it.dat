Some Team Bondi former employees went on to work for different Rockstar studios, while some went to Kennedy Miller Mitchell. Despite the allegedly difficult relationship during development, McNamara maintains an optimistic attitude towards Rockstar.

Irreverent and edgy, and sometimes downright stupid, Moron Life has something to say. <b>Hopefully,</b> <b>it’s</b> always funny.

It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, <b>hopefully</b> <b>it</b> will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing.

500|$|Himmler was {{inspired}} by the noted successes of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry in World War I. He [...] "endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army {{in the form of a}} Bosnian Muslim SS Division". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local [...] "order". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. [...] "Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and <b>hopefully</b> <b>it</b> and our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by... the Bosnian division... so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2000, Wembley Stadium, the final's {{traditional}} venue, {{was closed}} {{in anticipation of}} major redevelopment. Having considered alternative venues such as Twickenham, Murrayfield and Villa Park, the FA announced in January 2001 that the next three Cup finals would be staged at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. This therefore {{marked the first time}} the showpiece event was held outside England. In the lead-up to the final, FA chief executive Adam Crozier acknowledged concerns over transport {{and the quality of the}} pitch, saying, [...] "We've done a lot of work with Cardiff and <b>hopefully</b> <b>it</b> will be a great occasion, but we'll take a view about how it's worked after the final and decide whether to still hold the match there." [...] A new pitch was re-laid in May, and the police made attempts to ease traffic on the M4 by opening three more turn-offs than they did for the League Cup final.|$|E

[...] "I like analyzing fights, and I like doing color commentating," [...] he said.

What more can go wrong? <b>It's</b> tough. But <b>hopefully</b> <b>it's</b> the nadir of Stan's troubles. He's about to bounce back strong and hard—that's my hope for Stan." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{starting}} for {{an injured}} John David Booty in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom mouthguard that featured {{the colors of}} the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage. It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It’s just a little bit of pride in our heritage. <b>Hopefully,</b> <b>it</b> inspires somebody and it’s all for the best." [...] Overwhelmed by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to help the Hispanic community.|$|E
500|$|While this {{mixing of}} campaigns was done without the {{knowledge}} of the members of Fall Out Boy, Wentz did post an acknowledgement on August 22, when CFOB again [...] "hijacked" [...] Decaydance Records website. Decaydance act The Cab began performing with [...] "Citizens for Our Betterment" [...] written on the group's instruments. Finally, on August 26, a blog post of a press release was made on the band's FriendsOrEnemies.com page; it announced Folie à Deux as the title of the upcoming album, due for release on November 4. Wentz said of the endeavor [...] "To me, this is not a marketing campaign. It is a way to cause excitement about your art and have people earn it and understand it...I don't believe the full campaign has begun, and I also believe people are taking over the ship in a truly viral way. It doesn't hurt anyone, and <b>hopefully</b> <b>it</b> {{tells the story of the}} project better and makes it more appreciated." ...|$|E

Although they ultimately settled on having Kyle kill the [...] "main zombie" [...] {{to bring back the}} others, Parker did not feel the resolution made sense and described it as a deus ex machina. Parker said of the ending, [...] "This was another big one of those episodes where we were sort of (like), 'How do we get out of this one?'" [...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and <b>hopefully</b> <b>it</b> won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving.

You're no longer just succeeding because you're in a movie with the Jonas Brothers. These people bought your music for you." [...] Later in February 2009, Lovato's first headlining sitcom, Sonny with a Chance, premiered on Disney Channel. Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned two singles, [...] "Get Back" [...] and [...] "La La Land". In January 2009, Lovato announced to MTV News that she had already begun writing songs for her second studio album, as well as revealing its approach: [...] "It's {{going to take a}} different sound, so <b>hopefully</b> <b>it</b> goes over well. I sing a lot of rock, but this time I want to do more John Mayer-ish type of songs. Hopefully I can write with people like him. I love their music — it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 24, {{which was}} Yom Kippur, Youkilis {{appeared}} in the dugout in uniform, but declined {{to participate in the}} game out of deference to the religious holiday. Youkilis was named the club's Rookie of the Year by the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. For the season, in 44 games, he saw an average of 4.67 pitches per plate appearance, first among major leaguers with at least 90 plate appearances. As Youkilis observed, [...] "Fighting off pitches, fouling off pitches, laying off pitches, making it so the opposing pitcher can't breathe; that's my job." [...] He was on the roster for the Red Sox for the 2004 American League Division Series (ALDS), making his sole appearance in Game 2 against the Anaheim Angels. [...] "It's been an unbelievable ride", Youkilis said. [...] "It's a great first year, a year you probably can't top. <b>Hopefully,</b> <b>it</b> ends like a Cinderella story." [...] He was removed from the roster for the next round, the American League Championship Series (ALCS), and was on the roster but did not play in the World Series.|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so I {{want it to be}} very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>it</b> will be {{something}} people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head. I was going through a run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever seen me [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun." [...] Several songs from her previous albums ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again were remixed by Robson to [...] "take [...] in a new direction– flip [...] up a bit".|$|E

And I know it's gonna fuck a lot of people up. I want to make sure it gets done the right way, so we're being real careful with it. We don't know if we have the manpower ourselves to put it out on White Drugs, so we're trying {{to see if we can}} find a label who's in love with it enough to put it out there.|$|R
5000|$|David Jeffries from allmusic {{gave the}} EP a 3.5 out of 5 praising the overall album-like quality. Michael Weaver of Jesusfreakhideout gave the EP a 3 out of 5 saying: [...] "While it's {{great to see}} KB back in the mix, it's also a bit disappointing to see him not reach his full potential. [...] "100" [...] and [...] "Undefeated" [...] offer some enjoyment, with [...] "Kamikaze" [...] also being a decent track, but {{the other half of}} the EP may leave you {{scratching}} your head. There are a couple of tracks worth grabbing, but more than anything, this EP has me wondering what KB may have in store for his next full-length record. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>it's</b> more Weight & Glory and less 100 EP".|$|R
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>it</b> could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E
