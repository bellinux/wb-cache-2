5|$|A new Magnifier {{setting was}} added which {{allows users to}} triple-click the <b>home</b> <b>button</b> and iOS will open the Camera app with {{magnification}} on.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{physical}} {{switches on the}} iPad, including a <b>home</b> <b>button</b> near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.|$|E
5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a <b>home</b> <b>button</b> near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E
50|$|The Remote App was updated on September 13, 2016, to take {{advantage}} of all the features of the Apple TV 4. This includes Siri, Touchpad, and <b>Home</b> <b>Buttons,</b> along with a now playing screen.|$|R
50|$|The {{interface}} uses {{either the}} touch screen, or a directional pad and select button, with separate back, menu, and <b>home</b> <b>buttons.</b> It {{is capable of}} receiving text input through handwriting recognition, two different sizes of on-screen keyboard and hardware keyboard input with the N810.|$|R
5000|$|Native {{screen capture}} is added by {{pressing}} <b>home</b> and power <b>buttons</b> simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the <b>home</b> <b>button</b> placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E
25|$|By default, {{the main}} user {{interface}} includes back, forward, refresh/cancel and menu buttons. A <b>home</b> <b>button</b> is not shown by default, {{but can be}} added through the Settings page to take the user to the new tab page or a custom home page.|$|E
25|$|The {{intelligence}} also extends into apps. For instance, in Mail, {{events can}} be automatically added to Calendar if details {{are found in}} the message content, and likely additional recipients are suggested during message composition. Siri is also aware of what is currently on screen when it is engaged by holding down the <b>home</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Auditors: in the Common Army gold color buttons; in the <b>Home</b> guard silver <b>buttons</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Nokia X2 {{has a lot}} {{of changes}} {{compared}} to the original. It is powered by a 1.2 GHz dual-core Snapdragon 200 SoC, a significant upgrade from the older 1 GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 Play used in the previous Nokia X series. It features hardware back and <b>home</b> <b>buttons,</b> as opposed to the single back button on the past Nokia X devices. OS version has changed to Nokia X Software Platform 2.0 (based on Android 4.3 Jellybean) from 1.0 (Android Jellybean 4.1.2), with the amount of RAM increasing to 1 GB. The screen has changed to a 4.3 inch (11 cm) ClearBlack LCD panel, which is slightly bigger than the Nokia X (1st version) with a 4.0 inch (10 cm) screen.|$|R

25|$|Two of {{the first}} {{smartphone}} manufacturers to integrate fingerprint recognition into their phones were Motorola with the Atrix 4G in 2011, and Apple with the iPhone 5S on 10 September 2013. One month after, HTC launched the One Max, which also included fingerprint recognition. In April 2014, Samsung released the Galaxy S5, which integrated a fingerprint sensor on the <b>home</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 2017, Apple {{introduced}} the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, standing as evolutionary updates to its previous phones with a faster processor, improved display technology and upgraded camera systems. The company also announced iPhone X, which radically changes the hardware of the iPhone lineup, removing the <b>home</b> <b>button</b> {{in favor of}} facial recognition technology and featuring a near bezel-less design along with introducing wireless charging.|$|E
25|$|Like other Apple {{products}} such as the iPhone with a three click sequence to the <b>home</b> <b>button</b> to activate accessibility features, with Apple TV's tvOS, a user can activate VoiceOver without any installation process. One needs only to triple-click the Menu button on the Siri Remote and the Apple TV will guide the user through the complete initial setup, a task that is non-trivial to the visually impaired in most comparable products on the market.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to its {{official}} announcement, media outlets reported on rumors and information from industry insiders. In December 2016, SamMobile {{reported that the}} Galaxy S8 would not feature a 3.5 mm headphone jack, later reported to be a false rumor. In January 2017, The Guardian reported on bigger screens for both of the two phone sizes, with edge-to-edge [...] "infinity" [...] displays and very limited bezels, and an iris scanner. Additionally, The Guardian stated that the phones would come with 64 gigabytes of storage and support microSD cards, use USB-C connectors, and feature a [...] "Bixby" [...] intelligent personal assistant. Soon after, VentureBeat revealed photos of the phones and additional details, including the lack of physical navigation and <b>home</b> <b>buttons,</b> in which the fingerprint sensor {{was moved to the}} back of the phone. Evan Blass tweeted in mid-March about color options for the phones.|$|R
5000|$|The Treo 600 is {{a rather}} large device by cell phone {{standards}} but compact for a PDA. The 600 is slightly wider and deeper than its predecessor and is nearly half an inch slimmer, giving it a more cell-phone like feel. The new form factor {{has been compared to}} a bar of soap. The design is definitely an example of form-follows-function, the front of the phone consists of a full QWERTY keyboard at the bottom with menu and <b>home</b> <b>buttons</b> at the bottom right. Above the keyboard are the 4 application buttons with a [...] "five-way" [...] navigator in-between. Each application button can be mapped to two applications, {{with the exception of the}} last button which has one of its functions permanently mapped to the on/off. Above the buttons and navigator is a small Treo logo and the large 160x160 color touch screen.|$|R
2500|$|A {{firmware}} update (version 1.1) for the Nano {{was released on}} February 28, 2011. The update added the ability to change songs or pause with a double click of the sleep/wake button. It also added the ability to turn the device off by holding the sleep/wake button. The user interface was also enhanced. On October 4, 2011, the iPod Nano 1.2 update was unveiled at the Apple [...] "Let's Talk iPhone" [...] event at the Town Hall, 4 Infinite Loop. This update added the option to increase or decrease {{the size of the}} <b>home</b> <b>buttons</b> for easier use. The update also added a better fitness app, which had a better pedometer split into walking and running style. The update also included 16 new clock faces, which included designs like a Nixie tube clock face or an old-style clock face, and Disney-licensed designs, such as Mickey Mouse and Kermit the Frog, bringing to a total of 18 clock faces. [...] Three more background images were also added.|$|R
25|$|The iPhone 7's {{overall design}} {{is similar to}} the iPhone 6S, but {{introduces}} new color options, water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static <b>home</b> <b>button,</b> and removes the 3.5mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware also received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, and upgraded 12megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models and an additional telephoto lens on the iPhone 7 Plus model to provide enhanced zoom capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Accessed {{with the}} Wii Remote's <b>HOME</b> <b>button,</b> the HOME Menu {{displays}} {{information about the}} controller(s) currently being used, and allows the user to configure certain options. At {{the bottom of the}} menu screen, the battery life of all connected controllers is displayed. Below that is a bar labeled Wii Remote Settings. Selecting it brings users to an options screen where they can control the audio output volume, rumble settings, and reconnect the controllers, for example to connect Wii Remotes through one-time synchronization. Depending on when the HOME Menu is accessed, there will be a different amount of buttons displayed.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo 3DS input {{controls}} {{include the}} following: a round nub analog input called the Circle Pad, a D-pad, four face buttons (A, B, X, Y), bumper buttons (L, R), a <b>HOME</b> <b>button,</b> START and SELECT buttons, and a POWER button. It {{also features a}} dedicated volume slider and a wireless switch, which turns on or off wireless communications. The touchscreen can be interacted with either the user's finger or a stylus bundled with the handheld. There is also a six-axis motion sensor, which includes a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. Through the Circle Pad Pro accessory the system has access to a second Circle Pad and trigger buttons (ZL, ZR).|$|E
50|$|<b>Home</b> driver Jenson <b>Button</b> led the Drivers' Championship by 26 {{points from}} Brawn {{teammate}} Rubens Barrichello. Barrichello was 8 points clear of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who lay 1.5 points {{ahead of his}} teammate, Mark Webber.|$|R
50|$|The Nexus Player comes bundled with a Bluetooth remote control, with a {{direction}} pad & middle enter <b>button,</b> a back, <b>home</b> and play/pause <b>button.</b> It {{also features a}} button to activate the Google Search application to search for content by speaking through the remote's built-in microphone. The device can also be controlled by any Android smartphone with Google Play services. The app also features an Android Wear counterpart to allow remote input from compatible smartwatches.|$|R
5000|$|After {{returning}} <b>home</b> from Detroit, <b>Buttons,</b> {{his beloved}} lab mix {{who had been}} the subject of quite a few of Lieberman's songs, had passed at 14 1/2 on 22 September 2004. He played some shows in New York City including CBGB's and the Acme Underground. Author/promoter Steven Blush was promoting a Thanksgiving Eve jam on 24 November 2004 at Don Hills and was the first to book Lieberman as [...] "Gangsta Rabbi".|$|R
25|$|The Home Menu (stylized as HOME Menu) is a {{graphical}} {{user interface}} similar to the Nintendo DSi Menu and Wii U Menu for Nintendo 3DS systems. It is used to launch software stored on Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS Game Cards, applications installed on a SD card and DSiWare titles installed in the system's internal memory. Application icons are set in a customizable grid navigable on the lower screen. On the upper screen, a special 3D animated logo is displayed for each individual app, as well as system information such as wireless signal strength, date and time, and battery life. Using the <b>Home</b> <b>button,</b> users can suspend the current software that is running and bring up the Home Menu, allowing the user to launch certain multitasking applications, such as the Internet Browser and Miiverse.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "slide to unlock" [...] {{mechanism}} on {{the lock}} screen {{has been removed}} in favor of pressing the <b>home</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
500|$|Before its {{official}} unveiling, media speculation primarily centered on {{reports that the}} next iPhone would include a fingerprint scanner; including Apple's July 2012 acquisition of AuthenTec, a developer of mobile security products, references to a fingerprint sensor on the <b>home</b> <b>button</b> in the beta release of iOS 7 and leaked packaging for an iPhone 5S showing that the traditional <b>home</b> <b>button</b> now had a metallic [...] "ring" [...] around it. Similar ring-based imagery was seen on the official invitation to Apple's iPhone press event in September 2013, where the new device was unveiled. Shortly before {{its official}} unveiling, The Wall Street Journal also reported the rumor.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its 5-inch, five-point capacitive touch screen, the S5100 features four face buttons, a start and a select <b>button,</b> <b>home,</b> back and menu buttons, an accelerometer, a 0.3 megapixel front camera, and a 0.2 megapixel back camera {{that can be used}} to capture photos. On the bottom of the unit is an MicroSD card slot. On the top is a 5-volt AC jack, a Mini USB port, a Mini HDMI port, and a headphone jack.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{there are}} plenty of {{hands-on}} activities that encourage the OOIZ visitor—adult or child—to get better acquainted with insects and arthropods of all shapes and sizes. Of particular interest in the OOIZ is the [...] "Our House, Their House" [...] display which shows insects living in and around a giant 3-D <b>home.</b> By pushing <b>buttons</b> in front of the house, visitors illuminate the harborage areas for common household insects such as fleas, roaches, carpenter ants and silverfish.|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the Xperia S is almost 90% glass which appears all black when the screen is off and the back is curved {{slightly}} for comfort. The antenna {{is embedded in the}} transparent strip which cuts through the base of the device, the strip illuminates and indicates where the back, <b>home,</b> and menu <b>buttons</b> are placed. The buttons themselves are implemented as touch-sensitive regions between the transparent strip and the screen.Under the transparent belt, there is an XPERIA inscripted on top.|$|R
500|$|There {{are four}} {{physical}} {{switches on the}} third-generation iPad, including a <b>home</b> <b>button</b> near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three plastic switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function varies with software update. The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense orientation and to switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic [...] "native" [...] orientation; only the relative position of the <b>home</b> <b>button</b> changes.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] touchscreen, the SIII has several physical user inputs, including a <b>home</b> <b>button</b> located below the screen, a volume key {{on the left side}} and a power/lock key on the right. At the top there is a [...] headphone jack and one of the two microphones on the SIII; the other is located below the <b>home</b> <b>button.</b> The SIII is advertised as having an MHL port that can be used both as a micro-USB On-The-Go port, and for connecting the phone to HDMI devices. However, a retailer later discovered that Samsung had made a modification to the electronics of the port such that only the adapter made specifically for this model by Samsung could be used.|$|E
500|$|If the iPhone 6 <b>home</b> <b>button</b> is {{repaired}} {{or modified}} by a third-party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components {{had not been}} [...] "re-validated" [...] for security reasons—a process {{which can only be}} performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well.|$|E
50|$|The Meizu M5 Note has a MTK6755M octa-core {{processor}} {{with an array}} of ten ARM Cortex CPU cores, an ARM Mali-T860 GPU and 3 to 4 GB of RAM LPDDR3 (depending of the version 16/32 or 64 GB). Unlike most other Android smartphones, the M5 Note has neither capacitive buttons nor on-screen buttons; the functionality of these keys is implemented using a technology which makes use of gestures with the <b>home</b> screen <b>button,</b> which also acts as a fingerprint sensor. The haptic technology that debuted on the Meizu M3, which allows the user to perform a different action by pressing the touchscreen instead of tapping, also features on the M5. The M5 Note has a 5.5-inch LTPS IPS LCD multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, and a pixel density of 403 ppi.|$|R
25|$|BAR {{brought in}} Jenson Button to replace Panis for the 2003 Formula One season. Villeneuve's {{contract}} negotiation arguments with David Richards eventually ended with him being replaced {{before the end}} of the season by Japanese driver Takuma Sato. Honda has traditionally liked its teams to field Japanese drivers for publicity reasons in the car manufacturer's <b>home</b> country. Jenson <b>Button</b> led a race for the first time at the 2003 United States Grand Prix. The team struggled due to its use of Bridgestone tyres. In the off-season they changed to rival company Michelin.|$|R
50|$|Players {{can choose}} to pitch either inside or outside the strike zone by moving the ball across a series of two boxes. The red box is the batter's {{immediate}} zone of batting while the yellow box is the entire width of <b>home</b> plate. Each <b>button</b> on the Super Famicom controller represents a base to throw in case one of the runners decide to steal a base. Unlike North America where the keys were assigned letters, the four major buttons on the Japanese game controller were assigned colors (as {{it was easier for}} Japanese users to memorize colors instead of the Latin letters A, B, X, and Y).|$|R
