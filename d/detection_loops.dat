The system divides each direction of travel into collector and express lanes,giving the highway a wide span and four carriageways. To avoid confusion between carriageways, blue signs are used for the collector lanes and green signs for the express lanes. Unlike the collector lanes, which provide access to every interchange, the express lanes only provide direct access to a select few interchanges. Access {{between the two is}} provided by transfers, which are strategically placed to prevent disruptions caused by closely spaced interchanges.The overall purpose of the collector-express system is to maximize traffic flow for both local and long-distance traffic.

50|$|Vehicle <b>detection</b> <b>loops,</b> called inductive-loop traffic detectors, {{can detect}} {{vehicles}} passing or {{arriving at a}} certain point, for instance approaching a traffic light or in motorway traffic. An insulated, electrically conducting loop is installed in the pavement. The electronics unit transmits energy into the wire loops at frequencies between 10 kHz to 200 kHz, depending on the model. The inductive-loop system behaves as a tuned electrical circuit in which the loop wire and lead-in cable are the inductive elements. When a vehicle passes over the loop or is stopped within the loop, the vehicle induces eddy currents in the wire loops, which decrease their inductance. The decreased inductance actuates the electronics unit output relay or solid-state optically isolated output, which sends a pulse to the traffic signal controller signifying the passage or presence of a vehicle. Parking structures for automobiles may use inductive loops to track traffic (occupancy) in and out or may be used by access gates or ticketing systems to detect vehicles while others use Parking guidance and information systems. Railways may use an induction loop to detect the passage of trains past a given point, as an electronic treadle.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} impediments to high-quality EEG recorded in an MRI scanner is subject motion. Availability of motion artefact sensors can substantially improve the quality of the recorded EEG. In the study of epilepsy, it can also dramatically increase the confidence one has in discriminating true epileptiform activity from artefact. This is due both to the reduction in artefact and the ability to visually inspect the motion sensor signals when reading the EEG, revealing whether or not head motion is present. We have previously described the use of carbon-fibre loops for detecting and correcting artefact in EEG acquired simultaneously with MRI. The loops, attached to the subject’s head, are electrically insulated from the scalp. They provide a simple and direct measure of specific artefact that is contaminating the EEG, including both subject motion and residual artefact arising from magnetic field gradients applied during MRI. Our previous implementation was used together with a custom-built EEG-fMRI system that differs substantially from current commercially available EEG-fMRI systems.

40|$|In {{this report}} a {{design of a}} traffic count network for the Dutch borough of Valkenburg is described. The purpose of this network is twofold: (1) to support borough policy; and (2) {{to act as an}} example to other similar boroughs. The {{purposes}} of using the network are: (a) to see if the roads are being used correctly conform with their function and facilities; (b) targeted surveillance of speeds by time and place; (c) evaluating speeding measures; and (d) monitoring congestions. A distinction can be made between systematic and ad-hoc traffic counts. For systematic counts, the selection of locations is done according to expected traffic problems. Systematic counts can be best carried out using double <b>detection</b> <b>loops.</b> Ad-hoc traffic counts can be done where there is an incidental need, and can be carried out with a portable system such as tubes or radar.

40|$|One {{aim of the}} Dutch "Sustainably-safe road {{surroundings}} and traffic behaviour" research programme is to find {{an answer to the}} question whether, and to what extent, a `sustainably-safe' design of rural collector roads influences road users' behaviour. The present report is part of this research programme. The report presents the research design together with the results of the October 2000 before/baseline measurement carried out using video observations and <b>detection</b> <b>loops.</b> The research design was that of a before-and-after study, with an experimental and control road section. As location two sections of the road were chosen between Meppel and Pesse in the north-eastern province of Drente. This is an 80 km/h rural collector road for motor vehicles only. The control section was between Weerwille and Blijdenstein and the experimental section between Pesse and the exit road to Ruinen. The before-measurement showed that, on weekdays, there were behavioural differences between the two sections. The detector loop data showed, among other things, that on the experimental section between Pesse and the exit road to Ruinen, the average speed driven was higher than on the control section between Weerwille and Blijdenstein. The video data showed that there were neither differences between the average headway times of the two sections, nor between the percentage of overtaking manoeuvres. There were, however, differences in lateral positions: the driving was nearer the axis line on the experimental section than on the control section. This applied especially for the traffic driving westwards...|$|E
40|$|To meet {{traffic control}} needs, {{detection}} systems must first have a fundamental capability to count vehicles passing {{in each direction}} along a road. For multilane roads, this detection capability is needed on an individual lane basis. As traffic control technology becomes more sophisticated, particularly in urban areas, measuring vehicular speed and type (truck or passenger) as well as numbers of vehicles approaching intersections or other control points becomes desirable. Vehicle detectors have been in use for more than 50 years. The most common are inductive loops or ellipses of wire buried in the roadway. 1, 2 These detectors record a vehicle passing over the loop. They work because most vehicles are made, at least partially, of ferro-magnetic materials that induce an inductive “blip ” of electric current in the buried loop as they pass over it. These detectors are relatively expensive and can suffer from severe weather hazards (freezing and so forth) that might deteriorate pavements and affect <b>detection</b> <b>loops.</b> Inductive loop detectors also have indeterminate zones of influence that make them difficult for multilane use and for speed or length detection. By contrast the infrared laser system {{described in this article}} has the potential for being low cost, safe, easily installed overhead, reliable and weather resistant. It also has the potential for vehicular speed and length determination and, because of its defined geometric properties, is suitable for multilane usage. The infrared laser system described is based on the use of laser sources and photodiode detectors that can be mounted above roadways to monitor traffic passage (Figure 1). The system does this by distinguishing between the reflection of infrared laser light from the road surface and the interruption and changes in such reflections by the passage of traffic. Furthermore, by using several laser beams illuminating successive sections of roadway vehicle passage, speed and length are obtainable for each traffic lane by comparing reflected laser signals with a computerized correlation scheme. This article describes the development, design and experimental testing of a system operating on these principles...|$|E

In Operating Rooms (OR), surgeons’ faces and hands are typically obstructed by sterile clothing and tools, making statistical and/or feature-based feature detection approaches ineffective.

40|$|Miniaturized, MEMS-based, {{inertial}} navigation systems are used to track the position of moving objects without an external reference system. Several existing and future applications such as indoor navigation, stability control of vehicles, active prostheses or training aids for sportsmen would benefit from the small size and the low cost of micromachined inertial sensors. The system performance depends {{on the performance of}} the inertial components, gyroscopes and accelerometers. Today true navigation with MEMS components is limited to short time periods, typically less than a minute. This thesis focuses on the development of better performing MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes. The design, fabrication and characterisation of micromachined three-axis accelerometers are described. These accelerometers are batch fabricated using silicon technology suitable for low-cost mass production. In contrast to most other monolithic silicon accelerometers slanted-beam accelerometers inherently show direction independent resolution and frequency response. Analytical models are presented that accurately model the sensitivity and the frequency response of the devices from the device geometry, the surrounding atmosphere and the readout circuitry. Different fabrication processes using bulk micromachining are proposed. Measurements on fabricated accelerometers over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and shaking conditions verify the models and demonstrate proper operation for both DC and AC measurements. These accelerometers are a promising alternative for future {{inertial navigation}} applications. Switched electronic circuits for sensor readout implemented in CMOS processes are proposed and verified. First, a capacitive readout circuit that is suitable for sensors with multiple capacitors connected to a common node, like the three axis accelerometer, is investigated. It is easy to implement since the need of fully differential amplifiers is eliminated. Second, a circuit for resonance frequency readout is investigated that eliminates crosstalk from the excitation signal to the detection circuit. Digital implementation of traditionally analogue parts of sensor systems is proposed. The digital technology is more flexible and allows more complex algorithms to be used. Gyroscope systems with digital excitation and <b>detection</b> <b>loops</b> as well as digital demodulation of the rate signal are demonstrated. Compared to previous analogue implementations these gyroscope systems show more stable rate signals since the low frequency noise from analogue circuits is avoided...|$|E
