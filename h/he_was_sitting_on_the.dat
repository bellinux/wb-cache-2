5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{during the}} early evening of May 14, in an {{apparent}} suicide, a man was killed after being struck by the Rail Runner as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tracks. On the evening of December 17, the inaugural day of service to Santa Fe, a southbound Rail Runner train struck a cow near San Felipe Pueblo.|$|E
60|$|That evening, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck, smoking his pipe, {{a shiver}} {{passed through the}} captain.|$|E
5000|$|... "Kathotane Se Ekeino To Trapezi" [...] (<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> that table) [...] - [...] 3:50 ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a stile {{between two}} threadbare looking fields, and {{suffering}} acutely from indigestion.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a chair, {{his hands}} fallen on his lap, the tears {{running down his}} face.|$|R
60|$|Next instant <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, having {{descended from}} the wall with the rapidity of one shot through the head.|$|E
60|$|Then Groa {{went to the}} shut {{bed where}} Asmund the Priest slept. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed and asked her why she came.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few more}} seconds, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, resting against his father, {{listening}} without alarm to his question--'Now, Owen, {{what were you}} saying?' ...|$|E
60|$|Shelton {{crossed the}} room, {{and went up}} to young Curly. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a bench, smiling to himself his private smiles.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a log; <b>he</b> {{sniffed the}} air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.|$|R
25|$|Richard Gere's {{character}} in The Mothman Prophecies (2002) {{appears in a}} scene where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a bench on the Cathedral of Learning lawn.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch, white-faced, one sea-boot in his hands, and I {{could have}} sworn his hands were shaking. That much I saw, and the next moment was out on deck.|$|E
60|$|Maraton {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the table, with folded arms. His visitor was pacing up and down the room, blowing out dense volumes of smoke.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{ground at}} her feet, his head pillowed in her lap, lazily dreaming whilst {{at his feet}} the river wound its graceful curves beneath {{overhanging}} willows and tall stately elms.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a bench {{outside an}} inn, {{when he heard}} two men who were loading their mules talking about the Groac'h of the island of Lok.|$|R
6000|$|He looks {{larger than}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> when <b>he</b> came in. I've offered him the dictionary; {{he says he}} has read it before. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> my table. Come at once! ...|$|R
60|$|The twins hunted {{around the}} school, {{and at last}} found Henry Stowell in the gymnasium, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a bench {{watching}} some other cadets going through their athletic exercises.|$|R
60|$|Toto, of course, wouldn't {{say a word}} {{to explain}} how the mistake arose. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> visitor's lap, shrieking about what he would have done to me if they hadn't {{separated}} us.|$|E
60|$|Two days passed. As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{platform}} {{over his}} cell, {{he heard a}} distant boom, and knew that Holkar was besieging Delhi. The next day, to his satisfaction, the sound of cannonading was again distinct.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front seat, facing her. [...] "I'm glad I went," [...] he {{said with}} sudden vehemence. [...] "I loved {{watching}} you, moving about among all those people. I never knew before how beautiful you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say," [...] replied Little Joe, [...] "but if {{you really}} want to know, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> his big green lily-pad in the Smiling Pool fast asleep right in plain sight." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a chair, {{wishing that}} {{somebody}} would come along and take off his pads, when Psmith's card was brought to him. A few moments later the old Etonian appeared in person.|$|R
5000|$|For David Tennant, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing {{something}} that rhymes with Who (As in Doctor Who). E.g. - <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a snooker cue and says 'I'm doctor cue!', or appearing twice and saying 'I'm doctor two!'.|$|R
60|$|The Vicar had {{forgotten}} the book on Political Economy, {{had forgotten}} everything until the Angel had done. For a minute he sat quite still. Then he woke up with a start. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old iron-bound chest.|$|E
6000|$|Bjornstam was [...] "keeping company" [...] with Bea. Every night <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back steps. Once when Carol {{appeared}} he grumbled, [...] "Hope you're {{going to}} give this burg one good show. If you don't, reckon nobody ever will." ...|$|E
60|$|So each of {{them went}} his way. But the horse dealer had not got very far with Jack before he resumed his own form again, and when the man got home <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench by the stove.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> his throne, {{surrounded}} by {{the sons of the}} other emperors, who served him as pages. These youths came forward to greet their new companion, and wondered why they felt so attracted towards him.|$|R
60|$|The other played-out {{man they}} found a few minutes later, {{revealed}} by a streamer of aurora borealis that shot like a searchlight from horizon to zenith. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a piece of ice beside the trail.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a {{hillside}} {{looking at the}} distant spot where they first met, and, feeling the pain of separation, he decides that he will sing songs to convey the feelings from one loving heart to the other.|$|R
60|$|They {{came upon}} a man who {{appeared}} {{a little older than}} Nasmyth. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> veranda, which was spacious, and had one or two wooden pillars with crude scroll-work attached to them in front. Acton nodded to the stranger.|$|E
60|$|In dreams, {{a gentle}} voice came over his ear; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mossy {{seat in the}} garden by Lake Pontchartrain, and Eva, with her serious eyes bent downward, was reading {{to him from the}} Bible; and he heard her read.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little longer," [...] Kramer said. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{floor of}} the cabin, down by the control wiring. He had removed the metal covering-plate, exposing the {{complicated}} maze of relay wiring. He was studying it, comparing it to the wiring diagrams.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, papa." [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a {{sofa and}} shrank {{back a little}} from her as she made this free avowal. [...] "In that case I could have judged for myself. I suppose every girl {{would like to do}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, Rollo,” {{said his}} father, one evening, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> his cricket before a bright, glowing fire, {{late in the}} autumn, after all his fruits were {{gathered}} in, “you have really done some work this summer, haven’t you?” ...|$|R
50|$|Querrey's {{year was}} ended prematurely by a {{potentially}} career-threatening accident {{in which a}} glass table <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> collapsed, impaling his arm and requiring emergency surgery; the location of injury just missed causing nerve damage, which could have ended his tennis career.|$|R
