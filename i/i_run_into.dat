500|$|Malouma {{announced}} in April 2014 that {{she no longer}} felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> ministers or important personalities, I tell them what the people expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Frank Mir was a color {{commentator}} for World Extreme Cagefighting until WEC 47, when he {{was replaced}} by Stephan Bonnar. In June 2012, Mir stated {{in an interview with}} The Chronicle-Journal that he wants to pursue commentary after he retires from fighting.

60|$|About a {{week later}} <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> him between the acts at the Knickerbocker. The old boy was beaming.|$|R
5000|$|... c. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> an old friend. - into is a {{preposition}} that {{introduces the}} prepositional phrase {{into an old}} friend.|$|R
60|$|And {{the first}} chap <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> was young Tuppy. His brow was furrowed, {{and he was}} moodily bunging stones at a flowerpot.|$|R
6000|$|... "It didn't feel so. Where are you? If I get up shall <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> you? There! all right. Whiskey? Here. Where shall I {{give it to}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but {{why should}} <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the world? It is not evil, I know, so far as you and all your friends can manage; but it stirs up the evil in one's self." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Col. Zane, I'd {{been here}} days before, but <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> some Shawnees, {{and they gave}} me a hard chase. I have to report that Girty, with four hundred Injuns and two hundred Britishers, are on the way to Ft. Henry." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the marble}} {{vestibule}} of the Corn National Bank <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> Tallant, holding his brown straw hat {{in his hand}} and looking a little more moth-eaten than usual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane, your riders seem {{as many as}} the {{bunches of}} sage. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> five {{yesterday}} 'way down near the trail to Deception Pass. They were with the white herd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blink, I'm {{going to}} turn in. Call {{for me in the}} morning. I can't tell you how glad I am that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> you boys. And you, too, Brown. I'd like to see more of you." ...|$|R
60|$|Jul. I {{sent for}} him; yet if he comes, there's danger; Yet {{if he does}} not, I for ever lose him. What can I wish? and yet I wish him here, Only to take the care of me from me. Weary with sitting out a losing hand, Twill be some ease to see another play it. Yesterday I refused to marry him, To-day <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> his arms unasked; Like a mild prince encroached upon by rebels, Love yielded much, till honour asked for all. How now, where's Roderick? [Sees AMIDEO. I mean Gonsalvo. [Sees HIPPOLITO.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] thought I to myself, [...] "if {{the gate}} of that house is open I'll turn into it, {{and no matter what}} <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into,</b> it would be better than going over the edge of that rise beyond and down the awful hill that must be {{on the other side of}} it." [...] As I swooped down to the little house and reached the level ground I felt I was going a little slower, but not much. However, I steered my {{tricycle}} round at just the right instant, and through the front gate I went like a flash.|$|E
60|$|I {{had turned}} out of Pall Mall into a side street, when whom should I strike against but her false swain! It was my fault, but I hit out at him savagely, as I always do when <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> anyone in the street. Then I looked at him. He was hollow-eyed; he was muddy; {{there was not a}} haw left in him. I never saw a more abject young man; he had not even the spirit to resent the testy stab I had given him with my umbrella. But this is the {{important}} thing: he was glaring wistfully at the post-office and thus in a twink I saw that he still adored my little governess. Whatever had been their quarrel he was as anxious to make it up as she, and perhaps he had been here every Thursday while she was round the corner in Pall Mall, each watching the post-office for an apparition. But from where they hovered neither could see the other.|$|E
60|$|While {{the poor}} fellows were being {{bound to the}} stakes, Jacob and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the barracks, where we remained, trying to shut out from our ears the yells and whoops which told {{of what was going}} on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, while I was up at White Plains, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a cove who had a place of the sort and wanted to sell out. That was what made me think of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cover note: The {{photographs}} were all taken {{late at night}} in NYC. As we left Dan's photographer's place {{in search of a}} cab Graham Smith and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> some trouble from which, frankly, we were lucky to escape...".|$|R
6000|$|... "New York State," [...] said Shark Dodson, {{sitting down}} on a boulder and chewing a twig. [...] "I was born {{on a farm in}} Ulster County. I ran away from home when I was seventeen. It was an {{accident}} my coming West. I was walkin' along the road with my clothes in a bundle, makin' for New York City. I had an idea of goin' there and makin' lots of money. I always felt like I could do it. I came to a place one evenin' where the road forked and I didn't know which fork to take. I studied about it for half an hour, and then I took the left-hand. That night <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the camp of a Wild West show that was travellin' among the little towns, and I went West with it. I've often wondered if I wouldn't have turned out different if I'd took the other road." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't good at tellin' things," [...] began Lewis. [...] "I reckon I've {{seen some}} strange sights. I kin {{tell you about}} the only redskin I ever let off. Three years ago I was takin' a fall hunt over on the Big Sandy, and <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> a party of Shawnees. I plugged a chief and started to run. There was some good runners and I couldn't shake 'em in the open country. Comin' to the Ohio I jumped in and swum across, keepin' my rifle and powder dry by holdin' 'em up. I hid in some bulrushes and waited. Pretty soon along comes three Injuns, and when they saw where I had taken to the water they stopped and held a short pow-wow. Then they all took to the water. This was what I was waitin' for. When they got nearly acrosst I shot the first redskin, and loadin' quick got a bullet into the others. The last Injun did not sink. I watched him go floatin' down stream expectin' every minute to see him go under as he was hurt so bad he could hardly keep his head above water. He floated down a long ways and the current carried him to a pile of {{driftwood}} which had lodged against a little island. I saw the Injun crawl up on the drift. I went down stream and by keepin' the island between me and him I got out to where he was. I pulled my tomahawk and went around the head of the island and found the redskin leanin' against a big log. He was a young brave and a fine lookin strong feller. He was tryin' to stop the blood from my bullet-hole in his side. When he saw me he tried to get up, but he was too weak. He smiled, pointed to the wound and said: 'Deathwind not heap times bad shot.' Then he bowed his head and waited for the tomahawk. Well, I picked him up and carried him ashore and made a shack by a spring. I staid there with him. When he got well enough to stand a few days' travel I got him across the river and givin' him a hunk of deer meat I told him to go, and if I ever saw him again I'd make a better shot.|$|E
5000|$|... "My brain {{tends to}} work {{along the lines}} of science fiction tropes. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> an odd little bit of trivia, some obscure {{historical}} fact or odd scientific principle, I can't help but start thinking of ways I could use it in a story." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I heard a {{voice calling}} me, and pushing past Mrs. Cowan, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the cabin. Polly Ann lay on the log bedstead, and she turned to mine a face radiant with a {{happiness}} I had not imagined.|$|R
6000|$|... “‘Then <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> {{the fort}} and found there a Spanish officer and four men alive, while seven lay dead in one room. The whole floor ran with blood. Blood splashed all the walls. It {{was a perfect}} hog-pen of butchery.|$|R
60|$|At the Drones <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> Pongo Twistleton, and {{he talked}} so much about his {{forthcoming}} merry-making of his, of which good reports had already reached me through my correspondents, that it was nearing eleven when I got home again.|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps his proudest {{achievement}} as {{an educator}} was leaving his mark on 34 doctoral students, 47 master's degree students and, especially, the numerous undergraduates who enjoyed his classes. In a February 2004 interview he said, [...] "I taught 'General Astronomy' for 17 years, {{and it was my}} favorite course. I spent one or two hours preparing for each lecture because I had a genuine enthusiasm for the course. Today, <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> people all the time who say, 'You don't remember me, but I took your course in 1985.' Many former students tell me how much they enjoyed the course." ...|$|E
5000|$|David Stones {{was born}} in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York. An area {{known as one of the}} roughest neighborhoods in not only the borough of Brooklyn but also the entire state of New York. Rapping was a hobby he picked up from {{watching}} his cousin Kenyatta Blake, better known as Buckshot from the critically acclaimed 90's rap group Black Moon. When asked about his cousins influence over his career in an interview David replied, [...] "I use him as a mentor, so when <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> some type of jam in the game I can always hit him up and ask, 'what do you think about this?'".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the cabin, Jones following. Here all was confusion, as if {{the inmates}} {{had been forced to}} leave in a great hurry. The captain of the Spitfire had left nothing undone to make the loss of the {{schooner}} appear purely accidental.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> Strickland's {{room and}} asked him whether he was ill, and had been calling for me. He was lying on his bed half dressed, a pipe in his mouth. 'I thought you'd come,' he said. 'Have I been walking round the house recently?' ...|$|R
60|$|Well, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> my {{own room}} {{as quick as}} quick could be, and set my front hair straight, and slipped on a hat and jacket (for I was in my morning dress), and then {{went down to the}} drawing-room to see the Inspector.|$|R
5000|$|One day I {{was out in}} {{the barn}} doctorin' my horses when I heard a gunshot in the house. When I heerd that gun go off I knowed it wasn't no play-party, because we argued with guns in them days. <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the house and there was Bob Ford, {{standing}} over Bigelow with a gun in his hand and blood on the floor. I said to Ford, 'Looks like you killed him, Bob,' and Bob says, 'Looks like I did, Jesse.' Then I says, 'This is my chance, Bob. You tell 'em its me you killed. You tell my mother to say so, and you take care of that Bigelow woman. I'm long gone.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 2010 Jim Lynch {{reviewed}} Lubuntu 10.04, saying, [...] "One thing you’ll notice {{about using}} the Lubuntu desktop is that it’s fast. Very, very fast. Even on an underpowered machine, Lubuntu should perform very well. It’s {{one of the best}} things about this distro; it leaves behind the bloated eye candy that can sometimes bog down GNOME and KDE... I didn’t run into any noticeable problems with Lubuntu. It was very fast and stable, and I didn’t see noticeable bugs or problems. I hate it when this happens since it’s so much more interesting for my readers when <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> one nasty problem or another. Hopefully the next version of Lubuntu will be chock full of horrendous problems and bugs. Just kidding." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Walker {{auditioned for}} the seventh season of Australian Idol, singing John Legend's [...] "Ordinary People" [...] at his Brisbane audition. He {{received}} praise from the judges and progressed through to the theatre rounds receiving more recognition from the judges, with Kyle Sandilands saying, [...] "You're the only person after the auditions that I ever told anyone about; family, friends other people that <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into.</b> I only told them about you." [...] After all three theatre rounds were over, {{it was announced that}} Walker had made it into the top twenty four semi-finals. Walker {{was a part of the}} first group to perform in the semi-finals. The following evening, it was announced that the first two contestants to be put through to the final top twelve according to viewer votes, were Walker and fellow contestant Kate Cook.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dare, it's {{better for}} him--and Mel too," [...] said Blair, {{with a hand}} going to his friend's shoulder.

60|$|To {{think was}} to act. No sooner had the {{policeman}} {{jumped into the}} doorway than I dodged {{through the crowd and}} hurried across the street.
