50|$|PERFACT Procedure {{is another}} latest {{addition}} to the armamentarium to treat complex and highly complex fistula-in-ano. Invented by Dr Pankaj Garg, it is a minimally cutting procedure as both the anal sphincters (internal and external sphincters) are not cut/damaged at all. Therefore, the risk of incontinence is minimal. PERFACT procedure (proximal superficial cauterization, emptying regularly fistula tracts and curettage of tracts) entails two steps: superficial cauterization of mucosa at and around the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> and keeping all the tracts clean. The principle is to permanently close the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> by granulation tissue. This is achieved by superficial electrocauterization at and around the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> and subsequently allowing the wound to heal by secondary intention. Early results of this procedure are quite encouraging for complex fistula-in-ano (86.4% in highly complex anal fistulae). The procedure is effective even in fistula associated with abscess, supralevator fistula-in-ano and fistula where the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> is non-localizable.|$|R

40|$|Backgroung : Anorectal fistula {{represents}} an epithelized communication path of infectious origin between the rectum or anal canal and the perianal region. The association of endoscopic surgery with the minimally invasive approach {{led to the}} development of the video-assisted anal fistula treatment. Aim : To describe the technique and initial experience with the technique video-assisted for anal fistula treatment. Technique : A Karl Storz video equipment was used. Main steps included the visualization of the fistula tract using the fistuloscope, the correct localization of the <b>internal</b> fistula <b>opening</b> under direct vision, endoscopic treatment of the fistula and closure of the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> which can be accomplished through firing a stapler, cutaneous-mucosal flap, or direct closure using suture. Results : The mean distance between the anal verge and the external anal orifice was 5. 5 cm. Mean operative time was 31. 75 min. In all cases, the <b>internal</b> fistula <b>opening</b> could be identified after complete fistuloscopy. In all cases, <b>internal</b> fistula <b>opening</b> was closed using full-thickness suture. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. After a 5 -month follow-up, recurrence was observed in one (12. 5 %) patient.

40|$|Background Video-assisted anal fistula {{treatment}} (VA-AFT) {{is a novel}} {{minimally invasive}} and sphincter-saving technique for treating complex fistulas. The aim of this report is to describe the procedural steps and preliminary results of VAAFT. Methods Karl Storz Video Equipment is used. Key steps are visualization of the fistula tract using the fistuloscope, correct localization of the <b>internal</b> fistula <b>opening</b> under direct vision, endoscopic treatment of the fistula and closure of the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> using a stapler or cutaneousmucosal flap. Diagnostic fistuloscopy under irrigation is followed by an operative phase of fulguration of the fistula tract, closure of the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> and suture reinforcement with cyanoacrylate. Results From May 2006 to May 2011, we operated on 136 patients using VAAFT. Ninety-eight patients were followed up {{for a minimum of}} 6 months. No major complications occurred. In most cases, both short-term and long-term postoperative pain was acceptable. Primary healing was achieved in 72 patients (73. 5 %) within 2 – 3 months of the operation. Sixty-two patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The percentage of the patients healed after 1 year was 87. 1 %. Conclusions The main feature of the VAAFT technique is that the procedure is performed entirely under direct endoluminal vision. With this approach, the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> can be found in 82. 6 % of cases. Moreover, fistuloscopy helps to identify any possible secondary tracts o...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{surgical}} treatment of fistula-in-ano is {{to eradicate the}} suppurative process permanently without compromising faecal continence.

We evaluated the clinical course of 214 patients in a randomised. controlled trial with respect to the recurrence rate of anal fistula with or without preoperative endoanal ultrasonography.

40|$|Background: On {{an average}} 30 - 50 % of {{patients}} who undergo incision and drainage (I and D) of anal abscess will develop recurrence or fistula formation. It is claimed that finding the internal orifice of anal abscess to distract the corresponding anal gland duct; will decline the rate of future anal fistula. Surgeons supporting I and D alone claim that finding the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> is hazardous. This study is conducted to assess short-term results of optional method to manage patients with anal abscess and fitula-in-ano at the same time. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study 49 from 77 patients with anal abscess whose internal orifice was not identified by pressing on the abscess, diluted hydrogen peroxide (2 %) and methylene blue was injected into the abscess cavity and the anal canal was inspected {{to find out the}} <b>internal</b> <b>opening.</b> Once the opening was distinguished, an incision was given from the anal verge to the <b>internal</b> <b>opening.</b> Results: The <b>internal</b> orifice was identified in 44 out of 49 patients (90 %) who underwent this new technique. Up to 18 months during follow-up, only 2. 5 % of patients with primary fistulotomy developed fistula on the site of a previous abscess. Conclusion: Conventional method to seek the internal orifice of anal abscesses is successful in about one-third of cases. By applying this new technique, surgeons would properly find the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> in > 90 % of patients. Needless to say, safe identification of the anal gland orifice in anal abscess disease best helps surgeons to do primary fistulotomy and in turn it would significantly decrease the rate of recurrence in anal abscess and fistula formation...|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of endoanal ultrasound with hydrogen peroxide enhancement in the assessment of anal fistula (tract and <b>internal</b> <b>opening),</b> and to value the utility of this examination for anal or perianal suppuration when performed by a colorectal surgeon trained in this technique. Patients: endoanal ultrasound was performed in 103 patients with anal or perianal suppuration. Twenty patients were excluded: 9 had the external opening closed, and 11 had cryptoglandular abscesses. All ultrasound scans were performed by the same explorer using a B&K Diagnostic Ultrasound System with a 7 MHz endoprobe. The examination was based on the identification of the three anal planes, then hydrogen peroxide was infused and the procedure was repeated. Results: out of 83 patients included, 11 had a perianal sinus and 72 an anal fistula. In all fistulas the main tract was found: 24 were inter-sphinteric (33. 33 %), 33 trans-sphincteric (45. 83 %), 3 supra-sphincteric (4. 17 %), and 12 extra-sphincteric (16. 67 %).

40|$|Background and Objectives: Fistula in ano is {{a common}} disease seen in the {{surgical}} outpatient department. Many procedures are advocated {{for the treatment of}} fistula in ano. However, none of the procedures is considered the gold standard. The latest addition to the list of treatment options is video-assisted anal fistula treatment (VAAFT). It is a minimally invasive, sphincter-saving procedure with low morbidity. The aim of our study was to compare the results with a premier study done previously. Methods: The procedure involves diagnostic fistuloscopy and visualization of the <b>internal</b> <b>opening,</b> followed by fulguration of the fistulous tract and closure of the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> with a stapling device or suture ligation. The video equipment (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was connected to an illuminating source. Results: The study was conducted from July 2010 to March 2014. Eighty-two patients with fistula in ano were operated on with VAAFT and were followed up according to the study protocol. The recurrence rate was 15. 85 %, with recurrences developing in 13 cases. Postoperative pain and discomfort were minimal. Conclusion: VAAFT is a minimally invasive procedure performed under direct visualization. It enables visualiza-tion of the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> and secondary branches or abscess cavities. It is a sphincter-saving procedure and offers many advantages to patients.

30|$|The {{location}} of external openings {{is of little}} importance, since both {{the patient and the}} surgeon can find it often easily themselves. Goodsall’s rule states that the external opening of a fistula situated behind the transverse anal line will open into the anal canal in the midline posteriorly. An anterior opening is usually associated with a radial tract, however. The exception to the rule is anterior fistulas lying more than 3  cm from the anus, which may have a curved track (similar to posterior fistulas) [27]. This rule is, however, not without many exceptions [28]. The <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> will decide the extent of sphincter division during fistulotomy. Since the dentate line cannot be identified on MRI, its position must be inferred as the middle of the anal canal. If no <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> can be detected, then a sinus should be diagnosed instead of a fistula.|$|R

Only patients with low perianal fistulae that were surgically treated by fistulotomy were included. Surgical biopsies were taken from the fistula tract from three different locations; on the proximal side at the <b>internal</b> <b>opening,</b> in the middle of the fistula tract and near the distal end close to the external opening. In the study period, 18 patients with low perianal fistulae were included. In 15 of the 18 patients, squamous epithelium was found at least in one of the biopsies taken from the fistula tract. Epithelium was predominantly found near the <b>internal</b> <b>opening.</b> There was no relation between the duration of fistula complaints and the amount of epithelialization (P = 0. 301). The amount of epithelium was not related to the presence of a history of fistula surgery (P = 1. 000). This study demonstrated epithelialization in the fistula tract in the majority of the patients surgically treated by fistulotomy for low perianal fistulae. Curettage of perianal fistulae must therefore be considered an essential step in the surgical treatment of perianal fistul...|$|R

50|$|In 1993 Matos et al. {{described}} a technique of total anal sphincter preservation in high fistula in ano, {{which is based}} on the concept of excision of intersphincteric anal gland infection through the intersphincteric approach. This novel technique was also documented in Corman’s textbook of colon and rectal surgery. However, the technique was not widely adopted.Between 2004 and 2005 there was a personal experience in the similar technique by group of surgeons. That technique included coring out the intersphinteric fistula tract from the external opening to the external sphincter, excision of the intersphincteric fistula tract and suture of the internal sphincter defect through the intersphincteric plane. The outcome in 20 patients was disappointing with only 9 (45%) successes. Surgeons proposed that the reasons for the unfavorable outcome include dissection in the intersphincteric plane damaging blood supply to the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> area, and suturing delicate ischemic areas with increased risk of suture break-down. Surgeons thought that ligation of the intersphincteric tract close to the <b>internal</b> <b>opening</b> might solve the problem.
