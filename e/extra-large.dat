The new products are King Krinkz, which are seasoned crinkle-cut fries; King Kolossalz, an <b>extra-large</b> package of fries; and King Wedgez, seasoned potato wedges. The products were slated to be released in September 2009. The packaging is designed to resemble BK's FryPod fry container.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the <b>extra-large</b> paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{objections}} to the proposed change have been answered by its opponents. For example, Dr. Felicitas Arias, who, as Director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)'s Time, Frequency, and Gravimetry Department, is responsible for generating UTC, noted in a press release that the drift of about one minute every 60–90 years could {{be compared to the}} 16-minute annual variation between true solar time and mean solar time, the one hour offset by use of daylight time, and the several-hours offset in certain geographically <b>extra-large</b> time zones.|$|E
25|$|Ships in Eve Online come in four size classes. Small starships include frigates (small, mobile ships {{good for}} {{disruption}} and harassment) and destroyers (slightly {{larger and more}} offensively oriented than frigates). Medium starships include cruisers (multipurpose ships with many possible roles) and battlecruisers (heavier, more combat-oriented cruisers). Battleships (heavily armed and armoured dedicated combat ships) make up the large size class. <b>Extra-large</b> (or capital-class) starships include carriers (mobile bases that can launch fighters and are adept at repairing other ships), dreadnoughts (dedicated siege ships for attacking structures and other capitals), supercarriers (larger versions of carriers focused more on damage to capital class ships) and titans (supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to other capital ships).|$|E
25|$|Though it did {{represent}} {{a complex and}} gradual change in the shopping and self-presentation habits of both men and women, the idea of metrosexuality was often distilled in the media down to a few men and a short checklist of vanities, like skin care products, scented candles and costly, colorful dress shirts and pricey designer jeans. It was this image of the metrosexual—that of a straight young man who got pedicures and facials, practiced aromatherapy and spent freely on clothes—that contributed to a backlash against the term from men who merely wanted to feel free to take more care with their appearance than had been the norm in the 1990s, when companies abandoned dress codes, Dockers khakis became a popular brand, and XL, or <b>extra-large,</b> became the one size that fit all.|$|E
25|$|In 751, An again visited Chang'an. On An's {{birthday}} on 20 February, 751, Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Yang rewarded {{him with}} clothing, treasures, and food. On 23 February, when An {{was summoned to}} the palace, Consort Yang, in order to please Emperor Xuanzong, had an <b>extra-large</b> infant wrapping made, and wrapped the obese An in it, causing much laughter among the ladies in waiting and eunuchs. When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang's attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days before and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong was amused by the comic situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed free admittance to the palace, and there were rumors that he and Consort Yang had an affair, but Emperor Xuanzong discounted the rumors.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, 2010, it was {{revealed}} that former Sheriff Mike Carona received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction. A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits. It was noted that the county's retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7 billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 in benefits in 2009. Also on the list of those receiving <b>extra-large</b> pension checks is former treasurer-tax collector Robert Citron, whose investments, which were made while consulting psychics and astrologers, led Orange County into bankruptcy in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{monolithic}} columns {{were used}} by Roman builders who preferred them over the stacked drums typical of classical Greek architecture. The logistics and technology involved in the transport and erection of <b>extra-large</b> single-piece columns were demanding: As a rule of thumb, {{the weight of the}} column shafts in the length range between 40 and 60 Roman feet (c. 11.8 to 17.8m) doubled with every ten feet from c. 50 over 100 to 200t. Despite this, forty and also fifty feet tall monolithic shafts {{can be found in a}} number of Roman buildings, but examples reaching sixty feet are only in evidence in two unfinished granite columns which still lie in the Roman quarry of Mons Claudianus, Egypt. One of the pair, which was discovered only in the 1930s, has an estimated weight of 207t. All these dimensions, however, are surpassed by Pompey's Pillar, a free-standing victory column erected in Alexandria in 297AD: measuring 20.46m high with a diameter of 2.71m at its base, the weight of its granite shaft has been put at 285t.|$|E
25|$|The semi-democratic {{confederation}} or Kedatuan was integrated to the Spanish Empire through pacts and treaties (c. 1569) by Miguel López de Legazpi and {{his grandson}} Juan de Salcedo. During {{the time of}} their hispanization, the principalities of the Confederation were already developed settlements with distinct social structure, culture, customs, and religion. Among the archaeological proofs of the existence of this Hiligaynon nation are the artifacts found in pre-Hispanic tombs from many parts of the island, which are now in display at Iloilo Museum. There are also recent discoveries of burial artifacts of eight-foot inhabitants of Isla de Gigantes, including <b>extra-large</b> Lungon (wooden coffins) and pre-Hispanic potteries. Another testimony of the antiquity of this civilization is the longest and oldest epic in the region, the Hinilawod, which must have been commonly known to the Visayans of Panay before the conquest, since its main protagonists, like Labaw Donggon, were noted in the accounts of the Islanders' beliefs by early Spanish colonizers. One of these Westerners' accounts says that the tales regarding adventures of this ancient hero of Panay were being retold during wedding celebrations in form of songs.|$|E
500|$|The Start screen {{received}} several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including an extended [...] "All Apps" [...] view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new down arrow button or swiping upward), small and <b>extra-large</b> sizes for tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional customization options were also added, such as expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of which incorporate animated elements), {{and the ability}} for the Start screen to use the desktop background instead. Applications are no longer added to the Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The app snapping system has also been extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and {{can also be used}} on any display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate the presence of a pop-up menu accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or right-clicking.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{construction}} {{for the new}} airfield {{began in}} late June 1942 with construction proceeding throughout the summer. [...] It included {{more than one hundred}} buildings, all intended to be temporary. Station buildings and streets were also constructed, the buildings consisting primarily of wood, tar paper, and non-masonry siding. The use of concrete and steel was limited because of the critical need elsewhere. Most buildings were hot and dusty in the summer and very cold in the winter. [...] Water, sewer and electrical services were also constructed. [...] The airfield consisted of runways in a [...] "star" [...] layout consisting of four 5,500 x 150' runways laid out in a north/south, northeast/southwest, east/west and a northwest/southeast direction. [...] An <b>extra-large</b> parking ramp was constructed to accommodate large numbers of training aircraft, several hangars, a control tower and other auxiliary support aircraft buildings.|$|E

Similarly, the Philadelphia Business Journal awarded Comcast the silver medal among <b>extra-large</b> companies in Philadelphia, with the gold medal going to partner organization, Comcast-Spectacor. The Boston Globe found Comcast to be that city's top place to work in 2009. Employee diversity is also an attribute upon which Comcast receives strong marks.

2500|$|In 1987, Tufts University {{students}} Davin Wedel and Adam Glickman started Global Protection Corp. {{in response}} to C. Everett Koop's statement that [...] "a condoms can save your life." [...] Since that time, Global Protection Corp. has become known for its innovative approach to condom marketing and its support of more than 3500 non-profit organizations worldwide. The company has numerous patents and trademarks to its name, including the only FDA-approved glow-in-the-dark condom, the Pleasure Plus condom and the original condom keychain. In 2005 the company introduced its newest product, One Condoms. One represents a complete reinvention of retail condom brands, combining sleek metal packaging, innovative condom wrappers and innovative marketing programs. One is also the first condom brand to donate 5% of sales {{to the development of}} sexual health outreach and educational programs. In South Africa, some manufacturers have considered introducing an <b>extra-large</b> variety of condoms after several complaints from South African men claiming the condoms were too small and causing discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|In 1736 Handel {{produced}} Alexander's Feast. John Beard appeared for {{the first}} time as one of Handel's principal singers and became Handel's permanent tenor soloist for the rest of Handel's life. The piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works. In Saul, Handel was collaborating with Charles Jennens and experimenting with three trombones, a carillon and <b>extra-large</b> military kettledrums (from the Tower of London), to be sure [...] "...it will be most excessive noisy". Saul and Israel in Egypt both from 1739 head the list of great, mature oratorios, in which the da capo aria became the exception and not the rule. Israel in Egypt consists of little else but choruses, borrowing from the Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline. In his next works Handel changed his course. In these works he laid greater stress on the effects of orchestra and soloists; the chorus retired into the background. L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato has a rather diverting character; the work is light and fresh.|$|E
2500|$|The Century was {{redesigned}} for {{the last}} time in 1997. The four-door sedan was the only body style offered (the station wagon was dropped due to decreasing sales), and was still a front wheel drive V6-powered configuration. Plainer [...] "Custom" [...] and fancier [...] "Limited" [...] trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. The 1997 redesign moved Centurys to the W-body platform, rejoining its former Regal sibling. In this generation, the Century and Regal were nearly the same car, distinguished only by seating configurations, trim, and engine differences. Since the Century was lower-priced than the Regal, it was also the lower-powered and plainer of the two, offering only a 3.1L V6. In keeping with its traditional image, the 6-passenger Century came equipped with a front bench seat and column shifter, while the more performance-oriented 5-passenger Regal came standard with front bucket seats and console shifter. After the 1998 discontinuation of the Skylark, the Century for the first time became Buick's entry-level car. Buick tried to position the Century as a lower-priced alternative to Japanese family sedans like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. However, it failed to compete with them and was instead widely viewed as a car designed for a geriatric target audience, an image not helped by the Century's assortment of senior citizen-friendly features like <b>extra-large</b> dashboard buttons and an extremely soft suspension. For 2003, all trim levels were eliminated, leaving one standard model. Additionally, the [...] "Century" [...] nameplate on the front doors was dropped, and only seen on the vehicle's taillights.|$|E
2500|$|How early {{decision}} affects financial aid. There are {{conflicting reports}} about how early decision affects aid offers. The more widely held {{view is that}} a student's bargaining position is weaker because the student cannot compare offers from different colleges. Since the applicant is declaring an intention to attend if accepted, then the school can [...] "pinpoint the smallest amount of financial aid it will take {{for the student to}} attend." [...] There have been reports of problems with early Decision aid offers falling below levels that had been expected prior to applying. A report in the Chicago Tribune suggested that applying early decision could cost [...] "thousands more than necessary." [...] A report in US News pointed to a research study concluding that regular decision applicants get more financial aid than early ones. Lynn O'Shaughnessy described early decision as [...] "essentially applying blind" [...] because a student has agreed to attend before seeing the financial aid package; and this practice [...] "favors rich students." [...] Several reports confirm that early decision applicants tend to come from wealthier families. However, a contrasting view is that students who apply early have an advantage getting aid because they are applying earlier in the year when that aid is being doled out, and the early decision kids have [...] "first crack at the money," [...] particularly at competitive schools without <b>extra-large</b> endowments. Two reports suggested that while a student's bargaining position is somewhat weaker, it is not totally diminished, and that if a college thinks an early decision admittee may withdraw because of financial concerns, the college [...] "may pull out all the stops" [...] to prevent this, and that the possibility of backing out for financial reasons gives an applicant some form of negotiating leverage. Ivy League universities and other universities with large endowments may be somewhat different, in the sense that all aid offers are likely to be based solely on financial need, and that whether an applicant applied by early or regular methods would have no impact on the resulting financial aid package, according to one report.|$|E
