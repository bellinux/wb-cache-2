25|$|The taxonomical {{classification}} of the <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> has been problematic. In 1991, after a major {{revision of the}} species and taxonomic characters, the herpetologists Pedro Ruiz-Carranza and John D. Lynch published {{a proposal for a}} taxonomic {{classification of}} the Centrolenidae based on cladistic principles and defining monophyletic groups. That paper was {{the first of a series}} of contributions dealing with the <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> from Colombia that led them to describe almost 50 species of <b>glass</b> <b>frogs.</b> The genus Centrolene was proposed to include the species with a humeral spine in adult males, and the genus Hyalinobatrachium to include the species with a bulbous liver. However, they left a heterogeneous group of species in the genus Cochranella, defined just by lacking a humeral spine and a bulbous liver. Since the publication of the extensive revision of the Colombian <b>glass</b> <b>frogs,</b> several other publications have dealt with the <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> from Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to some green frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus and to some tree frogs of the family Hylidae. However, hylid tree frogs have eyes that face to the side, whilst those of <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> face forward. Some species of green tree frogs (especially juveniles), such as Hyloscirtus palmeri and Hypsiboas pellucens, have the transparent abdominal skin typical of <b>glass</b> <b>frogs,</b> {{but they also have}} calcars on the heels, a character not present in any species of the Centrolenidae.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> are frogs of the {{amphibian}} family Centrolenidae (order Anura). While {{the general}} background coloration of most <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> is primarily lime green, the abdominal skin of {{some members of}} this family is transparent. The internal viscera, including the heart, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, are visible through the skin, hence the common name is given as glass frog.|$|E
50|$|The {{powdered}} <b>glass</b> <b>frog</b> or Chiriqui <b>glass</b> <b>frog,</b> Teratohyla pulverata, is a frog {{species in}} the <b>glass</b> <b>frog</b> family (Centrolenidae). It is found from north-central Honduras south to northwestern Ecuador.|$|R
50|$|Hyalinobatrachium dianae, {{also known}} as Diane's bare-hearted <b>glass</b> <b>frog,</b> (or a Kermit frog due to its {{peculiar}} appearance) is a species of Costa Rican <b>glass</b> <b>frog</b> in the family Centrolenidae.|$|R
50|$|Vitreorana helenae is {{a species}} of frog in the Centrolenidae family. Two common names are {{sometimes}} {{used to refer to}} this species: Venezuelan <b>glass</b> <b>frog</b> and Helena's <b>glass</b> <b>frog.</b> In Spanish, it is locally known as ranita de cristal de Helena.|$|R
25|$|The family Centrolenidae was {{proposed}} by Edward H. Taylor in 1945. Between the 1950s and 1970s, most species of <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> were known from Central America, particularly from Costa Rica and Panama, where Taylor and Jay M. Savage extensively worked, {{and just a}} few species were known to occur in South America. In 1973, John D. Lynch and William E. Duellman published a large revision of the <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> from Ecuador, showing the species richness of Centrolenidae was particularly concentrated in the Andes. Later contributions by authors such as Juan Rivero, Savage, William Duellman, John D. Lynch, Pedro Ruiz-Carranza, and José Ayarzagüena increased the number of described taxa, especially from Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are mostly}} arboreal. They live along {{rivers and streams}} during the {{breeding}} season, and are particularly diverse in montane cloud forests of Central and South America, although some species occur also in Amazon and Chocóan rainforest and semideciduous forests.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} relationships, biogeography, {{and character}} evolution of centrolenids were discussed by Guayasamin et al. (2008) <b>Glass</b> <b>frogs</b> originated in South America and dispersed multiple times into Central America. Character evolution {{seems to be}} complex, with multiple gains and/or losses of humeral spines, reduced hand webbing, and complete ventral transparency.|$|E

50|$|Hyalinobatrachium orientale is {{a species}} of <b>glass</b> <b>frog</b> in the family Centrolenidae. It is found {{on the island of}} Tobago and in eastern Venezuela (Paria Peninsula and Sierra de Lema). Its common name is eastern <b>glass</b> <b>frog</b> (in Spanish ranita de cristal oriental). The Tobagonian {{population}} has been described as subspecies Centrolenella orientalis tobagoensis Hardy, 1984, although this has been rejected.|$|R
25|$|The {{eggs are}} usually {{deposited}} on {{the leaves of}} trees or shrubs hanging over the running water of mountain streams, creeks, and small rivers. One species leaves its eggs over stones close to waterfalls. The method of egg-laying on the leaf varies between species. The males usually call from leaves close to their egg clutches. These eggs are less vulnerable to predators than those laid within water, but {{are affected by the}} parasitic maggots of some fly species. As a result, some <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> show parental care. In many species, glass frog females brood their eggs during the night the eggs are fertilized, which improves the survival of the eggs, while in almost a third of species, glass frog males stay on guard for much longer periods.After they hatch, the tadpoles fall into the waters below. The tadpoles are elongated, with powerful tails and low fins, suited for fast-flowing water. Outside of the breeding season, some species live in the canopy.|$|E
500|$|Tree frogs live {{high in the}} canopy, {{where they}} {{scramble}} around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The [...] "true" [...] tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae, but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of convergent evolution. These include the <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> (Centrolenidae), the bush frogs (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae), and the shrub frogs (Rhacophoridae). Most tree frogs are under [...] in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis {{on the surface and}} also surface tension and viscosity. Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed. Some members of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet. The reticulated leaf frog (Phyllomedusa ayeaye) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.|$|E

50|$|Bare-hearted <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are similar}} in {{features}} to most <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> but have their own distinct characteristics. Like most <b>glass</b> <b>frogs,</b> they are small and green with yellow spots, and transparent undersides. The transparent undersides are the main feature of most <b>glass</b> <b>frogs,</b> but the bare-hearted glass frog has the clearest underside, allowing almost full visibility of their internal organs. Their transparent skin also makes them difficult to see, {{as well as their}} size. They are very small, with male frogs being 22-27 mm long and females 24.5-29 mm long. Other distinct characteristics of bare-hearted <b>glass</b> <b>frogs</b> are their forward-facing golden eyes and nostrils raised from their heads. They spend time moving throughout the forests and streams, their front fingers being less webbed and more isolated, while their back feet are heavily webbed, allow them mobility in trees and in water.|$|E
