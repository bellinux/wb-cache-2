[...] Provided that pairs of events have a purely causal relationship, that is edges represent causal relations between the events, {{we will have a}} directed acyclic graph. For instance, a Bayesian network represents a system of probabilistic events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph, in which the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the likelihoods of its predecessors in the DAG. In this context, the moral graph of a DAG is the undirected graph created by adding an (undirected) edge between all parents of the same vertex (sometimes called marrying), and then replacing all directed edges by undirected edges. Another type of graph with a similar causal structure is an <b>influence</b> <b>diagram,</b> the vertices of which represent either decisions to be made or unknown information, and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another. In epidemiology, for instance, these diagrams are often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention.|$|E

The rough sets theory was first introduced by Pawlak as a tool dealing with uncertainty and vagueness in decision-making. The probabilistic approaches have been applied to the rough set theory.

It can not only contain {{the information about the}} connection between all risk causes during the risk event happening process, but also can support the operational risk measurement by <b>influence</b> <b>diagrams</b> approach. In the operational risk topological data model, a risk loss event is attributed to risk trigger cause which lead to the initial loss and successor causes which increase (sometimes maybe decrease) the initial loss.
