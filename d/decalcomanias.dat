Especially, the <b>decalcomania</b> method was the most suitable manufacturing method for the segmented type SOFC. The cathode, prevent diffusion layer (PDL), anode functional layer (AFL) and electrolyte were manufactured using <b>decalcomania</b> method on porous anode support. The sintered electrolyte at 1450 o C for 2 h using <b>decalcomania</b> method was very dense, and the thickness was about 10 µm. The cathode, the PDL and the AFL were manufactured using <b>decalcomania</b> method and was sintered at 1250 o C for 2 h, and the sintered electrodes were the porous. As a result, with humidified hydrogen used as fuel, the cell with an 15 µm-thick AFL exhibited maximum power densities of 0. 246, 0. 364, 0. 504 W/cm...|$|R

5000|$|It {{was invented}} in England about 1750 and {{imported}} into the United States at least as early as 1865. Its invention {{has been attributed to}} Simon François Ravenet, an engraver from France who later moved to England and perfected the process, which he called [...] "décalquer" [...] (derived from French papier de calque, [...] "tracing paper"). The first known use of the French term décalcomanie, in Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Eleanor's Victory (1863), was followed by the English <b>decalcomania</b> in an 1865 trade show catalog (The Tenth Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association); it was popularized during the ceramic transfer craze of the mid-1870s. By c 1875 <b>decalcomania</b> designs printed in colored glazes were being applied to porcelain, an extension of transfer-printing, which had been developed in England since the late 18th century. The <b>decalcomania</b> was applied over an already-glazed surface and re-fired. The process began to be mechanized from the turn of the 20th century.|$|R

40|$|Author abstract]Heavy {{metals and}} arsenic {{sometimes}} {{have been found}} by extraction with diluted acetic acid from ceramic and porcelain table wares. In the present investigation, these harmful substances extracted from 69 kinds of the <b>decalcomania</b> papers and several kinds of the glazes were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry and examined on causal connection between the major colors of these papers and glazes, and the extracted metals. The results were as follows: 1. Lead amount extracted from the <b>decalcomania</b> paper by 4 % acetic acid at 25 ℃ for 24 hours was 90. 2 % of the amount, extracted by the acid at 100 °C for an hour. Both data seems to serve for a purpose of quality control of lead in the paper. 2. The enamel colors of the <b>decalcomania</b> papers contained lead in amount 1. 2 to 21. 0 %. Lead amount extracted by 10 % acetic acid from the enamel colors was 2. 3 times the amount extracted by 4 % acetic acid. 3. The contents of copper, zinc, and arsenic extracted by 4 % acid from the enamel colors were 0. 0007 to 0. 116 %, 0. 05 to 1. 60 % and 0. 03 to 7. 0 mg% of the samples respectively. 4. The major colors of these papers from which the extracted amounts of heavy metals and arsenic were more than certain level listed in the following. Lead, more than 15 %: green, blue, white red or reddish orange. Cadmium, more than 2 %: white or blue. Zinc, more than 1 %: green or reddish-dark yellowish red. Arsenic, more than 0. 005 %: green or weak yellow. Copper, more than 0. 1 %: black or dark yellowish red. The colors of the glazes which the extracted lead were more than 37 % were dark blue and blue. 5. In addition, {{the names of the}} <b>decalcomania</b> papers contained more than certain level of heavy metals and arsenic were described.

40|$|Abstract: As {{one of the}} {{recurrent}} {{themes in}} the literature of {{the last half of the}} 20 th century, moral decadence is skilfully interwoven in the various levels of McEwan’s Amsterdam (1998). Having an eye on Deleuze and Guattari’s taxonomy of four major types of multiplications based on the actual root types in botany discussed in their book One Thousand Plateau, this study attempts to show that the dissemination of the moral turpitude in Amsterdam follows a particular mode of multiplication. Instead of the patterns of pivotal taproot, dichotomous root or fascicular root, moral decadence in this novel spreads wildly in that of rhizomatic root and devastates various “plateaus ” of British society on the verge of the third millennium. To substantiate this claim, the six principles of the rhizomatic expansion (i. e. connection, heterogeneity, multiplicity, a signifying rupture, cartography and <b>decalcomania)</b> are examined vis-à-vis Amsterdam: an investigation that lays bare an aspect of McEwan’s postmodern psyche which, according to Deleuze and Guattari, is rhizomatic...|$|R
