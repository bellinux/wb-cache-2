5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her {{there was nothing to be}} done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ariel Sabar {{published}} an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; she had even published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues - Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house - or a desire to make The Da Vinci Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The Da Vinci Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz denied that he or anyone else forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he never once claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text.|$|E

While 11 tracks ended up on the final version of the album, a further seven or eight songs were recorded. Howie Weinberg mastered the recordings at Howie Weinberg Mastering in March.|$|E
500|$|Following Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, Khan {{starred in}} Sanjay Gadhvi's thriller Kidnap. He was cast as Kabir Sharma, a {{kidnapper}} who abducts {{a girl to}} settle an old score with her father, played by Minissha Lamba and Sanjay Dutt, respectively. The actor was initially hesitant to play the part (calling it [...] "tricky and tough") because he couldn't relate to the character; according to him, he would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it without Gadhvi's support and backing. In preparation for his role, Khan listened to metal and rock music for a year to become aggressive. While the film was a critical failure, his performance was generally well received by critics. Gaurav Malani, in a review for The Economic Times, wrote: [...] "Imran Khan is effective as the intelligent abductor who's always two steps ahead of his opponent. However, the natural actor could go easy on his lip movements that appear synthetic at times." [...] Kidnap was also a commercial failure.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Nowitzki can put {{the ball}} down and drive with it from the perimeter, like few <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his size. NBA.com lauds his {{versatility}} by stating: [...] "The 7–0 forward who at times mans the pivot can strike fear in an opponent when he corrals a rebound and leads the break or prepares to launch a three-point bomb." [...] Charles Barkley says {{the best way to}} guard Nowitzki is to [...] "get a cigarette and a blindfold". Later on in his career, Nowitzki also developed an unorthodox post up game, often backing down his opponents from the free throw line or near the middle of the key, opening up the floor for multiple passing angles should a double team come his way. [...] When defenses guard Nowitzki with one of their biggest men, who is then pulled out to the perimeter, the net effect is that while Nowitzki's own statistics are actually compromised by being out of position to offensively rebound or make an easy close-range basket, {{the rest of the team}} becomes more offensively potent with the defense having to be spread across the floor. Often, this creates mismatches that his teammates can exploit. The Mavericks system and international play exposed him to an open passing game, making him dangerous as a point forward and post playmaker as well.|$|E

500|$|Republicans {{claimed that}} Taylor's suit, {{by virtue of}} having been filed two hours before Beckham's, gave the case {{precedence}} in Louisville. By mutual consent, the parties consolidated the suits, which were heard before Judge Emmet Field in Jefferson County circuit court. Both sides knew that Field's decision, whatever it might be, would be appealed, but both agreed {{to abide by the}} outcome of the final court's decision. The case was heard on March 1 and 2, 1900. Taylor's attorney's contended that the General Assembly had acted in a quasi-judicial manner, violating the principle of separation of powers. Further, because the contest committee's report did not specify how many votes were invalid, Republicans argued that all 150,000 votes cast in the contested counties had been invalidated by the General Assembly's vote, and consequently, the voters of those counties had been illegally disenfranchised. The most the Assembly should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> they claimed, was to invalidate the entire election. Finally, they contended that the alleged illegal activities of the General Assembly had deprived Taylor and Marshall of their property rights – the [...] "property" [...] in question being the offices they claimed – and their liberty to hold an elected office. Attorneys for Beckham contended that legislative actions historically had not been subject to judicial review, and indeed were not subject to such under any provision of the state constitution.|$|E
500|$|In early November 2011, Architects {{announced}} {{a plan to}} release [...] "Devil's Island", the first song from the then-unnamed follow-up to their fourth studio album The Here and Now.

Both the song and the accompanying music video reference rioting in England in 2011, and the music video features clips of the riots. [...] "Devil's Island" [...] was well received by critics for its return to the mathcore style of their third album, Hollow Crown. Thrash Hits said, [...] "more-melodic aspects of Architects are still very much on show", that the song used [...] "increased harsh vocals" [...] and that the guitar tones were reminiscent of those on [...] "Early Grave", the opening track of Hollow Crown. J.J. Nattrass of Bring The Noise said, [...] "the track is sweeping and melodic in parts, whilst bursting with high tempo and visceral raw energy in others." [...] Tim Dodderidge, writing for Mind Equals Blown, praised the song's lyrics, saying, [...] "Architects has taken on an important issue in Britain today and made a song that questions humanity; it may have a lasting effect on listeners that bands like Rise Against <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> though they sound nothing alike". The band supported the single's release with a five-day UK headline tour in December 2011; supporting acts were Deaf Havana, Tek-One and Heights.|$|E
