25|$|Drugs {{most often}} {{associated}} with this term include: alcohol, cannabis, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methaqualone, opioids and some substituted amphetamines. The exact cause of substance abuse is not clear, with the two predominant theories being: either a genetic disposition which is learned from others, or a habit which if addiction develops, manifests itself as a chronic <b>debilitating</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fossey {{had been}} plagued by lung {{problems}} from an early age, and later in her life, she suffered from advanced emphysema brought on by years of heavy cigarette smoking. As the <b>debilitating</b> <b>disease</b> progressed—further aggravated by the high mountain altitude and damp climate—Fossey found {{it increasingly difficult to}} conduct field research, frequently suffering from shortness of breath and requiring the help of an oxygen tank when climbing or hiking long distances.|$|E
25|$|In {{in-vitro}} experiments THC at {{extremely high}} concentrations, {{which could not}} be reached with commonly consumed doses, caused competitive inhibition of the AChE enzyme and inhibition of β-amyloid peptide aggregation, implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of A aggregation, and this study provides a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may impact the progression of this <b>debilitating</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

25|$|The European economy {{entered a}} vicious circle in which hunger and chronic, {{low-level}} <b>debilitating</b> <b>disease</b> reduced {{the productivity of}} labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs like Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377) and Philip VI of France (r. 1328–1350), out of a fear that their comparatively high standard of living would decline, raised the fines and rents of their tenants. Standards of living then fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole experienced more health problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between the Pizarro brothers and Almagro originated {{in a dispute over}} the possession of the city of Cuzco during the initial Spanish partition and administration of Peru. While Almagro controlled the city from 1537, both considered it under their jurisdiction. Almagro's enterprise had won him several earlier battles, but although he succeeded in taking the city by a coup de main, Pizarro's forces were by far the stronger in the region, leaving him with few options for its defence. Almagro, his fortunes on the wane, invalided by a <b>debilitating</b> <b>disease,</b> turned to Rodrigo Orgóñez to carry out the campaign.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to mankind always has been eradicating the presence of <b>debilitating</b> <b>disease.</b> Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E

500|$|Other health {{problems}} persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, {{which he had}} dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party, the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy. Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a [...] "frightful smell", until McKinlay arrived to help.

2500|$|Degenerative {{myelopathy}} (DM) is {{a neurological}} {{disease of the}} spinal cord causing progressive paraparesis, most commonly in the German shepherd dog breed. It affects Rhodesian ridgebacks {{at a rate of}} only 0.75%. Signs of degenerative myelopathy are characterized at the beginning with foot dragging, and slipping of the rear limbs. The disease progresses {{to the point where the}} animal can no longer stand or walk on its own. Progression has been known to take as little as six months, or several years. There is a [...] offered by the Orthopedic Foundation of Animals, to test for the gene.
