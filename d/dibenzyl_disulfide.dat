Friction coefficients and wear track widths were measured with a Bowden-Leben type friction apparatus by using a pin-on-disk specimen configuration. Results obtained indicate that benzyl monosulfide, <b>dibenzyl</b> <b>disulfide,</b> and benzyl alcohol resulted in the lowest friction coefficients for 304 stainless steel, while benzyl ether provided the least surface protection and gave the highest friction. Strainhardening of the 304 stainless steel prior to sliding resulted in reduced friction in dry sliding.

40|$|During hydro {{desulfurization}} or hydrotreatment {{of crude}} oil in petroleum refineries, one or more gaseous by products are produced with hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) infused into it. Since the presence of H 2 S, corrodes the process equipment and is highly toxic, it is eliminated from the gas stream and transformed into harmless forms. H 2 S from gas stream is removed using amine treating unit and is treated in the Claus unit {{for the production of}} elemental sulfur. But in Claus process valuable hydrogen energy is lost and requires exact process control over ratio of oxygen to hydrogen sulfide feed. Therefore, an alternative process i. e. Phase Transfer Catalysis which could transform H 2 S to valuable chemicals is greatly welcome in the process industry. The valuable chemical such as <b>Dibenzyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> (DBDS) find their application in manufacturing corrosion inhibitors, fragrance compounds, high pressure lubricant additives and other organic compounds. This work was carried out to study the synthesis of fine chemicals like <b>Dibenzyl</b> <b>Disulfide</b> (DBDS) and using H 2 S-rich monoethanolamine (MEA) and benzyl chloride (BC) under Liquid-Liquid-Solid phase transfer catalysis with a tri-phase catalyst. Owing to its solid state, availability, cost and reusability, Amberlite IR 400 is selected as a PTC. A parametric study was carried out which emphasized upon the impact of catalyst loading as one of the process variables on the conversion of benzyl chloride and selectivity of DBDS and parametric study with these substances revealed 100 % selectivity for desired product at ambient condition.

Analysis of the molecular orbitals shows that the characteristic double peak of the <b>dibenzyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> arises {{as a consequence of}} the enhanced splitting of the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and the LUMO + 1. Exchange of the ligand benzyl by phenyl introduces more transitions at the absorption edge, which enhance the broadening in the divalent sulfur and splitting of the peaks of the disulfide.

The complexes were grouped as physi-or chemi-sorption according to their adsorption energy applying a distortion decomposition model, with a preference by a double interaction of S with Cu (i. e. hollow hcp, and bridge sites). A degree of disulfide bond dissociation was observed in the complexes, being correlated with adsorption energies.

The rate of decomposition of heptane (at 700 ‘C, 100 kPa, and a mass ratio of steam to feed 3 :l) increased by 16 to 26 %, and the selectivity toward ethene decreased, if 0. 1 to 1.

40|$|Insulating oils {{are often}} {{considered}} the life blood of electrical {{devices such as}} transformers. Proper functioning of these devices is essential for uninterrupted electrical power over long periods, often stretching into decades. To ensure longevity of insulating oils and improve certain characteristics additives are often added to the oils. On the other hand, the presence of contaminants can deteriorate {{the performance of the}} oils and can cause extensive damage to the electrical devices. To ensure optimal operation of electrical devices, additive and contaminant levels should be periodically monitored. Because of the complex chemical composition of insulating mineral oils, the determination of additives and contaminants is a difficult and often laborious task. However, the task can be made manageable with the use of current state-of-the art analytical instrumentation.

This paper investigates permittivity and loss factor curves of transformer oil impregnated insulation paper, at different corrosive sulfur degradation stages. Three types of transformer conductors are investigated; new, artificially aged and service aged.

40|$|Corrosion {{of copper}} {{conductors}} in mineral oil insulated power transformers {{is a well-known}} problem in electrical power management and distribution worldwide. Recently, some corrosive compounds containing sulfur (e. g. DBDS, <b>dibenzyl</b> <b>disulfide)</b> have been identified {{to play an important}} role in this process. A common strategy to limit corrosion, either as precaution or remedy, is the addition of a passivator (Irgamet 39 ™, I 39 ™) in the oil, with a recommended concentration of 100 ppm to protect the surface of conductors from chemical attack from corrosive oil components. In this study, samples of naturally non-corrosive oil with different concentrations of I 39 ™ are used to treat copper surfaces that are aged under inert atmosphere and analyzed with X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) to assess directly the effective amount of passivator covering the surface of metal and its dependence on the original concentration in oil. The main aim is, therefore, to determine the effect of the concentration of I 39 ™ originally in oil on the effective surface coverage of copper conductors to observe its distribution and to verify the recommended passivator concentration to be used...|$|E

This involves first absorption of H 2 S in either aqueous ethanolamine (MEA) or methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and then reaction of this H 2 S richaqueous solution with organic reactants.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless gas with an obnoxious rotten egg odour. H 2 S {{is highly}} flammable, noxious, and vitriolic in nature. Many {{petroleum}} {{and natural gas}} processing industries produces H 2 S as a by-product gaseous stream. Most H 2 S in the air comes from natural sulfur cycle. Exposure to H 2 S can lead to various health issues like burning/tearing of eyes, cough, and shortness of breath. Moderate concentration can lead to respiratory issues. So it is advisable {{to make use of}} this gas in other industrial operations. In industries, normally H 2 S present in gas streams is absorbed in amines and is converted to sulfur through conventional Claus process. From economical point of view, sulfur is not so good product, so the idea is to find out a substitute for the Claus process where H 2 S rich amine instead of going to the scrubber is fed to some reactor for production of compounds like thioether, disulfides which are more valuable than sulfur. Also the need of additional scrubber and other Claus units is ruled out in the new alternative process which makes the overall process economical. The present work includes the study of synthesis of <b>Dibenzyl</b> <b>Disulfide</b> using H 2 S rich aq. Alkanolamine, sulfur and Benzyl chloride in presence of triphase catalyst.

40|$|Corrosive sulfur in {{the last}} decade has been {{recognized}} as a major risk to high voltage transformers. An initial study undertaken by CIGRE on copper sulfide in transformer insulation investigated possible sources, i. e. <b>Dibenzyl</b> <b>Disulfide</b> (DBDS), it also looked at possible mitigating techniques, i. e. passivation, environmental influences, i. e. temperature, and improvement to oil corrosion standards, i. e. EN 62535. Although there was significant volume of research undertaken the high voltage industry still felt {{there is a lack of}} understanding in the process of copper sulfide formation and long-term effects of mitigation techniques. Hence a new CIGRE transformer working group, A 2. 40, was created. The identification of techniques with the ability to track the mechanism of copper sulfide (Cu 2 S) formation is fundamental to the current research objectives. The technique suggested in this paper involves the use of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), which is used for elemental analysis, to track the quantity of sulfur in the oil. As the deposits of Cu 2 S form in the conductors and paper insulation the amount of sulfur in the oil decreases. By using a series of laboratory experiments is possible to investigate how the rate of formation of Cu 2 S changes with time, suggesting that there is an initial chemical reaction needed for the Cu 2 S deposits to form. Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) has been used to investigate the surface of copper at several different stages of the copper sulphide formation. By manipulating variables, i. e. temperature, it is possible to map their influence and provide a more precise risk assessment of transformer with corrosive oil to electrical utility companies. The experimental results suggest the possibility of developing a method to indirectly measure Cu 2 S deposition on conductors and insulation paper by tracking sulfur concentration changes in the transformer oil...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to utilize {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S) in the synthesis of fine chemicals, such as, thioethers and organic disulfides. Two different aqueous alkanolamines, such as, Nmethyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and monoethanolamine (MEA) were used for the absorption H 2 S to make H 2 S-rich alkanolamine solution. Dibenzyl sulfide (DBS) and <b>dibenzyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> (DBDS) were synthesized from the reaction of H 2 S-rich alkanolamine with organic reactant,benzyl chloride (BC). To carry out this biphasic reaction, three different phase transfer catalysts (PTCs) were used, namely, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide (TBPB), trihexyl (tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride (THTDPC) an ionic liquid (ILs) and a solid catalyst, amberlite IR- 400. The main objective of the present study is to utilize H 2 S in synthesizing value-added chemicals such as DBS and DBDS, along with maximization of the conversion of the organic reactant, and the selectivity of desired product. Three different reaction systems have been carried out for the present work. First system dealt with the synthesis of DBS from the reaction of H 2 S-rich MDEA and BC using TBPB as PTC under liquid-liquid (L-L) phase transfer catalysis (PTC). Parametric study, mechanistic investigation and kinetic modeling have been performed for this system. In the second system, DBS was synthesized using THTDPC as a PTC under L-L PTC condition with around 98 % BC conversion and 100 % DBS selectivity. Parametric study and mechanistic investigation was performed and a detailed kinetic model was developed and validated using experimental values. In the last system, an investigation has been done on the utilization of H 2 S for the synthesis of DBDS under liquid-liquid-solid (L-L-S) PTC using amberlite IR- 400 as a solid PTC.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} volume {{of research has}} been undertaken {{in order to understand}} the recent failures in oil insulated power apparatus due to deposition of copper sulphide on the conductors and in the insulation paper. <b>Dibenzyl</b> <b>Disulfide</b> (DBDS) has been found to be the leading corrosive sulphur compound in the insulation oil [1]. The process of copper sulphide formation and the deposition in the paper is still being investigated, but a recently proposed method seems to be gaining some confidence [1]. This method suggests a two-step process; initially the DBDS and some oil soluble copper complexes are formed. Secondly the copper complexes are absorbed in the paper insulation, where they then decompose into copper sulphide [2]. The most commonly used mitigating technique for corrosive sulphur contaminated oil is passivation, normally using Irgamet 39 or 1, 2, 3 -benzotriazole (BTA). The passivator is diluted into the oil to a concentration of around 100 ppm, where it then reacts with the copper conductors to form a complex layer around the copper, preventing it from interacting with DBDS compounds and forming copper sulphide. This research project will investigate the electrical properties of HV transformers which have tested positive for corrosive sulphur, and the evolution of those properties as the asset degrades due to sulphur corrosion. Parallel to this the long term properties of transformers with passivated insulation oil will be analysed {{in order to understand the}} passivator stability and whether it is necessary to keep adding the passivator to sustain its performance. Condition monitoring techniques under investigation will include dielectric spectroscopy, frequency response analysis, recovery voltage method (aka interfacial polarisation) amongst others. Partial discharge techniques will not be investigated, as the voltage between the coil plates is low and therefore it will not contribute significantly to the overall insulation breakdown, in corrosive oil related faults [3]. The goal of this research is to establish key electrical properties in both passivated and non-passivated power transformers that demonstrate detectable changes as the equipment degrades due to the insulation oil being corrosive...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} "Synthesis of Novel Chalcogenides using Acyloxyphosphonium Intermediates and Doubly Activated Cyclopropanes" {{is divided}} into six chapters. Chapter 1 : Part 1 : Synthesis of thioesters from carboxylic acids and alkyl halides using benzyltriethylammonium tetrathiomolybdate In this chapter, we describe the synthesis of thioesters from carboxylic acids and alkyl halides. Aryl carboxylic acids are first activated using PPh 3 and NBS to form the corresponding acyloxy phosphonium intermediates which then on further reaction with reagent, 1 generate thioaroylate ions in situ. These thioaroylates on further reaction with various electrophiles such as alkyl halides / dihalides in the same pot gives the corresponding functionalized thioesters. This methodology was then extended to carbohydrate based thioesters as they are important synthetic intermediates in various transformations and also they could be deprotected later to synthetically more valuable thiols. For this study, we took 1, 2, 3, 4 tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranuronic acid which on treatment with PPh 3,NBS, reagent, 1 and I-bromo propane (CHCl 3, 28 °C, 2 h) afforded the corresponding thioester in 55 % yield. An intramolecular version of the reaction was then performed on a compound containing both anomeric bromide and carboxylic acid functionality. This was achieved by treating tetra acetyl glucuronic acid, with HBr/AcOH to form α-D-bromo-glucopyranuronic acid which on further treatment with PPh 3, NBS and reagent, 1 gave the corresponding bicyclic thiolactone in 55 % yield. Chapter 1 : Part 2 : Synthesis of Thioesters by Simultaneous Activation of Carboxylic Acids and Alcohols using PPh 3 /NBS In this chapter, we have shown the synthesis of thioester from carboxylic acids and alcohols. Both carboxylic acids and alcohols are first activated using PPh 3 and NBS to form the corresponding phosphonium salts. Reagent, 1 then reacts selectively with acyloxyphosphonium intermediates to generate thioaroylate ions in situ which then react either with alkoxy phosphonium salts or the corresponding alkyl bromide to give thioesters in good yield. The same methodology was then used for a one pot conversion of N-Boc serine ester to s-protected cysteine using reagent 1 as the key sulfur transfer reagent. Chapter 2 : Part 1 : Tetrathiomolybdate mediated Michael addition of thioaroylates generated from acyloxyphosphonium salts In this chapter, we have reported an easy and alternative protocol for the Michael addition of thioacids to various Michael acceptors. Acyloxyphosphonium salts and tetrathiomolybdate reacts to generate thioaroylate ions which then undergo Michael additionto givethe corresponding Michael adducts. This methodology was then extended for the synthesis carbohydrate based thiolactone by an intramolecular Michael addition reaction to show {{the applicability of the}} methodology. Chapter 2 : Part 2 : Regioselective and chemoselective ring opening of aziridines and epoxides using thioaroylate ions In this chapter, we have demonstrated nucleophilic ring opening of Aziridines and epoxides using thioaroylate ions generated from acyloxyphosphonium salts and tetrathiomolybdate as a sulfur transfer reagent. We have also demonstrated chemoselective ring opening of azirdines in the presence of an epoxide and tosylate to show the novelty of our method. Chapter 3 : Synthesis of bromo esters and bromo thioesters by ring opening of cyclic ethers and thiiranes via acyloxyphosphonium intermediates In this chapter, we report the synthesis of bromo esters and thioesters by the ring opening of epoxides, tetrahydrofuran, and thiiranes with bromide ion to form the corresponding bromo alcohols and thiols followed by the nucleophilic displacement of triphenylphosphine oxide from acyloxyphosphonium salts. At first THF and epoxides were subjected for the ring opening reactions to give the corresponding bromo esters. The methodology was then extended to thiiranes to synthesis bromo thioesters in good to moderate yield. Chapter 4 : Synthesis of doubly activated cyclopropranes and their applications to the synthesis of dihydrothiophenes and thiophenes In this chapter we discuss the synthesis and ring opening of doubly activated cyc 1 opropanes using tetrathiomolybdate and their applications towards the formation of dihydrothiophenes and other bioactive molecules. At first, we synthesized a number of doubly activated cyc 1 opropanes from dimethyl-α-arylsulfonium bromide, 24 a protocol developed by Chow and others. With the doubly activated cyclopropanes in hand, we then attempted the ring opening of cyclopropanes containing a cyano group with tetrathiomolybdate to give the corresponding dihydrothiophene derivatives. Also we have used our methodology for the synthesis of HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor Chapter 5 : Synthesis of unsymmetrical sulfide and disulfide derivatives via ring opening of doubly activated cyclopropanes Here, we describe the synthesis of various monosulfides and mixed disulfides by doubly activated cyclopropane ring opening mediated by tetrathiomolybdate in one pot. Tetrathiomolybdate is known for the reduction of disulfides while diaryl disulfides gives monosulfide, dialkyl disulfides give mixed disulfides with the corresponding doubly activated cyclopropane. Thus diaryl disulfide cleaves readily as the resultant thiolate ion is stable and opens the cyclopropane ring to give a monosulfide. <b>Dibenzyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> on the other hand being less reactive gave a mixed disulfide instead of a monosulfide. We also extended this ring opening reactions for the synthesis of symmetrical disulfides Using tetrathiomolybdate as the key sulfur transfer reagent. Chapter 6 : A mild protocol for the nucleophilic ring opening of doubly activated cyclopropanes using selenolates generated in situ Nucleophilic ring opening of doubly activated cyc 1 opropanes with selenolate ions generated by the reduction of diselenides using NaB 14 is discussed {{in this part of the}} work. A variety of doubly activated cyc 1 opropanes have been tested for this reaction giving the corresponding selenium compounds in good yield. This methodology was then extended to other diselenides using nitroester cyclopropane as standard and also to other substituted nitroester cyclopropanes using diphenyl diselenide as standard. This methodology was also then extended to the synthesis of homoselenocysteines by the reduction of nitro group using Sn/HCI for the reduction. (For structural formula pl refer the hard copy...|$|E
