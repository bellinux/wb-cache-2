The bout saw Mann hit Evans with multiple combinations and low kicks, before utilising a flying knee. Evans counter-attacked with takedowns, which he kept up into the final round. Mann won the bout via split decision (47–48, 48–47, 48–47) to become the new Shark <b>Fights</b> Featherweight champion.|$|E

5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer {{is that he}} holds the second longest unbeaten record of <b>fights</b> of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten <b>fights</b> between 1908 and 1912. Although {{it could be argued}} that Dyer may have boxed 94 <b>fights</b> between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss.

Though officially exhibition <b>fights,</b> the UFC chooses to record the results of semi-final matchups.
