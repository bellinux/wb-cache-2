5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> the peak {{ring of the}} impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there {{in case of a}} defeat. It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|The Khazars {{resumed their}} raids on Muslim {{territory}} after the Abbasid succession, reaching <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> Transcaucasia. Nevertheless, although by the 9th century the Khazars had re-consolidated their control over Dagestan {{almost to the}} gates of Derbent itself, they never seriously attempted to challenge Muslim control of the southern Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> {{the realm of}} quantum physics, {{but it can be}} summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{song lyrics}} relate to romance and paranoia, {{the latter being}} a {{recurring}} theme in Jackson's albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that Bad moved Jackson [...] "deeper <b>into</b> hard rock, <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> schmaltzy adult contemporary, <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> hard dance – essentially taking each portion of Thriller to an extreme, while increasing the quotient of immaculate studiocraft." ...|$|R

5|$|After the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense again {{failed to}} advance the ball. After a three-and-out, the Hokies again punted. The ball {{traveled}} 44yards, forcing the Eagles to start at their own 21-yard line. As the quarter came to a close, the Eagles drove the ball <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> Virginia Tech territory.

Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> Caledonia again: they soon withdrew south permanently to Hadrian's Wall.|$|E

The influence of Calakmul extended <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> the Petén; king Tuun K'ab' Hix of Calakmul oversaw the enthronement of Aj Wosal to the rulership of Naranjo in 546.

5|$|Committed {{to social}} and {{cultural}} activism in Transylvania, Agârbiceanu spent the 1910s officiating near Sibiu, with a break during World War I that eventually took him <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> Ukraine.

He was voted into the Romanian Academy and assumed the office of Senate vice president under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of the {{intrinsic}} magnetic field on Venus, the solar wind penetrates relatively <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E

5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> the genitals.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July 2016, Allardyce {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} to become {{manager of the}} England national team.

The German Army Group North moved towards Leningrad, Army Group South took control of Ukraine, and Army Group Center advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, Army Group Center crossed the Dnieper River, {{on the path to}} Moscow.|$|E

Tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.|$|E
