40|$|This is {{the peer}} {{reviewed}} {{version of the}} following article: BETZ, S. [...] . et al., 2016. Photovoltaic <b>energy</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and risk assessment for the South African residential sector. Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, DOI: 10. 1002 /pip. 2757, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. The establishment of new photovoltaic (PV) markets in emerging economies represents a business development opportunity for expansion outside traditional energy markets. Appropriate assessment of PV market competitiveness is thus necessary in order to inform policy and regulatory development, and in order to manage risks related to investment. This paper presents an evaluation of PV <b>energy</b> <b>competitiveness</b> using a case study of the emerging residential PV market in South Africa. Competitiveness is defined in light of the risks associated with the financial performance of domestic grid-connected rooftop PV considering the current market status together with three proposed business models, namely net-metering, net-billing, and an energy savings performance contract framework. Financial performance is evaluated in terms of a socket parity evaluation together with a discounted net cash flow analysis. Investment risk assessment was facilitated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate the highest potential profitability for the energy savings performance contract model, which includes PV system ownership by an energy services company. It is also shown that appropriate application of risk modelling has the potential to inform decisions by investors and policy makers alike that result in improved policy and business solutions that are able to support increased residential PV energy market competitiveness without the need for explicit subsidy frameworks...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{energy is}} one of the most {{promising}} alternatives to fossil fuels due to the enormous energy resource available. However, it is often considered uneconomical and difficult due in part to the initial stage of development of the technology and the harsh marine environment. With this in view, this Thesis proposes combined wave and wind energy farms as a way to enhance marine <b>energy</b> <b>competitiveness</b> by taking advantage of the mutual benefits. In this sense, the synergies between both renewables are deeply analysed in a holistic way through numerous case studies implemented by third generation models used as a conjunction – SWAN and WAsP. The benefits regarded along the different case studies are translated into monetary terms assessing the impact on the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) ...|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to assess}} the likely {{competitiveness}} of different forms of renewable energy in Colombia over the next 25 years. To this end, it compares the likely power production cost {{for a set of}} renewable energy sources, and compares them to the likely long-run cost of traditional energy. Costs from global and local externalities through the use of traditional energy sources are also factored into the analysis. The key conclusion of the article is that while solar PV will likely remain uncompetitive under any future cost scenario, cost paths for small hydro, modern biomass or geothermal are already close enough to being competitive, so that appropriate government intervention may make the decisive difference in making these technologies competitive with conventional energy technologies.

40|$|Security and {{competitiveness}} {{are two very}} {{important aspects of the}} economic and political development of every country. In the 21 st century, one of the key drivers of most economies in countries throughout the world is energy. Different countries adopt different measures so as to ensure their security {{and competitiveness}} through the effective energy policies that make traditional and renewable resources adequately available hence eliminating the possibilities of shortages. Our paper takes up the case study of Germany as one of the wealthiest and most developed economies in the European Union which also occupies the first positions in the charts of energy uptake and consumption. German policy-makers realize its vulnerability when it comes to energy security and attempt to diversify its <b>energy</b> <b>competitiveness</b> using the renewable sources of energy (for instance via the adoption of the Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz or the "Renewable Energy Act" (EEG)). We analyze the issues of energy security and competitiveness of a country using an example of Germany.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop an initial {{estimate}} of the potential competitiveness of low temperature (45 degrees C to 100 degrees C) geothermal resources on the Eastern Coastal Plain, the Center for Metropolitant Planning and Research of The Johns Hopkins University reviewed and compared available energy price projections. Series of projections covering the post- 1985 period {{have been made by}} the Energy Information Administration, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and by private research firms. Since low temperature geothermal energy will compete primarily for the space and process heating markets currently held by petroleum, natural gas, and electricity, projected trends in the real prices for these fuels were examined. The spread in the current and in projected future prices for these fuels, which often serve identical end uses, underscores the influence of specific attributes for each type of fuel, such as cleanliness, security of supply, and governmental regulation. Geothermal energy possesses several important attributes in common with electricity (e. g., ease of maintenance and perceived security of supply), and thus the price of electric space heating is likely to be an upper bound on a competitive price for geothermal <b>energy.</b> <b>Competitiveness</b> would, of course, be increased if geothermal heat could be delivered for prices closer to those for oil and natural gas. The projections reviewed suggest that oil and gas prices will rise significantly in real terms over the next few decades, while electricity prices are projected to be more stable. Electricity prices will, however, remain above those for the other two fuels. The significance of this work rests on the fact that, in market economies, prices provide the fundamental signals needed for efficient resource allocation. Although market prices often fail to fully account for factors such as environmental impacts and long-term scarcity value, they nevertheless embody a considerable amount of information and are the primary guideposts for suppliers and consumers...|$|E
