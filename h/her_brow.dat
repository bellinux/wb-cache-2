500|$|In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-directed romantic drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani. Penned by Mahesh Bhatt, {{the film}} {{tells the story}} of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day reviewed, [...] "Vidya Balan, a fine actress with {{thousand}} emotions fleeting across her lovely face, has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do". Vidya next took {{on the part of a}} police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was attracted to the idea of playing a [...] "no-nonsense police inspector who commands much respect" [...] and was particularly drawn to her character's [...] "silent aggression". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya [...] "is reliably solid each time she’s on screen, raising <b>her</b> <b>brow,</b> curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi language biopic of the actor-director Bhagwan Dada.|$|E
2500|$|The 1899 {{portrait}} of Williams depicts her wearing a pleated black {{dress with a}} high white collar. Her hair is in a tight bun, set against a dark brown background. Williams is turned slightly to the right, with a strong light cast {{on that side of}} her body. Her lips are pursed and <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> is furled; her expression is nearly a scowl. Dark circles are visible under her eyes.|$|E

2500|$|Selene is {{commonly}} depicted with a crescent moon, {{often accompanied by}} stars; sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used. Often a crescent moon rests on <b>her</b> <b>brow,</b> or the cusps of a crescent moon protrude, horn-like, from her head, or from behind her head or shoulders. [...] Selene's head is sometimes surrounded by a nimbus, and from the Hellenistic period onwards, she is sometimes pictured with a torch.|$|E
2500|$|... "At last, Maria Clara {{emerged from}} the bath {{accompanied}} by her friends, fresh as a rose opening its petals with the first dew, covered with sparks of fire from the early morning sun. [...] Her first smile was for Crisostomo (Ibarra), and the first cloud on <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> for Padre Salvi..." [...] (Padre Salvi, although a priest, is an admirer of Maria Clara.) [...] "Their legs were up to the knees, the wide folds of their bathing skirts outlining the gracious curves of their thighs. [...] Their hair hung loose and their arms were bare. [...] They wore striped gay-colored blouses... Pale and motionless, the religious Actaeon (i.e. Padre Salvi, who was hiding in the bushes, acting as a voyeur) watched this chaste Diana (i.e. Maria Clara): his sunken eyes glistening {{at the sight of}} her beautifully molded white arms, the graceful neck ending in a suggestion of a bosom. [...] The diminutive rosy feet playing in the water aroused strange sensations and feelings in his impoverished, starved being and made him dream of new visions in his fevered mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Girl {{with the}} Dragon Tattoo began {{shooting}} in Sweden in September 2010. Mara {{did not consider}} the film to be a remake, but another interpretation of the novel. [...] "I plan on giving my interpretation of the character," [...] she stated to Variety. Mara's long brown hair was cut short and dyed black, in a style reminiscent of 1970s punk and 1980s goth fashions. She also had each of her ears pierced four times, and had <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> and right nipple pierced for the role. Her nose and lip piercings were fake. She kept the nipple piercing {{so that it would}} not need to be re-pierced for a sequel. Mara's eyebrows were bleached, and she wore a temporary dragon tattoo. She began preparing for the role by starting to skateboard and kickbox, and underwent dialect and computer training. She also visited Stockholm, the setting of the novel. The film was released on December 20, 2011. Mara received universal critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance. On January 24, 2012, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.|$|E

60|$|Still {{she did not}} understand. A deep frown of puzzlement {{appeared}} between <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b>|$|R
60|$|The scarlet fired her temples, <b>her</b> <b>brow,</b> darkening {{the skin}} under her bright hair.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} close to mine. I stooped forward and kissed her on <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b>|$|E

60|$|She faced him fully, a frown of perplexity {{bringing}} <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> together above <b>her</b> troubled eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him keenly, inquiringly, a deep line of doubt, even of fear now {{settling}} between <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce {{passed her}} hand over <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> {{to get rid of}} a feeling of unreality.|$|E
60|$|She {{gazed at}} me in a long, {{lingering}} sort of way, <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> wrinkled as if in thought.|$|E

60|$|Carrie Denham flushed crimson, and <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> {{straightened}} ominously, but she restrained herself, and laughed, {{a little}} bitter laugh.|$|R

60|$|She {{looked up}} suddenly. <b>Her</b> <b>brows</b> {{met in a}} frown of bewilderment. Clearly this {{interested}} her. Again was she drawn.|$|R
