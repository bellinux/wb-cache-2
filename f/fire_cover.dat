During the second World War, all local fire services in the region and on a national level created under the 1938 legislation were nationalised to form the National Fire Service, remaining this way until the Fire Services Act 1947 which handed control back of <b>fire</b> <b>cover</b> back to local authorities in 1948. When the service {{was established}} in 1974, it brought together four small local fire services and parts of two others to form the service that exists today.|$|E
