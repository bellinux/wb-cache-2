5|$|As {{a widely}} used {{international}} standard, ISO 3166-1 <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> in other standards {{and used by}} international organizations to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information.

5|$|Metagenomic {{analysis}} pipelines use {{two approaches}} in the annotation of coding {{regions in the}} assembled contigs. The first approach is to identify genes based upon homology with genes that are already publicly available in sequence databases, usually by simple BLAST searches. This type of approach <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> in the program MEGAN4.|$|E
5|$|The F571 {{extension}} is {{orthogonal to}} the presence of the boolean datatype in SQL (discussed later in this article) and, despite syntactic similarities, F571 does not introduce boolean or three-valued literals in the language. The F571 extension was actually present in SQL92, well before the boolean datatype was introduced to the standard in 1999. The F571 extension <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> by few systems however; PostgreSQL is one of those implementing it.|$|E

5|$|The three-languages {{wayfinding}} {{system for}} the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by Philippe Apeloig, and <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> in both Arabic and Roman script. Frutiger LT typeface has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect readability for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an Arabic bespoked typeface, the LAD Arabic, based on the classic Naskh style and his Colvert Arabic font.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborated}} APXS {{setup is}} equipped with a sensor head containing six curium sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of millicuries (roughly a gigabecquerel). The sources are collimated on the sample, and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed (the proton analysis <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> only in some spectrometers). These spectra contain quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium and lithium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax <b>is</b> <b>implemented,</b> {{there could be}} a strong {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E

30|$|The {{functions}} (link, format, button, {{and page}} title) that can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> through markup language {{should not only}} <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> through Java script because if they only depend on it, the link, format, button, and page title may not <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> {{in an environment where}} such implementation is impossible.|$|R
5|$|Perl <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as a core interpreter, {{written in}} C, {{together}} with a large collection of modules, written in Perl and C. , the interpreter is 150,000 lines of C code and compiles to a 1MB executable on typical machine architectures. Alternatively, the interpreter can be compiled to a link library and embedded in other programs. There are nearly 500 modules in the distribution, comprising 200,000 lines of Perl and an additional 350,000 lines of C code (much of the C code in the modules consists of character encoding tables).|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{incorporates}} Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant, Cortana, {{which was}} first introduced with Windows Phone 8.1 in 2014. Cortana replaced Windows' embedded search feature, supporting both text and voice input. Many of its features are a direct carryover from Windows Phone, including integration with Bing, setting reminders, a Notebook feature for managing personal information, as well as searching for files, playing music, launching applications and setting reminders or sending emails. Cortana <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as a universal search box located alongside the Start and Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed to a single button.|$|E
