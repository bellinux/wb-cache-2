5|$|Aldimir rose in {{importance}} with the accession of {{his older brother}} George (r. 1280–1292) to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conferred the high noble title of despot during George's reign, and American historian John Fine believes Aldimir was granted his appanage at that time. Pavlov, however, conjectures that Aldimir's domain dates to 1298, long after George's reign.|$|E
5|$|Disguised as a habitué of {{bars and}} taverns, he {{gathered}} {{much of that}} evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a {{justice of the peace}} in all the home counties—there is a draft of a letter regarding this matter stuck into Newton's personal first edition of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica which <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> amending at the time. Then he conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully prosecuted 28 coiners.|$|E
5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E

5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, {{an ability to}} remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He {{was a man of}} honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{was born}} in a village in Auranitis, part of the {{district}} of Trachonitis, east of the Sea of Galilee in Palestine. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern al-Shahbā', Syria) during his reign as emperor. He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> prominent in his community.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E

5|$|A {{week later}} on 27 September 1822, he {{published}} {{some of his}} findings in his Lettre à M. Dacier, addressed to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Champollion read the letter before the assembled Académie. All his main rivals and supporters were present at the reading, including Young {{who happened to be}} visiting Paris. This was the first meeting between the two. The presentation did not go into details regarding the script and in fact was surprisingly cautious in its suggestions. Although <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> already certain of this, Champollion merely suggested that the script was phonetic already from the earliest available texts, which would mean that the Egyptians had developed writing independently of the other civilizations around the Mediterranean. The paper also still contained confusions regarding the relative role of ideographic and phonetic signs, still arguing that also hieratic and demotic were primarily ideographic.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} over the clan's origins, Samuel undoubtedly descended from a distinguished family, since an unnamed sister of Stephen I, who had in 1000 or 1001 been crowned the first King of Hungary, {{was given in}} marriage {{to a member of}} the Aba clan around 1009. However, historians still debate whether Samuel himself or Samuel's father married the royal princess. If Samuel was her husband, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born before 990 and converted either from Judaism or paganismto Christianity when he married Stephen I's sister. His Christian credentials are further evidenced by Samuel's establishment of an abbey at Abasár which was recorded by Hungarian chronicles. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Samuel's conversion coincided with the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger encompassing his domains.|$|E
5|$|The Excellency {{over the}} Masses (also {{known as the}} Minister over the Masses) shared the same censorial and {{advisory}} roles as the other two Excellencies, the Excellency of Works and Grand Commandant. Like his previous counterpart, the Chancellor, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> responsible for drawing up the annual budget, although contemporary sources fail to mention this point. Aside from the court conference, the Great Conference of leading officials across the empire was conducted by his ministry. The Chancellor's bureaus were also retained by the Excellency over the Masses, and were nearly identical {{to that of the}} new Eastern-Han Grand Commandant's bureaus. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister Coachman, Minister of Justice, and Minister Herald.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{regiment}} {{landed at}} Cape Helles in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished {{himself in the}} construction of trenches and as an able commander. His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> kept on earth for some purpose. He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at Suvla Bay, where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre for his service during these months, and rose to the rank of captain on 5 August. He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.|$|E

25|$|As Collins had {{established}} his reputation by 1744, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> active {{for some years}} previously and his career probably began in the 1730s.

25|$|Chauncey Rowland Brown's {{reputation}} preceded him {{and led to}} many rumors.

25|$|Six months later, Parker goes to Chicago {{and kills}} the {{syndicate}} boss who hired Kroll to kill him. One year later, Leslie receives two hefty {{boxes in the}} mail containing several million dollars.

25|$|That <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> well practised in {{surveying}} {{is shown}} by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or chorobates, which he compares favourably with the groma, a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to {{the walls of the}} channel. He also developed one of the first odometers, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.|$|E
25|$|Juan van der Hamen y (Gómez de) León {{was baptized}} on 8 April 1596 in Madrid, therefore, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born there {{just days before}} that date. He {{was the son of}} Jehan van der Hamen, a Flemish courtier, who had moved to Madrid from Brussels before 1586, and Dorotea Whitman Gómez de León, a half-Flemish mother of noble Toledan ancestry. Van der Hamen and his two {{brothers}} Pedro and Lorenzo (both of whom were writers) emphasized their Spanish roots by using all or part of their maternal grandmother's family name, Gómez de León.|$|E
25|$|Before the Norman conquest a small Saxon chapel {{dedicated}} to St Peter {{stood outside the}} east gate of Shrewsbury; it had been built by Siward, son of Ethelgar and a close relative of Edward the Confessor. There was still a landowner, known as Siward the Fat, in Shropshire at Domesday, although he had owned many more estates in 1066. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the donor of the two estates the church is known from Domesday to have held in 1066: at Boreton near Condover and Lowe near Farley. However, the Abbey had lost Lowe by 1087.|$|E
