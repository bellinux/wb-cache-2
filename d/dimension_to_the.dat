5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west {{give the impression of}} a building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub. The tower is of the late 15thcentury Perpendicular style, but its four large battlemented turrets are the work of the restoration architect George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but also how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{history the}} area has absorbed waves of immigrants, who have each added a new <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> culture {{and history of the}} area, most notably the French Protestant Huguenots in the 17th century, the Irish in the 18th century, Ashkenazi Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and the Sylheti Bangladeshis {{community}} settling in the East End from the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most of his}} contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist {{anybody in}} film-making prior to {{entering}} the industry. He is credited with revolutionizing the Tamil film industry and is referred for bringing new <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South Asian cinema. A majority of his films are characterized by a string of socio-political themes. Because of his idea of combining art and commercial elements, most of his films garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. Nayagan, Bombay and Iruvar were inspired from real-life incidents, while Thalapathi and Raavan were based on Indian epics.|$|E
5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota {{started a}} slow {{disintegration}} of the Kannada speaking region into many short-lived palegar chiefdoms, and the better known Kingdom of Mysore and the kingdom of Keladi Nayakas, which were to later become important centres of Kannada literary production. These kingdoms and the Nayakas ("chiefs") of Tamil country continued to owe nominal support to a diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Penukonda (1570) and later from Chandragiri (1586) in modern Andhra Pradesh, followed by {{a brief period of}} independence. By the mid-17th century, large areas in north Karnataka came {{under the control of the}} Bijapur Sultanate who waged several wars in a bid to establish a hegemony over the southern Deccan. The defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate at the hands of the Mughals in late 17th century added a new <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prevailing confusion. The constant wars of the local kingdoms with the two new rivals, the Mughals and the Marathas, and among themselves, caused further instability in the region. Major areas of Karnataka came under the rule of the Mughals and the Marathas. Under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, the Mysore Kingdom reached its zenith of power but had to face the growing English might who by now had a firm foothold in the subcontinent. After the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, the Mysore Kingdom came under the British umbrella. More than a century later, with the dawn of India as an independent nation in 1947, the unification of Kannada speaking regions as modern Karnataka state brought four centuries of political uncertainty (and centuries of foreign rule) to an end.|$|E

25|$|In 1827, the Mahoning Association {{appointed}} Walter Scott as an evangelist. Through Scott's efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly.

25|$|In {{accounting}} for historical changes, David Lempert's {{work in the}} early 1980s introduced a time dimension and a political <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> curve, showing how population and politics interact with economic inequality over time, leading either to long-term stability or to collapse. This neo-Malthusian model incorporating Kuznets' work, yields a helix model of the relationships over time rather than just a plane curve.|$|E
25|$|Recently, a {{large body}} of {{scientific}} research deals with the background of autoimmune disease, the cause of many rheumatic disorders. Also, the field of osteoimmunology has emerged to further examine the interactions between the immune system, joints and bones. Epidemiological studies and medication trials are also being conducted.

25|$|The Klein bottle, proper, {{does not}} self-intersect. Nonetheless, {{there is a}} way to {{visualize}} the Klein bottle as being contained in four dimensions. By adding a fourth <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional space, the self-intersection can be eliminated. Gently push a piece of the tube containing the intersection along the fourth dimension, out of the original three-dimensional space. A useful analogy is to consider a self-intersecting curve on the plane; self-intersections can be eliminated by lifting one strand off the plane.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, {{historian}} John Regan, in his paper, The Bandon Valley Massacre Revisited, {{argued that}} the killings might be best understood in light of purported IRA fears that the British were planning a reoccupation of the south of Ireland and was a preemptive move against people {{believed to have been}} informers. Regan {{argued that the}} selective use of evidence by Peter Hart to emphasize the sectarian <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> killings highlights a wider problem in the politicization of Irish history.|$|E

Prince Charles then added another <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the Crown and First Nations when, in a speech in Vancouver, he drew a connection between his own personal interests and concerns in environmentalism and the cultural practices and traditions of Canada's First Nations.|$|E
25|$|Mozart {{introduced}} the newly invented clarinet {{into the chamber}} music arsenal, with the Kegelstatt Trio for viola, clarinet and piano, K. 498, and the Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet, K. 581. He also tried other innovative ensembles, including the quintet for violin, two violas, cello, and horn, K. 407, quartets for flute and strings, and various wind instrument combinations. He wrote six string quintets for two violins, two violas and cello, which explore the rich tenor tones of the violas, adding a new <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> string quartet conversation.|$|E
25|$|Brandeis was {{becoming}} increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and {{the trend toward}} bigness in American industry and finance. He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans. Although the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was enacted in 1890, {{it was not until}} the 20th century that there was any major effort to apply it.|$|E
