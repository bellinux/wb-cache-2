40|$|According to {{the current}} {{situation}} in emergency management of the low utilization and slow search for <b>emergency</b> <b>document</b> knowledge result to the efficiency in making decisions. This paper aims {{to solve the problem}} of difficult in searching needed knowledge in emergency management. F rom the perspective of knowledge system engineering, this paper conduct s an in-depth study on knowledge-mined model of emergency documents and offer s an alternative for decision-makers to locate and use <b>emergency</b> <b>document</b> knowledge more quickly and efficiently by <b>emergency</b> <b>document</b> knowledge modeling based on knowledge element. This modeling process includes the analysis of physical and logical structure, the navigation link based on knowledge element and the knowledge reasoning and retrieval. The physical analysis aims to extract the metadata and structure the documents; the logical analysis intends to classify the knowledge element into three types, namely the event-based knowledge element, the subject-based knowledge element, and the task-based knowledge element; and the navigation link targets at establishing the link between the knowledge and the structured document. At last, we propose a prototype of emergency knowledge decision supporting system for verifying the validity of its application, of which the results indicate that the modeling approach is both practical and effective. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{consistency}} {{review of}} accident analyses in US Department of Energy (DOE) safety, environmental, and <b>emergency</b> planning <b>documents</b> is presented. The range of and key differences in driving assumptions used in accident definition and frequency assessment, radiological source term generation, and atmospheric transport and fate modeling across recent environmental impact statements (EISs) and <b>emergency</b> planning <b>documents</b> {{and the effects}} of these differences on results are summarized. Considerable variation in both the assumptions and the underlying level of conservatism is shown to exist. Recommendations are made for source term generation and assumed meteorological conditions to reduce inconsistencies without being overly prescriptive. Recommendations also are made to improve consistency in assessing the frequencies of various generic accident sequences traditionally analyzed in EIS and <b>emergency</b> planning <b>documents.</b> All recommendations are shown to be consistent with currently applicable DOE guidance...|$|R

50|$|Following {{calls from}} the {{government}} of South Sudan, Uganda deployed its troops to Juba to assist in securing the airport and evacuating Ugandan citizens. On 21 December a flight of three US Air Force V-22 Osprey aircraft en route to evacuate US nationals from Bor took small arms fire from the ground, injuring four Navy SEALs. South Sudan blamed the rebels for the incident. A second evacuation attempt by four UN and civilian helicopters succeeded in evacuating about 15 US nationals, Sudanese-Americans and those working in humanitarian operations, from the United Nations base in Bor on 22 December. Although the base was surrounded by 2,000 armed youths, a rebel commander had promised safe passage for the evacuation. In total 380 officials and private citizens as well as about 300 foreign citizens were flown to Nairobi. The United States military announced a repositioning of its forces in Africa to prepare for possible further evacuations as the United Nations warned of the planned strikes. Many of these reports {{have come from the}} hundreds of foreign oil company employees gathered at the airport to leave. Five Ugandan and ten Kenyan citizens were also evacuated from Bor and then Juba before leaving the country.
