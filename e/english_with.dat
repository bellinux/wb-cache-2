40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to find out the correlation between 1) students’ habit in watching <b>English</b> films <b>with</b> <b>English</b> subtitles and speaking skill; (2) students’ grammatical competence and speaking skill; and (3) students’ habit in watching <b>English</b> films <b>with</b> <b>English</b> subtitles and grammatical competence simultaneously to speaking skill. The research used correlational method. The research was conducted at English Education Department of Sebelas Maret University. The sample was 30 from the population of 88 sixth semester students. The instruments to collect the data were in the forms of questionnaire and test. The questionnaire was used to collect the data of students’ habit in watching <b>English</b> films <b>with</b> <b>English</b> subtitles while the tests were used to collect the data of students’ grammatical competence and speaking skill. The techniques which were used in analyzing the data were Simple Correlation and Multiple Regression Correlation. The result shows, (1) there is a positive correlation between students’ habit in watching <b>English</b> films <b>with</b> <b>English</b> subtitles and speaking skill (rx 1 y = 0. 511); (2) there is a positive correlation between students’ grammatical competence and speaking skill (rx 2 y = 0. 73), and (3) there is a positive correlation between students’ habit in watching <b>English</b> films <b>with</b> <b>English</b> subtitles and grammatical competence to speaking skill simultaneously (Ry 12 = 0. 76). It means the increase of students’ habit in watching <b>English</b> films <b>with</b> <b>English</b> subtitles and grammatical competence, either separately or simultaneously, will be followed by the increase of the students’ speaking skill.

5|$|By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was {{incorporated}} into England and was given an administrative system like the <b>English,</b> <b>with</b> counties policed by sheriffs. English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes. After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, and many were protected by extensive walls.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} two {{mechanisms to}} procure differentiated goods: {{a request for}} quote and an <b>English</b> auction <b>with</b> bidding credits. In the request for quote, each seller submits a price and the inherent quality of his good. Then the buyer selects the seller who offers the greatest difference in quality and price. In the <b>English</b> auction <b>with</b> bidding credits, the buyer assigns a bidding credit to each seller conditional upon {{the quality of the}} seller’s good. Then the sellers compete in an <b>English</b> auction <b>with</b> the winner receiving the auction price and his bidding credit. Game theoretic models predict the request for quote is socially efficient but the <b>English</b> auction <b>with</b> bidding credits is not. The optimal bidding credit assignment under compensates for quality advantages, creating a market distortion in which the buyer captures surplus {{at the expense of the}} seller’s profit and social efficiency. In experiments, the request for quote is less efficient than the <b>English</b> auctions <b>with</b> bidding credits. Moreover, both the buyer and seller receive more surplus in the <b>English</b> auction <b>with</b> bidding credits. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the {{dominant}} {{language of the}} country. It was derived largely from Old <b>English,</b> <b>with</b> the addition of elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century. It {{was adopted by the}} ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline.|$|E

5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. <b>English,</b> <b>with</b> its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
