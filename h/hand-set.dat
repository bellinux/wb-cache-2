40|$|For precise {{satellite}} navigation, {{the reception}} {{of more than one}} frequency band of the whole GPS/Galileo spectrum is required. However, interference from different sources like <b>hand-sets,</b> base-stations for mobile communications or military and civil aircraft radars is a permanent threat for the receiver. Consequently, large errors in positioning can arise. This is a serious problem and not acceptable in safety-of-life applications like aircraft landing. To minimize the impact of interferers, suitable steep bandpass filters or multiplexers with low insertion loss can be employed in the front end between the antenna and the LNA. A better way, however, is to avoid the additional expenditure and realize bandpass and stopband functions in the antenna design, which also reduces the noise figure of the whole receiver. This paper presents different broadband and narrowband antenna developments for multifrequency navigation receivers and a new concept to integrate a diplexer function directly in the antenna. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{usability}} {{of mobile}} portals {{has been a}} major stum-bling block since the advent of the mobile Internet and WAP <b>hand-sets.</b> Indeed poor usability is cited as a major contributing factor to the poor take-up of mobile Internet services amongst consumers. A key problem relates to {{the amount of time that}} users spend navigat-ing to content as they browse mobile portals. Recent advances in personalization technology have the potential to solve this problem, and today a number of leading operators already provide their users with access to intelligent portals that are automatically personalized based on subscriber usage patterns. In this paper, we examine this so-called personalized navigation technology and propose ways in which it may be enhanced by combining structural properties of a mobile portal (such as the distance to content sites) with the access probabilities of users. We demonstrate that although such distance factors have proven successful in Web personalization, they are less beneficial when it comes to the personalization of mobile portals. ...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 64). Grameenphone is the leading company in the mobile telecommunication industry of Bangladesh. It has been successful to build a superior image {{in comparison to the}} other operators. In other words, GP has a clear advantage over the competitors. Grameenphone has some additional features in comparison to its competitors. It is playing a vital role to increase the subscribers of Grameenphone. Another important thing is that GP users are mostly satisfied with the initial price of GP connections and <b>hand-sets.</b> Because, before GP’s introduction to the market, mobile phones were totally out of reach to the major part of the current market. Moreover, Grameenphone subscribers are happy with the country-wide network. But overall, GP users are not satisfied with service of the company. Many important factors are acting as reasons behind this overall dissatisfaction. Grameenphone connections are not always available. The Grameenphonecenters are very important for some after-sales services. But, these have shortage of capacity. GP Subscribers need to spend significant amount of time to reach the customer care. Behavior of the Customer Manager is satisfactory. For customer managers it is too tough to handle a large numbers of subscribers with a smiling face continuously.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{navigation}} receivers for safety-of-life (SoL) applications requires {{the system to}} be robust against interference coming from several different sources, such as <b>hand-sets</b> and base stations for mobile communications, and radars. One way to minimize the effects introduced by such interferers is to place a filter with low insertion loss between the antenna and the low-noise amplifier (LNA). In order to increase robustness, the antenna itself can be designed to be narrow-band, so that only low power levels in the out-of-band region are received. In order to receive only the L 1 band of the Galileo system (1. 565 – 1. 585 GHz), a narrow-band antenna may be used. This paper describes the design of an active microstrip antenna array that is under development with this frequency-selective characteristic. The geometry of the single antenna is composed of a square patch, which {{is located at the}} top of the multilayer structure, the slots, which are in the middle, and the feeding system, which is at the bottom. During the design process of this antenna, several parameters can be used to obtain a good matching inside the band of interest and a strong reflection (low gain) outside of it. A 90 °-hybrid has been integrated in order to generate circularly polarized waves. The variation of the gain in the band of interest is about 0. 6 dB. At the region of GSM, the rejection is at least 14 dB, which is higher than it would be obtained with an ordinary microstrip antenna. The antenna described above will be used in a 2 x 2 array, where each patch will be connected to an LNA. In order to compensate for the differences of the S-parameters of the used amplifiers, a calibration is necessary. For this purpose, a directional coupler has been integrated at the output of the 90 °-hybrid. It will be used to couple the calibration signal to the input of the active part. The structure described above is under construction at the moment and a better description will be given in the final version of this paper and in the conference. Also, a study of the radiation properties of the 2 x 2 array under different beamforming conditions will be presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} robust {{navigation}} systems requires {{the receiver to}} be nearly immune against interference coming from several different sources, such as <b>hand-sets</b> and base stations for mobile communications, and military radars. One way to minimize the effects introduced by such interferers is to place pass-band filters with low insertion loss between the antenna and the low-noise amplifier (LNA). In order to increase robustness, the antenna itself can be designed to operate only in the desired bands, so that only low power levels in the out-of-band region are received. In order to receive the signals in the E 5 a-E 5 b and L 1 bands of the European Galileo system, a dual-band antenna may be used. Several topologies presenting multi-band characteristics have been already proposed in the literature. In some of the cases, the antennas do not present strong rejection in the out-of-band region. Moreover, most of them present only one output, where the signals received in all desired bands are present. For navigation systems, circularly polarized (CP) antennas with high polarization purity should be employed {{in order to reduce}} the positioning errors caused by multi-path. One way to obtain CP microstrip antennas is by using geometry-perturbation techniques, which is effective only for very narrow-band applications. One of the drawbacks is that the CP purity is strongly dependent on the fabrication tolerances. Another way is by designing microstrip patches that operate with two orthogonal modes simultaneously and with its outputs connected to power splitter that introduces a 90 ° phase shift between its two outputs. For dual-band CP antennas, this splitter is normally optimized at a frequency between both desired bands. For this reason, the CP purity of the antenna is not optimum in the bands of interest, since the performance of the splitter degrades for frequencies other than the one for which it has been optimized. This paper presents a novel microstrip antenna capable of separating the E 5 A-E 5 b and the L 1 bands of the European Galileo system in two different isolated ports. With this feature, one 90 °-hybrid is needed in each port to receive right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) waves in each of the aforementioned bands. For this reason, the hybrids can be optimized to operate in the center frequency of each band, hence resulting in an improvement of the axial ratio. Moreover, since the antenna separates already the signals received at each frequency band, the two bands can be processed separately already right after the antenna. Since no diplexer is needed to separate the signals received in the E 5 a-E 5 b and L 1 bands, volume, weight and cost are reduced in comparison to conventional solutions. In the final version of the paper, the geometrical details of the proposed antenna will be depicted. Simulated and measured results will be shown and discussed. The simulations performed up to now show that the radiation pattern presents nearly the same shape in the two frequency bands of interest. Moreover, due to a proper selection of the employed dielectric materials, the radiation pattern obtained is broad, which is important for receiving the signals coming from satellites passing near the horizon. At the zenith (90 ° of elevation), the simulations showed that the antenna presents a gain larger than 4 dBi. For an elevation angle of 5 °, the computed gain is larger than - 5 dBi. Further details about this antenna will be discussed in the final paper and in the conference. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{increasing}} demand of high data rate mobile broadband communication, newer standards increasingly employ spectrally efficient high order modulation schemes, which lead to large peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) of transmitted signals. To drive down the cost and form factor, {{a significant portion of the}} active circuitry in today’s commercial handsets is implemented in silicon CMOS technology – except for the power amplifier (PA). Silicon technology comes with low breakdown voltage, however, limiting the output power of the PA. Recent work has shown that series-connection of Si FETs (the “Stacked-FET” technique) can overcome the breakdown issue of silicon CMOS FETs to implement high power PAs. This can enable the use of scaled CMOS technology nodes which are optimized for digital logic circuits, to implement high performance PAs. The PAs, moreover, can make use of the digital circuits available to produce compact integrated circuits that are less dependent on microwave matching techniques than their counterparts. This work investigates the design and implementation of high output power, digitally-intensive PA CMOS architectures and their extensions for wireless transmitters that are highly efficient, even for signals with high peak-to-average ratio. In the first part of this work, a digitally modulated PA (DPA) is implemented in polar architecture on 180 nm CMOS SOI technology. The amplitude modulation input signal is a 10 -bit digital word controlling the number of active unit cells – each unit cell being a stacked FET PA. The DPA is also driven by a constant amplitude phase modulated (PM) signal centered at RF. The demonstrated DPA provides output power of 1. 45 W at 900 MHz with drain efficiency of 65. 9 %. The power and efficiency are adequate for use in cellular handsets for 3 G and 4 G standards. The DPA can transmit WCDMA and LTE signals at 900 MHz and is functional from 800 MHz to 2. 4 GHz with different matching networks. This DPA is a multi-band, multi-standard PA and is used as a building block for additional designs in this work. The back-off efficiency enhancement of PA is critical to efficiently transmit signals of high PAPR from <b>hand-sets.</b> In the second part of the work, two identical DPAs are used to implement a digitally modulated Doherty power amplifier (DDPA). This part of the work investigates the challenges and develops the techniques for achieving strong efficiency peaking in output power back-off for CMOS Doherty PAs at microwave frequencies. The output combiner needed within the Doherty architecture is realized using surface-mount components on a printed circuit board (PCB). Digital AM signals to both DPAs are independently provided as inputs. The phase difference between RF PM inputs of main and peaking DPAs can also be varied. The peak output power of CMOS DDPA at 900 MHz is > 2 W (highest reported in the literature) with drain efficiency of 55. 5 %, while at 6 dB back-off the drain efficiency is 52. 6 %. The back-off efficiency and its improvement relative to class-B is highest reported in the literature for any CMOS Doherty implementation. The DDPA is demonstrated to transmit 5 MHz 64 -QAM OFDM signal with very good linearity of ACPR better than - 35. 9 dB and EVM of 3. 8 %. For applications like femto-cell base-stations, where the power needed is large, technologies like Gallium Nitride (GaN) work better than silicon because of superior voltage handling. The challenge here lies in efficiently driving the GaN FETs. The DPA developed in this work can provide large enough voltage to directly drive the input of GaN FET, thanks to the use of FET stacking. A novel architecture is demonstrated in which the CMOS DPA drives the GaN FET, which is connected as a common gate stage, with no inter-stage matching. The GaN FET in turn drives a 50 Ω load directly. The absence of any impedance matching network (with its associated bandwidth limitation) makes this PA wideband. Key design aspects of this architecture, including bandwidth limitation caused by circuit parasitics, are discussed in this work. A digitally controlled PA with a combination of CMOS and GaN (Mitsubishi Electric 0. 75 μm process) is demonstrated. The CMOS-GaN PA operates over a 2. 4 : 1 frequency range for 1 dB output power variation (500 MHz to 1. 2 GHz); output power varies from 2. 4 W to 3 W with efficiency between 48 % to 74 %. This PA is demonstrated to transmit 5 MHz, 64 QAM signal at various frequencies. These characteristics make this amplifier a candidate for application in femtocells and microcells...|$|R
