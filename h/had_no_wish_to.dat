5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimatum}} {{contributed to}} the general atmosphere of tension and fear in Europe. It relieved {{some of the pressure}} on Germany that had arisen {{in the aftermath of the}} Anschluss and tested the Soviets' willingness to defend their interests in Eastern Europe. Fears were expressed, both in Lithuania and abroad, that the establishment of diplomatic relations was not the only goal of Warsaw and that more far-reaching ultimata might follow. Speculations arose that Poland might seek to resurrect the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, using Germany's annexation of Austria as a precedent. Poland announced that it planned to create a neutral bloc comprising Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania to counter both fascism and communism. It stated that it <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> incorporate Lithuanian territories and maintained that the bloc would be formed on the basis of bilateral non-aggression and economic treaties. According to The New York Times, the impact of the ultimatum was felt on Wall Street; on March 17, the foreign currency and bond markets sagged, in some cases reaching the lowest points seen in several years. These markets recovered on March 19, after the ultimatum was accepted.|$|E
25|$|Roberts was {{approached}} for advice about the Ulster Voluntary Force, formed in January 1913 by Ulstermen who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{be part of}} a Home Rule Ireland. Too old himself to take active command, Roberts recommended Lieutenant General Sir George Richardson, formerly of the Indian Army, as commander.|$|E

25|$|In 1833 {{and again}} in 1850 bills were passed by the Virginia {{legislature}} to encourage free black emigration to Liberia. The funds were not available however to newly manumitted slaves as the legislature <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> encourage emancipation. The bill was partially funded by a yearly tax of one dollar on all male free blacks between 21 and 55 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Muti {{has been}} a regular and popular guest {{conductor}} with the New York Philharmonic. The orchestra's musicians had reportedly been interested – {{towards the end of}} the tenures of Kurt Masur and Lorin Maazel, and before Muti took the Chicago post – in having the conductor as their music director, but Muti stated that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> take on the position.|$|E
25|$|Omar {{learns that}} Marlo had framed {{him and was}} {{the one he had}} robbed at the card game. Omar demands that Proposition Joe help him rob Marlo, and Joe agrees to alert Omar when Joe's soldier Cheese is {{dropping}} off Marlo's package. Omar orchestrates an elaborate and successful hijacking of Joe's entire shipment of heroin as it enters port. As he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> sell drugs on the street, he sells the heroin back to Proposition Joe. Although the heist makes Omar a lot of money, it has all of the drug kingpins ready to put a contract on his head.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, Ormonde {{lived in}} {{retirement}} at Cornbury in Oxfordshire, a house lent {{to him by}} Lord Clarendon, but emerged in 1687 to offer opposition at {{the board of the}} Charterhouse to James's attempt to assume the dispensing power and force upon the institution a Roman Catholic candidate without taking the oaths. Ormonde also refused the king his support in the question of the Indulgence; James, to his credit, refused to take away his offices, and continued to hold him in respect and favour to the last. Despite his long service to Ireland he admitted that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> spend his last years there.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 1911, {{the army}} {{garrison}} in Wuhan mutinied, sparking a widespread revolt in the Yangtze river valley and beyond, demanding {{the overthrow of}} the Qing dynasty which ruled China since 1644. The strongman of late imperial China, General Yuan Shikai, was dispatched by the court to crush the revolution, which he was unable to do, as by 1911 public opinion had turned decisively against the Qing, and many Chinese <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> fight for a dynasty which was seen as having lost the Mandate of Heaven. Puyi's father, Prince Chun, served as a regent until 6 December 1911 when Empress Dowager Longyu took over following the Xinhai Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{military}} aid continued after their withdrawal, and massive quantities of food, fuel, ammunition and military equipment {{was given to}} the government. Varennikov visited Afghanistan in May 1989 to discuss ways and means to deliver the aid to the government. In 1990 Soviet aid amounted to an estimated 3 billion United States dollars. As it turned out, the Afghan military was entirely dependent on Soviet aid to function. When the Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, Najibullah turned to former Soviet Central Asia for aid. These newly independent states <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see Afghanistan being taken over by religious fundamentalists, and supplied Afghanistan with 6 million barrels of oil and 500,000 tons of wheat to survive the winter.|$|E

25|$|In 132, the Emperor Hadrian {{threatened}} to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to Jupiter, called Aelia Capitolina. Some {{of the leading}} sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion (and, for a short time, an independent state) led by Simon bar Kochba; some, such as Rabbi Akiva, believed Bar Kochba to be messiah, or king. Up until this time, a number of Christians were still part of the Jewish community. However, they did not support or {{take part in the}} revolt. Whether because they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> fight, or because they could not support a second messiah in addition to Jesus, or because of their harsh treatment by Bar Kochba during his brief reign, these Christians also left the Jewish community around this time. Traditionally, it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish–Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.|$|E
25|$|Further acrimonious {{correspondence}} followed, {{the result}} of which was that the NBR declined to improve the Methil docks, while Wemyss threatened, {{for the time being}} in vain, to build an additional dock facility himself. However, in the 1905 Parliamentary session he deposited a Bill for a Wemyss Dock at Buckhaven. The Lords Committee refused the preamble, on the grounds of his undertaking to the NBR, and that no-one else was precluded from taking the necessary steps. In the following year the NBR, stung into action by the finding, presented a proposal themselves but it ran out of time for the 1906 session and was deposited in April 1907. At the same time, Wemyss, possibly suspecting tactical play, submitted a modified version of his own scheme, while stating that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> proceed with it if the NBR would itself improve Methil.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1940s, the major US explosive manufacturers, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and Hercules, had several decades of experience of manufacturing trinitrotoluene (TNT) and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> experiment with new explosives. US Army Ordnance held the same viewpoint and wanted to continue using TNT. RDX had been tested by Picatinny Arsenal in 1929 and it was regarded as too expensive and too sensitive. The Navy proposed to continue using ammonium picrate. In contrast, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), who had visited The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, did not share the view that new explosives were unnecessary. James B. Conant, chairman of Division B, wished to involve academic research into this area. Conant therefore set up an Experimental Explosives Research Laboratory at the Bureau of Mines, Bruceton, Pennsylvania, using Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) funding.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch {{garrison}} of Recife {{was increased}} in March 1640 by 2,500 soldiers carried aboard 28 ships under Amidrals Cornelis Jol and Jan Lichthart, {{who was in}} charge of naval operations to disrupt the Portuguese sugar trade. In December Portugal revolted against the Spanish Habsburg rule, proclaiming the seventh Duke of Bragança as King João IV in place of Philip IV of Spain. Although the Dutch welcomed the news of the revolt, expecting the Portuguese to become their allies, this did not happen, as the Dutch <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> restore the occupied territories to Portugal. Recife served as base for an expedition under Jol and Lichthart, in 1641, to seize Portugal's slaving depots in Angola before any treaty could be concluded in Europe, and despite a ten-year truce between both countries that was signed on 12 June, the hostilities continued, resulting in the expulsion of the Dutch from Brazil in 1654.|$|E
25|$|Of further {{interest}} {{is that the}} caliph of Baghdad had attempted to instigate a war between the Mongols and the Shah some years before the Mongol invasion actually occurred. This attempt at an alliance with Genghis was made because of a dispute between Nasir and the Shah, but the Khan {{had no interest in}} alliance with any ruler who claimed ultimate authority, titular or not, and which marked the Caliphate for an extinction which would come from Genghis' grandson, Hulegu. At the time, this attempt by the Caliph involved the Shah's ongoing claim to be named sultan of Khwarezm, something that Nasir <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> grant, as the Shah refused to acknowledge his authority, however illusory such authority was. However, it is known that Genghis rejected the notion of war as he was engaged in war with the Jin Dynasty and was gaining much wealth from trading with the Khwarezmid Empire.|$|E
25|$|When Clarke {{arrived in}} Bangkok on 18 February on the HMS Valiant (commanded by Admiral Alfred Ryder), Newman {{came on board}} to report {{that there has been}} no change in the situation. It was clear that Newman and the Consul's staff were on the side of Vichaichan and had wanted to support him against the King. They {{suggested}} to Clarke that Vichaichan should be sent to British Burma for his own safety. On 20 February Chulalongkorn formally gave audience to Clarke at the Grand Palace; the meeting took over three hours. During the meeting Clarke assured the king that {{he had no intention of}} interfering in the dynastic conflict of the House of Chakri, but he was determined to reaffirm the King's power over the Kingdom's finances and military against that of Vichaichan's powers. The Governor asked the king to dictate his terms in full. The king also gave reassurance to Clarke that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> harm Vichaichan, and displayed a conciliatory disposition towards his royal cousin. Afterwards the king asked Clarke to put the terms on paper.|$|E

25|$|The Cabinet Minister Jan Christiaan Smuts and the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had {{contemplated}} appointing to Kiggell's job, {{were sent}} on a five-day mission to France {{coinciding with the}} Lovat Fraser article. On the first evening they met Haig at GHQ and assured him that Lloyd George <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> replace him, although they had in fact been tasked by the Prime Minister on 18 January “to find out who are the rising men” amongst the British generals. Hankey wrote that “the atmosphere of complaisant optimism that formerly pervaded GHQ” was now “conspicuous by its absence”, that general opinion was that the US Army would not be ready for a major offensive before 1920, {{and that there was}} open talk, in which Haig participated, of a compromise peace, Haig being worried about the danger of France or Italy collapsing and believing that Britain had already gained more from the war than other powers and risked being left exhausted compared to the USA. Hankey also recorded that officers had been angered by the Lovat Fraser article. Over the next few days Hankey and Smuts took discreet soundings among the Army Commanders to see whether any of them were willing to replace Haig - none of them were. The only possibility seemed to be Claud Jacob, GOC II Corps. Hankey formed the opinion that nobody important amongst the British generals thought a major German attack likely.|$|E
