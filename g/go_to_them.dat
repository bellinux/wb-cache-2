[...] The NHL's owners supported the concept after agreeing {{that half of the}} proceeds from the games would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Some teams remained uneasy, however. [...] The Philadelphia Flyers were afraid their players might suffer injuries in the tournament and vowed that no player from their roster would be permitted to play. [...] They were convinced to back down on their threats after being promised two games would be played in Philadelphia with the Flyers receiving their share of the revenue. Though the tournament was held in September so as not to interfere with the NHL season, league president Clarence Campbell remained skeptical of the tournament's viability, calling it [...] "wasteful".|$|E

2500|$|Midwifery-led {{continuity}} of care is where one or more midwives have the primary responsibility for the {{continuity of}} care for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from [...] "medical-led care" [...] where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In [...] "shared-care" [...] models, responsibility may be shared between a midwife, an obstetrician and/or a family physician.

2500|$|The {{series has}} two protagonists: witty [...] "thirty-something" [...] mother Lorelai Gilmore and her {{academic}} teenage daughter Rory. Their backstory is established {{early in the}} show: Lorelai grew up in Hartford with her old money parents, Richard and Emily, but always felt stifled by this environment. She accidentally became pregnant at age sixteen, and left home a year later to raise Rory in the close-knit town of Stars Hollow. Lorelai found work and shelter at the Independence Inn, where she eventually progressed from maid to executive manager. Lorelai and Rory develop a very close relationship, living like best friends, and Lorelai is proud of the independent life she has formed away from her parents. In the pilot episode, she is forced to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> when Rory is admitted to Chilton Preparatory School but she cannot afford the tuition fees. Emily and Richard agree to provide a loan, {{so long as the}} girls join them every Friday night for dinner. This sets up the show's primary conflict, as the Gilmores are forced to face their differences and complicated history. The contrasting mother–daughter relationships of Emily–Lorelai and Lorelai–Rory become a defining theme of the show. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has summarised the core of Gilmore Girls: ...|$|E
