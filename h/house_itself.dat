5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period tended {{to be built in}} the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. The <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E

5|$|Bordered by the Cowley Road, {{this site}} was {{formerly}} Nazareth House, a residential care home convent — Goldie Wing (shown left) and Larmenier House are its surviving buildings. Nazareth <b>House</b> <b>itself</b> was demolished {{to make room for}} two purpose-built halls of residence, James Mellon Hall (shown right) and David Paterson House. The two new halls were opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 November 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Roseberys' {{house party}} would leave Dalmeny and tour {{towns and cities}} across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the {{speakers}} often addressing vast crowds {{from the back of}} an American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings have been described as something between a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny <b>House</b> <b>itself,</b> the public were treated to a great firework display.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground floor level has a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band exists on the second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the sills.|$|E
5|$|The barn {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} soft brick that makes up {{the exterior of the}} home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the <b>house</b> <b>itself,</b> was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E

5|$|The listed {{building}} consent application for the demolition was recommended for approval although some concerns were raised regarding {{the proposed new}} constructions, which were to be detailed in a separate application. Other applications made at the time, for the demolition of other buildings on the site and for the refurbishment and change of use of the <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> were also recommended for approval.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} Public Trustee, who put Linwood House up for sale as four {{sections}}, {{with one of those}} holding the <b>house</b> <b>itself.</b> Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction, including the one containing the building. Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903). Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named 'Chaddesden', and Cowlishaw Street and Chaddesden Lane are named after the family.|$|E
5|$|Osea was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact French Polynesia during the season; Cyclone Martin had impacted the islands a few weeks earlier. In {{the aftermath of the}} storm, disaster aid was delivered to the victims of Osea. President Gaston Flosse, accompanied by technicians, arrived in Maupiti to help repair the island's electrical and hydraulic systems. A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used as an emergency shelter, though the <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> sustained minor damage from the storm. The name Osea was later retired from the South Pacific list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

5|$|Several {{geographic}} {{features are}} named after Patrick Cleburne, including Cleburne County in Alabama and Arkansas, {{and the city}} of Cleburne, Texas. The location where he was killed in Franklin, Tennessee was reclaimed by preservationists and is now known as Cleburne Park. Though the small monument in the park is often perceived as a monument to Cleburne, it actually is a marker to show where The Carter Family Cotton Gin once stood (the gin being {{an integral part of the}} Battle of Franklin, and The Carter <b>House</b> <b>itself</b> being the headquarters of Union Brigadier General Jacob D. Cox).|$|E
5|$|Several old {{building}}s, which {{date from}} the 1880s, remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the hydraulic engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic engine <b>house</b> <b>itself.</b> It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery, installed in 1907 by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, which powers the dock's hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks. The former pattern-maker's shop and stores {{date from the}} same period and are grade II listed, as are the Patent slip and quay walls.|$|E
5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E
40|$|Last week, Stewart Smyth {{outlined}} {{recent developments}} in Social Housing policy up to the Comprehensive Spending Review. In this follow-up article he looks to the future, arguing that lack of access, not lack of <b>housing</b> <b>itself,</b> is a crucial problem. He further highlights how the issue runs deeper still; until we treat houses as homes, and not as stores of wealth, the contradictions in housing policy cannot be solved...|$|R
25|$|In {{some cases}} the <b>housing</b> <b>itself</b> varied in quality as – perhaps harking back to the Cheap Cottages Exhibition 60 years before – various {{different}} construction methods were tried, including the pre-fabrication of some houses at a shipyard in Sunderland. This resulted in dwellings with large amounts of internal space, but of variable build quality (particularly, it is alleged, for houses whose panels were constructed on Friday afternoons). Other parts of the estate used more traditional methods.|$|R
50|$|Considered a {{low point}} in the {{democratic}} process, the 1973 elections were followed by {{an amendment to the}} constitution that abolished legal appeals to the Privy Council in London. After consolidating power on the legal and electoral fronts, Burnham turned to mobilizing the masses for what was to be Guyana's cultural revolution. A program of national service was introduced that placed an emphasis on self-reliance, loosely defined as Guyana's population feeding, clothing, and <b>housing</b> <b>itself</b> without outside help.|$|R
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic {{in their use of}} this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture.|$|E
5|$|Clevedon Court is on Court Hill east of {{the town}} centre, close to the road to Bristol. It {{is one of only}} a few {{remaining}} 14th century manorial halls in England, having been built by Sir John de Clevedon circa 1320. Since the early eighteenth century the house has been owned by the Elton family, who were responsible for much building work on the house and many improvements in the town, and although the <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> is now owned by the National Trust, the associated estates are still owned by the Elton family. Sir Edmund Elton (1846–1920) was a potter who produced unusually shaped ware in a variety of richly-coloured glazes, including a gold glaze of his own invention, at the Clevedon Elton Sunflower Pottery.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Wilmington, North Carolina on May 23, 2012 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios, with the working title Caged Heat. Cinematographer John Toll opted {{to for the}} first time in his career work with digital cameras, as he found them more {{convenient}} for a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film primarily on the Arri Alexa camera. From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in Cary, North Carolina at the Epic Games headquarters and SAS Institute, with a large Christmas tree set up on the front lawn. A scene was also shot at the Wilmington International Airport. The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation of the dock. The crumbling <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> was filmed in a hydraulic-powered giubo platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had practical effects, including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.|$|E

Modern top category apartments with central heating were a complete novelty for them. This has been cited as {{one of the reasons for}} the ensuing devastation of the housing stock in Chánov - as people were unable to make good use of the modern apartments, they thus adapted them to how they thought they should be.|$|R
5|$|Hart House Theatre is the university's student amateur theatre, {{generally}} producing {{four major}} plays every season. As old as Hart <b>House</b> <b>itself,</b> the theatre {{is considered a}} pioneer in Canadian theatre for introducing the Little Theatre Movement from Europe. It has cultivated numerous performing-arts talents, including Donald Sutherland, Lorne Michaels, Wayne and Shuster and William Hutt. Three members of the Group of Seven painters (Harris, Lismer and MacDonald) have been set designers at the theatre, and composer Healey Willan was director of music for fourteen productions. The theatre also hosts annual variety shows run by several student theatrical companies at the colleges and academic faculties, {{the most prominent of}} which are U.C. Follies of University College, Skule Nite of the Faculty of Engineering, and Daffydil of the Faculty of Medicine, the latter in its hundredth year of production in 2010–2011.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the site}} of Noel Park was {{virtually}} uninhabited. The 1619 Earl of Dorset's Survey of Tottenham shows the area as forming the historic Duckett's (Dovecote) Manor; as {{with the rest of}} the Moselle valley, the land consisted almost entirely of woodland and pasture, with the only building shown in the area which was to become Noel Park being Dovecote <b>House</b> <b>itself,</b> dating from 1254 and the earliest recorded property in Wood Green. The small village of Wood Green itself is shown a short distance to the north-east. The manor itself was situated on the ancient arterial road of Green Lanes. The last recorded occupancy of the manor was in 1881, shortly before the site was cleared for the construction of Noel Park.|$|E
5|$|The Fuller Houses are two {{historic}} {{homes at}} 339-341 and 343-345 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Constructed in 1896-1897, the two Queen Anne-styled homes were constructed as rental properties for the Fuller family and {{are believed to}} have originally been identical in construction. The -story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front staircase and a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from the <b>house</b> <b>itself.</b> For the National Register of Historic Places nomination only a single unit was examined, but the identical unit below is believed to have undergone minimal alterations. The other house, 343-345 Broadway, was not surveyed, but has been more seriously modified to allow for four apartment units. The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as well-preserved and well-detailed Queen Anne-styled apartment flats. The Fuller Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
25|$|The NTSB {{found that}} there was a fatigue crack in the power control module, and that it was not {{possible}} to visually inspect that type of failure. The lower rudder control module's cast metal housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was an unusual failure since most failures are of internal components rather than the <b>housing</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Housing</b> <b>itself</b> is {{a spatial}} {{phenomenon}} {{that has been}} linked with the subjective perception of shelter, security, comfort and desire (Alexander 1985). The individual home is a comfortable environment {{that is associated with}} intimate and relaxing behaviour shaped in specific size and type of spaces to enhance the spatial and social interaction (Chandhoke 2003). The residential unit has been recognised as a reciprocal interaction between the physical space, social life and interests of the householders, which have been rooted in peace, faith and purity (Philips 2008).|$|R
50|$|In {{many other}} {{countries}} the supply and load terminals are in the meter <b>housing</b> <b>itself.</b> Cables are connected directly to the meter. In some areas the meter is outside, often on a utility pole. In others, it is inside the building in a niche. If inside, it may share a data connection with other meters. If it exists, the shared connection is often a small plug near the post box. The connection is often EIA-485 or infra-red with a serial protocol such as IEC 62056.|$|R
