5|$|Taqiya ("dissimulation") was {{practiced by}} some Bábís. It was {{justified}} {{by some as}} a response to the often violent oppression the community faced.

5|$|The {{battle was}} the first {{engagement}} between the Israelis and Palestinians, in which the latter used suicide bombers. Files released by the IDF in 2011 contradict the official Israeli narrative, which claimed that the operation {{was carried out in}} retaliation for the bus incident. The files revealed that the IDF began planning the two operations in 1967, one year before the bus incident. They also revealed that the IDF <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> crossing the Jordan River in 1966, while Jordan still controlled the West Bank.|$|E
5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than {{a few of his}} earliest students <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} only about a quarter <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception of}} Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{operation}} approached, training became more intensive. Glider units spent hours aloft every day circling over airfields as they practiced the manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to the bridges over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles. The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture the bridges over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective. The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of scale models of the zones and the primary objectives, such as the bridges and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the correct speed and height over the scale models, realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.|$|E

25|$|Just {{two years}} after Vasco da Gama reached India by sea, the Portuguese {{realized}} that the prospect of developing trade such as that which they <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> in West Africa had become an impossibility, due to the opposition of Muslim merchant elites in the western coast of India, who incited attacks against Portuguese feitorias, ships and agents, sabotaged Portuguese diplomatical efforts, and led the massacre of the Portuguese in Calicut in 1500.|$|E

25|$|Contacts between Asia and the West already dated back {{hundreds}} of years, especially between the Papacy and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Numerous traders – most famously Marco Polo – had traveled between {{eastern and western}} Eurasia. Christianity was not new to the Mongols, as many <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> Christianity of the Church of the East since the 7th century (see Christianity among the Mongols). However, {{the overthrow of the}} Mongol Yuan Dynasty by the Ming in 1368 resulted in a strong assimilatory pressure on China's Muslim, Jewish, and Christian communities, and outside influences were forced out of China. By the 16th century, there is no reliable information about any practicing Christians remaining in China.|$|E
25|$|The {{only person}} {{actually}} tried was Castner Hanway, a European-American man. On 15 November 1851 he was tried for liberating slaves {{taken into custody}} by U.S. Marshal Kline, {{as well as for}} resisting arrest, conspiracy, and treason. Hanway's responsibility for the violent events was unclear. He was reported {{as one of the first}} on the scene where Gorsuch and others of his party were attacked, and he and his horse provided cover for Dickerson, Gorsuch and Dr. Pearce, who were wounded. The jury deliberated 15 minutes before returning a Not Guilty. Among the five defense lawyers, recruited by the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, was U.S. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, who <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> law in Lancaster County since at least 1838.|$|E
25|$|J.

Garfield {{after he had been}} shot. Sims does have a controversial medical past. Under the beliefs at the time about pain and the prejudice towards African people, he <b>had</b> <b>practiced</b> his surgical skills and developed skills on slaves. These women were the first patients of modern gynecology. One of the women he operated on was named Anarcha, the woman he first treated for a fistula.|$|E
