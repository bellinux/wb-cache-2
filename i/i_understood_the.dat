The Foundation is a non-profit organization that grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions. On his personal website, Parker states: [...] "I already knew Make-A-Wish as it is very famous {{around the world and}} I have previously taken part in the granting of wishes by meeting children and their families. I decided to commit to working with Make-A-Wish France when <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> true dedication there and I realized that I could help to grant as many wishes as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I think I’ve {{always been}} a seeker. All during Fanny I was reading books that really appealed to me – on Buddhism; all the forms of Hindu asceticism; Chinese Tao; Japanese forms of discipline, both {{physical}} and mental; Sufism; Gurdjieff; Madame Blavatsky; Paramahansa Yogananda; Alan Watts; Carl Jung; Chinese poetry; and so on. What has seemed to take the greatest hold is Buddhism, particularly the Tibetan style. As I’ve learned so often during discourses, {{it all depends on}} one’s karmic predisposition. Mine seems to be constantly investigating, although once <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> four Noble Truths in conjunction with the Eightfold Path and actually experienced moments of no consciousness; slowly, my life was transformed. Before that, I had a deep feeling of hopelessness. These practices haven’t been easy but pretty brutal to go through in many instances.|$|E

[...] That same year, she {{appeared}} in an episode Empire, playing Pepper O'Leary, [...] "a tough criminal who shared a cell for years with Cookie Lyon." [...] In preparation for the role, she hired an acting coach and stated, [...] "I prepared for this like I've never prepared for anything in my career, because I didn't want to disappoint and <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> pace at which they work." [...] O'Donnell also appeared as herself in two documentaries that same year. In April 2015, Roseanne For President! was released, a film about Roseanne Barr's presidential bid in 2012. O'Donnell appeared in the film alongside Michael Moore and Sandra Bernhard. In September 2015, the documentary Everything Is Copy was released, a film by Jacob Bernstein about his mother Nora Ephron.

[...] "T.W.L" [...] was written for Kanjani Eight {{to be used for}} the Shin-chan anime and upon news of hearing that Kitagawa had penned the song for them, there was a mutual excitement among the band. Tadayoshi Ohkura had said, [...] " [...] I really like the song, T.W.L, that {{was written by}} Yuzu's Kitagawa Yujin. [...] When I found out that Yuzu had wrote the song, I was extremely excited and yelled [...] " [...] Oh!!! [...] ". When I heard the demo tape, I had instantly liked the song. [...] ". Shota Yasuda had said, [...] " [...] I don't know the meaning behind the title for T.W.L. I don't know the reason (behind it), hahaha! When I first heard the song, I was able to honestly get it. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> lyrics. [...] " [...] He later stated on the DVD making that T.W.L stood for the word [...] "towel". This could be confirmed {{by the fact that the}} animated version of band wave towels throughout the video for the song.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in The Life-Giving Church. Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in [...] "cumbersome systems" [...] in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its [...] "brightest and best future leaders". Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even {{to the point of}} disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. In Haggard's book, Primary Purpose, he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This [...] "Philippians 2 Attitude" [...] comes from the scripture that states, [...] "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others." [...] "I took a free-market approach to that and just wanted to empower people to minister whatever was in their hearts." [...] Some of the best-known results of this model are the Mill, the Desperation Band and Desperation interns, the Furnace and World Prayer Center, 24/7 leadership training and New Life Groups, a unique brand of free-market small groups as well as many others. As an example of his coaching of young leaders, John Bolin, in the book Confident Parents, Exceptional Teens that he co-wrote with Haggard, says [...] " [...] talked about communicating with people by improving my posture, poise, and delivery. He painstakingly coached me to stand up tall, to speak with confidence, to look people in the eye, and to articulate with concise clarity... he knew I wouldn't be effective... unless <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> principle of communication and connection by presenting myself well".|$|E
2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But as we say in Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E
