500|$|Though Wenger has {{established}} Arsenal as UEFA Champions League regulars, {{he has yet}} to win the European Cup, or translated his domestic success in other continental competitions – often considered a blemish on his managerial career. Writer Michael Calvin argues despite the European failings, Wenger should still be considered one of the greats in football: [...] " [...] <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> most influential manager of the modern era. His job has involved managing change, and all the hypocrisy which comes with that. In a world where incoherence is routinely hailed as innovation, he has been a true visionary". Wenger's stubbornness to follow his idealistic vision of football has been heavily criticised during his second decade at Arsenal. In 2016, Henry Winter reasoned the Frenchman's methods no longer gave him an advantage over others, and he needed to adapt or resign. Winter also suggested the club was content with lucrative top-four finishes, and the manager needed tough individuals to challenge him. Ferguson however expressed admiration in Wenger's consistency and obstinate nature: [...] "He stays with what he believes in. And I think people who do that are outstanding coaches".|$|E

500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Major League Baseball {{introduced}} the Trevor Hoffman National League Reliever of the Year Award, which is awarded annually {{to the top}} reliever in the NL. [...] Hoffman became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame starting in 2016. In his debut, he fell short of the 75 percent of votes required for entry, but the 67.3 percent he received {{in his first year}} was promising for possible induction in the future. [...] No career reliever has reached Cooperstown on the first ballot, and only six relievers have been inducted. In 2017, Hoffman received 74 percent of the vote, falling five votes short of induction. Lee Smith, the all-time saves leader for 12 years before he was surpassed by Hoffman, was not inducted in 2017 in his 15th and final year on the ballot. Buster Olney of ESPN says any discussion of Hoffman's deficiencies in the postseason and All-Star Games are small samples compared to his incredible body of work over 18 years. [...] Zimniuch wrote that Hoffman and Rivera are [...] "the best of the best of the one-inning closers". Less than 10 percent of Hoffman's saves were over one inning. Closers as a whole have been criticized for pitching almost exclusively in the ninth inning with no runners on base, while star relievers previously were called firemen, entering games in the middle of innings with runners on base and capable of pitching multiple innings. Saves arguably became overrated as firemen gave way to closers. However, Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2007 proposed that 500 saves (let alone 600) would be enough for him to validate Hoffman's induction if Sutter was invited with his 300 career saves. Moreover, Hoffman might have accumulated much more than 601 saves had he played for more successful teams. During his tenure in San Diego, the Padres won at least 90 games only twice and had nine losing seasons, including five with no more than 70 wins. Hall of Fame voter Dan Graziano of the Newark Star-Ledger said, [...] "I don't think much of the save as a stat, but I'm looking at a guy who's been a lockdown closer for more than a decade. Closers are a real and important part of the game, and either he or Rivera <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> one for the past decade." [...] Some opponents of Hoffman's induction, including Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports and Keith Law of ESPN.com, maintain that his limited innings mitigate his impact compared to starting pitchers who have not been inducted, while Joe Posnanski of NBC Sports and writer Joe Sheehan posit that those starters could have excelled as closers, but Hoffman would not have succeeded as a starter. Hoffman pitched [...] innings in his career, which tops only Sutter (1,042) among pitchers already inducted in the Hall of Fame.|$|E
