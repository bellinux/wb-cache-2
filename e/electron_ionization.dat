25|$|Gas samples, or {{volatile}} samples, can be ionized using {{methods such as}} <b>electron</b> <b>ionization,</b> photoionization, {{and chemical}} ionization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>ionization</b> (EI) in mass {{spectrometry}} requires samples that are small molecules, volatile, and thermally stable, {{similar to that}} of gas chromatography. This ensures that as long as GC is performed on the sample before entering the mass spectrometer, the sample will be prepared for ionization by EI.|$|E
25|$|Different {{types of}} ion source result in {{different}} arrays of fragments produced {{from the original}} molecules. An <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> source produces many fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons), whereas an electrospray source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions that are frequently multiply charged. Tandem mass spectrometry purposely produces fragment ions post-source and can drastically change the sort of data achieved by an experiment.|$|E

These {{are the first}} <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> data for any Si-like ion uncontaminated by an unknown metastable fraction.

40|$|Absolute total <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> {{cross-sections}} {{have been}} measured and calcu-lations performed for C 1 to C 4 perfiuorocarbons, C 1 to C 5 chlorocarbons {{and a number}} of mixed halo carbons and nitriles. Measured and calculated cross-sections using sev-eral different models have been analyzed using empirically and theoretically determined functions in terms of fundamental molecular parameters. A series of bond contribu-tions to the total <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> cross-section have been determined and shown to reproduce total cross-sections for all of the molecules investigated {{with a high degree of}} confidence. An instrument has been constructed for the measurement of pseudo-absolute par-tial <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> cross-sections using the NIST standard mass spectrum database as a reference. Measurements were carried out for CF 4, C 2 F 6, C 3 Fs, C 3 F 6, F 2 C=CF-CF=CF 2 and F 3 C-C=C-CF 3 Theoretical models of <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> cross-sections have been critically assessed and a correction factor has been devised and applied to the binary encounter Bethe model of <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> resulting in a significant improvement in the performance of that model such that it can now be used for molecules comprising of atoms in rows 1 to 4 of the periodic table with a high degree of confidence. Ion imaging has been applied for the first time to crossed-beam <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> in an attempt to measure angular scattering patterns and energy disposal in a one step process. The instrument and the ion imaging process are described in detail and preliminary results reported in this thesis. A feasibility study has been carried out on the use of a capacitance manometer II to measure neutral molecular beam fluxes directly and recommendations made for the future development of a usable device...|$|R
25|$|Hard {{ionization}} {{techniques are}} processes which impart high quantities of residual {{energy in the}} subject molecule invoking large degrees of fragmentation (i.e. the systematic rupturing of bonds acts to remove the excess energy, restoring stability to the resulting ion). Resultant ions tend to have m/z lower than the molecular mass (other than {{in the case of}} proton transfer and not including isotope peaks). The most common example of hard ionization is <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> (EI).|$|E
25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E
25|$|The {{interface}} between a liquid phase technique (HPLC) with a continuously flowing eluate, and a gas phase technique {{carried out in}} a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of electrospray ionization changed this. Currently, the most common LC-MS interfaces are electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These are newer MS ion sources that facilitate {{the transition from a}} high pressure environment (HPLC) to high vacuum conditions needed at the MS analyzer. Although these interfaces are described individually, they can also be commercially available as dual ESI/APCI, ESI/APPI, or APCI/APPI ion sources. Various deposition and drying techniques were used in the past (e.g., moving belts) but the most common of these was the off-line MALDI deposition. A new approach still under development called direct-EI LC-MS interface, couples a nano HPLC system and an <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> equipped mass spectrometer.|$|E
30|$|The {{new model}} also {{includes}} processes {{that were not}} included in the previous work: charge exchange reactions between protons and neutral atoms, and <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization.</b> The <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> reactions and the charge exchange reactions between the neutral exospheric atoms and the solar wind plasma play in an important role in the formation of the Martian plasma boundaries, in particular the magnetic barrier (Jin et al., 2006). This shows the necessity to implement exospheric processes.|$|R

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{clusters}} were obtained in seeded supersonic conical jet expansions of organic molecules. It was shown that mixed clusters probably are formed statistically in the collisional region of the expansion, although kinetic effects cannot be excluded. The molecular fragmentation in the clusters upon mass selection using <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> is negligible, which makes the use of supersonic jet expansions under cluster forming conditions a valuable addition to standard mass spectrometry analytical techniques. The effect of the <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization</b> on cluster fragmentation was studied. ...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "hard ionization" [...] {{process of}} <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> can be {{softened}} by the cooling of the molecules before their ionization, resulting in mass spectra that are richer in information. In this method named cold <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> (Cold-EI) the molecules exit the GC column, mixed with added helium make up gas and expand into vacuum through {{a specially designed}} supersonic nozzle, forming a supersonic molecular beam (SMB). Collisions with the make up gas at the expanding supersonic jet reduce the internal vibrational (and rotational) energy of the analyte molecules, hence reducing the degree of fragmentation caused by the electrons during the ionization process. Cold-EI mass spectra are characterized by an abundant molecular ion while the usual fragmentation pattern is retained, thus making Cold-EI mass spectra compatible with library search identification techniques. The enhanced molecular ions increase the identification probabilities of both known and unknown compounds, amplify isomer mass spectral effects and enable the use of isotope abundance analysis for the elucidation of elemental formulae.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>ionization</b> and {{chemical}} ionization {{are used for}} gases and vapors. In chemical ionization sources, the analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. Two techniques often used with liquid and solid biological samples include electrospray ionization (invented by John Fenn) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI, initially developed as a similar technique [...] "Soft Laser Desorption (SLD)" [...] by K. Tanaka for which a Nobel Prize was awarded and as MALDI by M. Karas and F. Hillenkamp).|$|E
2500|$|By far {{the most}} common and perhaps {{standard}} form of ionization is <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> (EI). [...] The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the ion trap itself in an ion trap MS) where they are bombarded with free electrons emitted from a filament, not unlike the filament one would find in a standard light bulb. [...] The electrons bombard the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic and reproducible way. [...] This [...] "hard ionization" [...] technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and few, if any, molecules approaching the molecular mass unit. [...] Hard ionization is considered by mass spectrometrists as the employ of molecular electron bombardment, whereas [...] "soft ionization" [...] is charge by molecular collision with an introduced gas. [...] The molecular fragmentation pattern is dependent upon the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70 eV (electron Volts). [...] The use of 70 eV facilitates comparison of generated spectra with library spectra using manufacturer-supplied software or software developed by the National Institute of Standards (NIST-USA). Spectral library searches employ [...] matching algorithms such as Probability Based Matching and dot-product matching that are used with methods of analysis written by many method standardization agencies. Sources of libraries include NIST, Wiley, the AAFS, and instrument manufacturers.|$|E

5000|$|Low fragmentation: Only a {{small amount}} of energy is {{transferred}} during the ionization process (compared to e.g. <b>electron</b> impact <b>ionization),</b> therefore fragmentation is suppressed and the obtained mass spectra are easily interpretable.|$|R
2500|$|The {{coupling}} of chromatography with MS is a {{well developed}} chemical analysis strategy dating back from the 1950s. Gas chromatography (GC) - MS was originally introduced in 1952, when A.T. James and A.J.P Martin were trying to develop tandem separation - mass analysis techniques. In GC, the analytes are eluted from the separation column as a gas and the connection with <b>electron</b> <b>ionization</b> (EI) or chemical ionization (CI) ion sources in the MS system was a technically simpler challenge. Because of this, the development of GC-MS systems was faster than LC-MS and such systems were first commercialized in the 1970s. The development of LC-MS systems took longer than GC-MS and was {{directly related to the}} development of proper interfaces. V.L. Tal'roze and collaborators started the development of LC-MS in the early 1970s, when they first used capillaries to connect LC columns and MS ion sources. A similar strategy was investigated by McLafferty and collaborators in 1973. This was the first and most obvious way of coupling LC with MS, and was known as the capillary inlet interface. This pioneer interface for LC-MS had the same analysis capabilities of GC-MS and was limited to rather volatile analytes and non-polar compounds with low molecular mass (below 400 Da). In the capillary inlet interface, the evaporation of the mobile phase inside the capillary {{was one of the main}} issues. Within the first years of development of LC-MS, on-line and off-line [...] alternatives were proposed as coupling alternatives. In general, off-line coupling involved fraction collection, evaporation of solvent, and transfer of analytes to the MS using probes. Off-line analyte treatment process was [...] time consuming and there was an inherent risk of sample contamination. Rapidly, it was realized that the analysis of complex mixtures would require the development of a fully automated on-line coupling solution in LC-MS.|$|E
