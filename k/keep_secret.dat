In the wake of the Japanese counterattack, the members of the Australian and American staff began working more closely together and reinforcements were quickly approved {{in the form of the}} 26th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier David Whitehead, as well as a squadron of Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion– whose presence the Australians sought to <b>keep</b> <b>secret</b> for as long as possible– which were landed at Langemak Bay.

Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).|$|E

Winston Churchill personally issued an order for their destruction into pieces no larger than a man's hand, to <b>keep</b> <b>secret</b> that the British were capable of cracking Lorenz SZ cyphers (from German rotor stream cipher machines) during the oncoming cold war.

Jean does not know about the blocked spring, only of a more distant one, and is relying on rainfall to fill a cistern with water for supplying livestock and irrigating crops. The distant spring, where an old Italian couple lives, is [...] away and also part of the property. Jean believes the needs of the farm can be met from here.

United States District Court for the District of Columbia (2005), a case concerning whether Vice President Dick Cheney could <b>keep</b> <b>secret</b> {{the membership of}} an advisory task force on energy policy. Scalia was asked to recuse himself because he had gone on a hunting trip with various persons including Cheney, during which he traveled one way on Air Force Two. Scalia issued a lengthy in-chambers opinion refusing to recuse himself, stating that though Cheney was a longtime friend, he was being sued merely in his official capacity and that were justices to step aside {{in the cases of}} officials who are parties because of official capacity, the Supreme Court would cease to function. Scalia indicated that it was far from unusual for justices to socialize with other government officials, recalling that the late Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson played poker with President Harry Truman and that Justice Byron White went skiing with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Scalia stated that he was never alone with Cheney during the trip, the two had not discussed the case, and the justice had saved no money because he had bought round-trip tickets, the cheapest available. Scalia was part of the 7–2 majority once the case was heard, which generally upheld Cheney's position. Scalia later described his refusal to recuse himself as his [...] "most heroic opinion" [...] because it had exposed him to a great deal of criticism.|$|E
