5|$|Steph later begins feuding with Summer Shaw (Summer Strallen), who {{was after}} a career in show business, {{everything}} she previously wanted. When Max split up with Steph, she was heartbroken. After a talk they decided they would both <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> go, and Steph asked him to meet her for lunch. Niall made sure Max thought that he and Steph had an affair. This resulted in Max and Steph splitting up once more. They reconciled, but the doubts continued. When Steph was at The Loft with Niall and Nancy, she saw Max with another girl and {{decided to make a}} move of her own — grabbing Niall and kissing him passionately.|$|E
25|$|After the Bulls' final {{title of}} the Jordan era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> chance with the Lakers. Longtime friend of Krause and Bulls {{assistant}} coach Tex Winter, who was {{the architect of the}} triangle offense, stayed with the Bulls for another full season, leaving the organization in the summer of 1999, when Phil Jackson was hired to coach the Los Angeles Lakers. Krause said that he had not spoken to Jackson since. When Jordan was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009, Krause was not in attendance. Krause said he would not attend the ceremony because of his personal boycott of the Hall of Fame over their refusal to induct Winter. Krause and Jackson briefly put their differences aside when Winter was finally inducted two years later. The two shook hands before the ceremony and conducted themselves in a cordial manner during Winter's segment.|$|E
25|$|The Nets {{were in the}} mix {{prior to}} the season to be contenders in the Eastern Conference {{alongside}} the Miami Heat. Pierce and Garnett were set to be the 'supporting cast' to Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Brook Lopez. However, with Lopez going down with a season-ending injury in December, Pierce was entrusted with the starting power forward spot. As the season moved along and the Nets continued to struggle, doubt began to creep around the locker room, front office, and fan base. That's when the Nets saw revitalization in Pierce's game and his never-say-die attitude. After scrapping past the Toronto Raptors {{in the first round}} of the playoffs thanks to a last-second block from Pierce in Game 7, their attempt to get past the Heat and win a championship fell short. They lost to Miami in five games in the second round, and questions began to linger about whether Pierce would <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> year in Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|In Mick's absence, Linda hires a new bar manager, Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) and {{agrees with}} Shirley {{to sell the}} Vic's {{freehold}} in order to solve their financial problems. Mick returns and walks in on Whitney and Woody in bed after having sex. He then punches Woody and throws him out. He later learns that Shirley and Linda sold the freehold of the Vic {{behind his back and}} forged his signature, and turns to alcohol to deal with the stress. He also learns that Max Branning (Jake Wood) set up the deal, and confronts him, branding him a snake and warning him to stay away from him. He then kisses a vulnerable Whitney who responds. Shirley learns of the kiss and tells Whitney to pack her bags and leave. When Mick learns that Shirley did this, he drunkenly throws a glass at her, but instantly regrets it and cries, saying he no longer knows himself. Mick tells Linda about the kiss on her return but is then left devastated when she tells him they're over. Later, Linda agrees to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> go but when Mick admits he made a failed attempt to pay Whitney off with £200, it earns him a hard slap across the face from 'L'. Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner) reveals her mum's suicide to Mick and when she tries to kiss him, he pushes her away. Following a reconciliation and Switzerland holiday, Mick leaves Linda for not revealing her cancer to him first and lying about the length of her mum's illness. Next day they get back together.|$|E

[...] When she called the company to ask for assistance, they were delighted because [...] "they wanted to see Chanel on a young girl to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> point of view," [...] showing it as a brand for [...] "not just middle-aged women in suits, but youthful and funky." [...] Calvin Klein rounds out Andrea's wardrobe.|$|E
500|$|Jacques's biographer, Francis Gray, {{highlighted}} {{two aspects}} of the actress's abilities; in her appearances in the sequence of post-war Dickens adaptations (Nicholas Nickleby, Oliver Twist, Scrooge and Pickwick) Jacques [...] "reflected her talent for larger-than-life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity", while in other films, such as Mother Riley Meets the Vampire, she displayed [...] "a broader comic mode". In her later career Jacques showed [...] "a comic talent of extraordinary versatility. In Sykes her performance {{had to be a}} foil for the main character; in the Carry Ons she blossomed". As a singer she was also praised; Jonathan Cecil of The Spectator said that her [...] "bell-tone voice with its cut-crystal diction—perfect for radio—had an edge of pain which suggested a greater depth to her talents than she was generally allowed to express". The actor Neville Phillips, who toured with Jacques, described her as having a [...] "pretty voice" [...] and able to [...] "take an innocuous old Victorian or Edwardian ballad and with just a few intonations and expressions <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> meaning entirely".|$|E

500|$|On 13 April 1943 the {{committee}} of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel John Bevan – the head of London Controlling Section, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – {{that he needed to}} obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who was in bed, wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the Cabinet War offices and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects that could go wrong, including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that [...] "in that case we shall have to get the body back and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> swim". Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower's headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} month of release many stability, registration, and billing issues hurt public {{perception}} of the game. Some gaming reporters claimed {{it was the worst}} launch of an MMO {{in the history of the}} genre. Funcom spent about 6 months fixing the game, particularly the beginning experience. [...] The company then took the [...] "fixed game" [...] on a press tour to convince reporters to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> try, even though reviews and scores had been printed months before. At the same time, the company needed to build subscribers, which was very difficult given the reputation of the game. Funcom introduced the first [...] "free trial" [...] of the game and gave out returned boxed copies for free at the 2002 Game Developer's Conference. Some gaming publications informed their readers of the improved game, although they did not change their original scores. By the end of that year, Anarchy Online had recovered from the launch woes and won the MMO of the Year award from PC Gamer. The company went on to create expansions, including the Shadowlands expansion in 2003 that earned several Editor's Choice awards.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy when I could let it go. I didn't <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> thought when it was done." ...|$|E

You miss it. I can still perform at a high level. [...] I’m still a big, strong man. I would like to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> shot.

2500|$|With many of {{the stories}} he had planned for America's Best Comics brought to an end, and with his {{increasing}} dissatisfaction with how DC Comics were interfering with his work, he decided to once more {{pull out of the}} comics mainstream. In 2005, he remarked that [...] "I love the comics medium. I pretty much detest the comics industry. <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> <b>another</b> 15 months, I'll probably be pulling out of mainstream, commercial comics." [...] The only ABC title continued by Moore was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen; after cutting ties with DC he launched the new League saga, , in a co-publishing partnership of Top Shelf Productions and Knockabout Comics, the first part released in 2009, the second in 2011 and the third released in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|No longer {{managed by}} Howard Wolf, Eddie Haddad set the band up touring {{military}} bases across the U.S., Europe and Japan non-stop.
