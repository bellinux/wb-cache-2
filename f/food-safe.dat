The starch in the peanuts comes from crop-based sources rather than petroleum-based polystyrene, and is non-toxic. One of the first brands of biodegradable peanuts, Biofoam, is made from the grain sorghum; other brands are made from corn starch. Biodegradable foam peanuts have no electrostatic charge, another benefit over polystyrene. Being biodegradable and nontoxic, they are also safe for humans and pets if ingested accidentally. However, they are not produced in <b>food-safe</b> conditions, and are not recommended for eating. Also, during the manufacturing process, the nutritional value is removed from starch-based packing peanuts. This removes edible components, such as sugars, that would otherwise attract rodents and bugs. Their main drawbacks compared with polystyrene are lower resilience, higher weight (6.5 to 13 g per litre/0.4 to 0.8 lb per cubic foot), dust creation, and higher price. Starch-based peanuts are soluble in water, and polystyrene peanuts are soluble in acetone, but not vice versa.

30|$|Bacillus subtilis is a <b>food-safe</b> microorganism, {{which has}} been used to food {{fermentation}} {{for a long period of}} time (Song et al. 2015). Several gene expression systems have been developed for high-level production of heterologous proteins such as amylase (Chen et al. 2015 a, b), lysozyme (Zhang et al. 2014), protease (Degering et al. 2010), and lipase (Lu et al. 2010). However, few reports are concerned with application of recombinant B. subtilis directly to food processing. One important reason is that most vectors (mainly based on antibiotics) used in this systems are not food-grade. Food-grade expression systems have been widely developed and investigated for lactic acid bacteria. Such systems require that the resultant strains should only contain materials from <b>food-safe</b> microorganisms, and no antibiotic resistance marker can be utilized. Usually, food-grade selection markers can be classified as dominant markers or complementation markers (de Vos 1999). Compared with dominant markers, selection markers based on complementation do not require supplements in the cultivation medium. In order to develop a food-grade complementation-based system, usually a gene on the host chromosome is mutated or deleted, and a wild type copy is inserted into the expression vector. The alanine racemase gene dal is involved in the conversion of d-alanine and l-alanine (Bron et al. 2002), and d-alanine is not a common ingredient of large-scale fermentation media (Nguyen et al. 2011); the dal gene thus has considerable potential as a food-grade selection marker in B. subtilis.|$|E

To develop a food-grade expression system for d -psicose 3 -epimerase production, we use an alanine racemase-encoding gene as selection marker in Bacillus subtilis. Results In this study, the d -alanine racemase-encoding gene dal was deleted from the chromosome of B. subtilis 1 A 751 using Cre/ lox system to generate the food-grade host. Subsequently, the plasmid-coded selection marker dal was complemented in the food-grade host, and RDPE was thus successfully expressed in dal deletion strain without addition of d -alanine. The selection appeared highly stringent, and the plasmid was stably maintained during culturing. The highest RDPE activity in medium reached 460 U/ml at 720 h which was comparable to RDPE production in kanamycin-based system. Finally, {{the capacity of the}} food-grade B. subtilis 1 A 751 D 2 R was evaluated in a 7. 50 l fermentor with a fed-batch fermentation.

This review highlights {{the features of the}} Flp-FRT system, describes current bacterial genetic methods incorporating this technology and, finally, suggests potential future uses of this system. In combination with improved allele replacement methods, recyclable FRT mutagenesis cassettes, whose antibiotic resistance markers can be excised from the chromosome in vivo, are useful for the rapid construction of multiple, unmarked mutations in the same chromosome, and thus aid in the generation of live vaccine strains or <b>food-safe</b> bacteria. The high-specificity of the Flp-FRT system makes it also applicable for manipulation of whole genomes, including in vivo cloning of large genomic segments. Integration-proficient vectors, from which antibiotic resistance markers and replication functions can be evicted after integration of the desired sequences into the chromosome, are useful for the construction of strains destined for environmental release, e. g. strains used as biosensors or for bioremediation. Although the Flp-FRT system is extremely efficient and easy to use, its true potential in bacterial genetics has not yet been fully exploited. On the contrary, in many instances this technology is probably greatly underutilized, especially in gram-positive bacteria...|$|E

A central question is: does the current approach, premised on the ability to separate a ‘disease free’ commercial sector from areas at high risk of FMD outbreaks because of the presence or proximity of wildlife (African buffalo particularly) through strictly enforced protection (formerly known as ‘buffer’) zones and movement control, make sense given new contexts and challenges?

Due to the important applications of TGase in food industry, obtaining robust and <b>food-safe</b> TGase-producing strains has {{attracted much attention}} during the past decade. In this study, Streptomyces hygroscopicus pro-TGase was efficiently expressed and secreted by a food-grade host, Yarrowia lipolytica, without antibiotic markers. Results: The pro-TGase gene was cloned into integrative vectors pINA 1296 (monocopy) and pINA 1297 (multicopy), and was used to transform the Y. lipolytica Po 1 g or Po 1 h strain, respectively. Expression was driven by a recombinant hp 4 d promoter and secretion obtained using a XPR 2 pre-sequence as a signal peptide. The highest yield of extracellular pro-TGase produced by the recombinant Po 1 h strain corresponded to 5. 3 U/mL of TGase, a level 8. 8 fold higher than that obtained using the recombinant Po 1 g strain. Asparagines in two potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites (Asn 160 and Asn 355) from pro-TGase were mutated to glutamine individually or simultaneously, yielding the deglycosylated variants N 160 Q, N 355 Q, and N 160 Q/N 355 Q.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Hazelnuts are {{commonly}} consumed raw and are valued for their numerous health benefits and antioxidant properties. Increased foodborne illness outbreaks associated with Salmonella and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 contamination of tree nuts and peanuts generate {{a need for}} improving agricultural sanitation procedures. <b>Food-safe</b> chemical sanitizers have shown promise for reducing pathogenic organisms on fresh produce, but minimal {{research has been conducted}} for in-shell nuts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of water and three <b>food-safe</b> sanitizers on a) the natural microbial load of postharvest in-shell hazelnuts and b) populations of pathogenic Salmonella (S. enterica subsp. enterica ser. Panama) inoculated and dried onto the surfaces of in-shell hazelnuts. The first phase of the study investigated the effectiveness of water, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl; 25 ppm, 50 ppm), peroxyacetic acid (PAA; 80 ppm, 120 ppm), and acidified sodium chlorite (ASC; 990 ppm) as sanitizers for use on postharvest in-shell hazelnuts. Treatments were applied to two groups of freshly harvested hazelnut samples to examine their effects on total aerobic microorganism populations during different times of harvest (Group 1 = early season, dry weather; Group 2 = late season, rainy weather). Treatments within each group included hazelnuts that underwent a tap water rinse, a tap water rinse followed by a water spray, and a tap water rinse followed by a chemical spray. Due to excess soil attached to shell surface, hazelnuts harvested later in the season (Group 2) had an initial population mean 2. 24 log CFU/hazelnut greater than hazelnuts harvested earlier in the season (Group 1). All treatments, including water, resulted in significant population reductions compared to untreated controls (P≤ 0. 05). Rinsing with tap water produced reductions of 0. 38 log units in both groups, and additional water spraying resulted in reductions of 0. 83 and 0. 73 log units in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. None of the chemical treatments were significantly more effective than the water spray treatment in Group 1; however, several chemical treatments in Group 2 were significantly more effective than water spraying. Tight adherence to shell surfaces during dry weather may have increased the chemical resistance of microorganisms on hazelnuts. Treatment with ASC produced the greatest reduction in Group 1 and Group 2 compared to the control (1. 22 and 2. 08 log units, respectively) and water spray treatments (0. 39 and 1. 39 log units, respectively), but the efficacies varied between treatment groups. Wide variation between Group 1 and Group 2 treatment results made determination of chemical efficacy difficult. The second phase of the study analyzed the effectiveness of water, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl; 25 ppm, 50 ppm), peroxyacetic acid (PAA; 80 ppm, 120 ppm), and acidified sodium chlorite (ASC; 450 ppm, 830 ppm, 1013 ppm) as sanitizers for reducing Salmonella on in-shell hazelnuts. Hazelnut samples were soaked in pure cultures of S. Panama for 24 h, air dried for 66 h, and then sprayed with water and chemical treatments. Surviving S. Panama populations were evaluated using a non-selective medium (tryptic soy agar), followed by a selective overlay (xylose lysine deoxycholate agar) after a 3 h incubation period. Tight adhesion prevented significant population decreases from physical removal by water, which allowed for clear demonstration of chemical effectiveness. All of the chemical treatments significantly reduced the S. Panama population (P≤ 0. 05) compare to untreated and water-sprayed samples. The most effective concentrations of ASC, PAA, and NaOCl treatments resulted in mean microbial population reductions of 2. 65, 1. 46, and 0. 66 log units, respectively. Overall, physical removal of excess dirt appeared to have the greatest effect on the microbial population reductions of postharvest in-shell hazelnuts, and adherence to shells during dry weather appeared to increase the chemical resistance of microorganisms. Future sanitation experiments should consider weather and levels of excess soil on hazelnuts as factors in the apparent efficacy of chemical sanitizers. Testing chemical sanitizers against tightly-adhered Salmonella cells provided consistent results with clear demonstration of chemical efficacies. Acidified sodium chlorite at 1013 ppm was significantly more effective at reducing Salmonella populations than other treatments and shows the greatest potential for use as a postharvest sanitation treatment. Thorough rinsing of hazelnuts in clean tap water, followed by spraying with high concentrations of acidified sodium chlorite could help increase the efficacy of current hazelnut processing...|$|E

M. tuberculosis {{must be able to}} control this latent even in response to nitrosative and oxidative stress conferred by the host. It is not well known how M. tuberculosis controls this state. One possibility for this control is through its eleven eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases. Our lab has focused research on two eukaryotic-like ser/thr protein kinases, PknA and PknB. It has been found that PknA expression may affect the stability or the assembly of the proteasome complex, which is essential for M. tuberculosis to persist in mice. This work shows that PknA phosphorylates the α subunit and the unprocessed Β subunit of the M. tuberculosis proteasome, and that this direct effect arrests the proteasome assembly at the half- proteasome stage. Furthermore this effect confers resistance in Mycobacterium smegmatis to oxidative stress. The significance of this research is that it potentially elucidates one way that M. tuberculosis is able to persist in host cells, because it shows an effect of PknA on a protein complex that is necessary for resistance to nitrosative stress, and whose lack confers resistance to oxidative stress. Part 2 : L-threonine is the second-most deficient amino acid in livestock, and its addition to livestock feed will create healthier animals and a cleaner environment. Corynebacterium glutamicum is a Grade-A <b>food-safe</b> microorganism that is used for the industrial production of amino acids, which makes it ideal for creating an over-producing strain of threonine. A key enzyme in the pathway for threonine production in C. glutamicum is homoserine kinase (thrB). Homoserine kinase is competitively inhibited at the active site by threonine, which makes it difficult to relieve feedback inhibition through mutation. This work shows that at the entry of the active site of homoserine kinase there is a conserved alanine residue. We propose that mutation of this residue could relieve feedback inhibition. The significance of this research is that it provides a novel approach for relief of feedback inhibition, since we attempted to genetically separate the catalytic activity and feedback inhibition in the active site of homoserine kinase. This approach may be applied later to other amino acid production in C. glutamicum and other amino acid over-producing organisms...|$|E

WhitworthDry-cured ham is {{protected}} from infestations of Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Sarcoptiformes: Acaridae) with the fumigant methyl bromide. Developing feasible alternatives to methyl bromide is necessary {{due to the}} phase out of methyl bromide. The effectiveness of <b>food-safe</b> compounds for preventing infestations of T. putrescentiae on dry-cured hams was evaluated by dipping ham pieces in solutions of various food additives. Propylene glycol (1, 2 -propanediol), lard, ethoxyquin and butylated hydroxytoluene prevented or significantly reduced mite population growth. A combination of carrageenan + propylene glycol alginate + 40 % propylene glycol was effective in reducing mite numbers on treated whole-aged hams compared with untreated hams. Dose/response tests with twelve registered residual insecticides were conducted to assess contact toxicity to T. putrescentiae. Three of these insecticides were evaluated for persistence over a 2 -month period on different surfaces. Commercial formulations of deltamethrin plus chlorpyrifos-methyl, chlorfenapyr, and malathion showed promising results for contact toxicity against T. putriscentiae. Chlorfenapyr applied to metal, concrete, and wood resulted in 100 % mortality of treated ham mites for up to 8 weeks. The effect {{of high and low}} temperatures on mortality of T. putrescentiae was studied in the laboratory. Groups of 10 eggs and groups of a mixture of 40 adults and nymphs were separately exposed to several high and low temperatures, ranging from[*]+ 35 to 45 °C and from − 20 to[*]+ 5 °C, for several time periods. Eggs were found to be more tolerant to both high and low temperatures compared with adults and nymphs. Results showed that high temperatures from 40 - 45 °C killed all T. putrescentiae eggs, adults, and nymphs within 4 - 1 d, while − 10 °C or lower killed all the same stages in less than 1 d. Combinations of the fumigant sulfuryl fluoride (SF) applied under high temperatures ranging from 25 - 40 ºC, were studied to determine the highest temperature, shortest exposure time, and the lowest value of a concentration-by-time product (CTP) of SF against T. putrescentiae. Results showed that complete control of all life stages of T. putrescentiae was achieved at 40 ºC with SF. More than one day of exposure was required to kill adults and nymphs and eggs at 40 ºC at a CTP close to the EPA labeled rate of 1500 gh. m⁻³. Results indicated that adults and nymphs were more susceptible to SF compared to eggs.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from 2017 - 06 - 26 to 2018 - 06 - 26 There is growing evidence that humans and other animals can taste certain starch hydrolysis products, namely, maltooligosaccharides (MOS), and that their detection is independent of the known sweet receptor, T 1 R 2 /T 1 R 3. The overall goal {{of this study was}} to further investigate the taste perception of low degree-of-polymerization (DP) MOS in humans. However, research in this area is limited, presumably due to a lack of MOS with specific, narrow DP profiles that are safe for human testing. In order to achieve the overall goal, a method was first developed to prepare specific groups of food-grade MOS (DP 3, 3 - 4, 5 - 6, and 6 - 7) by fractionating commercial mixtures of glucose oligomers and polymers. Psychophysical testing using the four prepared MOS stimuli in addition to glucose (DP 1) and maltose (DP 2) at the same concentration showed that all six stimuli were detected with similar discriminability in normal tasting conditions. In order to assess the potential role of T 1 R 2 /T 1 R 3 in MOS taste detection, the stimuli were additionally prepared with lactisole, a sweet inhibitor. All stimuli in both lactisole treatments were prepared with acarbose to prevent oral digestion of glucosidic bonds by salivary α-amylase. Here, it was found that subjects could not detect DP 1, 2, or 3, but could still detect the MOS mixtures (DP 3 - 4, 5 - 6, and 6 - 7). Together, these results support the presence of a MOS taste perception mechanism independent of the T 1 R 2 /T 1 R 3 taste receptor, and suggest it is stimulated by MOS greater than three units. After completing psychophysical testing, modifications to the MOS fractionation protocol were found to allow isolated MOS products from DP 3 to 7 to be collected. A second study thus presents the method to obtain these isolated products in a <b>food-safe</b> quality. Differential solubility using aqueous ethanol is first used to obtain a refined MOS preparation, which can then be further refined using column chromatography. A cellulose-based column in conjunction with aqueous ethanol mobile phases is used to separate the MOS preparation into linear, isolated MOS DP 3 to 7 in high purity. This fractionation method will not only be of high relevance to researchers interested in studying the physiological impacts of MOS consumption in humans, but will also be useful to future studies involving human taste perception of these saccharides...|$|E
40|$|Whey is a {{byproduct}} of cheese making; whey proteins are globular proteins which can be modified and polymerized to add functional benefits, these benefits can be both nutritional and structural in foods. Modified proteins {{can be used in}} non-foods, being of particular interest in polymer films and coatings. Food packaging materials, including plastics, can linings, interior coatings of paper containers, and beverage cap sealing materials, are generally made of synthetic petroleum based compounds. These synthetic materials may pose a potential human health risk due to presence of certain chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA). They also add to environmental pollution, being difficult to degrade. Protein-based materials {{do not have the same}} issues as synthetics and so can be used as alternatives in many packaging types. As proteins are generally hydrophilic they must be modified structurally and their performance enhanced by the addition of waterproofing agents. Polymerization of whey proteins results in a network, adding both strength and flexibility. The most interesting of the <b>food-safe</b> waterproofing agents are the (large aspect ratio) nanoclays. Nanoclays are relatively inexpensive, widely available and have low environmental impact. The clay surface can be modified to make it organophilic and so compatible with organic polymers. The objective of this study is the use of polymerized whey protein (PWP), with reinforcing nanoclays, to produce flexible surface coatings which limit the transfer of contents while maintaining food safety. Four smectite and kaolin type clays, one treated and three natural were assessed for strengthening qualities and the potential waterproofing and plasticizing benefits of other additives were also analyzed. The nutritional benefits of whey proteins can also be used to enhance the protein content of various foodstuffs. Drinkable yogurt is a popular beverage in the US and other countries and is considered a functional food, especially when produced with probiotic bacteria. Carbonation was applied to a drinkable yogurt to enhance its benefits. This process helps reduce the oxygen levels in the foodstuff thus potentially being advantageous to the microaerophilic probiotic bacteria while simultaneously producing a product, somewhat similar to kefir, which has the potential to fill a niche in the functional foods market. Yogurt was combined with a syrup to reduce its viscosity, making it drinkable, and also to allow infusion of CO 2. This dilution reduced the protein content of the drink and so whey protein concentrate was added to increase levels in the final product. High-methoxyl pectins were used to provide stability by reducing the tendency of the proteins to sediment out. The objectives of this study were to develop a manufacturing technology for drinkable carbonated symbiotic yogurts, and to evaluate their physicochemical properties. Two flavors of yogurt drink, pomegranate and vanilla, were formulated containing inulin as prebiotic, along with probiotic bacteria, producing symbiotic dairy beverages...|$|E
