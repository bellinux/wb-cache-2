40|$|We {{address the}} {{following}} question: How can data be disseminated in an inter-vehicle communications (IVC) network when the traffic of IVC-equipped vehicles is very sparse (e. g., one IVC-equipped vehicle every few minutes), using minimal extra-vehicular infrastructure? We present a datadissemination scheme that uses wireless <b>dead</b> <b>drops</b> (<b>dead</b> letter boxes) as intermediaries between vehicles. These <b>dead</b> <b>drops</b> are simple transceivers with storage {{and are not}} connected to other <b>dead</b> <b>drops,</b> the Internet, or other networks. An important question is the placement of such <b>dead</b> <b>drops.</b> We formulate the corresponding optimization problem and prove that it is NPhard. We present an optimal greedy approximation algorithm for solving the optimization problem. Our algorithm is based on mapping the dead-drop placement problem {{to the problem of}} computing a minimum-weight spanning sub-hypergraph. I...|$|R

2500|$|If a {{traditional}} cell had independent communications {{with the foreign}} support organization, headquarters {{might be able to}} arrange its reconnection.

2500|$|A {{network was}} then {{established}} in which Townsend would pass intelligence to a courier, Jonas Hawkins or Austin Roe, {{who would take}} it [...] to Setauket and {{pass it on to}} Woodhull, usually via <b>dead</b> <b>drop.</b> Woodhull would evaluate and comment on it and pass it to Caleb Brewster, who took it across Long Island Sound to Tallmadge, who would then usually add a cover letter with comments. Tallmadge found that personally taking the message to Washington was too time consuming, so he eventually began to send these reports to Washington via dragoons and then by relays of dragoons.|$|E

50|$|While the <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> {{method is}} useful in {{preventing}} the instantaneous capture of either an operative/handler pair or an entire espionage network, it is not foolproof. If one of the operatives is compromised, they may reveal the location and signal for that specific <b>dead</b> <b>drop.</b> Counterintelligence will then use the <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> as a double agent for many purposes : feed deceptive information to their enemy, identify other operative using it, etc.|$|E

The cigar completely destroyed {{the upper and}} lower jaw of a gel head but was determined to be very unreliable due to its timed fuse and small explosive payload while the explosive trap concealed in the <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> spike decimated a mannequin. The edge was given to the <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> spike for its higher success rate at killing a target with its SEMTEX payload and [...] "fail-deadly tamper" [...] trigger.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} {{dissemination}} of data in a vehicular network in which the density of equipped vehicles, or all vehicles, is very low, and {{in which there is}} no centrally connected infrastructure, such as a network of gateways. In this environment, a vehicle is rarely in communication range of another vehicle, so that protocols based on forwarding messages along a chain of vehicles in communication range are not effective. Similarly, the lack of centrally connected network infrastructure precludes protocols that use a fixed network of gateways to transfer messages. Our solution is based on using a collection of stationary, stand-alone <b>dead</b> <b>drops</b> that exchange data with vehicles that pass by them. Although the <b>dead</b> <b>drops</b> do not communicate among themselves or with a central network, their limited ability to store and forward data can improve the connectivity of a vehicular network. We use simulation-based experiments to demonstrate that the use of <b>dead</b> <b>drops</b> results in significant improvements in both the rate of data dissemination and the robustness to frequent changes in the set of participating vehicles.

5000|$|Vandalism of the <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> by {{physical}} destruction: anyone with physical access can destroy the <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> by using for instance pliers or a hammer, by high voltage from a static field, with high temperature from a blowtorch, or other methods of physical force. It {{is possible to}} make the USB key more difficult to vandalize or to extract, by sealing it in a hole deeper than {{the length of the}} USB key (at least 2 cm more), but this requires legitimate users to connect with a USB extender cable. For clarity, sometimes the installation of the dead-drop can itself be vandalism of the building; when a building owner destroys a <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> placed without permission, they are not vandalizing the <b>dead</b> <b>drop,</b> but removing a device placed without their leave. Even when a device is placed legally, the device itself is vulnerable to third-party vandalism.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>drop</b> or [...] "dead letter box" [...] is {{a method}} of espionage tradecraft used to pass items between two {{individuals}} using a secret location and thus does not require them to meet directly.
