A kind of automatic backwash fiber bundle filter {{which is used}} for filtering the washing BFS water is designed and its properties have been studied. The high density particles in washing BFS water and suspended slag wool are the key factors for the filtering effect. By optimization design of structure, the filter has properties of big particles precipitation, automatic discharge of <b>floating</b> <b>sludge</b> and fixed pressure backwash. Through experimental tests, the results show that: the high density particles precipitation and filter layer regeneration rate are quicker; the ability of automatic discharge <b>floating</b> <b>sludge</b> is higher.

40|$|Vegetable oil–based {{cutting fluids}} are a {{relatively}} recent development in large-scale metal machining. A metal machining factory in Wales that switched from mineral oil-based to vegetable oil-based cutting fluids has experienced the occurrence of a problematic <b>floating</b> <b>sludge</b> within the settling and holding tanks at the on-site effluent treatment plant. Physicochemical analyses {{have found that the}} sludge is composed of on average 33 % water, 20 % oleic acid, and 18 % palmitic acid, originating from the vegetable oil–based cutting fluids used at the factory. A solvent separation step was devised and used successfully to separate water inherent within the sludge so as to study the division of the inorganic elements within the water and organic phases of the sludge. It was found that only a minor constituent of the sludge can be accounted for by Ca-bonded fatty acids. Formation of the sludge is suspected to be due to the biologically induced hydrolysis and oxidation of the oils from esters to the free fatty acids and subsequent creaming, forming a layer of stable <b>floating</b> <b>sludge</b> {{on the surface of the}} effluent storage tanks...|$|R
50|$|The {{adherence}} of {{suspended solids}} to bubbles is {{easier and more}} intensive, the smaller the bubbles are. Because of the improved adherence capacity of small microbubbles, the saturation of the introduced air {{as well as the}} reduction capability of particles lead to an improved suspended solids reduction, a higher solids content in the <b>float</b> <b>sludge</b> and a more stable <b>float</b> <b>sludge</b> {{on the surface of the}} microflotation cell. A difference has to be made to dispersed flotation used in mining industry in mineral segregation processes where the bubble are bigger being 500-2000 μm in size and volume of air is many fold compared to the water volume. Traditional Dissolved Air flotation (DAF) mainly operates with bubble sizes ranging from 80-300 μm with very inhomogeneous bubble size distribution.A major difference of low pressure dissolved air flotation and other flotation processes lies in the volumes of bubbles, amount of air and raising speeds. One macro bubble can be 1000 times bigger in volume compared to one micro bubble. And vice versa the number of micro bubbles can be 1000 fold in number compared to one macro bubble having same volume.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} aluminum salts on <b>floating</b> <b>sludge</b> caused by Microthrix parvicella, the addition of AlCl 3 was tested in a pilot scale activated sludge treatment plant fed with municipal wastewater. After enriching M. parvicella by dosing an emulsion of vegetable oil and Tween 80, an average aluminum application rate per mass of {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} of 3. 5 g kg- 1 d- 1 was applied. Specific sludge parameters such as the settling ability and the filament index were measured during the experiment. At the same time the effect of aluminum on the tendency to float and the hydrophobicity of activated sludge {{as well as on the}} morphology of M. parvicella was investigated. Microscopic investigations revealed a morphological modification of the filamentous bacterium during adding of AlCl 3. M. parvicella was found mostly inside of the activated sludge flocs and appeared as a short filament. Concurrently, an improvement of the settling characteristics of the activated sludge was observed. The tendency to float and the hydrophobicity of activated sludge decreased during the dosing. This is of significant relevance in the attempt to prevent <b>floating</b> <b>sludge</b> accumulation in activated sludge systems. The decrease of hydrophobicity of activated sludge during AlCl 3 dosage is probably related to the interaction of the aluminum species with the lipophilic substances and hydrophobic cell surface of M. parvicella (co-precipitation process) ...|$|R

The system is designed such that parameter values are retrieved from the database if such a database exists and contains appropriate values and, if no such database exists or if the appropriate values are not present, the operator is queried for the parameter values.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Engenharia Química e BiológicaLipids are {{ubiquitous}} in industrial wastewater {{produced in the}} food industry, yet practically no biological treatment systems {{are available on the}} market that are capable of directly treating wastewater containing lipids. In general, lipids are considered a nuisance and are normally removed prior to biological treatment. Lipids are however compounds with a high calorific value and therefore highly interesting for conversion into biogas under anaerobic conditions. This thesis reports on the development of a high-rate anaerobic reactor capable of directly treating wastewater containing fat. The reactor’s technological basis for includes floatation as main sludge retention technique. Next to that, the specific contact surface between sludge and fat is maximised to prevent mass transfer limitation. Because fat degradation leads again to settlable sludge, a sedimentation step is incorporated {{in the form of a}} tilted plate separator (TPS). The settled sludge is then recycled and mixed up with raw wastewater to stimulate fat adsorption and sludge floatation. The sludge/raw wastewater mixture is subsequently injected into downers to induce reactor mixing and the break-up of <b>floating</b> <b>sludge.</b> Finally, to counteract foam formation, treated wastewater is sprayed in the head space. These considerations formed the basis of the Inverted Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (IASB) reactor. The IASB concept was tested using several lab-scale configurations and lead to an optimised 1. 2 m 3 pilot scale reactor. Its robustness and capacity for treating wastewater strongly fluctuating in quality while maintaining treatment efficiency was demonstrated during a one year pilot trial on slaughterhouse wastewater. Until an organic loading rate of 12 kg COD/m 3 /day, no problems were encountered in terms of COD removal. The TPS showed to be efficient in retaining solids inside the reactor. The spray flow rate, however, should not go through the TPS. The IASB technology is currently being scaled-up to industrial scale taking the pilot findings into account. A modular approach was chosen as to reduce investment costs associated to the technology. The IASB technological development further resulted in a novel separation technology called Sludge Lift Separator. Separator design was optimised using computational fluid dynamics.

40|$|Several tools {{have been}} {{developed}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS) to remotely sample stored radioactive waste. These sampling tools {{have been developed}} to determine the chemical characteristics of the waste prior to processing. The processing of waste material varies according to the chemical characteristics of the waste, which change due to additions, settling, mixing, and chemical reactions during storage. Once the waste has been sampled to identify its characteristics, the chemical composition of the waste can then be altered if needed to prepare for processing. Various types of waste material in several types of containment must be sampled at SRS. Stored waste materials consist of liquids, <b>floating</b> organics, <b>sludge,</b> salt and solids. Waste is stored in four basic types of tanks with different means of access and interior obstructions. The waste tanks can only be accessed by small openings: access ports, risers and downcomers. Requirements for sampling depend on the type of tank being accessed, the waste within the tank, and the particular location in the tank desired for taking the sample. Sampling devices {{have been developed to}} sample all of the waste material forms found in the SRS tank farms.

40|$|In most {{developing}} countries commonly practiced domestic wastewater treatment systems predominantly constitute anaerobic treatment process. The anaerobic treatment units mostly installed are on-site at residential dwellings. However the commonly installed units, viz., traditional pit latrines and septic tanks {{are in fact}} 'low-rate' anaerobic pre-treatment units and are associated with inefficiency, poor maintenance and groundwater pollution. Moreover since most poor communities, who constitute {{the majority in the}} {{developing countries}}' populations could afford these types of anaerobic pre-treatment units, their numbers have also grown to unmanageable proportions. Consequently the demand for effective but low cost wastewater treatment facilities for developing countries is indisputably great. On the basis of already available technical information concerning the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Bed (UASB) reactor performance a wastewater treatment system based on the UASB reactor can lead to a compact, effective and low cost community on-site pre-treatment unit for tropical wastewaters. However the performance of these systems in an actual community on-site situation has so far not been investigated. This thesis therefore investigates the performance and feasibility of using the UASB reactor for the pre-treatment of wastewater under the conditions that arise at community level in tropical regions, viz. highly varying organic and hydraulic loads, but low variation in temperature. On-site pilot scale UASB reactors were configured and operated in parallel at community level for the purpose of acquiring performance data. All the reactors were operated in gravity flow mode at ambient tropical temperature of 25 - 34 ºC. The wastewater in the study area - community level - was highly biodegradable with an average ratio COD:BOD 5 of 1. 52 at a standard deviation of 0. 13. The wastewater characteristic was highly variable. A 1277 -day monitoring duration of the wastewater grab samples has shown that the values of organic loads (with standard deviation in brackets), in terms of COD tot, and COD ss, were 529. 4 (544. 6) and 264. 4 (448. 4) mg/L respectively. A conventional pilot single-step community on-site UASB reactor (volume: 1. 5 m 3, height: 1. 7 m) was operated over {{three and a half years}} at an average hydraulic retention time of 6. 2 (4. 92). The performance data obtained via regular monitoring of the treatment unit showed a declining removal efficiency over time with respect to COD total, which likely can be attributed to the increasing rate at which biogas was produced along with the growth of sludge bed and the presence of <b>floating</b> <b>sludge.</b> As a result the removal of dispersed sludge particles becomes poorer, which likely is reinforced by the possible 'less' optimal dimensions and design of the Gas-Solids-Separator (GSS) device. The average removal efficiency on COD tot basis was 64 percent. However a study of a parallel pilot two-step community on-site UASB reactor configuration gave more promising results. The two-step UASB pre-treatment unit in this research refers to two UASB reactors connected in series, viz. a first 2 m high 1. 8 m 3 UASB reactor put in front of a second 1 m high 0. 852 m 3 UASB reactor. The second-step UASB reactor is a recipient of effluent including washouts from the first-step UASB reactor The average organic loads of the wastewater imposed to the system with respect to COD fractions COD tot, COD ss, COD col and COD sol were 537. 2 (165. 3), 189. 9 (109. 5), 127. 4 (75) and 223. 4 (108. 8) respectively. The investigations were conducted over a period of 630 days. The overall removal efficiency obtained on the basis of the distinguished COD fractions was far better than for the individual reactors, i. e efficiencies for COD tot, COD ss, COD col and COD sol, were respectively 68. 7 (16. 7), 51. 2 (41. 8), 62. 1 (38. 2), and 71. 8 (30. 5) %. The imposed overall HRT was 7. 4 (1. 6) (i. e. 5 + 2. 4) hours. The advantages of the two-step UASB reactor configuration include 1) the distinct higher overall removal efficiency of the anaerobic pre-treatment system 2) the higher sludge age 3) the higher reliability of the anaerobic pre-treatment process 4) the two reactors can separately be operated in case of technical problems...|$|R

Numa primeira fase, fez-se o estudo do tratamento anaeróbio de efluentes de uma indústria de mobiliário de madeira (efluente de uma cabine de pintura e envernizamento). Fizeram-se ensaios para testar a influência da carga orgânica e da velocidade ascensional da alimentação. Neste estudo os reatores UASB foram operados de forma descontínua com recirculação total do efluente tratado. Foram testadas cargas de 2, 300; 1, 150 e 0, 671 g CQO. L- 1 e velocidades ascensionais de 0, 036; 0, 072; 0, 108 e 0, 179 m. h- 1. As condições operacionais que favoreceram o tratamento deste efluente foram a carga 0, 671 g CQO. L- 1 e a velocidade ascensional 0, 036 m. h- 1, condições para as quais se obteve uma eficiência de remoção de CQO de 86, 9 %, uma eficiência de metanização da CQO removida de 72, 1 % e uma biodegradabilidade de 62, 6 %. Verificou-se que a carga e a velocidade ascensional mais baixas favoreceram a eficiência de metanização e a biodegradabilidade. Os resultados obtidos ao longo dos vários ensaios realizados sugerem a adaptação da biomassa ao substrato aplicado. Conclui-se que o tratamento anaeróbio é uma opção viável para a gestão dos efluentes de cabine de pintura e envernizamento de indústrias de mobiliário de madeira. Numa segunda fase, foram estudadas diferentes estratégias de operação para o arranque de reatores UASB, inoculados com biomassa floculenta não adaptada ao substrato, utilizados no tratamento de efluentes de indústrias de lacticínios (efluente complexo contendo gorduras). As estratégias testadas foram: operação contínua, operação intermitente e operação intermitente com choques de gorduras. Foram realizados dois ensaios, o primeiro com uma carga orgânica de 5, 0 g CQO. L- 1. d- 1 e o segundo ensaio com 8, 5 g CQO. L- 1. d- 1. Em termos de remoção de CQO, as três estratégias de operação resultaram em valores semelhantes (de 51, 3 a 60, 4 %). Nos dois ensaios verificou-se que a operação intermitente com choques de gorduras resultou nos valores mais elevados de metanização da CQO removida, com valores médios de 56, 0 % e 69, 3 % para o primeiro e segundo ensaios, respetivamente. Em comparação, para a operação intermitente, obtiveram-se eficiências de metanização médias de 53, 4 % e 60, 7 %, para o primeiro e segundo ensaios, respetivamente. Na operação contínua, as eficiências médias de metanização da CQO removida foram de 45, 9 % para o primeiro ensaio e 43, 9 % para o segundo ensaio. Verificou-se também que a operação intermitente com choque de gorduras teve um efeito benéfico em termos de sedimentabilidade da biomassa desenvolvida no reator, tendo-se observado a ausência de flutuação no topo do reator, ao contrário do que foi observado com a operação intermitente e com a operação contínua. Por outro lado, o modo de operação intermitente com choques de gordura apresentou a maior percentagem do grupo microbiano Syntrophomonadaceae, atingindo aproximadamente 20 % da contagem total de microrganismos. Dos resultados obtidos conclui-se que a estratégia mais adequada para a adaptação da biomassa floculenta ao efluente de indústria de lacticínios é a operação intermitente com choque de gorduras. This work {{concerns}} {{the study of}} anaerobic treatment of different industrial wastewaters in laboratory-scale UASB reactors. The {{first phase of the}} work foccused on the anaerobic treatment of a wastewater from a wood furniture industry (wastewater from a dying hood). Tests were made to assess the influence of the organic load and the upflow velocity upon the performance of the process. In this research the UASB reactors were operated in a batch mode with total recirculation of the treated effluent. Loads of 2. 300; 1. 150 and 0. 671 g COD. L- 1 and upflow velocities of 0. 036, 0. 072, 0. 108 and 0. 179 m. h- 1 were tested. The operating conditions that favoured the anaerobic treatment of this wastewater were a load of 0. 671 g COD. L- 1 and an upflow velocity of 0, 036 m. h- 1, conditions that lead to a removal efficiency of 86. 9 %, a methanization efficiency of the removed COD of 72. 1 % and a biodegradability of 62. 6 %. It was also established that the lower loads and the lower uplflow velocities favoured the efficiency of methanization of the removed COD and the biodegradability of the wastewater. Finally the results obtained throughout the series of tests performed suggest that the biomass adapted to the applied substrate. It was concluded that the anaerobic process is a viable option for treating the wastewaters from the dying hoods of furniture industries. In a second phase the work foccused on different startup strategies for UASB reactors, inocculated with flocculent biomass not adapted to the substrate, used for the treatment of dairy wastewaters (complex fat containing wastewaters). The tested strategies were: continuous operation, intermittent operation and intermittent operation with fat shocks. Two tests were performed: the first with an organic loading rate of 5. 0 g COD. L- 1. d- 1 and the second with an organic loading rate of 8. 5 g COD. L- 1. d- 1. In terms of COD removal the three tested strategies resulted in similar values (averages for all reactors from 51. 3 to 60. 4 %). In both the tests it was verified that the intermittent operation with fat shocks resulted in the higher values of methanization of the removed COD with averages values of 56. 0 % and 69. 3 % for the first and second tests, respectively. In comparison for the intermittent operation the average methanization efficiencies of the removed COD were 53, 4 % and 60. 7 % for the first and the second tests, respectively. With the continuous operation the average methanization efficiencies of the removed COD were 45. 9 % for the first test and 43. 9 % for the second test. It was also verified that the intermittent operation with fat shocks had a beneficial effect in terms of biomass sedimentability. It was observed that no <b>floating</b> <b>sludge</b> layer was present {{in the top of the}} intermittent reactor with fat shocks in contrast with what was observed with the continuous and the intermittent reactors. On the other hand, the intermittent system with fat shock revealed that a high percentage of microbial group Syntrophomonadaceae, near to 20 % of the total microbial count. From the results of this work it may be concluded that the most adequate strategy for the adaptation of flocculent biomass to dairy wastewater is the intermittent operation with fat shocks.

5000|$|Obuasi, Ghana is {{the home}} of one of the world's top gold mining sites. It was in 1897 when the first {{machinery}} was used to mine the gold from the region. As the years went by, new strategies were needed to establish out ways to [...] "treat the ores". By 1908, A leading chemist was brought in to help with the strategies and brought his Australian method of [...] "dry crushing and roasting preparatory to treatment with cyanide". Many rivers, fishing areas, and irrigation systems have been either slightly or permanently damaged. The mining industry has tried to compensate by building standpipes but for many, they have been to no use. The average amount of contamination in the water system of Obuasi was over 10-38 times the maximum amount that is allowable by law. The two main sources of the contamination is the arsenic powder that flows out from the mills and the extensive amount of run-off water that is disposed of through dams. [...] "Thus in the processing of the ore for gold, the dust may contain particles of the ore, ferric oxide, oxides of arsenic and sulphur". The dust will then get carried into the atmosphere and settle on the soil, humans, and rivers. In Obuasi, they receive a high annual rainfall due to the tropical rainforest that surrounds it (Smedley,1996,464). During precipitation or rainfall, the dust [...] "may be oxidized to the trioxide by the air and be converted to the sulphate in dew and rainwater". The soil is the main target of contamination because the soil is contaminated and whatever vegetation grows and decays goes right back in the soil which results in the contamination of the groundwater. However, the groundwater is not as polluted as the streams or rivers mainly due to the high dissolving process of the arsenic and due to the basement rocks that lie between the groundwater and the soil. [...] "The only disadvantage is that whatever is deposited on the surface soil may be carried to greater depths with time by rainwater (Gish et al,2010, 1973)". The most extensively damaged areas are the ones closest to the mines, but with the wind carrying the dust, areas hundreds of miles away are getting contaminated by the chemicals. Due to the extensive output of the chemicals from the mining mills and un resolved toxic spills, many rivers, streams, lakes and irrigation systems have been damaged or obsolete. The local residents have been affected greatly by this phenomenon. Residents have seen the environmental changes especially in the water. <b>Sludge</b> <b>floats</b> down on streams that were once main sources of drinking water according to local residents. All the marine life in the rivers and streams has died due to the high amounts of chemicals in the water. According to Action Aid, residents have seen pipes that run straight into local streams and rivers that were depositing the waste directly sometimes causing flooding of the streams and rivers (2006,11). Many local farmers suffered the hardest with the contamination of the water. Due to the irrigation systems using the contaminated water to irrigate all of the soil were then contaminated as well. The soil was no longer usable, causing the killing off their crops that were used for their business as well as for their own families. Children have also been targeted and affected by the pollution. According to Action Aid, many schools have been flooded with the over flow of the local streams, causing the children to leave school, sometimes permanently. AngloGold Ashanti (AGA) has put up standpipes to compensate for the contaminated water supplies, but these have also been useless to the locals. Standpipes were installed in the 1940s and 50’s that have now been contaminated with arsenic from the mills. AGA staff claim it is because of them being made of iron, but studies have shown large amounts of arsenic in the water. Many standpipes have been either broken or obsolete. This leads to the residents to walk at least 1.5 miles to go get clean water. All the work the local people have to go through to get clean water is uncalled for. No compensation has been giving to the local residents for the damage they have done to their water and environment.|$|R
