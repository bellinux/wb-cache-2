5|$|The Handley Page Victor was a British jet-powered {{strategic}} bomber, {{developed and}} {{produced by the}} Handley Page Aircraft Company, which served during the Cold War. It was {{the third and final}} of the V-bombers operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), the other two V-bombers being the Avro Vulcan and the Vickers Valiant. The Victor had been developed to perform as part of the United Kingdom’s airborne nuclear deterrent. In 1968, the type was retired from the nuclear mission following the discovery of fatigue cracks, which had been exacerbated by the RAF's adoption of a low-altitude <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> to avoid interception.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the <b>flight</b> <b>profile.</b> For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this {{mission was to}} achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines {{in the second and}} third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.|$|E

25|$|The flight {{recorders}} {{were found to}} be damaged by heat but their data were extracted and analysed, revealing no technical failures during the flight. There is currently an ongoing investigation by the Interstate Aviation Committee and others. They have found that the crew had chosen to fly at minimum altitude over the area. In the last few seconds preceding the crash, the crew attempted to gain altitude. The thick smoke may have led to the choice of <b>flight</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The XBQM-108 {{project was}} {{initiated}} in 1975 by the Aviation and Surface Effects Department of the U.S. Navy's David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center. The project {{was intended to}} demonstrate the practicality of the 'Vertical Attitude Take-Off and Landing' (VATOL), or 'tailsitter' <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> for remotely piloted vehicles, as the Navy believed the increasing threat posed by cruise missiles required that aviation assets be dispersed among additional ships of the fleet, which would possess limited space for aviation operations as opposed to conventional aircraft carriers.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} {{of all of}} the factual evidence is consistent with the conclusions that: 1) no airplane-related mechanical malfunctions or failures caused or contributed to the accident, and 2) the accident can be explained by intentional pilot action. Specifically, a) the accident airplane’s <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> is consistent with sustained manual nose-down flight control inputs; b) the evidence suggests that the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was intentionally disconnected; c) recovery of the airplane was possible but not attempted; and d) {{it is more likely that}} the nose-down flight control inputs were made by the captain than by the first officer.|$|E

25|$|The Kawasaki P-1 is a {{purpose-built}} {{maritime patrol}} aircraft equipped with four engines. The P-1 is powered by four podded IHI F7-10 turbofan engines underneath the low-set wings. The four-engine low-wing loading design adopted for the P-1 results in a <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> with better maneuverability and stability at low-speed, low-altitude flight and allows the aircraft to continue its mission {{in the event of}} a single engine failure as well as greater operational survivability, the high-bypass engines provide for quiet, fuel-efficient operation. The P-1 has reduced transit times in comparison to turboprop-powered competitors, and the turbofans are quieter, making it more difficult for submerged submarines to detect it acoustically.|$|E
25|$|Kh-101/102 (Izdeliye 111) - {{developed}} as a very stealthy replacement for the Kh-55SM in the late 1990s, the Kh-101 has a conventional warhead and the Kh-102 is thermonuclear. This missile weighs some 2,200 - 2,400kg, the weight of warhead is 400–450kg. According to reports, the Kh-101 has a maximum range of 4500–5500km and a variable <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> at altitudes ranging from 30 – 70 m to 6000 m, a cruising speed of 190–200m/s and a maximum speed of 250–270m/s. The missile is equipped with an electro-optical system for correcting the flight trajectory and with a TV guidance system for terminal guidance. Its official range is 4,500km or 3,000km with a conventional payload. It is re-targetable. The missiles {{are expected to be}} accurate within 10–20 m CEP. They are expected to be in service in those numbers by 2023. The new missile complex has been successfully tested and in recent years put into series production to equip modernized Tu-160 and Tu-95MSM bombers.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{aircraft}}'s many faults, {{only two}} {{were lost in}} accidents. The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory prior to delivery to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt {{which was part of}} the test <b>flight</b> <b>profile.</b> Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the rudder had locked. Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to come to a stop before bailing out. Because of the tandem seating, it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda down hard in a farmer's field, and walked away unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped.|$|E

25|$|During Deatrick's {{tenure at}} the school, {{students}} received the long-awaited Lockheed NF-104Aa rocket-powered variant of the F-104 intended to inexpensively train military space pilots. More than five years before, three F-104s were extensively modified to the NF-104A or Aerospace Trainer (AST) configuration that included {{the addition of a}} rocket engine and a reaction control system for flight in the upper atmosphere where the air is too thin for normal control surfaces to operate. Although the school managed the project, testing was performed not by the school's students, but by experienced test pilots from Lockheed and the Air Force Flight Test Center. Flight testing began in 1963 but was suspended when aircraft 56-0762 was destroyed on 10 December, seriously injuring the pilot. Safety modifications were made to the two remaining aircraft, and a restricted <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> was defined that lowered the maximum altitude and decreased the climb angle. In spite of the precautions, a serious accident occurred on June 18, 1965 when an instructor flying 56-0756 experienced a hydrogen peroxide fire from the reaction control system. A nitrogen purge system was added, and after additional test flights, the school's students were finally approved for training flights in May 1968.|$|E
500|$|With {{no other}} civil traffic {{operating}} at its cruising altitude of about , Concorde had exclusive use of dedicated oceanic airways, or [...] "tracks", {{separate from the}} North Atlantic Tracks, the routes used by other aircraft to cross the Atlantic. Due to the significantly less variable nature of high altitude winds compared to those at standard cruising altitudes, these dedicated SST tracks had fixed co-ordinates, unlike the standard routes at lower altitudes, whose co-ordinates are replotted twice daily based on forecast weather patterns (jetstreams). Concorde would also be cleared in a [...] block, allowing for a slow climb from 45,000 to [...] during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased. In regular service, Concorde employed an efficient cruise-climb <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> following take-off.|$|E

5|$|The Bolo plan {{reasoned}} that by equipping F-4s with jamming pods, using the call signs and communications codewords of the F-105 wings, and flying their <b>flight</b> <b>profiles</b> through northwest Vietnam, the F-4s could effectively simulate an F-105 bombing mission and entice the MiG-21s into intercepting not bomb-laden Thunderchiefs, but Phantoms configured for air-to-air combat.|$|R

500|$|Structural fatigue was {{accelerated}} {{by at least}} a factor of eight in a low-altitude <b>flight</b> <b>profile</b> over that of high-altitude flying, requiring costly repairs to extend service life. In the early 1960s, the three-phase High Stress program was launched to counter structural fatigue, enrolling aircraft at 2,000 flying hours. Follow-up programs were conducted, such as a 2,000-hour service life extension to select airframes in 1966–1968, and the extensive Pacer Plank reskinning, completed in 1977. The wet wing introduced on G and H models was even more susceptible to fatigue, experiencing 60% more stress during flight than the old wing. The wings were modified by 1964 under ECP 1050. This {{was followed by a}} fuselage skin and longeron replacement (ECP 1185) in 1966, and the B-52 Stability Augmentation and Flight Control program (ECP 1195) in 1967. Fuel leaks due to deteriorating Marman clamps continued to plague all variants of the B-52. To this end, the aircraft were subjected to Blue Band (1957), Hard Shell (1958), and finally QuickClip (1958) programs. The latter fitted safety straps that prevented catastrophic loss of fuel in case of clamp failure. The B-52's service ceiling is officially listed as 50,000feet, but operational experience shows this is difficult to reach when fully laden with bombs. According to one source: [...] "The optimal altitude for a combat mission was around 43,000feet, because to exceed that height would rapidly degrade the planes range." ...|$|E
