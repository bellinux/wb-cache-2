EFA Software Services, a Canadian company, provided both the trading and settlement & clearing systems. By August 1996 the Exchange was fully operational, and on November 7 of that year the PEX signed an operating agreement with the PNA, allowing for the licensing and qualification of brokerage firms to take place.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the valuation {{efficiency of the}} Eurex market for DAX single stock options. As a measure of arbitrage potential we use an adapted version of Stoll’s put-call parity model. By calculating deviations from the theoretical fair put and call prices {{before and during the}} financial crisis in 2008, we find evidence for a decrease in market’s valuation efficiency. Valuation efficiency is even worse for German financial stocks for which short selling was restricted. Although considerable profit opportunities are found, only a small number turn out to be profitable after transaction costs are considered. Our research complements the existing research by investigating American type stock options on a <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>exchange</b> in both, volatile and stable markets...|$|E
40|$|In the U. S., several {{exchanges with}} {{different}} market microstructure designs compete to provide quotes and attract order flow {{on a common}} set of stock options. In this article, we analyze how the different microstructure designs affect the price discovery of options quotes and how they alter the flow of options trading activities over time. We find that the <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>exchange</b> system at the International Secu-rities Exchange (ISE), where several market makers provide quotes independently and anonymously to compete for order flow within the exchange, generates options quotes that are the most informative and the most executable, with the narrowest bid–ask spreads. Over time, the ISE’s leading quote quality has attracted order flow to the exchange, and has com-pelled other exchanges to pursue technology innovations and structural reforms through either expansion or consolidation. T he financial industry has come to recognize the importance of deriv-ative securities in providing unique investment opportunities and risk-management vehicles. Trading volume on derivatives has increased tremendously during the past few years. Accompanying this expan-sion in derivatives have been rapid expansions and transformations in the stock options market. In the United States, in an effort to reduce trade-throughs and other market seg-mentations, a series of regulatory changes have taken place since the late 1990 s. In July 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a plan to electronically link the various market centers (the “Linkage Plan”). The SEC has also adopted more strin-gent quoting and disclosure rules on the options market. The “firm quote ” rule was applied to the options markets on April 1, 2001. At the time of our study, five options exchanges compete to provide quotes and attract order flows on {{a common set of}} stoc...|$|E

50|$|A hybrid market {{allows a}} {{stockbroker}} to either have his order executed immediately in a <b>fully</b> automated <b>electronic</b> <b>exchange,</b> {{or to have}} it routed to the trading floor where it is completed manually via the more traditional live auction method {{in the presence of}} a specialist broker. The <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> method has the advantage of speed, often completing orders in less than one second while comparable manual transactions take an average of nine seconds. However, the live auction method differentiates itself with the human interaction and expert judgment of the specialists, though they are currently seen as obsolete since most customers seem to prefer speed, and the NYSE is working to redefine the role these specialists play in the market. The NYSE is seen as the world's premier example of a hybrid market.|$|R

40|$|In NEMSIS V 2, the {{dominant}} data submission mechanisms are ftp and web submission using Java Applet. Such procedures are manual {{and difficult to}} automate. The NEMSIS TAC has implemented a simple Web Services API for V 2 data submission to the national EMS data warehouse. Although used only by a few states, it {{has proved to be}} an efficient alternative. For software applications seeking V 3 compliance, data submission via Web Services (WS) will be required. We hope the EMS software development community will take advantage of this mature technology and expand its usage to facilitate business workflow control and data exchange. If implemented properly, standardized NEMSIS WS API will provide the following advantages: NEMSIS V 3 Web Services Guide Page 2 of 24 1. <b>Fully</b> automated <b>electronic</b> data <b>exchange</b> (including submission and retrieval) between the WS Consumer’s system and the WS Provider’s system.

50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange must run continuously without interruption at all times, by implementing a fault-tolerant design. Early trials of electronics and {{computers in the}} control sub systems of an exchange were successful and resulted {{in the development of}} <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> systems, in which the switching network was also electronic. A trial system with stored program control was installed in Morris, Illinois in 1960. It used a flying-spot store with a word size of 18 bits for semi-permanent program and parameter storage, and a barrier-grid memory for random access working memory. The world’s first electronic switching system for permanent production use, the No.1 ESS, was commissioned by AT&T at Succasunna, New Jersey, in May 1965. By 1974, AT&T had installed 475 No. 1ESS systems. In the 1980s SPC displaced electromechanical switching in the telecommunication industry, hence the term lost all but historical interest. Today SPC is a standard feature in all <b>electronic</b> <b>exchanges.</b>|$|R
