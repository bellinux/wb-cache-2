50|$|Catch {{shares have}} been {{proposed}} as a potential solution for the common property challenges found in many fisheries and have typically been implemented after {{a variety of other}} approaches have failed. Most commercial fisheries begin under open access conditions in which any fisherman is able to enter the fishery, put in effort, and catch fish. However, if fish biomass is no longer able to sustain the amount of fishing effort exerted in the fishery, populations begin to decline, and fishing becomes less profitable. Conventional management systems tend to respond using input controls such as limiting the number of entrants to the fishery, restricting boat and <b>gear</b> <b>capacity,</b> limiting the number of days at sea, and applying catch allowances per trip. However, studies show that the approaches are sometimes ineffective in controlling overall harvest, and managers often implement additional effort-based regulations, output controls, to set strict fishery catch limits. Although catch limits have proven sufficient to sustain a fishery, the management approaches alone do not fundamentally eliminate the incentive for fishermen to compete and increase their share of the catch, which can lead to reduced fishery profitability and dangerous fishing conditions.|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of}} application of computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines in generation of gear tooth surfaces with new topology. This topology decreases gear vibration and will extend the <b>gear</b> <b>capacity</b> and service life. A preliminary investigation by a tooth contact analysis (TCA) program has shown that gear tooth surfaces in line contact (for instance, involute helical gears with parallel axes, worm gear drives with cylindrical worms, etc.) {{are very sensitive to}} angular errors of misalignment that cause edge contact and an unfavorable shape of transmission errors and vibration. The new topology of gear tooth surfaces is based on the localization of bearing contact, and the synthesis of a predesigned parabolic function of transmission errors that is able to absorb a piecewise linear function of transmission errors caused by gear misalignment. The report will describe the following topics: description of kinematics of CNC machines with six degrees of freedom that can be applied for generation of gear tooth surfaces with new topology. A new method for grinding of gear tooth surfaces by a cone surface or surface of revolution based on application of CNC machines is described. This method provides an optimal approximation of the ground surface to the given one. This method is especially beneficial when undeveloped ruled surfaces are to be ground. Execution of motions of the CNC machine is also described. The solution to this problem can be applied as well for the transfer of machine tool settings from a conventional generator to the CNC machine. The developed theory required the derivation of a modified equation of meshing based on application of the concept of space curves, space curves represented on surfaces, geodesic curvature, surface torsion, etc. Condensed information on these topics of differential geometry is provided as well...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} of the load distributions and bending stresses with helix deviations in power transmission systems is important for effectively improving <b>gear</b> load <b>capacity.</b> The equations of tooth surface with helix slope and form deviation were established by the given forming rack-cutter tool and the path for processing rack-cutter tool. And various kinds of engaged helical gear models with helix slope and form deviation were developed using finite element method software. Finally, tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress were numerically calculated. The effects of the helix slope deviation, different shape, period, and amplitude of helix form deviation on tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress were investigated {{and the results were}} compared to each other as specified by grades 5 and 7. It is found that the single helix slope deviation on tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress shows “superposition” effect. Especially, the different shapes, periods, and amplitudes of helix form deviation exhibit significant effect on tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress. Helix form deviation mainly affects the tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress along the tooth longitudinal direction, while has little impact between tooth pairs.

40|$|Abstract—Layered {{streaming}} {{is being}} considered {{as the most}} promising approach to adapt to bandwidth variations and heterogeneous end users in streaming applications. The goal of a layered streaming protocol {{is not only to}} optimize the average playback skip rate as in single-layer streaming, but also to maximize possible quality level (quality satisfaction) based on the available bandwidth capacity at the end user. In unstructured layered peerto-peer streaming, however, achieving high quality satisfaction is challenging due to content and bandwidth bottlenecks. With experiments, in this paper, we demonstrate the importance and identify unique challenges of neighbor selection to the system performance in terms of the average skip rate and quality satisfaction. Then, we propose a new neighbor selection technique that can offer good performance while keeping the scalability of the mesh overlay under network fluctuations. The core of the technique is a preemption rule that allows a higher capacity peer to replace a lower capacity peer to be a neighbor of another peer with a certain probability. This preemption rule <b>gears</b> high <b>capacity</b> peers to good locations in the overlay to maximize the use of their bandwidth capacity and available layers.

One {{of the major}} steps within such gear design is high-cost gear testing until failure with the goal to determine performance characteristics of gears and also to enable life expectancy evaluations. With the viewpoint in the low-cost failure analysis, considering crack initiation in tooth root fillet, simulation of material behaviour can be based also on recorded material response from the endurance tests on un-notched test circular samples. In order to account for large number of phenomena that appear in material during loading, complex material model for material behaviour modeling is chosen. Material behaviour in low–cycle fatigue regime is described by material model that combines isotropic and kinematic hardening with mechanics of material damage to simulate elastic-plastic response of the material, as well as damage nucleation and accumulation. Chosen material model is implemented into finite element code to enable numerical modeling of materials response in gears tooth root and life prediction, considering crack initiation period.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{concentrate}} on acetal gear wear behaviour and its performance prediction based on the extensive investigations on the gear thermal mechanical contact both experimentally and numerically. It has been found from the tests that acetal gear wear rate will be increased dramatically when the load reaches a critical value for a specific geometry and running speed. The gear surface will wear slowly with a low specific wear rate if the gear is loaded below the critical one. The possible reason of the sudden increase in wear rate {{is due to the}} gear operating temperature reaching the material melting point under the critical load condition. Gear surface temperature has been then investigated in details through three components: ambient, bulk and flash temperatures. Through extensive experimental investigations and modelling on gear surface temperature variations, a general relation has been built up between gear surface temperature and <b>gear</b> load <b>capacity.</b> An approach for acetal gear transition torque prediction has been proposed and this method is based on the link between polymer gear wear rate and its surface temperature. The method has been related to test results under different operating speeds and gear geometries.

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 1980 s, the Belizean {{beekeeping}} industry lost more than half of its colonies. These losses in part coincided with the arrival of the Africanized honeybee in Belize in 1987 and continued until 1992. It can now be said that through collaboration with the various organizations, cooperatives and other projects the decline of the Belizean beekeeping industry has been stopped and the basis for renewed growth has been laid. However, production has reached such low levels that without strong technical and financial assistance rehabilitation of the industry will take a very long time. The Africanized honeybee has created conditions which are more difficult and more expensive to overcome than those experienced during earlier growth of the industry with European honeybees. With the help of this project in training and equipment it was possible to focus the remaining active beekeepers and a few new beekeepers on the new requirements for beekeeping with Africanized honeybees, i. e. better knowledge and quality protective <b>gear.</b> <b>Capacities</b> were also created for the local production of this essential equipment. The basic legal foundation was laid for Townboard participation in the control of Africanized bee swarms and the necessary equipment was supplied. Material and knowledge for education of the public has also been made available. Over 18 one and two day workshops for beekeepers have been organized and others have been supported. Seminars for Apiary inspectors also included organizational matters such as workplan establishment and progress evaluation. Together a long-term workplan has been elaborated and a project proposal based on this workplan was prepared for immediate application. The higher initial investment cost with Africanized honeybees, particularly for small beekeepers, due to the expensive protective gear, requires the availability of advantageous loans. Thus, together with improved technical assistance, sufficient interest may be generated among farmers to reach the 5 -year goal of 10, 000 bee colonies in production. To become feasible, however, production has to exceed 30 kg per colony under most circumstances and new markets will have to be explored. Incorporating other rural development projects and NGO technicians may greatly increase the effectiveness of the Apiary Inspectors. Increased regional cooperation as initiated in the tripartite agreement between Mexico, Guatemala and Belize will become more important for marketing, disease protection and for maintaining productive and less defensive honeybee populations. Seeking closer contact with researchers and beekeeping programmes in other Central American countries, Mexico and the USA, is of great importance in maintaining manageable Africanized honeybee colonies and controlling a potential threat from the Varroa parasite, likely to arrive soon also in Belize. In this way, hopefully another setback potentially similar in scope to the one experienced with the Africanized bees will be avoided...|$|R

The possibility of its practicality has been proved by the repeated towing tests carried out on board the training ship. Basing on {{the assessment of the}} results obtained from (1) the 4 times drawing tests performed by the 2 training ship on the East China Sea in 1982 (2) the 25 times fishering tests carried out by the trawler No. 37 DAIKICHI MARU on the Bering Sea (3) the model tests carried out in the water tank the following concluusions were fixed concering its practicality. (1) Fishing Capacity : The value of the Catch Per Unit Effort of the chain net was equivalent to 47 ~ 82 % of that of the regular net. Even put under a statical assessment, in the fish composition of the caught fish an obvious distinction was noted between the chain net and the regular net; the usefulness of the chain net as a Fish species Selecting apparatus was ascertained. The amount of dergs and drains drawn into the net was noted to be quite negligible. (2) <b>Gearing</b> <b>Capacity</b> : In the both nets, almost no difference was noted between the height of net mouth. Concering the distance between the wing tips, that of the chain net was somewhat lager than that of regular net. The net resistance of the chain net was 15 ~ 30 % less than that of the regular net. In the case when fishing was effective, the off bottom height of the chain net was 20 ~ 40 cm in the Bering Sea, and it was 10 ~ 15 cm in the East China Sea. The proper shape of the chain which was to be fixed in accordance with its resistance against the flowing water, was sought out theoritically; the diameter of the most proper chain was assessed to be 16 mm. The slower was the towing speed, the longer the vertical past of the submerged hanging chain, which prevented fish school from running away : basing on the above mentioned fact the most proper to wing speed of the chain net was fixed to be 3 knots. 底曳網の沈子方のフィッシングラインに浮子と垂下チェーンを数多く装着し,そのラインを海底から微少高さ離底させて曳網する微離底曳網(チェーン網) については,これまで本学練習船により数多くの曳網実験が行なわれ,実用化が可能であることが証明されている。本報は,昭和 57 年,ベーリング海で行なわれた北転船,第 37 大吉丸の 25 回の漁獲試験と東支那海で行なった 2 隻の本学練習船の 4 回の曳網実験及び水槽で行なった模型実験の夫々の資料を併せて検討した結果,下記のような結論を得た。 1) 漁獲性能 : チェーン網のC・P・U・Eの値は通常網の 47 ~ 82 %に当る。両網の漁獲物の魚種組成は統計学的にみても有意差が認められ,チェーン網の選択漁法の漁具としての有効性を認めることが出来るようである。 2) 漁具性能 : 網口高さは両網ともほとんど差はない。袖先間隔はチェーン網が若干広い。チェーン網の抵抗は通常網より 15 ~ 30 %少ない。有漁獲の場合の離底の高さは,ベーリング海では 20 ~ 45 cmである。曳網中におけるチェーンの吹かれの形状を理論的に求めた結果,適正のチェーン径は 16 mm(16 φ) となる。またチェーンの吹かれを考慮すると,適正の曳網速力は 3. 5 ノット以下となる...|$|R

HCR profiles are more complicated than standard involute profiles, they have a greater predisposition for interference, pointed tip thickness and undercut of teeth during production (primary production interference). Due to increased addendum height, there is a larger possibility of some interference or pointed tooth tip occurring.

Shipping is also adapting fast to this scenario with higher <b>capacity</b> <b>geared</b> vessels and other type of multimodal ships. This capacity increase is being used in civil and industrial construction (occasionally even in building construction) by developing prefabrication and modularization since it opens the possibility to handle bigger and heavier pieces. The advantages for construction are very important: better safety because work can be achieved without working on heights, better quality because of working in a more controlled environment (prefabrication yards, factories, etc.), improving the schedules by working on several parts simultaneously, price reductions by optimizing construction methods, global sequence and locations...|$|R
30|$|A public {{passenger}} {{transit system}} is complex, {{because it involves}} two types of traffic unit, passengers and vehicles. The system operations require supplying passengers with stations where they can access vehicles and then travel in them between stations. These operations are subject to various capacity constraints, depending on the traffic type and {{the situation in the}} system. The article provides a framework for the analysis of a mass transit system, broken down into four subsystems that respectively pertain to the Passenger, the Vehicle, the Station and the Line. Each subsystem consists of several components that are involved in the system processes and interactions. Within this framework, capacity phenomena are identified, described qualitatively and classified into seven broad categories, namely: (i) the vehicle capacity of an infrastructure; (ii) the vehicle fleet; (iii) the passenger capacity of a vehicle; (iv) the passenger capacity of a route; (v) the passenger capacity of a station; (vi) the vehicle storage and movement capacity of a station; (vii) the capacity of a station for interface with personal transport modes. Moreover, it is shown that capacity phenomena can interact in congestion <b>gears,</b> which impair <b>capacity.</b> Lastly, there are complex retroactive effects that involve either network management or demand behaviour (through route choice which depends on quality of service hence on congestion).|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of fishing capacity requires reliable estimates of current capacity, {{and to this}} end most countries have developed a form of capacity measure usually based on some physical characteristics of the fleet. In the United Kingdom, the "capacity" measurement system currently in place is {{used as the basis}} of existing capacity reduction programmes. Each vessel has a number of Vessel Capacity Units (VCUs) defined by its size and engine power. An assumption is made that this measure is related to the ability of the fleet to catch fish. More recently, techniques have been developed to measure capacity directly in terms of potential output. In this paper, the fishing capacity of a sample of UK otter trawlers and a set of boats that primarily use static gear (i. e. nets and lines) is estimated using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Estimates are made on a species-by-species basis for the key species harvested. These are compared to the existing measures of physical capacity. The results suggest that VCUs may provide a reasonable approximation of fishing capacity for fleets using mobile gear, but may be inappropriate for fleets using static <b>gear.</b> Implications for <b>capacity</b> management based on the physical measures, given the results, are drawn...|$|R

40|$|The design {{standard}} VDI 2736 - 2 : 2014 is {{the most}} recent standard dedicated to the design and rating of thermoplastic cylindrical <b>gears.</b> Its load-carrying <b>capacity</b> methods are based primarily on DIN 3990 for rating metal gears, and there are few research studies on how the standard compares to experimental results. VDI 2736 - 2 : 2014 has been implemented as a new feature into the gearbox design and analysis software MASTA to give design engineers user-friendly computational access to the standard and help facilitate a quick and efficient validation of its rating methods against experimental results. An ongoing polymer gear performance test plan is being undertaken at the University of Warwick. One {{aim of the research}} being undertaken is to understand further the application and limitations of the current rating methods. In this paper the results of a group of tests for dry-running Nylon against Nylon gears, available in the literature, are compared against VDI 2736. The bending fatigue life obtained from the tests was found to agree well with the VDI 2736 calculated value at a specific torque but exceed it for higher torques. Further results are required before any strong conclusions can be made about the applicability of VDI 2736 for calculating Nylon root strength fatigue life. Having VDI 2736 implemented in MASTA will help significantly with future validation as further experimental results become available...|$|R
