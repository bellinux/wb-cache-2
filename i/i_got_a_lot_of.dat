The Complete X-Files notes that the [...] "chess motif" [...] was carried on throughout the episode, most notably in the fact that The Smoking Man [...] "plays Mulder to a checkmate, using Jeffrey as a pawn." [...] Because of this, and his past actions, many perceived The Smoking Man as the true villain of the story. William B. Davis, who played The Smoking Man, however, felt that the character was the hero of the story. He noted, [...] "I used to go to conventions and try to convince everyone that I was the hero of the series and Mulder was the bad guy. [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> laughs, but it's certainly true of how one plays the character. Nobody thinks they're evil." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{writing his}} 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes {{intended}} for male listeners, Bilal wrote A Love Surreal for female listeners with lyrics about love. He described writing the album as a surrealistic exploration of love. He {{was inspired by}} the surrealism of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, after viewing a 2005 Salvador Dalí exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title. [...] "For the longest I was supposed to sign with [...] and actually put Love for Sale out, but you know, things happen", Bilal told Okayplayer. [...] "It's surreal that I'm right back at the same spot about to put out a record with them. Also, surreal – the word surrealism – my inspiration for this record, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> concepts from Salvador Dali and the way he made his art pieces, it almost looks three-dimensional, and I wanted to do that with the sound of this album. So this record is almost like a sonic art piece." [...] Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in The Times, the character of Edina was based on Lynne Franks. Franks believed Saunders had observed her and her children in detail after joining them on a family holiday. Josh Howie, Franks' son, reported that his mother was upset because one of her best friends [...] "had taken the piss out of her" [...] in a TV show. Saunders revealed in 2012 that she was also inspired by pop band Bananarama with whom she and Dawn French had become friends after their Comic Relief collaboration in 1989. [...] "The nights with Bananarama were some of the best nights of my life, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> gags from Bananarama because they were big vodka drinkers...when I started doing AbFab, I remembered all of the falls that I saw Bananarama do.

I felt like I {{was a little bit}} light down in Turns 1 and 2 — I should have been a little bit quicker down there — but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> out of it in 3 and 4, so it was a great lap." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Kano, {{the editor}} in chief of Rockin'On Japan, he stated that the lyrical content {{discusses}} themes of mystery and daily life actions; he furthered believed that the song's lyrics is an open interpretation, due to its lack of major characteristics and identified philosophy and religion as examples. In an interview that promoted her fifth Japanese studio album Ultra Blue (2005) and her single [...] "Passion", which is the follow to [...] "Hikari", Utada felt the writing process was difficult. She believed that the plot to Kingdom Hearts was soulless, and was unable to become inspired by it to write the song. She further explained; [...] "when I was making the song 'Hikari', the whole outlook for the game and its entry onto the world was so crucial that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more info on the characters (so that 'Hikari' would mirror the image that they wanted)." ...|$|R
