40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} case for research in <b>environmental</b> management <b>accounting</b> and/or <b>environmental</b> cost <b>accounting.</b> The paper provides an analysis of the current status of environmental management and/or <b>environmental</b> cost <b>accounting</b> at the industry level. The author explores the extent of management research in the field of corporate sustainability management and <b>environmental</b> management <b>accounting.</b> The study employs a survey method for identifying factors to adopt <b>environmental</b> cost <b>accounting</b> and its guidelines within organizations in Korean manufacturing industry contexts. The paper uncovers those manufacturing industries' views on motivations and obstacles to adopt <b>environmental</b> cost <b>accounting</b> and its guidelines, and general perceptions on related issues. It is found that there is a lack of a systematically structured approach to implement <b>environmental</b> cost <b>accounting</b> internally in practice. The study also finds that some difficulties to adopt <b>environmental</b> cost <b>accounting</b> in practice are caused by the existing accounting and information system. The paper suggests where further contributions might be made by future research endeavours engaging with different industry sectors and country levels. No Full Tex...|$|R

The paper adopted the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to test the hypotheses. The findings are based on 118 Iranian manufacturing and consumer product firms in 2014. The findings reveal that the link between <b>environmental</b> management <b>accounting</b> and financial performance is a partial mediated relationship. Positive effect of <b>environmental</b> management <b>accounting</b> on financial performance is due to the positive effect <b>environmental</b> management <b>accounting</b> has on both product and process innovation on one hand and positive affect that innovation has on financial performance on the other.
