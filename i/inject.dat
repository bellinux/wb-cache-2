Overall, therefore, there were fewer injectors in prison, but {{a higher proportion of}} these shared needles.

Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of <b>injecting</b> drug use and associated risk behaviour among a sentinel sample of ecstasy users. Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted with regular ecstasy users as part of an annual monitoring study of ecstasy and related drug markets in all Australian capital cities. Results: Twenty-three percent of the sample reported having ever <b>injected</b> a drug and 15 % reported <b>injecting</b> in the 6 months preceding interview. Independent predictors of lifetime injection were older age, unemployment and having ever been in prison. Completion of secondary school and identifying as heterosexual was associated with a lower likelihood of having ever <b>injected.</b> Participants who had recently <b>injected</b> typically did so infrequently; only 9 % reported daily <b>injecting.</b> Methamphetamine was the most commonly <b>injected</b> drug. Prevalence of needle sharing was low (6 %), although half (47 %) reported sharing other <b>injecting</b> equipment in the preceding 6 months. Conclusions: Ecstasy users who report having <b>injected</b> a drug at some time appear to be demographically different to ecstasy users who have not <b>injected</b> although neither are they typical of other drug injectors. The current investigation suggests that ongoing monitoring of <b>injecting</b> among regular ecstasy users is warranted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely <b>inject</b> much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years.
