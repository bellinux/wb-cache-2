Hibernation {{is a means}} of avoiding the burden of saving unsaved data before shutting down and restoring all running programs after powering back on. Hibernation is used in laptops, which have limited battery power available. It can be set to happen automatically on a low battery alarm. Most desktops also support hibernation, mainly as a general energy saving measure.|$|E
500|$|Beck, Page, Hopkins, Jones, and Moon {{were pleased}} with {{the outcome of the}} {{recording}} session and there was talk of forming a working group and additional recordings. [...] This led to the famous quip, [...] "Yeah, it'll go <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lead zeppelin", which Page later used, with a slight spelling change, for his new group. Page ascribed it to Moon, while Beck's and Led Zeppelin's later manager Peter Grant claimed Moon used the phrase [...] "go <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lead balloon", to which Entwistle added [...] "more like a lead zeppelin". [...] Entwistle, on the other hand, insists that he came up with the name independently along with the idea of using an image of [...] "a Zeppelin going down in flames" [...] for an album cover. Led Zeppelin biographer Keith Shadwick notes that forming an actual group at the time [...] "was never a realistic option", due to existing contractual obligations.|$|E

[...] The vision came true. France announced their return to full participation at the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit.|$|E
500|$|Moon {{may have}} {{inspired}} {{the name for}} Led Zeppelin. When he briefly considered leaving the Who in 1966, he spoke with Entwistle and Page about forming a supergroup. Moon (or Entwistle) remarked that a particular suggestion had gone <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "lead zeppelin" [...] (a play on [...] "lead balloon"). Although the supergroup was never formed, Page remembered the phrase and later adapted it as {{the name of his}} new band.|$|E

Madonna wanted a raw documentary look for the video which allowed her to be portrayed more realistically. Regarding the making of [...] "Hung Up", Renck {{said that it was}} a massive work to undertake, [...] "It's like you form this little family that's flourished and prospered for the month, and then you chop it <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tree, [...] You come out with a sense of yearning and longing, like, 'Can we just do that again?

500|$|Resnick {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to design the memorial after a nationwide competition. His initial vision for the memorial was a [...] "free form" [...] but generally circular shape, set within a reflecting pool. [...] However, because money was being raised for the memorial by groups in all 50 states in the U.S., as well as groups in Washington, D.C., a vision of columns for each of those locations ultimately helped him {{come up with the}} concept of a tree trunk, linked to the idea that Kennedy's life had been cut <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tree that is felled in its prime. [...] The courtyard below the memorial includes a number of plaques acknowledging contributions by individuals and groups.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers held differing {{opinions}} on the game's setting and themes. Sumner stated the game is [...] "dragged down by distasteful graphics and a horribly grim inlay." [...] Roberts described the game as [...] "sick", adding [...] "I only recommend Soft & Cuddly to {{those of you who}} cut your toenails with a carving knife!" [...] Douglas was critical of the game's themes; he described playing Soft & Cuddly as [...] "watching very large and unpleasant graphics jigging up and <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> box of offal". Tony Lee of Your Sinclair was more positive, stating, [...] "This is a very sick game indeed, but fortunately I have a very sick sense of humour." ...|$|E

500|$|Dee's {{frequent}} collaborator Pete Sinclair {{joined him}} to write the pilot script. The two worked for two weeks developing the characters and forming storylines from them, which prepared them for writing the series proper when it was commissioned. The two were strongly influenced in their writing by the [...] "paradigm shift" [...] of The Office that made [...] "natural conversation" [...] funny without a studio audience being present. Dee cites the early films of Woody Allen, Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm as other [...] "cultural influences" [...] that helped set {{the tone of the}} series. Controller of BBC Four Janice Hadlow stated the series was in the [...] "same ballpark" [...] as Curb, though it is not quite as autobiographical. The name Lead Balloon comes from the expression [...] "To go <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lead balloon", meaning to be received badly by an audience.|$|E
500|$|The band {{completed}} the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing {{together for the}} first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs. After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only. One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "lead balloon", an idiom for disastrous results. The group dropped the 'a' in lead at the suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it [...] "leed". The word [...] "balloon" [...] was replaced by [...] "zeppelin", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought [...] "the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace" [...] to Page's mind.|$|E
500|$|Swift's vocals {{have been}} {{described}} by Sophie Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter as [...] "sweet, but soft". In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identified Swift's [...] "defining" [...] vocal gesture as [...] "the line that slides <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy". Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: [...] "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough." [...] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously [...] "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's {{learned how to make}} words sound like what they mean." [...] The Hollywood Reporter opines that her live vocals are [...] "fine", but they do not match those of her peers. In 2009, they were also described as [...] "flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt". However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.|$|E

500|$|Writers of Billboard {{magazine}} called [...] "Rocket" [...] a [...] "baby-making anthem" [...] in the vein of Zapp, which finds the singer [...] "fully equipped for the occasion". Commenting it was [...] "a primer on what sex with Beyoncé is like", Chris Bosman from the website Consequence of Sound concluded the track [...] "beats R. Kelly {{at his own}} game of pairing hyper-specific, 'so ridiculous they're incredible' bedroom euphemisms with the most classic of soul vibes". Writer Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune noted that Beyoncé's voice turned into a [...] "lust-saturated choir" [...] on the track. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt the [...] "sumptuous" [...] song provided a room for the singer to [...] "flex her impressive stylistic chops". Jody Rosen in Vulture also {{described it as a}} [...] "sumptuous old-fashioned soul ballad, [...] goes <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> profiterole". Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar advised people who thought D'Angelo's [...] "Untitled [...] " [...] is [...] "the sexiest song ever" [...] to hear [...] "Rocket". Lindsey Weber of Vulture considered it an ode to [...] "Untitled" [...] and summed it up as [...] "insanely sexy". [...] Editor Caitlin White writing for the website The 405 noted how the singer managed to reveal her true side in [...] "Rocket" [...] while making herself the dominant lover.|$|E
500|$|Hordern {{viewed the}} 1950s {{as a good}} decade to appear in film, {{although}} he did not then particularly care for the medium. Writing in 1993 he said: [...] "With cinema one has to leap into battle fully armed. From the start of the film the character has to be pinned <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> butterfly on a board. One does not always get this right, of course, sometimes starting at the beginning of shooting a film on a comedic level that cannot be sustained." [...] He disliked his physical appearance, which he found to be [...] "repulsive", and as a result loathed watching back his performances. He preferred radio because the audience only heard his voice, which he then considered his best attribute. Another reason was his recognition of the differences between his sense of personal achievement within a theatre compared to that on a film set: [...] "You get a certain sort of satisfaction in delivering what the director wants of you, but the chances of being emotionally involved are slim." [...] He acknowledged his good ability at learning lines, something which he found to be especially helpful for learning film scripts which frequently changed. [...] He enjoyed the challenge of earning as much value as possible out of a scene and revelled in being able to hit [...] "the right mark for the camera". With the experience of Nina still fresh in his mind, Hordern took a break from the stage and decided to concentrate on his film career.|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{said that}} [...] "Losts return goes <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> welcome tonic as scripted TV fades to black... {{providing}} an unusually generous array of juicy moments {{for the large}} (and, at times, neglected) cast." [...] Mark Medley of the National Post called it [...] "a brilliant season premiere" [...] with multiple [...] "jaw-dropping moments". [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly felt that the premiere was mind-blowing and featured good acting by Garcia. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press wrote that [...] "Lost is further upping the ante, and heightening the pressure on us as the show's vast mythology continues to metastasize." [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! called it [...] "so well written, produced, acted and directed {{it felt like a}} movie". [...] Michael Ausiello of TV Guide described it as [...] "easily one of the best hours of TV so far this season." [...] Bruce Fretts of TV Guide responded well to Reddick's performance. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode 9.1/10, stating that it was [...] "a great start to what promises to be an exciting... season 4. [...] The momentum and pacing is on par with last season's finale". [...] LTG of Television Without Pity graded it as an [...] "A–". [...] Jon Lachonis of UGO gave the episode an [...] "A+", calling it [...] "a crushingly emotional, action packed introduction... that... Losts groundbreaking protean form still has plenty of blinding ways to dazzle and entertain {{in a way that is}} nonetheless unique unto itself." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV wrote that [...] "the episode was pretty much a masterpiece". [...] Daniel of TMZ graded it as an [...] "A", saying that it was perfect and set up the rest of the season well.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} a generally positive response from film critics, being commended on {{the subtlety of}} its humor {{as well as being}} named as [...] "the funniest" [...] or [...] "one of the funniest" [...] films of the year by several critics. As of June 3, 2017, the aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes registered an 84% positive response based on reviews from 146 critics and certified the film [...] "Fresh" [...] with an average rating of 6.9/10. As of the same date, Metacritic, another aggregate review website, registered a rating of 73 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, which is classified as [...] "Generally favorable reviews" [...] by the website's rating system. Kenneth Turan, film critic for Los Angeles Times, called it [...] "the funniest film of the year so far, possibly the most amusing mainstream live-action comedy since There's Something About Mary." [...] Critic Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal stated that the film [...] "does almost everything right with a story about everything going wrong" [...] and that it [...] "works up a major comic delirium on the theme of Murphy's Law", concluding that [...] "Meet the Parents is the funniest movie of the year." [...] CNN's Paul Clinton proclaimed [...] "Meet the Parents {{is one of the best}} comedies of this – or any other – year", calling it [...] "wonderfully funny" [...] and expressing his hope that [...] "the Academy will also recognize this wonderful movie, something it rarely does when it comes to comedies" [...] Time magazine's film critic Richard Schickel stated that the film was [...] "divinely invented and perfectly orchestrated". He complimented the screenplay by calling the screenwriters Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg [...] "a couple of skilled tool-and-die makers" [...] as well as the acting cast because he believed that they [...] "understand that palpable reality will always trump frenzied fantasy when it comes to getting laughs." [...] Schickel concluded his review by proclaiming Meet the Parents a [...] "superbly antic movie". Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine called the film [...] "flat-out hilarious" [...] and Neil Smith of BBC proclaimed that [...] "there's not a weak scene in this super-funny picture" [...] while awarding it a rating of five stars out of five. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four comparing the film to Roach's previous work on the Austin Powers film series and offering his opinion that [...] " [...] is funnier because it never tries too hard." [...] Critic Christopher Null of AMC's Filmcritic.com claimed that [...] "Meet the Parents is one of the funniest comedies I've seen since Annie Hall". Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly called the script [...] "unforced" [...] and concluded that the film [...] "goes <b>down</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> flute of Champagne, leaving an aftertaste of giggles." ...|$|E
