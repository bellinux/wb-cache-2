The Carmelite Rite, based on the Rite of the Holy Sepulchre, was used by the Ancient Observance branch of the Carmelite Order {{from the time of the}} first hermits on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land in the late 12th century, until Vatican II at which time the Carmelites began to celebrate the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass. The <b>first</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Carmel was given to the Carmelites by Saint Albert of Jerusalem, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who in that time was exiled in the city of Acre, Israel, from which place Mount Carmel was visible to the south.|$|E

[...] The heraldic metals are gold and silver, usually represented as yellow and white, while red, green, blue, purple and black normally comprise the colors. Heraldic bearings are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a contrast of light metal against dark color is desirable. The same principle {{can be seen in}} the choice of colors for most license plates.|$|E

As the Judge Advocate {{states in the}} novel, [...] "the President's <b>first</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact". It {{can be argued that}} Camila represents hope in the novel because both her father and husband were able to persevere under the dictatorship by thinking of her; however, the President destroys this sense of hope with false stories. When the thought of her loyalty is eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her. Furthermore, Camila's happiness with her child and their escape to the countryside {{can be seen as the}} one glimpse of hope in an otherwise dark and disturbing ending. For critic Jean Franco, it is love that offers what little hope there is in the novel: [...] "The system is undermined only by lovethe love of an idiot for his mother, a woman trying desperately to save her husband from death." ...|$|E

Worsley, writing in The Telegraph, calls Food in England [...] "the definitive {{history of the}} way the English eat." [...] She describes the book as [...] "laden with odd facts and folklore ... a curious mixture of cookery, history, anthropology and even magic, ... with her own strong and lively illustrations." [...] She admits it is not a conventional history, since Hartley breaks [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> the historian: to cite her evidence. She wasn't fond of footnotes." [...] In a year of filming Hartley's places and people she knew, Worsley discovered that [...] "my frustration with her technique as historian was misplaced." [...] Hartley had travelled continually to gather materials for her weekly Daily Sketch column, sometimes sleeping rough [...] "in a hedge." [...] The work is thus effectively, Worsley argues, an oral history, as Hartley interviewed [...] "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing something in common with the Tudors." [...] The emphasis on local, seasonal food chimes well, Worsley suggests, with the modern trend for just those things.|$|E

Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the [...] "Shawarma scene" [...] in The Avengers, explaining, [...] "It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right.
