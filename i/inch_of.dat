5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E

Any suggestion of its withdrawal back to the river Rhine to obtain a better fighting position - given the Third Reich's weakening strength against the Allied torrent of men and material - was forbidden, and it was ordered to conduct its actions from now on upon the strategic basis of not yielding an <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> ground and an abandonment of tactical manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|In the 1903 CAHL season, Ottawa and the Montreal Victorias both {{finished}} {{in first place}} with 6–2 records. The top scorers were the Victorias' Russell Bowie, who scored seven goals in one game and six in another, and McGee, whose top performance saw him score five goals in a game. The two clubs faced off in a two-game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup. The first game, played in Montreal on slushy ice that made it a desperate struggle to score, ended 1–1. The return match in Ottawa, witnessed by three thousand fans, was on ice coated with an <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> water. The conditions did not hinder Ottawa, as they won 8–0, with McGee scoring three goals and the other five shared among the three Gilmour brothers, Dave (3), Suddy (1) and Bill (1), to win their first Cup.

5|$|Tropical Storm Karen {{produced}} {{light to}} moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with {{a gust of}} 64mph (103km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26mph (42km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.

Skewed to {{the left side of the}} transitioning storm, the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast-moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around half an <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> rain. A buoy in Halifax Harbour reported wave heights of up to 16.7feet (5.1m), causing breaking waves at docks white caps along the ocean. Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches. There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.|$|E
