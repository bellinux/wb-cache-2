5000|$|One of {{the unusual}} {{aspects of the}} Aldenham {{overhaul}} concept was the [...] "Works Float" [...] system. As chassis generally took less time to overhaul than did the bodies, this {{would have resulted in}} chassis cluttering up the works awaiting completed bodies. This required the number of bodies in the overhaul system to be greater than the number of chassis in the works. To provide this, a number of vehicle identifications became part of the works float and disappeared off the road, sometimes for years. Effectively, these buses ceased to exist except on paper, to provide the necessary spare components to allow the works float system to operate. This system permitted the number of road licences held to be less than the number of buses in existence, the unlicensed vehicles effectively being the vehicles under overhaul - a considerable <b>financial</b> <b>saving.</b> A system of separate chassis and body numbers was utilised to keep track of these major components. The works float system ceased in the mid-1980s when the practice of body separation was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} of Labour in October 1964 {{did not stop}} the programme of Beeching closures, despite the party's manifesto commitment to halt major closures. The intention remained {{to proceed with the}} closure of the Waverley Route, although the timing of the proposal was a matter of debate between the new Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Willie Ross, who was acutely aware of the sensitivity of the closure proposal for the Borders region and the wider context of Scottish economic development. The proposal for the closure of the entire line and its 24 stations was finally issued on 17 August 1966 with the mention that closure would take place on 2 January 1967 if no objections were received; replacement bus services were to be provided by Eastern Scottish. British Rail estimated that a net <b>financial</b> <b>saving</b> of £232,000 would be made from closure. 508 objections to closure were lodged with the Transport Users' Consultative Committee (TUCC) in Edinburgh within the allotted six-week period, and a public hearing was held in Hawick on 16 and 17 November 1966. Representatives from the County councils of Berwickshire, Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire and the town councils of Galashiels, Jedburgh, Innerleithen, Hawick, Kelso, Selkirk and Peebles attended the meeting to fight the case against closure. There were no representatives from English councils; only Northumberland had contacted the TUCC requesting to be informed of the outcome. Arguments made against closure included the inadequacies of local roads and the damage which would be caused to the fabric of Borders life, whilst British Rail pointed to the falling patronage of the line and the increased car ownership in the area. The TUCC's 15-page report was submitted to Barbara Castle in December 1966, but it was only in April 1968 that she reached the conclusion that the annual subsidy required for the line's retention - £700,000 for the whole route or £390,000 for Hawick-Edinburgh - could not be justified. In the meantime, British Rail's Network for Development plans published in May 1967 confirmed that the line was neither considered as a trunk route to be developed, nor as a rural branch line qualifying for subsidy on social grounds.|$|E

We focus on the dry bulk Panamax segment as it contributes to around 50 Mt (5 %) of total CO 2 emissions from shipping in 2007 and therefore its importance in terms of environmental impact should not be neglected. The time charter market represents a classical example of the principal–agent problem similar to the tenant–landlord problem in the buildings sector. We discovered that on average only 40 % of the <b>financial</b> <b>savings</b> delivered by energy efficiency accrue to ship owner for the period 2008 – 2012.

40|$|Includes bibliographyPension system reforms seek {{to combine}} and {{reconcile}} {{both economic and}} social functions. On the basis of both conceptual aspects and the actual experience of Chile, this article illustrates the difficulties encountered {{in trying to make}} reforms ensure the fulfillment of both types of functions. These difficulties stem from two factors: i); the need to consider the reform of the pension system as a whole, where, parallel with the capitalization component, it is necessary to develop another pay-as-you-go component to finance the costs of the transition from one pension system to another, minimum pensions, and social welfare pensions; and ii); the need to distinguish between <b>financial</b> <b>saving</b> and real saving (or national saving in the national accounts sense); and to study the financial sector's capacity to intermediate <b>financial</b> <b>saving</b> towards real investment. The Chilean experience confirms this view. The fiscal resources needed to finance the cost of the transition and the other items of the pay-as-you-go component represent flows which exceed those coming from workers' contributions, thus affecting the size and composition of the net flows of savings generated by the reforms. Furthermore, the relatively incipient nature of the capital markets and the regulation needed to ensure protection of the workers' pension funds in an investment portfolio approach {{make it more difficult to}} turn this <b>financial</b> <b>saving</b> into real investment. In the final analysis, although both types of functions include objectives which are desirable from the point of view of public policies, the mere reform of pension systems to change them from predominantly pay-as-you-go systems to others with substantial capitalization components does not guarantee that such objectives will be achieved...|$|E

40|$|In India, {{the pace}} of {{financial}} innovation was relatively slow until the initiation of the financial liberalization program in 1991 - 92. The subsequent financial reforms have had important implications for the user costs of assets and resulted in significant substitution among them.

As user costs of assets change so does the composition of the <b>financial</b> <b>savings</b> aggregate. An advantage of monetary aggregates that are derived from such microeconomic models is that no a priori assumptions about the substitutability of assets need to be imposed. A Divisia aggregate has some theoretical advantages in this regard but since the estimation of this aggregate is computationally difficult, the extent of its superiority over the simple sum becomes an empirical question.
