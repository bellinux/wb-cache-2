The addition of quaternary amine additives contribute to the improved metal distribution between high and low current density areas. Depending upon the desired performance, the <b>electroplater</b> can select the highest zinc content for increased productivity or lower zinc content for a better throwing power (into low current density areas).For ideal metal distribution, Zn metal evolutes between 6-14 g/L (0.8-1.9 oz/gal) and NaOH at 120 g/L (16 oz/gal). But for the highest productivity, Zn metal is between 14-25 g/L (1.9-3.4 oz/gal) and NaOH remains at 120 g/L (16 oz/gal).Alkaline Non Cyanide Zinc Process contains lower concentration zinc metal concentration 6-14 g/L (0.8-1.9 oz/gal) or higher zinc metal concentration 14-25 g/L (1.9-3.4 oz/gal) provides superior plate distribution from high current density to low current density or throwing power when compared to any acidic baths such as chloride based (Low ammonium chloride, Potassium chloride / Ammonium Chloride) - or (non-ammonium chloride, potassium chloride/Boric acid) or sulfate baths.|$|E

The feature hole exposes these fingers to plating on all sides, while the test pads are exposed on only one side. In addition, the fingers are small in cross section (typically. 003 x. 0015 inches). Recent thickness measurements indicate that plating around the lead frame fingers is nearly twice as thick as that on test pad areas.

Romanian {{health and}} safety {{regulations}} require employers to monitor the exposure by a suitable procedure in any case where {{it is necessary for}} ensuring the maintenance of adequate control of exposure of employees to hazardous substances. Objectives. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the occupational exposure risk of electroplating plant’s workers. Materials and methods. Indoor air quality was evaluated by workplace measurements of chemicals in two cadmium-nickel-chrome electroplating and zinc coating units. For the determination of internal exposure 69 workers (mean age: 42. 7 ± 6. 3 years, mean exposure length: 20 ± 7. 4), including 28 women, and a matched control group (72 subjects) were examined in a cross-sectional study. Whole blood samples were analyzed for cadmium and post-shift urine samples for beta 2 -microglobulin. The dermal exposure levels of heavy metals were measured by wipe sampling in combination with adequate analytical techniques. 23 <b>electroplaters</b> belonging to workplaces with major risk were analyzed for chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in peripheral lymphocytes.

40|$|Background: Great {{concern about}} {{occupational}} exposure to chromium (Cr [VI]) has been reported due to escalated risk {{of lung cancer}} in exposed workers. Consequences of occupational exposure to Cr (VI) have been reported as oxidative stress and lung tissue damage. Objective: To investigate the feasibility of biological effect monitoring of chrome electroplaters through analysis of serum malondialdehyde (MDA). Methods: 90 workers directly involved in chrome electroplating—categorized into three equal groups based on their job as near bath workers, degreaser, and washers—and 30 workers without exposure to Cr (VI), served as the control group, were studied. Personal samples were collected and analyzed according to NIOSH method 7600. Serum MDA level was measured by HPLC using a UV detector. Results: Median Cr (VI) exposure level was 0. 38 mg/m 3 in near bath workers, 0. 20 mg/m 3  in degreasers, and 0. 05 mg/m 3 in washers. The median serum MDA level of three exposed groups (2. 76 μmol/L) was significantly (p< 0. 001) higher than that {{in the control group}} (2. 00  μmol/L). There was a positive correlation between electroplaters' level of exposure to Cr (VI)  and their serum MDA level (Spearman's ρ 0. 806, p< 0. 001).

40|$|A new design, called {{electrodialysis}} {{ion exchange}} (or EDIX), has been {{development at the}} University of Connecticut that is a pollution prevention technique for metal finishers and <b>electroplaters.</b> By integrating the concepts of electrodialysis and ion exchange, the EDIX system separates and concentrates dilute concentrations of copper or nickel ions from wastewaters for recycle to the plating bath while the purified water is reused as process rinse waters. The EDIX cell is a five compartment electrodialysis cell, separated by ion exchange membranes, with ion exchange resins in each compartment. The resins mainly aid in improving the conductivity of the cell. Resins are continuously regenerated on-line by an electric field, {{so there is no}} need for additional chemicals. ^ The EDIX system has been shown to be operational on a pilot-plant scale for a feed flowrate of 1 liter per minute. For a feed concentration of 5 ppm Cu 2 + ions, a Cu 2 + concentrate concentration of 60 ppm and purified water concentration of 0. 4 ppm Cu 2 + ions were obtained using a current density of 11 mA/cm 2 with a membrane area of 480 cm 2. Most of the EDIX experiments were operated under current-limiting conditions (rather than molar flow-limiting conditions) such that problems of Cu(OH) 2 precipitation and copper reduction inside the cell were not an issue. Low counter flowrates allow higher concentrate concentrations due to the higher residence time of the ions in the concentrate compartment. Higher current densities allow higher exit concentrations by shifting the equilibrium of the ions in solution with the ions adsorbed on the resins. Differences in using strong and weak cation resins play an important role in the location of these resins inside the EDIX cell. Heterogeneous membranes, as opposed to the homogeneous type, perform better for Cu 2 + ion transport across the cell. A new technique and experimental apparatus was developed for characterizing membranes in terms of their effective diffusion coefficients. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to {{chromium}} during electroplating is a recognised though poorly characterised {{cause of}} occupational asthma. The first series of such patients {{referred to a}} specialist occupational lung disease clinic is reported. METHODS: The diagnosis of occupational asthma was made from a history of asthma with rest day improvement and confirmed by specific bronchial provocation testing with potassium dichromate and nickel chloride. RESULTS: Seven workers {{had been exposed to}} chrome and nickel fumes from electroplating for eight months to six years before asthma developed. One subject, although exposed for 11 years without symptoms, developed asthma after a single severe exposure during a ventilation failure. This was the only subject who had never smoked. The diagnosis was confirmed by specific bronchial challenges. Two workers had isolated immediate reactions, one a late asthmatic reaction, and four a dual response following exposure to nebulised potassium dichromate at 1 - 10 mg/ml. Two of the four subjects were also challenged with nebulised nickel chloride at 0. 1 - 10 mg/ml. Two showed isolated late asthmatic reactions, in one at 0. 1 mg/ml, where nickel was probably the primary sensitising agent. Four workers carried out two hourly measurements of peak expiratory flow over days at and away from work. All were scored as having occupational asthma using OASYS- 2. Breathing zone air monitoring was carried out in 60 workers from four decorative and two hard chrome plating shops from workers with similar jobs to those sensitised. No measurement exceeded the current occupational exposure standard for chromate or nickel, the mean levels of chromate exposure for jobs {{similar to those of the}} affected workers were 9 - 15 micrograms/m 3. CONCLUSION: Chrome used in electroplating is a potential cause of occupational asthma. Sensitivity to chrome in <b>electroplaters</b> may occur in situations where exposure levels are likely to be within the current exposure standards. There may be cross reactivity with nickel. Inhalation challenge with nebulised potassium dichromate solution is helpful in making the specific diagnosis where doubt exists. ...|$|R
