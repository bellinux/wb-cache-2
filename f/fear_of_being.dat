5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{story from}} western Arnhem Land tells of Black Cockatoo {{and her husband}} Crow, who are Bird-people, sprouting black feathers after becoming afflicted with a sickness from across the sea to the north. In <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> buried underground, they transform into birds and fly high in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published the results in American Anthropologist. Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was also possible that the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> {{negative}} evaluations {{from others}} {{is known to}} consist <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> negatively evaluated by friends, by parents, and by teachers. This study investigates the roles of parental attitudes and social experiences in controlling such fears. Fifth- through ninth-grade students (N= 350) participated in a questionnaire survey. Multiple-group structural equation modeling of the responses was conducted to investigate gender differences within {{a model of the}} relationships between this fear and its controlling factors. The results indicate that the model is applicable for both genders. They also reveal that autonomy-granting parenting is negatively correlated factor against <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluations by parents. Accordingly, such parenting may be an effective controlling factor against <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluations from parents. On the other hand, the results also indicate that there were no significant relationships between experiences <b>of</b> <b>being</b> accepted by parents, peers or teachers and <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> negatively evaluated by others. Thus, this study failed to illuminate any social experiences that can control the <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> negatively evaluated by others...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of his bestselling books, Speer donated a considerable amount of money to Jewish charities. According to Siedler, these donations were as high as 80% of his royalties. Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection, and for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> called a hypocrite.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's {{relationship}} with Béla IV deteriorated {{in the early}} 1260s. Stephen's charters reveal his <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disinherited and expelled by his father. He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him. On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|On October26, the Honduran Permanent Contingency Commission {{coordinated with}} {{neighboring}} countries regarding the storm. Officials initially issued {{a state of}} emergency for the offshore islands and five coastal departments, which was later extended {{to the rest of the}} country. The government increased emergency spending and created a National Emergency Commission. Officials advised residents to evacuate in flood-prone areas, although many people stayed for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> looted. Some left to stay with relatives during the hurricane. Prisoners in Tegucigalpa Central Penitentiary were evacuated to the national stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} military program, the , wherein fifty randomly selected classes of third-year junior {{high school students are}} kidnapped, dropped into a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> killed by a friend.|$|E
5|$|The mid-18th century saw an {{upsurge in}} the public's <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> mistakenly buried alive, and much {{debate about the}} {{uncertainty}} of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of sexual}} {{interaction}} are kissing, sexual touching, and sexual intercourse.

50|$|By August 1992 Fabrikant faced a {{contempt}} of court charge due to his behaviour during his suit. In addition, he had been conducting an email campaign against numerous members of the university. He claimed <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> killed in jail.|$|R
5|$|Tianshun {{proved to}} be a troubled time and Mongol forces within the Ming {{military}} structure continued to be problematic. On 7 August 1461, the Chinese general Cao Qin and his Ming troops of Mongol descent staged a coup against the Tianshun Emperor out of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> next on his purge-list of those who aided him in the Wresting the Gate Incident. Cao's rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the Imperial City (doused by rain during the battle) and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide.|$|E
5|$|When Cleomenes {{heard about}} the revolt at Argos, he sent his {{stepfather}} with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> encircled and left Corinth {{to fall into the}} hands of Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced his way into the city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.|$|E
5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, {{as a response to}} their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> exposed as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E

5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is off to}} Philadelphia to {{interview}} at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
5|$|In {{the face}} of a looming crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to throwing in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing {{for the first time in}} a club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E
5|$|On Henry's {{death in}} December 1135, Pain {{attended}} the king's funeral. Pain {{was an early}} supporter of King Stephen, although he was said initially to have been afraid to appear at Stephen's court for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> confronted by those he had oppressed. Nevertheless, Pain was with the new king by early January 1136, when he witnessed one of Stephen's documents, dated to around 4 January 1136, at Reading. By Easter, both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king. Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136. The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions, and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy {{provided}} the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Calcutta, 39 destroyers, {{and many other}} craft. The Merchant Navy supplied passenger ferries, hospital ships, and other vessels. Britain's Belgian, Dutch, Canadian, and French allies provided vessels as well. Admiral Ramsay arranged for around a thousand copies {{to be made of}} the required charts, had buoys laid around the Goodwin Sands and down to Dunkirk, and organised the flow of shipping. Larger ships such as destroyers were able to carry about 900 men per trip. The soldiers mostly travelled on the upper decks for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> trapped below if the ship sank. After the loss on 29 May of 19 British and French navy ships plus three of the larger requisitioned vessels, the Admiralty withdrew their eight best destroyers for the future defence of the country.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is mostly}} in English, {{but also has}} some subtitled Yiddish and Hebrew. The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and {{includes}} interviews with rabbis and psychotherapists about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality. During the film's six-year production, DuBowski met hundreds of homosexual Jews, but only a handful agreed to be filmed due to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> ostracized from their communities. Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only in silhouette or with their faces pixelized. The {{majority of the participants}} are American Jews, with one British and one Israeli Jew also featured. The film was successful at the box office, grossing over $788,896 on eight screens by its close date.|$|E
5|$|When Sierk Coolsma {{opened a}} missionary school in Buitenzorg on 31 May 1869, Lie {{was in the}} first class of ten. Once again {{studying}} in Sundanese, he took similar subjects to his time in Cianjur. Around this time he began studying Dutch. After a government-run school opened in 1872, most of Lie's classmates were ethnic Chinese; the Sundanese students, mostly Muslim, had transferred to the new school for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> converted to Christianity. In 1873 Coolsma was sent to Sumedang to translate the Bible into Sundanese and was replaced by fellow missionary D. J. van der Linden. Studies resumed in Malay, as van der Linden was unable to speak Sundanese. Lie and his new headmaster soon became close. The two later worked together at van der Linden's school and publishing house and shared an interest in traditional theatre, including wayang (puppets).|$|E
