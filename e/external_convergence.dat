30|$|Overall, {{the linkage}} between land and direct {{payments}} is always present {{in the background and}} strongly affects the correlation with farm income level and the redistributive effect of these types of aid. Moreover, especially in case of the flat rate, it exacerbates the transfer of public income support to land prices, reducing the effectiveness of the redistributive role of direct payments. Therefore, to obtain a better redistribution of payments, testing alternative parameters for allocating direct payments that substitute for or are combined with the current parameter (land) could be more effective than continuing to focus attention on redistributive tools/mechanisms (flat rate models, <b>external</b> <b>convergence,</b> degressivity, capping) or payments that can only reduce, but not eliminate, redistributive distortions caused by the connection between land and direct payments.|$|E

Through a Bayesian analysis we determine the expectation values (μ 0) and confidence levels of the underlying number counts {{for a range of}} apertures and magnitude bins. Our analysis has produced the following results: (i) we infer that our control samples are not consistent, with the number counts in the COSMOS sample being significantly higher than in the pure-parallel sample for 21 ≤F 814 W≤ 23. This result matches those found in previous analyses of COSMOS data using different techniques. (ii) We find that small-sized apertures, centred on strong lenses, are overdense compared with randomly placed apertures in the control samples, even compared to the COSMOS sample. Correcting for the local clustering of elliptical galaxies, based on the average two-point correlation function, reduces this overdensity to the 1 - 2 σ level. Thus, the overdensity of galaxies seen along a typical line of sight to a lens can be explained mostly by the natural clustering of galaxies, rather than being due to lenses lying along otherwise biased lines of sight. However, a larger sample of lenses is needed to see if the remaining bias persists when the lens-field uncertainties are smaller.

40|$|Matter near a {{gravitational}} lens galaxy or projected {{along the line}} of sight (LOS) can affect strong lensing observables by more than contemporary measurement errors. We simulate lens fields with realistic threedimensional mass configurations (self-consistently including voids), and then fit mock lensing observables with increasingly complex lens models to quantify biases and uncertainties associated with different ways of treating the lens environment (ENV) and LOS. We identify the combination of mass, projected offset, and redshift that determines the importance of a perturbing galaxy for lensing. Foreground structures have a stronger effect on the lens potential than background structures, due to nonlinear effects in the foreground and downweighting in the background. There is dramatic variation in the net strength of ENV/LOS effects across different lens fields; modeling fields individually yields stronger priors for H- 0 than ray tracing through N-body simulations. Models that ignore mass outside the lens yield poor fits and biased results. Adding external shear can account for tidal stretching from galaxies at redshifts z >= z(lens), but it requires corrections for <b>external</b> <b>convergence</b> and cannot reproduce nonlinear effects from foreground galaxies.

The <b>convergence</b> of different physical quantities of a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system, with the proposed control scheme, is ensured through the negative definiteness of the derivative of Lyapunov functions. The effects of external disturbances are considered during formulation of Lyapunov function and thus, the proposed excitation controller can ensure {{the stability of the}} SMIB system under the variation of critical parameters as well as external disturbances including noises. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is investigated with the inclusion of external disturbances in the SMIB system and its superiority is demonstrated through the comparison with an existing robust adaptive excitation controller. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides faster responses of physical quantities than the existing controller...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a concise {{analysis of the}} macroeconomic developments in four cohesion countries (CCs) Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, from 1960 to 2000. Special attention is being paid to the economic performance of these countries after their accession to the European Union (EU). The aim {{is to find out}} whether the new EU Accession Countries (ACs) from Central and Eastern Europe can learn from the experience of the CCs concerning future benefits and disadvantages resulting from accession. The study is divided into five major parts. The first part is devoted to methodological questions. In the second part the developments of major macroeconomic indicators for each CC for the period 1960 to 2000 are tracked and set in relation to each other. In doing this, we concentrate on the influence of exogenous demand factors (or injections) and so-called leakages that together determine the level of economic activity. Exogenous demand injections are private investment, government expenditures (for consumption and investment) and exports, whereas leakages contain private savings, net taxes (taxes net of subsidies and transfers) as well as imports. The third part deals in detail with the role that FDI and EU transfers played in the four CCs with respect to their influence on private investment, net exports and hence on economic growth {{as well as on the}} CCs' trade performance and external position. The fourth part focuses on the patterns of income catching-up of the four CCs in relation to the EU average; attention is drawn to the differences in growth records depending on whether GDP is measured in national currency terms or at purchasing power standards (PPS). The fifth part contains brief general remarks on the growth strategy of the ACscohesion countries, development before and after EU accession, FDI, <b>external</b> position, <b>convergence</b> of cohesion countries and lessons for new entrants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Snakes, or active contours, {{have been}} widely used in image {{processing}} applications. An external force for snakes called gradient vector flow (GVF) attempts to address traditional snake problems of initialization sensitivity and poor convergence to concavities, while generalized GVF (GGVF) aims to improve GVF snake convergence to long and thin indentations (LTIs). In this paper, we find and show that both GVF and GGVF snakes essentially yield the same performance in capturing LTIs of odd widths, and generally neither can converge to even-width LTIs. Based on a thorough investigation of the GVF and GGVF fields within the LTI during their iterative processes, we identify the crux of the convergence problem, and accordingly propose a novel external force termed as component-normalized GGVF (CN-GGVF) to eliminate the problem. CN-GGVF is obtained by normalizing each component of initial GGVF vectors with respect to its own magnitude. Experimental results and comparisons against GGVF snakes show that the proposed CN-GGVF snakes can capture LTIs regardless of odd or even widths with a remarkably faster convergence speed, while preserving other desirable properties of GGVF snakes with lower computational complexity in vector normalization.
