5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in Crime and Punishment. The director <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{this kind of a}} movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.|$|E
5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> adapting it long before he met the creators. A two-minute proof of concept teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E
5|$|One of Simpson's first tasks was {{to confer}} with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area, Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin. The two {{established}} mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting {{was the creation of}} the Central Bureau as a combined signals intelligence organisation. Simpson <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> such an organisation while on the Orcades. Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start, signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.|$|E

25|$|The {{life story}} of Maria took another {{dramatic}} turn on 16 August 1976, when Maria found herself {{on trial in}} a Dutch court charged with plotting to murder her husband. She admitted in court that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> leaving her husband but was afraid to start divorce proceedings in case she lost custody of her children. She {{came into contact with}} two regular customers at her husband's café bar. The trio bought a revolver and recruited a fourth accomplice to carry out the actual murder. However, the last member got cold feet and gossiped about the murder plan. The police quickly learnt of it and arrested all four conspirators.|$|E
25|$|Maxis {{went public}} in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on {{individual}} people; after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his life into a game. Sims {{would be based on}} Wright's focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was even sure to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright's idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by the homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis's employees had been laid off.|$|E

During {{his time in}} Rishikesh, Lennon decided to write a song about the recent wave of social upheaval.

500|$|The {{two were}} {{inspired}} by gospelmusic and both have described their music as [...] "electronicgospel"—in particular the tracks [...] "LifeIsLong" [...] and [...] "OneFineDay". In addition to subtle Biblical themes in the lyrics, Eno was influenced by gospel musicality, which he initially discovered through Talking Heads while working on MoreSongsAboutBuildingsandFood by listening to [...] "SurrendertoHisWill" [...] by ReverendMaceoWoods and The ChristianTabernacleChoir. For several {{years leading up to}} this project, Eno had primarily listened to gospelmusic—even joining a gospelchoir—and was attracted to the music's unrestrained vocals and lack of pessimism as well as its inclusive nature. Eno <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> gospel for several years, but could not write lyrics to hopeful songs.|$|E
500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world;" [...] themes that are explored in this song. [...] "Strange Overtones" [...] has been described as [...] "a song about writing a song"—the subject of the song struggles to write innovative music, but is overheard by a neighbor using beats that are [...] "twenty years old." [...] In terms of the genre of music, both Byrne and Eno have called it [...] "electronic Gospel"—the backing tracks are the kind of electronic music for which Eno is known, paired with hopeful and inspiring lyrics from Byrne— this song in particular features an uptempo backing track. Eno <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Gospel for several years, but couldn't write lyrics to hopeful songs.|$|E
500|$|On February 3, 2015, Dylan {{released}} Shadows in the Night, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963, {{which have}} been described as part of the Great American Songbook. All the songs on the album were recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of [...] "Sinatra covers". Dylan explained, [...] "I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day." [...] In an interview, Dylan said he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> making this record since hearing Willie Nelson's 1978 album Stardust.|$|E

500|$|At the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won {{the award}} for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the {{audience}} that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> [...] "a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson", and suggested that they Google his name. Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what I wanted to say. I {{have a friend who}} says the world doesn't need another angry dwarf." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Saari {{left behind}} two {{handwritten}} {{notes in his}} school dormitory indicating {{that he had been}} planning the massacre for six years. A police spokesperson commented: [...] "Saari left notes saying he had a hatred for mankind, for the whole of the human race, and that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{what he was going to}} do for years. The notes show he was very troubled and he hated everything." [...] Police said that although most of the victims were female, the motive did not seem to be a hatred of women. One of Saari's friends noticed a change in his behaviour two years before the shootings, when Saari began expressing a fondness for guns and an admiration of the school shootings in the United States. He said that around 18 months previously Saari had sent him a message saying that he would carry out a school shooting the next day. Saari reportedly denied being serious about carrying out his threat.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} a new [...] {{motorcycle}} was conceived in 1956, when Honda Motor's Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa toured Germany and witnessed the popularity of mopeds and lightweight motorcycles. Soichiro Honda was primarily the engineering and production leader of the company, always with an eye towards winning on the racetrack, while his close partner Fujisawa was the man of finance and business, heading up sales and formulating strategies intended to dominate markets and utterly destroy Honda Motor's competitors. Fujisawa <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a long term expansion strategy, and unlike other Japanese companies, {{they did not want}} to simply boost production to cash in on the recent economic boom in Japan. A small, high-performance motorcycle was central to his plans. Upwardly mobile consumers in postwar Europe typically went from a bicycle to a clip-on engine, then bought a scooter, then a bubble car, and then a small car and onwards. Fujisawa saw that a motorcycle did not fit in this pattern for the average person, and he saw an opportunity to change that. Soichiro Honda was at the time tired of listening to Fujisawa talk about his new motorcycle idea; Honda came to Europe to win the Isle of Man TT race and wanted to think about little else.|$|E
500|$|Mugford {{said she}} had spent the weekend before the murders with Bamber in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the {{prosecution}} later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse {{on the night of}} the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50pm on 6 August to say he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the crime all day, was [...] "pissed off", and that it was [...] "tonight or never". A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: [...] "Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven't had any sleep all night... bye honey and I love you lots." [...] Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: [...] "I should have been an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E

2500|$|One {{influential}} {{friend was}} the Piedmontese Justice Minister Urbano Rattazzi. He was anticlerical in his politics, {{but he saw}} some value in Bosco’s work.

He found a religious order to keep the oratory going after its founder’s death. Bosco <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> that problem, too, and had been slowly organizing his helpers into a loose [...] "Congregation of St. Francis de Sales".
