5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat <b>is</b> <b>funny</b> and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E
25|$|Founded by American {{entrepreneurs}} Jeff Valdez and Bruce Barshop, Sí TV {{was established}} in 1997 as a production company to develop, produce and distribute original English-language entertainment aimed primarily at a Latino audience. In 1998, the company produced two half-hour bilingual programs – the talk show Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez and the comedy series Funny <b>Is</b> <b>Funny</b> – for the Spanish-language cable channel Galavisión. The two series, which dealt primarily with Latino culture in the United States, helped boost Galavisión's audience share on weekends in the 18–34 Latino demographic by 83%. When Sí TV and Galavisión parted ways in August of that year, Valdez sold the shows into national syndication in 52 markets, drawing solid ratings in New York City, Atlanta, Houston and San Antonio.|$|E

Laura Doan, pointing out newspaper and magazine articles from 1924 in which high collars, tailored satin jackets, and watch fobs are described as the latest in women's wear, describes Troubridge as having a [...] "keen fashion sense and an eye for sartorial detail".

500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny.

500|$|In 2011, Allistair Pinsof at Destructoid {{reviewed}} the game, {{calling it a}} mix between Paperboy and Muscle March {{in terms of the}} complexity and pace, and compared the gameplay to Crash Bandicoot.

He concluded that the game <b>is</b> <b>funny,</b> but not great, and that the ridiculous premise and its large amount of small details make the game [...] "charmingly brain-dead". In 2013, Justin Amirkhani at Complex included the game in a list of company-branded video games that [...] "didn't suck", saying that while the game's graphics had not aged well, it was mechanically very similar to Temple Run, which Amirkhani called his favorite iOS game.

[...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] shows that even if The Simpsons is not dealing with famous celebrities or [...] "high profile places", the writers can still [...] "wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars. Flanders is a special creation in the canon of humor, a regular guy who <b>is</b> <b>funny</b> because of how hyper-normal he is compared to his Neanderthal neighbors. The focus on people who are left-handed, and the whole idea of being a lefty, is an unusual basis for a television show. But then again, nothing about The Simpsons is ever common." [...] Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town also praised the writers, stating that they [...] "are able to craft a downtrodden tale for the perpetually clueless Flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by Homer's guilt. A memorable episode." [...] Niel Harvey of The Roanoke Times called [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] a [...] "classic bit of Simpsonia."
