5|$|In 2014, a {{magnetic}} field around HD 209458 b was inferred from the way hydrogen was <b>evaporating</b> from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of {{a magnetic}} field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field {{is estimated to be}} about one tenth as strong as Jupiter's.|$|E
5|$|Evaporation-condensation {{involves}} atoms “evaporating” {{from the}} cluster onto a terrace accompanied by “condensation” of terrace adatoms onto the cluster {{leading to a}} change in the cluster’s center of mass. While figure 10 appears to indicate the same atom <b>evaporating</b> from and condensing on the cluster, it may in fact be a different atom condensing from the 2D gas.|$|E
50|$|Vapor-compression {{refrigeration}} uses evaporative cooling, but the <b>evaporated</b> vapor {{is within}} a sealed system, and is then compressed ready to <b>evaporate</b> again, using energy to do so. A simpleevaporative cooler's water is <b>evaporated</b> into the environment, and not recovered. In an interior space cooling unit, the <b>evaporated</b> water is {{introduced into the}} space along with the now-cooled air; in an evaporative tower the <b>evaporated</b> water is carried off in the airflow exhaust.|$|R
50|$|<b>Evaporated</b> milk is {{sometimes}} used in its reduced form; however, to reconstitute <b>evaporated</b> milk to be equivalent to normal milk, mix 1 part by volume of <b>evaporated</b> milk with 1 1/4 parts of water. Where <b>evaporated</b> milk is required but not available, {{it can be}} replaced by simmering 2 1/4 parts of fresh milk down to 1 part. A comparable result is obtained by simmering down 2 parts of almond milk.|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} solar cells, <b>evaporated</b> Ti-Pd-Ag metallization {{system has}} been found reliable. However, for low cost terrestrial applications, its cost effectiveness may be questioned.

5|$|Halley's {{periodic}} returns {{have been}} subject to scientific investigation since the 16th century. The three apparitions from 1531 to 1682 were noted by Edmond Halley, enabling him to predict its 1759 return. Streams of vapour observed during the comet's 1835 apparition prompted astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel to propose that the jet forces of <b>evaporating</b> material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Krypton was {{discovered}} in Britain in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from <b>evaporating</b> nearly all components of liquid air. Neon {{was discovered}} by a similar procedure by the same workers {{just a few weeks}} later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of <b>evaporating</b> material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and {{he argued that the}} non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|The device cools as {{the water}} <b>evaporates,</b> {{allowing}} refrigeration in hot, dry climate. It must {{be placed in a}} dry, ventilated space for the water to <b>evaporate</b> effectively towards the outside. Evaporative coolers tend to perform poorly or not at all in climates with high ambient humidity, since the water is not able to <b>evaporate</b> well under these conditions.|$|R
5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by <b>evaporating</b> the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and <b>evaporating</b> the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the <b>evaporating</b> effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E

25|$|At a {{temperature}} below the boiling point, any matter in liquid form will <b>evaporate</b> until the condensation of gas above reach an equilibrium. At {{this point the}} gas will condense {{at the same rate}} as the liquid <b>evaporates.</b> Thus, a liquid cannot exist permanently if the <b>evaporated</b> liquid is continually removed. A liquid at its boiling point will <b>evaporate</b> more quickly than the gas can condense at the current pressure. A liquid at or above its boiling point will normally boil, though superheating can prevent this in certain circumstances.|$|R

5|$|There are no {{geologic}} {{forms on}} the planet to suggest the presence of water over the past billion years. However, {{there is no reason}} to suppose that Venus was an exception to the processes that formed Earth and gave it its water during its early history, possibly from the original rocks that formed the planet or later on from comets. The common view among research scientists is that water would have existed for about 600million years on the surface before <b>evaporating,</b> though some such as David Grinspoon believe that up to 2billion years could also be plausible.|$|E
5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. They destroyed about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most <b>evaporating</b> sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note that he was there. Within three months, the saltworks were back in full production. Carpenter later wrote a long letter home about this battle and how his men responded.|$|E
5|$|Early on October26, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} central Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward. The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature. Due to weak steering currents, Juan looped once offshore Louisiana and later looped again over the state, weakening into {{a tropical}} storm over land on October29. The storm turned eastward and later northeastward, striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan turned to the north over land and became extratropical on November1 over Tennessee. After the remnants of Juan continued to the north into Canada, it spawned an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley. This low continued to the east through North Carolina, bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region, and saturating soils; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from <b>evaporating.</b>|$|E

50|$|The salt {{solution}} is regenerated by heating it under low pressure, causing water to <b>evaporate.</b> The water <b>evaporated</b> from the {{salt solution}} is re-condensed, and rerouted {{back to the}} evaporative cooler.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{have studied}} the {{correlation}} between field <b>evaporated</b> atoms during an atom probe tomography experiment. The <b>evaporated</b> atoms {{have been shown to}} be highly correlated both in time and in space. This correlation can be explained by the dynamic distribution of the electric field at the surface of the sample. The evaporation sequence follows the distribution of zones where the electric field intensity is higher. The distance of correlation between successively <b>evaporated</b> atoms corresponds to the mean size of these zones and the time of correlation corresponds to the mean time necessary to <b>evaporate</b> the entire zone...|$|R
5|$|More complex {{protactinium}} fluorides {{are also}} known such as Pa2F9 and ternary fluorides {{of the types}} MPaF6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH4), M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH4) and M3PaF8 (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF6 formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF5. These compounds {{can be obtained by}} <b>evaporating</b> a hydrofluoric acid solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K+, Rb+, Cs+ or NH4+. A similar variation was observed for the M2PaF7 fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs2PaF7 and M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb or NH4).|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for <b>evaporating</b> metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins <b>evaporating.</b>|$|E
40|$|An in-situ {{densification}} anneal at 550 °C {{was applied}} to e-beam <b>evaporated</b> a-Si films on Si (1 0 0) wafers in a non-UHV environment. The c-Si films were then obtained by annealing the as-deposited a-Si films at 575 °C in a tube furnace. It is shown that the crystal quality of the c-Si films obtained from low-rate (50 nm/min) <b>evaporated</b> a-Si film is considerably improved by the densification anneal, whereas densification has no beneficial effect on c-Si films obtained from high-rate (300 nm/min) <b>evaporated</b> a-Si. However, the improvement of c-Si obtained from low-rate <b>evaporated</b> a-Si is not due to {{a significant difference in}} the oxygen content in the films. It is suggested that the improvement of the c-Si films is related to structural relaxation induced by the densification anneal of low-rate <b>evaporated</b> a-Si...|$|R

5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating <b>evaporating</b> water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very abundant in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas <b>evaporating,</b> which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E
