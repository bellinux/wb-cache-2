Once in the job, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he {{considered to be a}} [...] "non-job", later commenting that [...] "I don't understand why, after <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done for the program... I was only one that was removed. That's {{the end of the program}} for me." [...] Only six months after the fire, and some two months after taking his new position, Shea left NASA in order to become a Vice President at the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts. He had not been called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire.|$|E

For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and let me do whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound like <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when you turn on the station".|$|E

I never have felt the need to belong to any exclusive, self-defining, or special group... I was never ashamed, and I never felt the need to explain or apologize for my relationships to anyone....

2500|$|Whilst Rouvas was {{disappointed}} with his seventh-place finish, announcing to Greek media [...] "I am so sorry, I {{wanted us to}} win", there was still unanimous support towards the artist himself in the country. [...] "Seventh in Europe, first in our hearts" [...] many journalists reported on Greek television. The media and public pronounced their support for Rouvas, the general consensus being that the artist gave it his best even though this did not translate in enough votes in the contest. All criticism in Greece focused on {{the selection of the}} song itself, rather than the artist's performance. Rouvas stated that, overall, it has all been a wonderful experience for him: [...] "some win, some lose, personally, I gave <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> But it was a wonderful experience".|$|E

His black 1957/63 (the body {{is from a}} '63; the neck from a '57) Stratocaster, {{previously}} owned by late Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, was used circa 1978–1990. It {{was used as a}} template by Fender to manufacture an Artist Signature model in 2009. The original now resides at his mother's home. [...] "I bought it in 1976," [...] he said. [...] "I saw it advertised in Melody Maker… I got the serial number to check it was [...] guitar. It cost quite a bit of money but I didn't care. I just sold <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so I could get it, and I used it from then on. It just felt like I was holding a piece of magic because he had used this guitar." ...|$|E

[...] Stein's two-day stay at Choate was her first exposure to a private school, if we can believe her statement in Everybody's Autobiography (published 1937). She wrote, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I had ever seen such a school. When I was brought up in East Oakland we all went to public school ...

2500|$|Takeshi Obata, {{the artist}} of Death Note, {{said that he}} had [...] "no trouble" [...] {{designing}} Light as the character description presented to him, [...] "A brilliant honors student who's a little out there," [...] was [...] "clear and detailed". As the weekly serialization continued, Obata simplified the design by subconsciously removing [...] "unnecessary" [...] lines and felt that he became [...] "better" [...] at drawing Light. When Chapter 35 appeared and the editor informed Obata that Light loses his memories, Obata had to draw Light in a similar manner as he appeared in Chapter 1; Obata said [...] "It was like I had to forget <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned." [...] Obata said that he used [...] "a lot of effort" [...] to design Light's wardrobe. According to Obata, he encountered difficulty imagining the clothing of [...] "a brilliant person," [...] so he looked through fashion magazines. Obata envisioned Light as a [...] "smart and formal guy" [...] who wears formal shirts. Most of Light's clothing in Death Note is [...] "fitted" [...] and Obata avoided jeans.|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theile {{arrived in}} Rome as an outsider, despite being the {{defending}} champion as he had not regained his form of four years prior, with Robert Bennett and Frank McKinney of the United States posting faster times. This {{appeared to be the}} case in the heats, with Theile posting the third fastest time behind the American duo. In the semifinals, Bennett was unable to repeat his earlier performance and Theile won, while McKinney won the other semifinal, also in a time slower than Theile. Theile was confident approaching the final, recounting [...] "I had great faith in myself and my abilities. I had a short, sharp peak, which meant that I had to save everything for that burst and then exert <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> for precisely that moment." [...] Theile attacked at the outset in the final, as was his style, and held a slender lead at the 50-metre mark over McKinney and Bennett. Theile made a good turn, lengthening his lead to half a body length, before holding off a late surge to claim consecutive gold medals, defeating McKinney by just 0.2 s, setting a new Olympic record in the event. For the first time, the 4×100-metre medley relay was contested at the Olympics, and combining with Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton, the Australians finished well behind the Americans to win the silver medal.|$|E
