Kemmerer, a [...] "Money Doctor", {{was invited}} to Chile in 1925 to deal with {{monetary}} policy and inflation problems which were {{considered one of the}} principal economic problems of Chile at the time. The visit by Kemmerer was used to back up monetary policies already outlined by Chileans. These reforms included the creation of a central bank, the establishment of government budget law and a general bank law. All these reforms were established by rule by decree by Arturo Alessandri who had been reestablished in power following a coup d'etat against him in 1924 (where the coup-makers protested among other things against inflation). Gold convertibility was established in 1925. As result of these reforms Chile managed to tame inflation to such degree that the 1920s were the decade with less inflation in the 1890-1980 period. Another concequence of the reforms was an increased <b>easyness</b> by Chile to obtain loans not only in the United States but also in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany. In the years after the visit of Kemmerer there was a sharp increase in foreign investments.|$|E

40|$|The Dirichlet family {{owes its}} privileged status within simplex {{distributions}} to <b>easyness</b> of interpretation and good mathematical properties. In particular, we recall fundamen-tal properties {{for the analysis}} of compositional data such as closure under amalgamation and subcomposition. From a probabilistic point of view, it is characterised (uniquely) by a variety of independence relationships which makes it indisputably the reference model for expressing the non trivial idea of substantial independence for compositions. Indeed, its well known inadequacy as a general model for compositional data stems from such an independence structure together with the poorness of its parametrisation. In this paper a new class of distributions (called Flexible Dirichlet) capable of handling various dependence structures and containing the Dirichlet as a special case is presented. The new model exhibits a considerably richer parametrisation which, for example, allows to model the means and (part of) the variance-covariance matrix separately. Moreover, such a model preserves some good mathematical properties of the Dirichlet, i. e. closure under amalgamation and subcomposition with new parameters simply related to the parent composition parameters. Furthermore, the joint and conditional distributions of subcompositions and relative totals can be expressed as simple mixtures of two Flexible Dirichlet distributions. The basis generating the Flexible Dirichlet, though keeping compositional invariance, shows a dependence structure which allows various forms of partitional dependence to be contemplated by the model (e. g. non-neutrality, subcompositional dependence and subcompositional non-invariance), independence cases being identified by suitable parameter configurations. In particular, within this model substantial independence among subsets of components of the composition naturally occurs when the subsets have a Dirichlet distribution...|$|E

Noise is a significant factors of negative influenceon people and environment. Combined effects of noise and of other physical pollutions on people may cause amplification of their negative impact. If the noise pollution level from the object in a residential area exceeds the permissible levels (MPL), noise protection measures can be initiated.

40|$|Aim: Given the {{increased}} tendency {{of depression in}} the following years, the scientific community pays attention on the expansion of this problem. This necessity led to the validation of DOM in Greece. The DOM is a questionnaire about major depression that combines the sufficiency {{in the description of}} major depression and the <b>easyness</b> of its fullfilment. In the present study the DOM was used for the follow-up of the sample patients, in-depth time of eighteen months, {{in order to determine the}} effect of various clinical, demographic and therapeutic factors in the recovery from depression. Material and method: In the study of the sample the withdrawals were checked with X 2 method and the co-morbidity of major depression with various mental and certain physical diseases plus the severity of major depression of each group with the anova method. It was also checked, with the anova method, the severity of depression for each demographic subgroup. The scale was measured in a sample of 167 individuals, out-patients and in-patients in psychiatric clinics for depression. 75 cases with depression were marked and 61 individuals of them were submitted in retests in a six-month follow-up, for an interval of eighteen months. For this evaluation both the reliability and the validity of the under study questionnaire were checked. For the study of validity the diagnoses that were placed by the DOM were compared with those from the SCID - I, in order to assess the specificity and the speciality of the scale, while at the same time in the above mentioned comparisons the Kappa coefficient was applied, too. Pearson correlations of scale D - ARK, that is included in DOM, with the HAM - D and the SCID - I, were also made. It was checked the improvement of depression, with the use of ancova method, concerning the supported psychotherapy, the pharmaceutical treatment, their combination, the previous depressive episode and certain demographic factors of the sample. It was also checked the improvement, with the Pearson method, concerning quantitative criteria that describe the ability of the patient. For the study of reliability an assessment of test - re-test, interrater, patient - rater assessment, were carried out with the Kappa coefficient method and Intra - Class Correlation. The assessment of internal consistency of the questionnaire was also achieved with the use of Cronbach α. The recovery from major depression and suicide ideation, for the various demographic subgroups, was checked with X 2 method and the clinical improvement with the Wilcoxon method. For the study of clinical improvement it was also checked via the anova method the change of various parameters of ability, so much for the total of the sample as for the demographic subgroups. Finally, for the discriminating analysis, the predictable role of factors, that probably influences the recovery, was checked. Results: An increased prevalence of major depression in groups that are liable to stressed conditions was ascertained. The individuals who dropped out suffered from more serious depression and they were those of high education scale. There was an increased co morbidity of major depression with the panic disorder, with agoraphobia and with certain somatic disturbances such as irritable bowel syndrome, cervical pain and headaches. The DOM demonstrated high rates of sensitivity that oscillated from 77 % to 100 %. The speciality oscillated from 83 % to 94 %. There were high rates of correlation of D-ARK with HAM-D and SCID-I. In every follow-up high rates of correlation between the reduction of severity of depression and changes in parameters of ability were observed, like the emotional ability, the social ability and the bed days. In the study of improvement of depression with the ancova method it was proved that the pharmaceutical treatment and the combination of pharma-ceutical treatment with the supported psychotherapy play an important role in the very improvement. In the test - re-test study for patient’s assessment, high rates of agreement between the diagnoses (K= 0. 85 to 0. 97) and correlation of D - ARK (the ICC oscillated from 0. 96 to 0. 99) with a lower race for suicide ideation (K= 0. 73 to 0. 82) were observed. In the test - re-test study for the clinician’s assessment, a high K= 0. 98 with an ICC= 0. 99 was observed. In the interrater study there was a K= 0. 94 (with ICC = 0. 98) and in the patient - rater study a K= 0. 76. Finally, there was a high rate of agreement about the characteristics of the treatment. The study of internal consistency demonstrated high Cronbach α rates (0. 93 to 0. 95). The pharmaceutical treatment was proved an important factor of recovery, regardless the engaging of supporting psychotherapy. It seems that a less powerful role in the recovery possess the absence of previous depressive episode and the supportive psychotherapy. [...] . ...|$|E
