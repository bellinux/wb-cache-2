40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Objective: Many {{opportunities}} {{exist for}} dermal exposure to isocyanates {{in the auto}} repair industry. Contaminated work surfaces may be of particular concern as surfaces sprayed with isocyanates {{have been shown to}} represent a source of exposure long after paints and clear coats have dried. Improvement upon currently used surface sampling methods may be important in evaluating work surfaces as a potential source of isocyanate exposure. In order to initiate these improvements, this study aims to compare multiple wipe media to find a material effective in recovering isocyanates. Methods: Percent recovery of isocyanates was compared among 3 different wipe media composed of the following materials: PVDF, quartz fiber, and polypropylene. In addition, each wipe material was sampled from 3 surface types, including glass, ceramic, and aluminum. All wipe samples were analyzed using a quantitative HPLC assay at the Industrial Hygiene lab at the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. Statistical analysis was used to determine whether differences in recovery of <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diisocyanates</b> (HDI) could be attributed to differences in wipe media or surface type. Results: Comparison of PVDF and quartz fiber media found that differences in recovered isocyanate species could not be explained by differences in the wipes. In contrast, a significant decline in mean recovery was observed when comparing polypropylene wipes to PVDF and quartz media. Surface type was also found to be a significant factor in determining isocyanate recovery. Samples taken from aluminum surfaces yielded the highest recovery of HDI. Conclusion: Although PVDF and quartz media appeared to be associated with similar recovery of HDI, quartz wipes are not recommended for surface sampling due to durability issues. Since HDI recovery when using PVDF wipes is significantly higher compared to that of polypropylene media, PVDF may be an effective material for surface sampling...|$|R

Ear application (skin LLNA) was used as a positive control. Negative controls were exposed to the vehicle.

40|$|A {{variety of}} paint {{products}} {{are used for}} their aesthetic and anti-corrosive properties. Isocyanates are consistently found in automobile paint products, particularly in clear coat polyurethane products. Clear coat is typically sprayed via pressurized air {{by means of an}} auto-spray robot. In clear coat repair situations, manual, air-powered spray guns are used, and manual spray Operators administer the clear coat material. The isocyanates are a primary anti-corrosive agent in polyurethane products. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not established a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have set Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) and Threshold Limit Value (TLV), respectively. NIOSH recommends a 0. 005 parts per million (ppm), 10 -hour Time Weighted Average (TWA), and a ceiling exposure of 0. 020 ppm in a 10 minute period. Similarly, ACGIH recommends a 0. 005 ppm, 8 hour TWA. Automobile manufacturers use clear coats in a variety of ways. Some may use clear coats with blocked isocyanates, or isocyanates that are completely reacted, and others may use clear coat products that allow isocyanates to be liberated during an application, baking, and curing process. The research objective {{of this study was to}} characterize exposure, focusing on a single manufacturer’s use of isocyanate-containing clear coats in their Paint Department. A newly evaluated medium (ISO 17734) using di-n-butylamine as a derivative agent, in a denuder tube, was selected instead of NIOSH methods 5521, 5522, and 5525. The ISO evaluated medium was selected to reduce secondary hazard exposure to toluene in impingers. Second, a medium developed by SKC, Inc., called ISO-CHEK®, was not selected because of the short collection time, sensitivity of the medium after collection, and storage and shipping requirements for analysis. Sampling took place over two days, one day for manual spray operations with 2 personal samples from Operators, and 4 area samples collected, and the second day for auto-sprayer Inspectors with 4 personal samples collected. The samples were then analyzed for <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diisocyanates</b> (HDI) monomer and homopolymer species. The 0. 005 ppm, 10 hour TWA; the 0. 020 ppm ceiling limit (10 minutes); and the 0. 005 ppm 8 -hour TWA TLV were not exceeded on either day of sampling. Neither the area nor the personal samples exceeded the 10 hour TWA, ceiling limit, or TLV. In fact, the results had to be recalculated in to parts per billion (ppb). The average exposure for manual spray Operators was 0. 052 ppb for the homopolymer, and 0. 024 ppb for the monomer species. For auto-spray Inspectors, the average was 0. 053 ppb for the homopolymer component and 0. 021 ppb for the monomer species. Though the average isocyanate concentration was similar for both Operators and Inspectors, the averages are still below REL and TLV recommendations. These data provided preliminary information regarding the exposure to isocyanates from clear coat use, and also provide context for future evaluation of isocyanate use at this automobile manufacturer. The low concentration of isocyanates could indicate working ventilation systems, liberation of isocyanate species to non-hazardous forms, or low volatilization of isocyanates from the clear coat...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in perfluoropolyether (PFPE) resin technology for high solids, weather resistant polyurethanes for automotive (OEM) and heavy duty coatings are presented. In the former case, polyfunctional OH-terminated PFPE resins can be successfully blended with commercially available blocked iso- cyanates leading to high solids (70 – 80 wt. %) monocomponent polyurethanes with high density of cross-linking. Formulations containing PFPE resins and mixed <b>hexamethylene</b> diisocyanate/isophorone <b>diisocyanate</b> (HDI/IPDI) blocked isocyanates were prepared and char- acterized according to OEM specifications; {{the performances of}} fluorinated coatings were {{compared with those of}} reference acrylic solvent-borne coatings. Clearcoats were applied over conventional OEM basecoats (car body painting) and polyester powder coatings (wheels painting). The remarkable improvement of anticorrosion performances, acid and mar resistance and durability of painting system was reached maintaining its good aesthetic aspect. Fluorinated films showed excellent stain release properties conferring to final painting system, the self-cleaning behaviour typical for PFPE coatings. In the latter case, the use of dihydroxy terminated PFPE oligomers having properly selected molecular weights and bimodal molecular weight distribution allowed the preparation of really high solid (80 – 90 wt. % dry) low viscosity formulations with aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrogenated polyisocyanates. The compositions were able to cross-link rapidly even at temperatures below 20 ◦C giving fully transparent, chemically resistant and easy-cleanable coatings. The coating physical properties like hardness, glass transition temperature (Tg) and elongation can be optimized by tuning the hardener composition (HDI/IPDI ratio) as well as the molecular weight of the PFPE. White pigmented, high gloss finishes were also prepared and evaluated as protective barrier coating for heavy duty paints working in highly corrosive environments...|$|R

Nevertheless, the growth of bacteria within textile knitted mesh intersections can occur after surgical mesh implantation, causing infections. Thus, bacterial reproduction has to be stopped {{in the very early}} stage of mesh implantation. Herein, novel antimicrobial PP meshes grafted with β-CD and complexes with triclosan were prepared for mesh infection prevention. Initially, PP mesh surfaces were functionalized with suitable cold oxygen plasma. Then, <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (HDI) was successfully grafted on the plasma-activated PP surfaces.

The hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior of β-CD are well suited to form complexes with hydrophobic host guest molecules. Thus, the prepared PP mesh samples, CD-TCL- 2 and CD-TCL- 6 demonstrated excellent antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli that were sustained up to 11 and 13 days, respectively.

Unique cysteine replacements in transmembrane domains were shown to react with organic mercurials but not with sulfhydryl reagents, such as maleimides and methanethiosulfonates. A new protocol was developed based {{on the use of}} HgCl 2, a compound known to react rapidly and selectively with sulfhydryl groups. The reaction can bridge vicinal pairs of cysteines and form an intermolecular mercury-linked dimer.
