40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal structure of government debt in a stochastic environment. In a model with distortionary taxes, {{the government should}} smooth tax rates over states of nature as well as over time. <b>Government</b> <b>liabilities</b> should be structured to hedge against macroeconomic shocks that affect the government budget. The optimal structure of <b>government</b> <b>liabilities</b> generally includes some "risky" securities that are state-contingent in real terms. The empirical part of the paper tests for tax smoothing and then studies state contingencies implemented by some specific securities, including nominal debt, long-term bonds, equity, and foreign-currency debt.

40|$|In New Zealand in {{the next}} 50 years, an aging {{population}} is expected to elevate <b>government</b> <b>liabilities</b> and weaken the government's fiscal position. To maintain fiscal balance, the government must either substantially pre-fund future increases in its liabilities or significantly raise taxes in the 2030 's- 40 's, following few small possible tax cuts {{in the next}} 10 to 15 years. Expected fiscal problems {{are related to the}} increasing costliness of publicly providing for health care and retirement. Moreover, the aging population's negative effects on the fiscal balance could be exacerbated by any slackening in economic performance or in fiscal prudence. Long-term fiscal projections for the country, and literature on the problem, indicate that {{the most effective way to}} contain the expected rise in <b>government</b> <b>liabilities</b> is to reform health care and pension policies.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has underscored {{the need to}} pay attention to contingent <b>government</b> <b>liabilities</b> that could arise from bank failures for sovereign risk management. This paper proposes a simple method to construct a contingent liability index (CLI) for a banking sector that takes into account the size and concentration of the banking system, market expectations of bank defaults, and perceptions of government support to each bank. This method allows us to track potential <b>government</b> <b>liabilities</b> related to bank failures for 32 advanced and emerging economies on a monthly basis from 2006 to 2013. Furthermore, we find that the CLI is a significant determinant of sovereign CDS spreads. Our results suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in the CLI is associated with an increase in sovereign CDS spreads by 24 basis points for advanced economies and 75 basis points for emerging markets on average...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his election and subsequent assumption of office, President Wilson held {{meetings with the}} authors of three competing proposals for the Federal Reserve:Rep. Carter Glass proposed a decentralized and private sector-dominated system, with a board made up primarily of private bankers, 20 or more regional reserve banks, and with currency a private bank liability. Glass, a southern Democrat with a marked antipathy to centralized power, intended his proposal to be differentiated from the (similarly private sector-dominated) Aldrich Plan largely {{by the absence of}} a central institution, but to Glass's horror, Wilson told him to add a central agency (in Wilson's own word, a [...] "capstone") to his model.U.S. Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo (soon to become Wilson's son-in-law) proposed the most centralized model, featuring a Government central bank within the Treasury Department, no regional reserve system, and currency a government liability.Owen's own proposal, drafted {{with the assistance of the}} Republican economist (and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury) A.

40|$|Georgia local {{government}} law not only encompasses a forbidding substantive expanse; it occupies a dominating presence before the Georgia appellate courts. Those courts {{are called to}} resolve all manner of litigation erupting from citizen exposure to government at its first level. The controversies feature issues both recurring and unique; they represent {{nothing less than the}} essence of law in daily life. An annual effort to chronicle those controversies over a good number of years reveals two (among many) distinct facets. First, local <b>government</b> <b>liability</b> has consistently dwarfed all other litigated issues; and second, this pervading characteristic emits no signs of abating. These facets, in turn, levy two requirements upon students of the subject. First, there is the obvious need for a substantive knowledge of local <b>government</b> <b>liability</b> law. Additionally, students must acquire a perception of liability 2 ̆ 7 s historic context, an awareness of the subject 2 ̆ 7 s litigational tenacity. It is the latter necessity that prompts this brief effort at descriptive analysis: a focus upon the number of liability cases historically before the courts, the precise issues presented, material distinctions between municipal and county liability litigation, and the decisional results...|$|E

50|$|Most {{government}} {{budgets are}} calculated on a cash basis, meaning that revenues are recognized when collected and outlays are recognized when paid. Some consider all <b>government</b> <b>liabilities,</b> including future pension payments and payments for {{goods and services}} the government has contracted for but not yet paid, as government debt. This approach is called accrual accounting, meaning that obligations are recognized when they are acquired, or accrued, rather than when they are paid. This constitutes public debt.|$|R

40|$|How should taxes, {{government}} expenditures, {{the primary}} and fiscal surpluses and <b>government</b> <b>liabilities</b> be set over the business cycle? We assume that the government chooses expenditures and taxes to maximize the utility of a representative household, utility is increasing in government expenditures, only distortionary labor income taxes are available, and the cycle is driven by exogenous technology shocks. We first consider the commitment case, and characterize the Ramsey equilibrium. In {{the case that the}} utility function is constant elasticity of substitution between private and public con- sumption and separable between the composite consumption good and leisure, taxes, government expenditures and the primary surplus should all be constant positive frac- tions of production, and both <b>government</b> <b>liabilities</b> and the fiscal surplus should be positively correlated with production. Then, we relax the commitment assumption, and we show how to determine numerically whether the Ramsey equilibrium can be sustained by the threat to revert to a Markov perfect equilibrium. We find that, for realistic values of the preferences discount factor, the Ramsey equilibrium is sustain- able.
