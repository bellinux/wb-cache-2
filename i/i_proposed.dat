5|$|As I {{made clear}} in my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs {{me that the}} rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{military}} supremacy over land, Simeon I {{was aware that}} he needed naval assistance in order to seize Constantinople. In 922 he clandestinely sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to negotiate {{the assistance of the}} powerful Arab navy. Simeon <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> to divide equally all spoils; the Bulgarians were to keep Constantinople and the Fatimids would gain the Byzantine territories in Sicily and South Italy.|$|E

500|$|Having {{played a}} part in Labor's {{abandonment}} of the White Australia Policy at national level, Dunstan was also prominent in promoting multiculturalism. He was well known for his attendance at and patronage of Cornish, Italian and Greek Australian cultural festivals and his appreciation of Asian art, and sought to build on cultural respect to create trade links with Asia. Dunstan's involvement in such cultural exchanges was also credited with generating strong support for Labor from ethnic and non-Anglo-Saxon immigrant communities, although it was viewed with suspicion by some in the Anglo-Saxon establishment. Dunstan himself later recalled: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> the establishment of a Cornish Festival, in Australia's [...] "Little Cornwall", people of Cornish descent came flocking." ...|$|E
500|$|Mac Senour, a {{producer}} at Sega, {{was responsible for}} the peripheral and its six-game cartridge as the company's [...] "hardware boy". He designed the six minigames based on Sega's previous intellectual property and licenses—such as ToeJam & Earl—under the instruction to avoid shooting games. His prototypes included games based on Joe Montana (Joe Montana Wide Receiver Training Camp) and David Robinson, but when presented, the company asked for more shooting games and scrapped all license-based games (besides ToeJam & Earl, whose license was free) due to their added cost. His [...] "reverse Blockout game" [...] prototype was the only other title carried to the final cartridge. Senour recalled that upon his cubicle presentation to Sega Japan's president, the executive did not say anything besides [...] "very good" [...] before leaving. Sega did not plan any other first-party releases for the Menacer—Senour recollected that [...] "they laughed when <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> more." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reaction of}} the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2–3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac {{that could have been}} a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them {{for the rest of the}} year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned [...] "rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac." [...] He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, [...] "Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that that army will be as quiet as a sucking dove." [...] Some Southern publications, such as the Charleston Mercury, criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.|$|E

2500|$|Jean de La Forêt was {{directed}} to seek trading privileges, as well as religious arrangements and military agreements between France and the Ottoman Empire. De La Forêt had also been instructed by Francis I to obtain [...] "a million of gold, which will be no inconvenience to the Grand Signior". In exchange, Francis <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> in his instructions to La Forêt: an ambassador, a perpetual treaty of alliance, trade and a promise [...] "to hold all Christianity quiet, without war undertaken against him... in a universal peace", by weakening Charles V [...] "until he can no more resist".|$|E

For The Untouchables, everything <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn't like at all, {{and of course we}} didn't have an agreement on that. It was something I didn't want to write – a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, 'Please don't choose the seventh!' because it was the worst. And guess what he chose? The seventh one. But it really suits the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> to Lucio my {{original}} treatment for Per Sempre, which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per Sempre and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing for him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that he originated the story and that I stole it from him is pure science fiction".|$|E
2500|$|Obama stated on March 15, 2007, that [...] "I do not agree...that {{homosexuality}} is immoral." [...] During the July 23, 2007 CNN/YouTube debate, Obama further stated that [...] "... we've {{got to make}} sure that everybody is equal under the law. And the civil unions that <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> would be equivalent in terms of making sure that all the rights that are conferred by the state are equal for same-sex couples as well as for heterosexual couples." [...] Obama supports expanding the protections afforded by hate crimes statutes to cover crimes committed against individuals because of sexual orientation or gender identity. Obama also called for full equality for gays during his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013: [...] "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law — for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well." [...] This was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word gay in an inaugural address.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to ABCFM {{corresponding}} secretary Dr. Judson Smith of 13 November 1900 (received by Smith on 7 January 1901), Ament says: I have been in Cho Chou. This time <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> to settle affairs {{without the aid of}} soldiers or legations. It was a complete success. Every one of our dispossessed church-members has been reinstated and a money compensation made for his losses. This has been done by appealing to the sense of justice among the villages where our people lived and where they are respected by all decent people. The villagers were extremely grateful because I brought no foreign soldiers and were glad to settle on the terms proposed. After our conditions were known many villagers came of their own accord and brought their money with them. Apparently, the actions of Russian, French and German soldiers, [...] "who looted and killed on every hand, often taking delight in shooting every person visible... determined Dr. Ament not to go again with soldiers in his efforts to secure the replacing of the Christian in their homes, or to enforce the reasonable demands for indemnity for the great losses sustained by the church-members." [...] Ament wrote in a letter on 27 September 1900, about a month after the occupation of the Mongol Fu (palace): [...] "I am selling off the bric-a-brac, silks, furs found in the Fu {{for the benefit of the}} Christians." ...|$|E
