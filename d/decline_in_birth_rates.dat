50|$|There {{has also}} been {{discussion}} on whether bringing women into the forefront of development initiatives {{will lead to a}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates.</b> In some countries, government policies have focused on reducing birth rates by improving women's rights, sexual and reproductive health.

5000|$|The {{idea that}} human {{population}} {{is tied to}} food supply is contentious, however. Many biologists disagree with Quinn's assessment. While food supply certainly imposes an upper limit on population growth, {{they point out that}} culture, living standards, human intelligence, and free will can impose lower, secondary limits to population growth. Critics also point out that the most significant population growth is occurring in the Third World, where regional food production is lowest. Meanwhile, the First World, where food is most plentiful, is undergoing a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates.</b> Quinn has suggested this results from international food distribution and has claimed that the farms of the First World fuel population growth in the Third. United Nations projections that world population will level off sometime in the near future also contradict Quinn's statements. In November 1998, Daniel Quinn made a video exploring these topics with Dr. Alan Thornhill of the Society for Conservation Biology, entitled, Food Production And Population Growth. Russell Hopfenberg has written at least two papers attempting to prove Quinn's ideas, one paper with David Pimentel entitled [...] "Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply" [...] and another, [...] "Human Carrying Capacity is Determined by Food Availability". Hopfenberg has also made available a narrated slide show entitled [...] "World Food and Human Population Growth".

40|$|Dynamic {{adjustments}} {{could be}} a useful strategy for mitigating the costs of acute environmental shocks when timing is not a strictly binding constraint. To investigate whether such adjustments could apply to fertility, we estimate the effects of temperature shocks on birth rates in the United States between 1931 and 2010. Our innovative approach allows for presumably random variation {{in the distribution of}} daily temperatures to affect birth rates up to 24 months into the future. We find that additional days above 80 0 F cause a large <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> approximately 8 to 10 months later. The initial decline is followed by a partial rebound in births {{over the next few months}} implying that populations can mitigate the fertility cost of temperature shocks by shifting conception month. This dynamic adjustment helps explain the observed <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> during the spring and subsequent increase during the summer. The lack of a full rebound suggests that increased temperatures due to climate change may reduce population growth rates in the coming century. As an added cost, climate change will shift even more births to the summer months when third trimester exposure to dangerously high temperatures increases. Based on our analysis of historical changes in the temperature-fertility relationship, we conclude air conditioning could be used to substantially offset the fertility costs of climate change...|$|E
