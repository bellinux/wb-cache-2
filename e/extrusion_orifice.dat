50|$|In principle, {{friction}} extrusion can {{be performed}} on any machine which can produce the required rotary and linear motions between the die and charge. Examples include machines built for friction stir welding, milling machines modified to accommodate the extrusion forces, and purpose built friction extrusion equipment such as the shear assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE™) machine at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Figures 1-3 show examples of friction extrusion equipment and extruded products. Figure 4 shows typical friction extrusion dies designed for production of wire, rod and tube. Dies are rotated in the direction which enhances material flow toward the <b>extrusion</b> <b>orifice</b> during the process.|$|E
5000|$|As in {{conventional}} extrusion processes, in friction extrusion, a shape change is enforced on the charge by forcing its passage through a die. However, friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in several key ways. Critically, in the friction extrusion process, the extrusion charge (billet or other precursor) rotates {{relative to the}} extrusion die. In addition, similar to conventional extrusion, an extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.  Scrolled features {{on the face of the}} die aid material flow into the <b>extrusion</b> <b>orifice</b> which can lead to order of magnitude reduction in extrusion force compared to conventional extrusions of equivalent cross section.  Third, the combined effects of elevated temperature and large levels of deformation normally lead the extrudate to have a relatively fine, equiaxed, grain structure which results from recrystallization after the conclusion of deformation: desirable crystallographic textures may also be created by the process and formation of nanocomposite structures are also possible. Based on the foregoing, it can be said that the essential controlled parameters in friction extrusion are typically: ...|$|E
40|$|Short fiber-reinforced {{semi-solid}} fresh cement pastes and mortars, tailored for extrusion, {{have much}} lower water-to-binder ratio and higher viscosity than normal cement pastes or mortars. The rheology of these pastes or mortars cannot {{be characterized by}} traditional rheology test methods suitable for normal fresh cement pastes or mortars with much greater water-to-binder ratio and lower viscosity. In this paper, <b>orifice</b> <b>extrusion</b> is employed to calibrate rheology of the semi-solid fresh cement mortar. An analytical model is developed for <b>orifice</b> <b>extrusion</b> of semi-solid pastes and mortars obeying a rigid-viscoplastic constitutive relationship, von-Mises yield criterion and the associated flow rule. <b>Orifice</b> <b>extrusion</b> results are interpreted using the analytical model and the established experiment data interpretation method, and the associated rheological parameters are derived for the semi-solid fresh cement mortar. This study provides a simple analytical model, together with experiment and data interpretation methods, for characterizing the complex intrinsic rheological behavior of semi-solid fresh cement pastes or mortars.

40|$|The plastic {{behaviour}} {{of individual}} Cu crystallites under nanoextrusion is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. Single-crystal Cu fcc nanoparticles {{are embedded in}} a spherical force field mimicking {{the effect of a}} contracting carbon shell, inducing pressure on the system in the range of gigapascals. The material is extruded from a hole of 1. 1 &# 8211; 1. 6 nm radius under athermal conditions. Simultaneous nucleation of partial dislocations at the <b>extrusion</b> <b>orifice</b> leads to the formation of dislocation dendrites in the particle causing strain hardening and high flow stress of the material.

30|$|No {{matter what}} methods applied, the {{nanotubes}} in CF must be superaligned and densely packed to achieve high performance. Based on the above, we can draw {{a conclusion that}} shear rate within the <b>extrusion</b> <b>orifice,</b> flow-induced alignment {{in the direction of}} the fluid velocity and the spontaneous ordering in the liquid crystalline phase are all responsible for the alignment. Polarized Raman spectroscopy and XRD can been used to quantitatively probe the degree of alignment. Meanwhile, high-speed drawing, twisting, and surface-tension-driven densification can increase in interbundle contact and packing density.|$|E
40|$|Fibers {{of single}} wall carbon {{nanotubes}} extruded from super-acid suspensions exhibit preferred orientation along their axes. We characterize the alignment by x-ray fiber diagrams and polarized Raman scattering, using a model {{which allows for}} a completely unaligned fraction. This fraction ranges from 0. 17 to 0. 05 ± 0. 02 for three fibers extruded under different conditions, with corresponding Gaussian full widths at half-maximum (FWHM) from 64 o to 44 o± 2 o. FWHM, aligned fraction, electrical and thermal transport all improve with decreasing <b>extrusion</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter. Resistivity, thermoelectric power and resonant-enhanced Raman scattering indicate that the neat fibers are strongly p-doped; the lowest observed ρ is 0. 25 mΩcm at 300 K. High temperature annealing increases ρ by more than 1 order of magnitude and restores the Raman resonanc...|$|E
40|$|Short fiber {{reinforced}} {{cementitious composites}} (SFRCC) manufactured by the extrusion technique exhibit {{significant improvements in}} physical, mechanical and durable properties {{as compared with the}} fiber-reinforced cementitious composites made by traditional manufacturing techniques. The constitutive properties of the fresh SFRCC pastes for extrusion, as well as their interactions with the walls of extrusion equipments, are very important for enabling a successive and successful extrusion process. However, very few researches have been done in these areas. Till now, no proper experimental method is available for calibrating the constitutive behavior of the fresh SFRCC pastes for extrusion and no reliable constitutive model has been developed for such pastes. Moreover, numerical simulation, optimization and control of various forming processes of the fresh SFRCC pastes are still challenging. In the present study, first, various promising rheology and plasticity methods, including ram <b>extrusion,</b> <b>orifice</b> extrusion, capillary extrusion and upsetting, have been examined to investigate constitutive characteristics of the fresh SFRCC pastes for extrusion. In these experimental works, the traditional ram extrusion and orifice extrusion theories have been further developed and the capillary extrusion theory has been modified by taking the rate and the slip effects. The upsetting theory has been corrected to include the effects of boundary friction and strain rate. It has been found that the fresh SFRCC pastes show pseudo-plasticity and significant strain rate hardening behavior. Only by combing rheology and plasticity methods could it give a full description of the constitutive behavior of such pastes. Second, based on experimental and theoretical investigations, an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model has been proposed for the fresh SFRCC paste, which considers the von Mises yield criterion, the associated flow rule and nonlinear isotropic strain rate-hardening. The model is formulated by introducing a strain rate-dependent yield function. The associated material parameters in the proposed constitutive model could be identified from material tests without the help of numerical methods. These parameters have been determined for the fresh SFRCC paste for extrusion in this study. Third, the proposed elasto-viscoplasticy constitutive model has been formulated in a computational form and implemented into the explicit finite element code ANSYS/LS-DYNA for simulation purposes. Various forming processes of the fresh SFRCC pastes, including upsetting and ram extrusion, have been simulated using the ANSYS/LS-DYNA FE package, combined with the calibrated constitutive model and the established boundary conditions. The finite element simulation results, with respect to the forming load versus imposed deformation data, agree well with the pertinent experimental results, which verify the reliability of the proposed constitutive model, boundary interaction description and numerical procedures. The predicted material flow behavior, in light of displacement fields and distributions of some internal state variables, also gives promising interpretations of various forming processes. The present study provides an appropriate method to link materials science and engineering. This research procedure can be used in developing new technique and new products for civil engineering in the future...|$|E
