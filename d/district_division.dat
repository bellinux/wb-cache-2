Her attorney, Donald Tickle of Volcano, argued that Perry had erred in his rulings {{for the prosecution}} on all four pretrial motions Overland had filed. Tickle argued that multiple precedents supported the defense arguments over those of the prosecution, and sometimes directly contradicted them. For example, he applied the good-faith exception to the detectives' reliance on an admittedly defective search warrant {{based on the fact}} that the judge had issued the warrant after reviewing the affidavit. An existing California case, however, had expressly held that the state cannot rely purely on the warrant's issuance by a judge to establish sufficient good faith that the search was constitutional.|$|E
