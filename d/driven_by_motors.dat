5000|$|Around 1908 on the Nonnendamm in Berlin Protos built {{electric}} trucks for municipal use. The Protos {{vehicle was}} <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> {{located on the}} rear wheels. In addition to the normal steering wheel were two additional steering wheels located on left and right which could be operated by the driver while walking beside the vehicle. This utility E-LKW was also supplied by Protos as a normal truck of four-ton payload and as an omnibus. The chassis were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke and the motors by Siemens & Halske. In 1911 commercial electric vehicles were introduced. In addition to automobiles and vans, truck and coach models were produced from 1913 with 2.5t capacity and up to 30hp. During the First World War many trucks came with 40hp and a 3t payload. In addition a model was built with 50hp and 4.5t payload. After the War trucks were no longer produced and those that had been stockpiled were still available until the 1920s. Production was limited to passenger cars and vans.|$|E
5000|$|The SCR-584 was {{extremely}} advanced for its era. To achieve high accuracy and measure both azimuth and elevation with one antenna, it used a conical scanning system, {{in which the}} beam is rotated around the antenna's axis to find the maximum signal point, thus indicating which direction the antenna should move in order to point directly at the target. The idea was proposed by Alfred Loomis, the director of section D-1 of the National Defense Research Committee. In October 1940, it was adopted for the [...] "wholly-automatic-tracking" [...] radar project. Conical scanning was also adopted in 1941 for the Navy's 10 cm fire-control radar system, and it {{was used in the}} German Würzburg radar in 1941. The SCR-584 developed the system much further, and added an automatic tracking mode. Once the target had been detected and was within range, the system would keep the radar pointed at the target automatically, <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> mounted in the antenna's base. For detection, as opposed to tracking, the system also included a helical scanning mode that allowed it to search for aircraft. This mode had its own dedicated PPI display for easy interpretation. When used in this mode the antenna was mechanically spun at 4 rpm while it was nudged up and down to scan vertically.|$|E

To limit the internal forces {{arising from the}} redundant driving, this paper proposes a joint torque control method, {{which is based on}} an assumption {{that there is only one}} active joint in the four-link mechanism driving the climbing gait. Except the active joint, the other three joints are all considered as passive joints, whose torques tend to be zero, although they are <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> in reality. According to the analyses of static forces in the closed chain state, the ideal torque of named active joint is calculated, and will be followed by the joint in real climbing locomotion. The experiments reveal the reasonability and feasibility of the proposed joint control method, as well as the limitations of current prototype and control algorithm. I...|$|E
40|$|The current paper proposes {{two methods}} and {{algorithms}} {{for determining the}} operating regimes of industrial electrical networks which include induction motors.

For the industrial machines <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> we take into account the characteristic of the resistant torque depending on speed. In this way, at the electrical busbars to which motors are connected, the active and the reactive power absorbed are calculated as a function of voltage as opposed to a regular consumer busbar. The algorithms for the two methods are presented. Finally, a numerical study for a test network is realized and the convergence is analyzed...|$|E

Kenshiro [1, 2] is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> and tendons. The body of Kenshiro {{is similar to that}} of a human because its muscles, bones and joint structures are based on human anatomy. For example, its knee joint is designed to imitate a human one; thus, Kenshiro has the functionality of a kneecap, cruciate ligament and screw-home mechanism in the knee joint using link mechanics, which allows for humanlike motion. ECCEROBOT (Embodied Cognition in a Compliantly Engineered Robot) [3, 4] is also driven by a tendon-driven system. It consists of a skeleton made from a polymorph that has a bone-like appearance and elastic actuators that include motors and elastic tendons to realize motions that are similar to a human. ECCEROBOT is used to test hypotheses about human motion as well as compare its performance with that of humans. However, the actuators of these conventional musculoskeletal robots with motor-driven tendon mechanisms are very heavy, not densely attached to the muscles and have poor backdrivability with respect to the motors, gear wheels and belts. Therefore, these robots do not have a redundancy that is as good as that of a human.|$|E

40|$|The present work is an {{experimental}} investigation of turbulent mixing of two co-axial jets with low annular to core area ratio in a non-separating confinement. Experiments {{were conducted in}} a newly designed set-up having a duct to nozzle diameter ratio of 1. 19. Two centrifugal blowers <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> of 30 kW power each generated the air flow. Influence of chute geometry on the turbulent mixing of two co-axial streams is studied by using two chute mixer configurations having 10 degrees and 20 degrees angles of penetration of the annular stream towards the core region at a velocity ratio of 1. 8. Contours of mean velocity and streamwise and transverse turbulence intensities were obtained by making measurements close {{to the point of}} injection with a very fine grid. The results show an improved mixing due to chutes. A stronger transverse turbulence component (w') is observed close to the injection points, which seems to enhance mixing. Profiles at the downstream locations show a faster approach towards uniform mean velocity and homogeneous turbulence intensity. With the chute model having 20 degrees angle of penetration, nearly complete mixing is achieved at a distance of 2. 2 duct radii itself, suggesting feasibility of shortening of the duct by about 50 %. However, a higher total pressure loss of about 1. 7 % is the penalty to be paid for enhanced mixing of the jets...|$|E

Outside of cells, microtubule-motor mixtures can form novel active liquid-crystalline materials {{driven out of}} equilibrium by ATP-consuming motor proteins. Microscopic motor activity causes polarity-dependent interactions between motor proteins and microtubules, but how these interactions yield such larger-scale dynamical behavior such as complex flows and defect dynamics is not well understood. We develop a multiscale theory for microtubule-motor systems in which Brownian dynamics simulations of polar microtubules <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> are used to study microscopic organization and stresses created by motor-mediated microtubule interactions. We identify polarity-sorting and crosslink tether relaxation as two polar-specific sources of active destabilizing stress. We then develop a continuum Doi-Onsager model that captures polarity sorting and the hydrodynamic flows generated by these polar-specific active stresses. In simulations of active nematic flows on immersed surfaces, the active stresses drive turbulent flow dynamics and continuous generation and annihilation of disclination defects. The dynamics follow from two instabilities, and accounting for the immersed nature of the experiment yields unambiguous characteristic length and time scales. When turning off the hydrodynamics in the Doi-Onsager model, we capture formation of polar lanes as observed in the Brownian dynamics simulation.

40|$|Robotic manipulanda are {{extensively}} used in {{investigation of}} the motor control of human arm movements. They permit the application of translational forces to the arm based on its state {{and can be used}} to probe issues ranging from mechanisms of neural control to biomechanics. However, most current designs are optimized for studying either motor learning or stiffness. Even fewer include end-point torque control which is important for the simulation of objects and the study of tool use. Here we describe a modular, general purpose, two-dimensional planar manipulandum (vBOT) primarily optimized for dynamic learning paradigms. It employs a carbon fibre arm arranged as a parallelogram which is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>motors</b> via timing pulleys. The design minimizes the intrinsic dynamics of the manipulandum without active compensation. A novel variant of the design (WristBOT) can apply torques at the handle using an add-on cable drive mechanism. In a second variant (StiffBOT) a more rigid arm can be substituted and zero backlash belts can be used, making the StiffBOT more suitable for the study of stiffness. The three variants can be used with custom built display rigs, mounting, and air tables. We investigated the performance of the vBOT and its variants in terms of effective end-point mass, viscosity and stiffness. Finally we present an object manipulation task using the WristBOT. This demonstrates that subjects can perceive the orientation of the principal axis of an object based on haptic feedback arising from its rotational dynamics...|$|E
