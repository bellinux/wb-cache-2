In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes. This resulted in a rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per Troy ounce (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.|$|E
25|$|Prior to fair trade, {{prices were}} {{regulated}} by the International Coffee Organization according to the regulations set forth by the International Coffee Agreement of 1962. The agreement, which was negotiated at the United Nations by the Coffee Study Group, set limits {{on the amount of}} coffee traded between countries so there would be no excess supply and consequent <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>price.</b> The ICA existed for five years, and then was renewed in 1968.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the storm, {{officials}} issued landslide warnings along 61rivers, {{and residents}} in landslide-prone areas {{were ordered to}} evacuate. About 10,000people left their homes in mountainous areas. Hotels were also evacuated, and residents boarded up windows, with schools and businesses closed. Overall, about 150,000were evacuated due to the storm, with over 7,500people staying in their houses and requiring assistance to leave after the floods. After the damaging impacts of Typhoon Morakot from the year prior, officials enacted enhanced preparations for Fanapi, including activating over 19,000emergency workers. Anticipating heavy rainfall, workers at the Tsengwen Reservoir drained waters ahead of the storm. Farmers also rushed to complete harvests, causing a temporary <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>price</b> due to excess supply.

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{dramatically}} improved performance of Loran-C, LORAN, now known as Loran-A (or [...] "Standard LORAN"), would become much more popular during this period. This was due largely to {{the large numbers of}} surplus Loran-A units released from the Navy as ships and aircraft replaced their sets with Loran-C. The widespread introduction of inexpensive microelectronics during the 1980s caused Loran-C receivers to <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>price</b> dramatically, and Loran-A use began to rapidly decline. Loran-A was dismantled starting in the 1970s; it remained active in North America until 1980 {{and the rest of the}} world until 1985. A Japanese chain remained on the air until 9 May 1997, and a Chinese chain was still listed as active as of 2000.|$|E

The price drop took effect on September 20, 2013. In Europe, Nintendo didn't confirm a formal price cut since individual retailers set their own prices. However, starting October 4, 2013, the company reduced the wholesale price of the system to retailers.
