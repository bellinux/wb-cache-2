It demonstrates that these models possess the unconstrained continuously differentiable minimization formulations, whose any stationary point is the solution of the corresponding model. Accordingly, not only is the Quasi-Newton algorithm capable of finding a solution of the model, but also it can overcome the difficulty experienced by the modified projection method in choosing an appropriate predetermined step size.

To elucidate further the relation between these conditions, we studied five Spanish families with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria and nine unrelated Spanish patients with familial porphyria cutanea tarda. Immunoreactive and catalytic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was decreased by greater than 95 % in the five patients with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. Hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity was decreased to 22 % of normal. Four patients were homozygous for a mutation (G <b>281</b> <b>E)</b> originally identified in a Tunisian family; the fifth patient was a compound heterozygote for this mutation. The calculated carrier frequency for G <b>281</b> <b>E</b> in Spain is one in 1800. None of the nine familial porphyria cutanea tarda patients carried the G <b>281</b> <b>E</b> mutation.

40|$|Background. To {{investigate}} whether {{one or more}} SAMHD 1 gene mutations are associated with cerebrovascular disease {{in the general population}} using a Chinese stroke cohort. Methods. Patients with a Chinese Han background (N= 300) diagnosed with either cerebral large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA, n= 100), cerebral small vessel disease (SVD, n= 100), or other stroke-free neurological disorders (control, n= 100) were recruited. Genomic DNA from the whole blood of each patient was isolated, and direct sequencing of the SAMHD 1 gene was performed. Both wild type and mutant SAMHD 1 proteins identified from the patients were expressed in E. coli and purified; then their dNTPase activities and ability to form stable tetramers were analysed in vitro. Results. Three heterozygous mutations, including two missense mutations c. 64 C>T (P 22 S) and c. 841 G>A (p. <b>E</b> <b>281</b> K) and one splice site mutation c. 696 + 2 T>A, were identified in the LAA group with a prevalence of 3 %. No mutations were found in the patients with SVD or the controls (p= 0. 05). The mutant SAMHD 1 proteins were functionally impaired in terms of their catalytic activity as a dNTPase and ability to assemble stable tetramers. Conclusions. Heterozygous SAMHD 1 gene mutations might cause genetic predispositions that interact with other risk factors, resulting in increased vulnerability to stroke...|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} 16 missense mutations of the tissue-nonspecific AP (TNAP) gene {{found in}} patients with hypophosphatasia. These mutations span the phenotypic spectrum of the disease, from the lethal perinatal/ infantile forms to the less severe adult and odontohypophosphatasia. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a sequence tag into the TNAP cDNA and eliminate the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchor recognition sequence to produce a secreted epitope-tagged TNAP (setTNAP). The properties of GPI-anchored TNAP (gpiTNAP) and setTNAP were found comparable. After introducing each single hypophosphatasia mutation, the setTNAP and mutant TNAP cDNAs were expressed in COS- 1 cells and the recombinant flagged enzymes were affinity purified. We characterized the kinetic behavior, inhibition, and heat stability properties of each mutant using the artificial substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) at pH 9. 8.

40|$|Hanatoxin 1 (HaTx 1) is a {{polypeptide}} toxin {{isolated from}} spider venoms. HaTx 1 inhibits the voltage-gated potassium channel kv 2. 1 potently with nanomolar affinities. Its receptor site {{has been shown}} to contain the S 3 b-S 4 a paddle of the voltage sensor (VS). Here, the binding of HaTx 1 to the VSs of human Kv 2. 1 in the open and resting states are examined using a molecular docking method and molecular dynamics. Molecular docking calculations predict two distinct binding modes for the VS in the resting state. In the two binding modes, the toxin binds the S 3 b-S 4 a from S 2 and S 3 helices, or from S 1 and S 4 helices. Both modes are found to be stable when embedded in a lipid bilayer. Only the mode in which the toxin binds the S 3 b-S 4 a paddle from S 2 and S 3 helices is consistent with mutagenesis experiments, and considered to be correct. The toxin is then docked to the VS in the open state, and the toxin-VS interactions are found to be less favorable. Computational mutagenesis calculations performed on F 278 R and <b>E</b> <b>281</b> K mutant VSs show that the mutations may reduce toxin binding affinity by weakening the non-bonded interactions between the toxin and the VS.

30|$|The {{nucleophile}} E 449 {{has been}} predicted {{based on the}} overlay of the crystal structures of Tm-AFase and Tx-Abf with a structure model of PoAbf. E 449 was located in a position suitable {{to act as a}} putative nucleophile in PoAbf corresponding to the nucleophile <b>E</b> <b>281</b> from Tm-AFase and E 298 from Tx-Abf. Based on sequence similarities, {{it was not possible to}} predict unambiguously the nucleophile catalyst. Indeed the broad sequence diversity has limited the power of prediction and therefore the assignment of the catalytic residue. PoAbf belongs to a set of sequence distantly related to the characterized enzymes with 14  % sequence identity on average. Moreover, PoAbf has been shown to be a versatile enzyme able to work on different arabinooligosaccharides with exo and endo activities. PoAbf is also highly stable in a broad range of pH, which is not the case for most of the other α-l-arabinofuranosidases (Amore et al. 2012). It is possible that the set of sequences including PoAbf, represent a new subfamily in the GH 51 family. Subfamily classification of GH 13, GH 30 and GH 5 has demonstrated that the majority of the defined subfamilies were monospecific, thus indicating a significantly better correlation of substrate specificity between sequences at the subfamily level than at the family level (Stam et al. 2006; St John et al. 2010; Aspeborg et al. 2012). For GH 73 family, the catalytic mechanism and the ligand specificity seem to correlate the sequences in each subfamily (Lipski et al. 2015). Therefore, the large substrate specifities of PoAbf, or its dual catalytic activity could illustrate the subfamily it belongs to. A thorough bioinformatic analysis conducted on this broad set of sequences should allow the identification of yet uncharacterized subfamilies.|$|E

Based on the reported presence of reversible diffuse epithelial hyperplasia in the oesophagus the LOAEL for a 90 -day study in dogs was considered by the Panel to be 1  % propionic acid in the diet and the NOAEL to be 0. 3  % propionic acid in the diet. The Panel considered that there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The Panel concluded that the present database did not allow allocation of an ADI for propionic acid - propionates. The overall mean and 95 th percentile exposures to propionic acid - propionates resulting from their use as food additives (major contributor to exposure) ranged from 0. 7 - 21. 1 and 3. 6 - 40. 8 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The Panel noted that the concentration provoking site of contact effect in the 90 -day study in dogs (1 % propionic acid in the diet) is a factor of three higher than the concentration of propionic acid - propionates in food at the highest permitted level and concluded that for food as consumed, there would not be a safety concern from the maximum concentrations of propionic acid and its salts at their currently authorised uses and use levels as food additives...|$|E

40|$|Changes in meat quality {{traits are}} {{strongly}} associated with alterations in postmortem metabolism which depend on genetic variations, especially nonsynonymous single nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) having critical effects on protein structure and function. To selectively identify metabolism-related nsSNVs, next-generation transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was carried out using RNAs from porcine liver, which contains a diverse range of metabolic enzymes. The multiplex SNV genotyping analysis showed that various metabolism-related genes had different nsSNV alleles. Moreover, many nsSNVs {{were significantly associated with}} multiple meat quality traits. Particularly, ch 7 :g. 22112616 A>G SNV was identified to create a single amino acid change (Thr/Ala) at the 145 th residue of H 1. 3 -like protein, very close to the putative 147 th threonine phosphorylation site, suggesting that the nsSNV may affect multiple meat quality traits by affecting the epigenetic regulation of postmortem metabolism-related gene expression. Besides, one nonsynonymous variation, probably generated by gene duplication, led to a stop signal in porcine testicular carbonyl reductase (PTCR), resulting in a C-terminal (<b>E</b> <b>281</b> -A 288) deletion. Molecular docking and energy minimization calculations indicated that the binding affinity of wild-type PTCR to 5 α-DHT, a C(21) -steroid, was superior to that of C-terminal-deleted PTCR or human carbonyl reductase, which was very consistent with experimental data, reported previously. Furthermore, P 284 was identified as an important residue mediating the specific interaction between PTCR and 5 α-DHT, and phylogenetic analysis showed that P 284 is an evolutionarily conserved residue among animal carbonyl reductases, which suggests that the C-terminal tails of these reductases may have evolved under evolutionary pressure to increase the substrate specificity for C(21) -steroids and facilitate metabolic adaptation. Altogether, our RNA-Seq revealed that selective nsSNVs were associated with meat quality traits that could be useful for successful marker-assisted selection in pigs and also represents a useful resource to enhance understanding of protein folding, substrate specificity, and the evolution of enzymes such as carbonyl reductase...|$|E
40|$|The {{kidney and}} inner ear CLC-K {{chloride}} channels, which {{are involved in}} salt absorption and endolymph production, are regulated by extracellular Ca 2 + in the millimolar concentration range. Recently, Gradogna et al. (2010. J. Gen. Physiol. [URL] identified a pair of acidic residues (E 261 and D 278) located in the loop between helices I and J as forming a putative intersubunit Ca 2 + -binding site in hClC-Ka. In this study, we sought to explore {{the properties of the}} binding site in more detail. First, we verified that the site is conserved in hClC-Kb and rClC-K 1. In addition, we could confer Ca 2 + sensitivity to the Torpedo marmorata ClC- 0 channel by exchanging its I–J loop with that from ClC-Ka, demonstrating a direct role of the loop in Ca 2 + binding. Based on a structure of a bacterial CLC and a new sequence alignment, we built homology models of ClC-Ka. The models suggested additional amino acids involved in Ca 2 + binding. Testing mutants of these residues, we could restrict the range of plausible models and positively identify two more residues (E 259 and <b>E</b> <b>281)</b> involved in Ca 2 + coordination. To investigate cation specificity, we applied extracellular Zn 2 +, Mg 2 +, Ba 2 +, Sr 2 +, and Mn 2 +. Zn 2 + blocks ClC-Ka as well as its Ca 2 + -insensitive mutant, suggesting that Zn 2 + binds to a different site. Mg 2 + does not activate CLC-Ks, but the channels are activated by Ba 2 +, Sr 2 +, and Mn 2 + with a rank order of potency of Ca 2 + > Ba 2 + > Sr 2 + = Mn 2 + for the human CLC-Ks. Dose–response analysis indicates that the less potent Ba 2 + has a lower affinity rather than a lower efficacy. Interestingly, rClC-K 1 shows an altered rank order (Ca 2 + > Sr 2 + >> Ba 2 +), but homology models suggest that residues outside the I–J loop are responsible for this difference. Our detailed characterization of the regulatory Ca 2 + -binding site provides a solid basis for the understanding of the physiological modulation of CLC-K channel function in the kidney and inner ear...|$|E
40|$|A {{deficiency}} in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme activity, the fifth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, {{is found in}} patients with {{sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda}} (s-PCT), familial porphyria cutanea tarda (f-PCT), and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). Subnormal UROD activity is due to mutations of the UROD gene in both f-PCT and HEP, but no mutations have been found in s-PCT. Genetic analysis has determined that f-PCT is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In contrast, HEP, a severe form of cutaneous porphyria, is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. HEP is characterized by a profound deficiency of UROD activity, and the disease is usually manifest in childhood. In this study, a strategy was designed to identify alleles responsible for the HEP phenotype in three unrelated families. Mutations of UROD were identified by direct sequencing of four amplified fragments that contained the entire coding sequence of the UROD gene. Two new missense mutations were observed at the homoallelic state: P 62 L (proline-to-leucine substitution at codon 62) in a Portuguese family and Y 311 C (tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 311) in an Italian family.

40|$|The entire {{substrate}} translocation pathway in {{the human}} GABA transporter (GAT- 1) was explored for the endogenous substrate GABA and the anti-convulsive drug tiagabine. Following a steered molecular dynamics (SMD) approach, in which a harmonic restraining potential {{is applied to the}} ligand, dissociation and re-association of ligands were simulated revealing events leading to substrate (GABA) translocation and inhibitor (tiagabine) mechanism of action. We succeeded in turning the transporter from the outward facing occluded to the open-to-out conformation, and also to reorient the transporter to the open-to-in conformation. The simulations are validated by literature data and provide a substrate pathway fingerprint in terms of which, how, and in which sequence specific residues are interacted with. They reveal the essential functional roles of specific residues, e. g. the role of charged residues in the extracellular vestibule including two lysines (K 76 (TM 1) and K 448 (TM 10)) and a TM 6 -triad (D <b>281,</b> <b>E</b> 283, and D 287) in attracting and relocating substrates towards the secondary/interim substrate-binding site (S 2).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Helplessness {{and mastery}} in {{childhood}} {{and in response}} to the events that trigger onset are implicated in the development of eating disorders. However, no studies have yet explored how these are linked and whether the effects are additive or mediated. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews (Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse; Life Events and Difficulties Schedule; Coping Strategies Interview) were used to assess helplessness and mastery in childhood {{and in response to}} a provoking agent in 15 eating disordered and 19 non-eating disordered women. RESULTS: Helplessness and mastery in childhood were related to helplessness and mastery in response to the events and difficulties that triggered onset of the eating disorder. However, only the presence of helplessness and the lack of mastery in response to this provoking agent predicted onset. CONCLUSION: Helplessness and mastery are vulnerability and protective factors but only in those women who develop an eating disorder in the context of later life events. It is suggested that helplessness and mastery in childhood act via their influence on the adequacy of coping in response to later life events. (Eat.

Nearly 60 % of these clusters contained isolates from more than one animal source. Conversely, the results of virulence factor profiling demonstrated clustering by animal source. Three clusters, named Bovine, Chicken, and Porcine, based on discriminant components analysis, were represented by 90 % or more of the respective isolates. A fourth group, termed Companion, was the most diverse, containing at least 84 % of isolates from canine, feline, equine, and other animal sources.

40|$|The {{thyrotropin}} receptor (TSHr) is {{a member}} of the glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHR), themselves, part of the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor family. The GPHR are characterized by a large aminoterminal extracellular extension responsible for the recognition and binding of their dimeric 30 kDa agonists (glycoprotein hormones thyrotropin (TSH), lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CG) or follitropin (FSH)). This ectodomain is composed of a central portion made of nine leucine-rich motifs and two flanking domains containing several disulfide bridges. In addition of encoding the specificity for hormone recognition, the ectodomain has been shown to exert an inhibitory constraint on the constitutionally active serpentine portion of the receptor coupled in priority to Gsα. This conclusion was reached from experiments with receptor constructs harboring truncated ectodomains, which displayed an increase in their constitutive activity. When compared with the wild type receptor maximally stimulated by TSH or the most active mutants of the ectodomain (<b>e.</b> g. Ser <b>281</b> Leu), the truncated constructs showed only partial activation. Interestingly, the “beheaded” receptor could be further activated by mutations affecting the transmembrane helices of the serpentine but not by selected mutations in the exoloops of the serpentine, which are known to be potent activators of the holoreceptor. From these observations, we propose a model for TSHr activation in which binding of the agonist would switch the ectodomain from a tethered inverse agonist into a tethered agonist. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are {{crystalline}} porous solids {{composed of}} a three-dimensional network of metal ions {{held in place by}} multidentate organic molecules. In recent years, MOFs have received considerable attention as potentially valuable materials for gas storage and catalysis. Until now, most of the studies on the catalytic activity of MOFs are focused on structures that contain coordinative unsaturated metal sites, as it is often believed that the coordinative saturated MOFs will not be catalytically active. In this contribution we discuss the catalytic performance of a completely saturated Metal Organic Framework, V-MIL- 47 [1], in the oxidation of cyclohexene [2]. This MOF was compared with several vanadium containing reference catalysts: VO(acac) 2, VAPO- 5 and VOx/SiO 2, showing that MIL- 47 exhibits a high catalytic performance and an interesting product distribution {{as can be seen in}} the figure below. Figure: The catalytic performance of MIL- 47 Subsequently, we have synthesized the amine and nitro functionalised MIL- 47. The latter was synthesized by an oxidation of the amine group [3]. The catalytic performance of these MIL- 47 analogues with extra electron donating or withdrawing groups will be discussed in comparison to the conventional MIL- 47 in the oxidation of cyclohexene. All systems have also been modelled on the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +g(3 df, 2 p) level of theory to calculate the reaction kinetics. [1] Barthelet K, Marrot J., Riou D., Férey G., Angew. Chem.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Higher {{visceral fat}} mass (VFM) is {{associated}} with an increased risk for developing cardio-metabolic diseases. The mechanisms by which an unhealthy diet pattern may influence VF development has yet to be examined through cutting-edge multi-omic methods. Therefore, our objective was to examine the dietary influences on VFM and identify gut microbiome and metabolite profiles that link food intakes to VFM. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In 2218 twins with VFM, food intake and metabolomics data available we identified food intakes most strongly associated with VFM in 50 % of the sample, then constructed and tested the ‘VFM diet score’ in the remainder of the sample. Using linear regression (adjusted for covariates, including BMI and total fat mass) we investigated associations between the VFM diet score, the blood metabolomics profile and the faecal microbiome (n= 889), and confirmed these associations with VFM. We replicated top findings in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant (greater than or equal to 1 s. d. apart) for VFM, matched for age, sex and the baseline genetic sequence. RESULTS: Four metabolites were associated with the VFM diet score and VFM: hippurate, alpha-hydroxyisovalerate, bilirubin (Z,Z) and butyrylcarnitine. We replicated associations between VFM and the diet score (Beta[s. <b>e.</b> ]: 0. <b>281</b> [0. 091]; P= 0. 002), butyrylcarnitine (0. 199 [0. 087]; P= 0. 023) and hippurate (− 0. 297 [0. 095]; P= 0. 002) in VFM-discordant MZ twins. We identified a single species, Eubacterium dolichum {{to be associated with the}} VFM diet score (0. 042 [0. 011], P= 8. 47 × 10 − 5), VFM (0. 057 [0. 019], P= 2. 73 × 10 − 3) and hippurate (− 0. 075 [0. 032], P= 0. 021). Moreover, higher blood hippurate was associated with elevated adipose tissue expression neuroglobin, with roles in cellular oxygen homeostasis (0. 016 [0. 004], P= 9. 82 × 10 − 6). CONCLUSION: We linked a dietary VFM score and VFM to Eubacterium dolichum and four metabolites in the blood. In particular, the relationship between hippurate, a metabolite derived from microbial metabolism of dietary polyphenols, and reduced VFM, the microbiome and increased adipose tissue expression of neuroglobin provides potential mechanistic insight into the influence of diet on VFM...|$|R

Um programa de melhoramento genético usando um método para selecionar plantas tolerantes ao estresse hídrico diminuiria bastante esses efeitos negativos: por isso, tentou-se verificar os comportamentos de cultivares de arroz (sequeiro e irrigado) e trigo sob estresse salino {{considerando que}} estes se correlacionassem. Realizaram-se dois experimentos no laboratório da Seção de Arroz e Cereais de Inverno do Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, empregando soluções nutritivas. Os cultivares estudados foram os seguintes: arroz-de-sequeiro: IAC- 25, IAC- 47, IAC- 164, IAC- 165, IAC- 1246, Batatais, Pérola, Pratão Precoce e Dourado Precoce; de arroz irrigado: IAC- 120, IAC- 435, IAC- 899, IR- 841, IAC- 1278 e IAC- 4440; de trigo: IAC- 5, IAS- 55, Siete Cerros <b>e</b> Paraguay- <b>281.</b> Tanto o arejamento das soluções como a iluminação das plântulas foram contínuos. Usaram-se as concentrações de cloreto de sódio: 0, 0; 0, 1; 0, 2; 0, 3; 0, 4; e 0, 8 molal (p/m) ou potenciais osmóticos de 0, 00; - 0, 47; - 0, 93; - 1, 39; - 1, 85 e - 3, 75 MPa. As plântulas de arroz cresceram doze dias em solução-tratamento contendo diferentes concentrações de cloreto de sódio em pH 6, 0 e com temperatura de raízes 30 ± 1 °C. As plântulas de trigo cresceram em dez dias em solução-tratamento em pH 6, 0 e temperatura de raízes 25 ± 1 °C. Mediu-se o comprimento da maior raiz seminal, comprimento da parte aérea (bainha da terceira folha madura) e pesou-se a matéria seca das partes aéreas e raízes, das plantas dos diferentes cultivares estudados. A avaliação da diminuição do diâmetro das raízes e da cor verde foi visual, tanto para o arroz como para o trigo. Os resultados mostraram que o parâmetro da raiz seminal variou mais do que os outros, sendo, portanto, melhor para avaliar a tolerância à salinidade, visando ao melhoramento genético. Assim, com base nas variações das porcentagens diárias médias do comprimento das raízes seminais ao cloreto de sódio, os cultivares de arroz foram classificados em tolerantes: IAC- 165, Pratão Precoce, Dourado Precoce, IAC- 1 64 e IAC- 1 20; moderadamente tolerantes: IAC- 1246, Pérola, IAC- 25, Batatais e IAC- 47; moderadamente sensíveis: IAC- 899, IAC- 435, IAC- 4440 e IR- 841, e sensível: IAC- 1278. Para o trigo foram considerados como os mais tolerantes os cultivares IAS- 55 e Siete Cerros. The water stress and the {{salinity}} {{in the soil}} {{are the most important}} causes of low grain yield of rice and wheat in Brazil, when cultivated on upland conditions. Selection for new cultivars showing tolerance to salt effects seems {{to be one of the}} methods to solve this problem. The osmotic agent usually used to this purpose is sodium chloride. One experiment was conducted in laboratory conditions using nutrient solutions. The rice genotypes utilized were: upland cultivars IAC- 25, IAC- 47, IAC- 164, IAC- 165, IAC- 1246, Batatais, Dourado Precoce, Pérola and Pratão Precoce; and irrigated cultivars IAC- 120, IAC- 435, IAC- 899, IAC- 1278, IAC- 4440 and IR- 841. The wheat genotypes utilizated were: upland cultivars IAC- 5, IAS- 55, Siete Cerros and Paraguay- 281. Nutrient solutions aeration and light for the seedlings were provided continuously. Six levels of sodium chloride (0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4 and 0. 8 molal) or osmotic potentials of 0. 00, - 0. 47, - 0. 93, - 1. 39, - 1. 85 and - 3. 75 MPa were applied int the nutrient solutions. The plastic pots containing the treatment solutions were placed in waterbath with temperature of 30 ± 1 °C, for rice, and 25 ± 1 °C, for wheat. The rice and wheat seedlings were cultivated during 48 hours in distilled water and after this period -they were changed to pots, containing nutrient solutions with different sodium chloride concentrations and pH = 6. 0. The rice plants were cultivated during twelve days and the wheat plants, ten days. The longest seminal root lengths, the aereal part heights and dry weights of plants were determined. Visual evaluations of root diameter and leaf color were done for all plants in the different treatments. The length of the longest seminal root was the best parameter in relation to the others to evaluate the tolerance to salinity for a breeding program. According to the variations in percentage of the longest seminal root length, as the sodium chloride concentration increased in the solutions, the rice cultivars IAC- 165, Pratão Precoce, Dourado Precoce, IAC- 164 and IAC- 120 were considered tolerant; IAC- 1246, Pérola, IAC- 25, Batatais and IAC- 47, moderately tolerant; IAC- 899, IAC- 435, IAC- 4440 and IR- 841, moderately sensitive and the cultivar IAC- 1278, sensitive. The wheat cultivars IAS- 55 and Siete Cerros were considered more tolerant than the cultivars IAC- 5 and Paraguay- 281 up to the concentration of 0. 2 molal of sodium chloride. The developed technique was useful to select plants more tolerant to sodium chloride...|$|R
