5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E
5|$|Aditya Lakhia as Kachra (spinner), the untouchable. Lakhia's {{association}} with Ashutosh in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa (1993) and Pehla Nasha (1993) brought <b>him</b> <b>this</b> role. He {{read the book}} Everybody Loves a Good Drought by P. Sainath to better understand and portray his character.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} that Nate no longer loves her, Blair sleeps with Chuck, eventually falling for <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> {{leads to a}} heated affair and an eventual love triangle. Her inability to choose creates much of the first season's story line. There are brief mentions of Blair's past struggle with anorexia-bulimia that are never mentioned again past the first season.|$|E

5|$|Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper {{and set out}} {{to defeat}} <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> campaign, {{initially}} against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.|$|E
5|$|Finucane was {{credited}} with 28 aerial victories, five probably destroyed, six shared destroyed, one shared probable victory, and eight damaged. Included in his total were 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and one Messerschmitt Bf 110. Official records differ over the exact total. After the war, two of Finucane's victories that were credited as probables had, in fact, been destroyed, but were not officially included. His total victory count {{could be as high}} as 32. Some sources credit <b>him</b> <b>this</b> figure.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his arrest}} and release Chatwin left Benin {{and went to}} Brazil to {{continue}} his research on de Sousa. Frustrated {{by the lack of}} documented information on de Sousa, Chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> book was published in 1980, and Werner Herzog's film, Cobra Verde (1987), is based on it.|$|E

5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for <b>him</b> <b>this</b> meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E
5|$|On the December 19 SmackDown!, Holly {{teamed with}} Bill DeMott to defeat Noble and Nunzio. After the match, DeMott turned on Holly and {{attacked}} <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> {{led to a}} match on the next SmackDown!, which DeMott won.|$|E
5|$|The Lupo {{character}} was eventually {{licensed by the}} Converse athletic shoe company, that has produced some animated commercials such as Lupo's Nightmare, where Lupo dreams that a giant high-top wants to kill <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> led to additional work, including other animated commercials for Levi Strauss & Co. and MTV.|$|E

5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E
5|$|The list of Greek leaders Troilus wounds expands in {{the various}} re-tellings of the war from the two in Dares to also include Agamemnon, Diomedes and Menelaus. Guido, in keeping his promise to tell of all Troilus' valorous deeds, {{describes}} many incidents. Troilus is usually victorious but is captured in an early battle by Menestheus before his friends rescue <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> incident reappears in the imitators of Guido, such as Lefevre and the Laud and Lydgate Troy Books.|$|E

5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, the {{government}} regarded Black Consciousness as a threat. It sought to disrupt Biko's activities, and in March 1973 placed a banning order on <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> {{prevented him from}} leaving the King William's Town magisterial district, prohibited him from speaking either in public or {{to more than one}} person at a time, barred his membership of political organisations, and forbade the media from quoting him. As a result, he returned to Ginsberg, living initially in his mother's house and later in his own residence.|$|E

5|$|Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery novel {{written by}} Blue Balliett and {{illustrated}} by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting, A Lady In Writing, is stolen on route to the Art Institute of Chicago, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> causes Petra, Calder, {{and the rest of}} Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and problem-solving are apparent.|$|E
5|$|Cody Rhodes was a World Tag Team Champion {{throughout}} {{the beginning of}} 2008 alongside Hardcore Holly, who was acting as a mentor to him. Ted DiBiase made his first WWE appearance on the May 26 episode of Raw, in which he claimed that he and a mystery partner would take the World Tag Team Championship from Rhodes and Holly. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view event in June, DiBiase revealed his partner was running late and started the match without him, however Rhodes quickly betrayed Hardcore Holly by attacking <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> turned Rhodes into a villainous character and meant that he and DiBiase won the championship.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrive at}} the police station to see Billy. Doggett {{interviews}} the boy, who seems to be mute. In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local , may {{have been involved in the}} boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy. As Doggett sits in his car, he pulls out a photo of his deceased son, Luke.|$|E
