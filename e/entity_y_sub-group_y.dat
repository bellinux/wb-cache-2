X no = for an entity X there is an <b>entity</b> <b>Y</b> which carries the features of X indirectly. A situation is an entity with a temporal dimension. A predicate is a set of features with a temporal dimension. The subject of a predicate is an entity which carries the features of the predicate directly. The complement of a predicate is an entity of which the participa-tion in the situation is coextensive with the predicate.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} concept of {{autonomy}} in three contexts: in constitutional law (SA), {{in the philosophy of}} Immanuel Kant (KA) and in the contemporary philosophical discussion on personal autonomy (PA). Tracing {{the concept of}} autonomy historically, we highlight similarities and dissimilarities between different definitions. For example, Kant’s account of self-legislation is traced back to Samuel von Pufendorf’s theory of legislation. The main aim is to describe the difference between a descriptive and a normative interpretation of autonomy. Autonomy is presented as a relational concept, being on the one hand commonplace and concrete – individuals are mutually intertwined through various social relations and states of dependence – yet having also logical and conceptual aspects, in this work illustrated by a model where one entity (X) is autonomous in relation to another <b>entity</b> (<b>Y)</b> regarding a right or a capacity (Z). The X-Y-Z-model is applied throughout in the three above-mentioned contexts. Two main issues are discussed in the thesis: First, the contemporary discussion is characterized by the transition from “ought” to “is” – an inverse naturalistic fallacy, as it were. Personal autonomy is described as being factual, a psychological capacity people possess to a varying extent, but without any positive evidence presented for it being humanly possible. Being only seemingly descriptive, the concept is in fact normative, and the point of departure is an ideal outlook on human beings – how people should, or ought to, be. Thus, PA seems to imply that if human beings should, or ought to, be some certain way, then they are or can be in that way. A person’s irrationality and his lack of reason, however, is substantiated precisely by the fact that he, in spite of compelling evidence to the contrary, does not realize, or does not want to realize, that he is not solely rational or ruled by his intellect. In other words, it is not evident whether personal autonomy is a matter of theoretical reasoning, hypotheses, ideals or empirically established facts and realities regarding the autonomy of human beings. This is not entirely manifest in Kant’s account either, which leads to the second issue. Kant may, on one hand, as advocated in this work, be interpreted as presenting an ethical theory – hypotheses, ideals defining how human beings ought to be, that clearly differs from how he describes them to be. If, on the other hand, Kant is read as intending his theory to be put into practice in mundus sensibilis, then he joins the vast majority of thinkers, idealists, utopists, who through the centuries have insisted that their theories are applicable in practice, if not in the present, at least in an indeterminate future; if human beings were only a little less irrational, a little less predictably unpredictable, a little less controlled by their emotions and impulses, i. e. if man were what he is not, {{he would be able to}} live according to the ideals of reason...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere are {{numerous}} types of urethral duplication previously {{described in the}} literature including a Type IIA 2 Y where a large ventral channel branches from the hypoplastic, dorsal, orthotopic urethra. There have been 27 previously reported cases of a similar defect, called “congenital posterior urethrocutaneous fistula” (CUPF) with the only difference being that the ventral urethra is hypoplastic and the dorsal, orthotopic one normal. The difference in treatment for these 2 entities is markedly different, and preoperative identification of the appropriate abnormality is essential. Treatment of CUPF requires only safe excision of the ventral segment, but treatment for a Type IIA 2 Y duplication requires resection of the hypoplastic, orthotopic urethra and transposition of the larger ventral segment into the dorsal orthotopic position.

40|$|Much of {{linguistic}} analysis {{rests on a}} single key question: given <b>entities</b> X and <b>Y</b> as objects for analysis, are they the same or different? This issue pervades all components of grammar: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, etc. Moreover, in addressing this issue, one often needs to recognize the relevance of different levels of analysis, especially underlying versus surface, since underlying sameness can be surface difference, and vice versa. For example, phonemic analysis takes phones with decidedly different phonetic realizations (e. g. aspirated vs. unaspirated stops in English) and treats them as the same at the phonemic level if their distribution does not overlap. But at the same time, segments {{that seem to be}} the same phonetically on the surface and even phonemically as well, e. g. the [d] of recede and the [d] of invade, might need to be treated as different from a morphophonemic standpoint, since, in this example, the former alternates with [] in the related noun recession whereas the latter alternates with [] in division, both nominal formation having ostensibly the same suffix.

40|$|Deep {{levels in}} Pt- and Pd- doped si and GaP green light {{emitting}} diodes (LED's), which {{are expected to be}} efficient recombination centres, were investigated. In si:Pt and GaP LED's the mid-gap levels were the focus of interest, while in si:Pd detailed characterization of all the Pd related levels was carried out. In the case of GaP, the samples were commercially fabricated LED's. pt and Pd was doped into silicon by solid state diffusion process carried out in Ar atmosphere, in sealed quartz ampoules, at 850 Â°C and 950 Â°C respectively. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and single shot dark capacitance transient (SSDCT) measurements were used as complementary techniques for deep level characterization. Optical DLTS was also employed in some cases. To identify the origin of deep levels, samples were annealed 1 sochronally from room temperature to - 400 Â°C and exposed to a 5. 48 MeV a-particle source (maximum dose of 3. 8 X 1010 particles/cm 2, in steps) to observe the response of the deep levels to these treatments. Post-irradiation annealing was also carried out. In GaP green LED's the DLTS measurements revealed one mid-gap level lying at Ec - 1. 02 eV. The transients obtained by SSDCT technique revealed the presence of two levels. The line-shape analysis of the DLTS spectra confirmed the results of SSDCT. The thermal activation energies obtained by SSDCT measurements were Ec - 1. 03 eV and Ec - 0. 93 eV for the two levels. The shallower level could possibly be a complex of PGa antisite defect with an unknown <b>entity</b> <b>Y.</b> The deeper level could be the analog of the well known level EL 2 (in GaAs) in GaP. In the case of Pt-doped silicon, the Pt-related mid-gap level was observed in our pt diffused samples. The thermal activation energy obtained was Ec - 0. 55 eV and capture cross-section measured at 279 K was 1. 6 x 10 - 16 cm 2. Our minority carrier injection DLTS and ODLTS measurements revealed that for this mid-gap levelÏƒp>>Ïƒâ�¿,which shows that it is a good candidate for the dominant recombination centre in si:Pt. For the other two well-known Pt-related levels, it was found that Ïƒp â‰ˆÏƒnfor the Ec - 0. 23 eV acceptor and Ïƒ >Ïƒ for the Ev + 0. 32 eV donor level. In Pd doped si, four Pd-related levels were observed simultaneously in as-diffused (and quenched) samples for the first time. The activation energies found were E 1 (Ec - 0. 18 eV), E 2 (Ec - 0. 22 eV), E 3 (Ec - 0. 37 eV) and E 4 (Ec - 0. 59 eV). The detailed pre- and Post-irradiation annealing behaviour of the E 1 and E 2 levels negate a previous suggestion that these correspond to two configurations of Pd-vacancy complex which transform into each other at high temperatures. These two levels do, however, seem to be related to substitutional Pd. Different concentrations, concentration profiles and different responses to irradiation Prove that E 3 and E 4 have different origins which contradicts the hitherto held belief that they are different charge states of the same defect. Î±-irradiation introduced five expected levels in reference and Pd-doped samples. The presence of Pd, in general, suppresses the production of these levels. Combined with the observation that the Pd-related levels in general increase in concentration upon this treatment, it is concluded that the primary defects produced by a-irradiation make complexes with electrically inactive Pd atoms activating them electrically. In post-irradiation annealing of Pd-doped samples a new hole level H(Î±-Pd) emerged at Ev + 0. 27 eV which has been observed for the first time. This level could be a complex of Pd with some a-induced defect which needs annealing of 100 Â°C to become electrically active. Four new annealed-in levels appeared in post-irradiation annealing of reference samples (not reported for the virgin samples). These four levels were E 12 (Î±) Ec - 0. 37 eV], E 13 (Î±) [Ec - 0. 31 eV], E 14 (Î±) [Ec - 0. 13 eV] and H 5 (Î±) [Ev + 0. 16 eV]. These levels are suggested to be complexes of some quenched-in defects with radiation-induced defects which require annealing for becoming electrically active...|$|R
