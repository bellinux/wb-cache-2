40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports the}} {{quantification}} of the evaporative emissions from gasoline-poweredmotor vehicles in South Africa {{under various conditions}} including high temperatures. Three vehicles with and without evaporative emission control systems have been tested to quantify gasoline evaporative emissions, including both diurnal and running loss emissions. Measurements were made in a Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determination over a range of ambient temperatures. The standard <b>diurnal</b> <b>test</b> shows that evaporative emissions increase progressively with increasing fuel temperature. South African gasoline poweredmotor vehicles exhibitedevaporative emissions 10 times higher than that allowed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The extended-time <b>diurnal</b> <b>test</b> shows that the fuel emittedfrom gasoline-poweredmotor vehicles in South Africa is about 97 million litres of gasoline every year...|$|E
40|$|On November 26, 2011, NASA {{launched}} a large (900 kg) rover {{as part of}} the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission to Mars. The MSL rover is scheduled to land on Mars on August 5, 2012. Prior to launch, the Rover was successfully operated in simulated mission extreme environments during a 16 -day long Rover System Thermal Test (STT). This paper describes the MSL Rover STT, test planning, test execution, test results, thermal model correlation and flight predictions. The rover was tested in the JPL 25 -Foot Diameter Space Simulator Facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The Rover operated in simulated Cruise (vacuum) and Mars Surface environments (8 Torr nitrogen gas) with mission extreme hot and cold boundary conditions. A Xenon lamp solar simulator was used to impose simulated solar loads on the rover during a bounding hot case and during a simulated Mars <b>diurnal</b> <b>test</b> case. All thermal hardware was exercised and performed nominally. The Rover Heat Rejection System, a liquid-phase fluid loop used to transport heat {{in and out of the}} electronics boxes inside the rover chassis, performed better than predicted. Steady state and transient data were collected to allow correlation of analytical thermal models. These thermal models were subsequently used to predict rover thermal performance for the MSL Gale Crater landing site. Models predict that critical hardware temperatures will be maintained within allowable flight limits over the entire 669 Sol surface mission...|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2014 six dye-tracer tests were {{conducted}} in two englacial channels in the accumulation area of Evighetsfonna, Oppdal. The aim {{of this research was}} to map the drainage system of the glacier. Tests revealed multi-peaked tracer return curves, low velocities and high dispersivities, indicating an inefficient drainage system covering a part of the glacier bed. Dye-tracer tests were conducted both during daytime and in the afternoon and registered by a data logger during the night in channel 1 to examine any diurnal difference in drainage. These tests revealed diurnal variation in the drainage structure of channel 1 which showed abnormal results compared to tests conducted at daytime. Here an inefficient, braided subglacial drainage system is registered during the night reflected by low through-flow velocities and multi-peaked tracer return curve in channel 1 during nighttime. The drainage network of channel 1 thus provide long travel distance for the meltwater. Lower dispersivities are registered during the night in channel 1 meaning that the drainage network covers a smaller part of the glacier bed. There is a marked difference in the characteristics of the two channels investigated, where channel 2 shows low trough-flow velocities, and dispersivity nearly five times lower than in channel 1. The tracer return curves from channel 2 reveal relatively symmetric curves that do not develop through the period of investigation. The subglacial drainage system of Evighetsfonna is revealed to be complex with channelization and well-developed braided channel structure reflected in the multi-peaked tracer return curves. Compared to other non-temperate glaciers, the small glacier Evighetsfonna shows highly complex subglacial drainage structure with low trough-flow velocities, and inefficient drainage capacity. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>test</b> conducted in channel 1 shows that the drainage structure in a non-temperate glacier can change from poorly developed to more efficient over a short time-span...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} different amounts of sleep and SWS restriction on the ensuing day-time sleepiness. Six healthy selected males, after one adaptation night and an initial 8 -hr baseline night, were allowed to sleep 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 hr with a 1 -week interval between conditions. The following day, 4 sleep onset MSLT trials and 2 Wilkinson Auditory Vigilance Task (WAVT) were administered. Before each MSLT, self evaluations of sleepiness and activation on a visual analogue scale (ADAS) were assessed. Each restriction night was followed by an 8 -hr recovery night, and a final 8 - hr baseline night was recorded. The day after each night the same <b>diurnal</b> <b>tests</b> were repeated. Results indicated a linear increase in the propensity to sleep (MSLT) and of subjective sleepiness {{as a function of}} the increase in sleep restrictions. Performance scores (WAVT) showed that vigilance is partially affected by sleep restrictions. For each measure, regression analyses showed that the effect of sleep reduction is better predicted by the total duration of sleep than by the amount of SWS. Correlations between measures were negligible with the exception of those between performance and subjective sleepiness measures...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. A {{recent study}} {{identified}} {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) within the IL- 1 gene cluster at chromosomal locus 2 q 13 that were associated with reduced risk for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in whites. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the association between IL- 1 SNPs and glaucoma in Chinese patients with either POAG or primaryangle closure glaucoma (PACG). METHODS. Patients with POAG with a mean IOP without treatment that was consistently � 21 mm Hg on <b>diurnal</b> <b>testing</b> were classified as having normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and those with higher IOP were classified as having high-tension glaucoma (HTG). Subjects with PACG had at least 180 ° of angle closure on gonioscopy. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction digest enzymes at the following loci: IL 1 A (� 889 C/T), IL 1 B (� 3953 C/T), and IL 1 B (� 511 C/T). The association of individual SNPs with glaucoma was evaluated by using � 2 testing. Haplotype analysis was performed with the PHASE program, with haplotype frequency estimated for combined cases and controls, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of haplotypes. RESULTS. Of the Chinese subjects studies, 194 had POAG (94 NTG and 100 HTG), 125 had PACG, and 79 were normal control subjects. There was no significant difference in IL- 1 SNP or allele frequencies for in subjects with POAG or PACG compared with control subjects, or between NTG and HTG. None of the common haplotypes showed any significant difference between the HTG, NTG, PACG, and normal control subjects. CONCLUSIONS. This study did not find an association between IL- 1 gene cluster polymorphisms and glaucoma in this sample of Chinese subjects. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2007; 48...|$|R

40|$|Most bees rely on {{flowering}} plants and hence are diurnal foragers. From this ancestral state, dim-light foraging in bees requires significant adaptations {{to a new}} photic environment. We used DNA sequences to evaluate the phylogenetic history of the most diverse clade of Apoidea that is adapted to dim-light environments (Augochlorini: Megalopta, Megaloptidia and Megommation). The most speciose lineage, Megalopta, is distal to the remaining dim-light genera, and its closest diurnal relative (Xenochlora) is recovered as a lineage that has secondarily reverted to <b>diurnal</b> foraging. <b>Tests</b> for adaptive protein evolution indicate that long-wavelength opsin shows strong evidence of stabilizing selection, {{with no more than}} five codons (2 %) under positive selection, depending on analytical procedure. In the branch leading to Megalopta, the amino acid of the single positively selected codon is conserved among ancestral Halictidae examined, and is homologous to codons known to influence molecular structure at the chromophore-binding pocket. Theoretically, such mutations can shift photopigment λ(max) sensitivity and enable visual transduction in alternate photic environments. Results are discussed in light of the available evidence on photopigment structure, morphological specialization and biogeographic distributions over geological time. Simon M.

40|$|Abstract Songbirds are {{generally}} considered diurnal, although many species show periodic nocturnal activity during migration seasons. From a breeding-range perspective, such migratory species {{appear to be}} diurnal because they are observed to nest and feed their young during the day. But are they really exclu-sively <b>diurnal?</b> The authors <b>tested</b> how a passerine long-distance migrant, the Eurasian reed warbler, schedules movements during the breeding period by tracking birds in 2 experimental situations: 1) Birds experienced simulated nest loss and were monitored during their search for alternative locations, and 2) birds were translocated to reed beds at distances from 2 to 21 km and tracked during homing. The simulated unpredictable events disrupted normal breed-ing, forced birds to move over relatively long distances, and triggered rapid change in diel activity. In all but 1 case, birds resorted to nocturnality {{to find their way}} home and to search for new places to breed. Nocturnality during the breeding season indicates that songbird schedules are far more flexible than previously assumed. The reasons for nocturnal movements are poorly under...|$|R

Despite the popularity of this movement, there has been surprisingly little research assessing the characteristics of self-help books consumers, and whether this consumption is associated with physiological and/or psychological markers of stress. The goal of this pilot study was to perform the first psychoneuroendocrine analysis of consumers of self-help books in comparison to nonconsumers. We <b>tested</b> <b>diurnal</b> and reactive salivary cortisol levels, personality, and depressive symptoms in 32 consumers and nonconsumers of self-help books. In an explorative secondary analysis, we also split consumers of self-help books {{as a function of}} their preference for problem-focused versus growth-oriented self-help books. The results showed that while consumers of growth-oriented self-help books presented increased cortisol reactivity to a psychosocial stressor compared to other groups, consumers of problem-focused self-help books presented higher depressive symptomatology.

40|$|Patients with COPD {{may show}} slow, {{progressive}} deteriorations in {{arterial blood gases}} during the night, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This is mainly due to hypoventilation, while a deterioration of ventilation/perfusion mismatch plays a minor role. The severity of gas exchanges alterations {{is proportional to the}} degree of impairment of <b>diurnal</b> pulmonary function <b>tests,</b> particularly of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) and of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) in arterial blood, but correlations between diurnal and nocturnal blood gas levels are rather loose. Subjects with diurnal PaO 2 of 60 – 70 mmHg are distinguished in “desaturators” and “nondesaturators” according to nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation behavior. The role of nocturnal hypoxemia as a determinant of alterations in sleep structure observed in COPD is dubious. Effects of the “desaturator” condition on pulmonary hemodynamics, evolution of diurnal blood gases, and life expectancy are also controversial. Conversely, it is generally accepted that occurrence of sleep apneas in COPD is associated with a worse evolution of the disease. Nocturnal polysomnographic monitoring in COPD is usually performed when coexistence of sleep apnea (“overlap syndrome”) is suspected, while in most other cases nocturnal oximetry may be enough. Nocturnal oxygen attenuates sleep desaturations among stable patients, without increases in PaCO 2 of clinical concern. Nocturnal treatment with positive pressure ventilators may give benefit to some stable hypercapnic subjects and patients with the overlap syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The loss of diurnal rhythm {{in blood}} {{pressure}} (BP) is an important predictor of end-organ damage in hypertensive and diabetic patients. Recent evidence has suggested that two major physiological circadian rhythms, the metabolic and cardiovascular rhythms, are subject to regulation by overlapping molecular pathways, indicating that dysregulation of metabolic cycles could desynchronize the normal diurnal rhythm of BP with the daily light/dark cycle. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of changes in metabolic cycles on BP <b>diurnal</b> rhythm. To <b>test</b> the hypothesis that feeding-fasting cycles could affect the diurnal pattern of BP, we used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) which develop essential hypertension with disrupted diurnal BP rhythms and examined whether abnormal BP rhythms in SHR were caused by alteration in the daily feeding rhythm. We found that SHR exhibit attenuated feeding rhythm which accompanies disrupted rhythms in metabolic gene expression not only in metabolic tissues but also in cardiovascular tissues. More importantly, the correction of abnormal feeding rhythms in SHR restored the daily BP rhythm and was accompanied by changes in the timing of expression of key circadian and metabolic genes in cardiovascular tissues. These results indicate that the metabolic cycle is an important determinant of the cardiovascular diurnal rhythm and that disrupted BP rhythms in hypertensive patients can be normalized by manipulating feeding cycles...|$|R

However, {{there is limited}} data on diurnal variation of balance control in these patients. This study aimed to investigate postural stability in older adult patients with symptomatic knee OA during different periods in a daytime. Methods: Two-hundred and forty-one patients with OA knee (median age = 65 +/- 12 years; 82 males) were enrolled in this study. Static posturography was performed under four standing conditions: eyes open and eyes closed, without and with foam support. To assess <b>diurnal</b> postural variations, <b>testing</b> sessions were defined as follows: 8 - 10 am, 10 - 12 am, 1 pm- 3 pm, 3 pm- 5 pm. Influence of sex, age, height, weight, and body mass index on postural stability was evaluated. Knee pain was also assessed in these four testing sessions. Results: Postural control was in particular less efficient in the late morning than {{in the early afternoon}} (p < 0. 05). Diurnal variation of balance control was more noticeable in older, heavier, and male patients (p < 0. 05). Patients' knee pain was more pronounced in the morning than in the afternoon (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: Balance stability of patients with OA knee was different during a daytime. Altered postural performance in the morning could be explained by joint pain. This diurnal variation should be taken into account in the daily management of knee OA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Predation may be particularly relevant for inhabitants of fragmented habitats, which encounter unfavorable conditions when crossing gaps in their preferred habitat. Therefore, similar selection pressures around the year may have favored the evolution of a general circadian mechanism for switches to nocturnality.

40|$|Abstract The {{mechanisms}} of summertime diurnal pre-cipitation in the US Great Plains were examined with the two-dimensional (2 D) Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) cloud-resolving model (CRM). The model was {{constrained by the}} observed large-scale background state and surface flux derived from the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program’s Intensive Observing Period (IOP) data at the Southern Great Plains (SGP). The model, when continuously-forced by realistic surface flux and large-scale advection, simu-lates reasonably well the temporal evolution of the observed rainfall episodes, particularly for the strongly forced precipitation events. However, the model exhibits a deficiency for the weakly forced events driven by <b>diurnal</b> convection. Additional <b>tests</b> were run with the GCE model in order to discriminate between the mechanisms that determine daytime and nighttime convection. In these tests, the model was constrained with the same repeating diurnal variation in the large-scale advection and/or surface flux. The results indicate that it is primarily the surface heat and moisture flux {{that is responsible for}} the development of deep convection in the afternoon, whereas the large-scale upward motion and associated moisture advection {{play an important role in}} preconditioning nocturnal convection. In the nighttime, high clouds are continuously built up through their interaction and feedback with long-wave radiation, eventually initiating deep convection from the boundary layer. Without these upper-level destabilization processes, the model tends to produce only daytime con-vection in response to boundary layer heating.

The elemental composition in {{six out of}} seven species tested was affected by variation in [CO 2,aq]. Among these species, the magnitude of change in C: N: P was similar over the experimental CO 2 range. Differences in both cell size and day length-dependent growth rate {{had little effect on}} the critical CO 2 concentration below which a further decrease in [CO 2,aq] led to large changes in C: N: P ratios. Significant CO 2 -related changes in elemental ratios were observed at [CO 2,aq] � 10 �mol kg� 1 and correlated with a CO 2 -dependent decrease in growth rate. At [CO 2,aq] typical for ocean surface waters, variation in C: N: P was relatively small under our experimental conditions. No general pattern for CO 2 -related changes in the elemental composition could be found with regard to the direction of trends.

40|$|Predation risk {{strongly}} {{influences the}} ecology {{and evolution of}} animal behaviors. However, anti-predator responses differ among species. Tradeoffs between anti-predator abilities and foraging efficiencies across habitats can promote the coexistence of ecologically similar species. In general, larger animals may better exploit riskier habitats; smaller animals, resources at low densities. I studied two montane ground squirrels Spermophilus lateralis and Tamias minimus in Colorado. Using food trays, I determined that the smaller T. minimus foraged more efficiently near meadow edges and was competitively superior to S. lateralis there. In contrast, S. lateralis had no preference for either edge or far habitat, but was competitively superior to T. minimus farther from the edge. I predicted, correctly, the exclusion of S. lateralis from meadows with primarily edge habitat. I proposed three alternatives to explain the observed patterns of habitat use: satiation, travel cost, or perceived predation risk. In a series of manipulations of energetic costs, protective cover, and predators, I eliminated all but the predation risk hypothesis. S. lateralis perceives less risk farther {{from the edge of}} the meadow than T. minimus. Faster harvesting and running speeds might decrease perceived predation risk. S. lateralis and T. minimus both experienced diminishing returns while foraging in food trays. Due to a higher encounter rate, S. lateralis harvested seeds significantly faster than T. minimus. S. lateralis also ran faster than T. minimus (3. 14 m/s and 2. 13 m/s, respectively). Gregarious animals may detect predators before solitary ones. I suggest that due to differences between sensory modes, this advantage occrues only to animals using vision. Thus, I predicted that gregariousness as a predator detection strategy should evolve only in <b>diurnal</b> animals. To <b>test</b> this, I mapped diurnal activity and gregarious behavior onto a phylogeny of eutherian mammals, and than calculated their degree of association. I found strong support for my prediction. This pattern may occur in other mobile animals. The data also suggest an association between larger body size and open habitat use among diurnal, gregarious organisms, paralleling a result from Colorado ground squirrels...|$|R
