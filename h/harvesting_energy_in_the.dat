40|$|<b>Harvesting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human {{environment}} {{has been identified}} as an effective way to charge the body sensor nodes in wireless body area networks (WBANs). In such networks, the capability of the nodes to detect events is of vital importance and complements the stringent quality of service (QoS) demands in terms of delay, throughput, and packet loss. However, the scarce energy collected by human motions, along with the strict requirements of vital health signals in terms of QoS, raises important challenges for WBANs and stresses the need for new integrated QoS-aware energy management schemes. In this paper, we propose a joint power-QoS (PEH-QoS) control scheme, composed of three modules that interact in order to make optimal use of energy and achieve the best possible QoS. The proposed scheme ensures that a sensor node is able to detect the medical events and transmit the respective data packets efficiently. Extensive simulations, conducted for different human activities (i. e., relaxing, walking, running, and cycling), have shown that the application of PEH-QoS in a medical node increases the detection efficiency, the throughput, and the energy efficiency of the system.

We devise novel online scheduling schemes <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> tradeoff between the users' ergodic rates and their average amount of <b>harvested</b> <b>energy</b> can be controlled. In particular, we modify the well-known maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and maximum normalized-SNR (N-SNR) schedulers by scheduling the user whose SNR/N-SNR has a certain ascending order (selection order) rather than the maximum one. We refer to these new schemes as order-based SNR/N-SNR scheduling and show that the lower the selection order, the higher the average amount of <b>harvested</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system {{at the expense of}} a reduced ergodic sum rate.

Time switching scheme is used at the relay to switch between EH and decoding information. Harvest-use approach is implemented, and we investigate the effects of <b>the</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> enhancing <b>the</b> performance of the relaying system by deriving estimated closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function of each link & #x 2019;s individual SNR and of the end-to-end SNR. The analytical expression for the ergodic capacity is also derived. These expressions are validated through Monte-Carlo simulations. It is also shown that with the additional EH at the transmitter (source and relay), a significant improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system throughput can be achieved when fixed batteries are running on low powers...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{wireless}} {{information and}} power transfer (SWIPT) is an appealing solution to balance <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> distribution <b>in</b> wireless networks {{and improve the}} energy-efficiency of <b>the</b> entire network. <b>In</b> this paper, we study the optimal policies for SWIPT over the flat-fading channel subject to the co-channel interference. The SWIPT receiver using dynamic power splitting (DPS) is expected to achieve the maximum information rate given an average <b>harvested</b> <b>energy</b> constraint. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case that channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is not available, the optimal power splitting is derived. For the case with CSIT, the joint optimal policy of the transmit power and the power splitting are also provided. Through simulations, we show the optimal rate-energy (R-E) trade-offs of our proposed policies. The case with CSIT achieves better R-E trade-off than the case with no CSIT.

Solar absorbers using cermet-based coatings {{demonstrate a}} high absorptance {{of the solar}} spectrum and a low emittance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared (IR) regime. Extensive {{work has been done}} to optimize cermet-based solar absorbers to achieve high performance by exploring different cermet (ceramic–metal composite) materials and film configurations through different preparation techniques such as electrodeposition, sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and solution-based methods. In this article, we review the progress of cermet-based spectrally selective absorbers with high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance, such as Cr[subscript 2]O[subscript 3], Al[subscript 2]O[subscript 3], AlN, SiO[subscript 2], and ZrO[subscript 2] based cermets as absorption layers. We also present an outlook for cermet-based spectrally selective absorbers with high thermal stability and high conversion efficiency from sunlight to heat. United States.
