These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls.

The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{it appears}} that after 1914 most {{maintenance}} work was undertaken only when conditions presented a safety hazard, mechanical systems were in need of repair, or the building became extremely unsightly. Lack of scheduled maintenance affects the performance of building materials. Wood, in particular, requires proper maintenance of paint coatings to control the development of rot. In this building, {{it is important to}} maintain the condition of the interior, as well as exterior, coatings because of the humid <b>indoor</b> <b>environment.</b> Also necessary is the maintenance of waterproofing details, such as flashing, to prevent water from accumulating in concealed areas. It is therefore not surprising that rot developed in the building, and significant repairs to the wood elements of the building were necessary over time, given its somewhat irregular maintenance history.|$|E

The Maharishi University of Management (MUM) in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (best known for having brought Transcendental Meditation to the West) incorporates principles of Bau Biology (a German system that focuses on creating a healthy <b>indoor</b> <b>environment),</b> as well as Maharishi Vedic Architecture (an Indian system of architecture focused on the precise orientation, proportions and placement of rooms). The building {{is one of the}} few in the country to qualify as net zero, and one of even fewer that can claim the banner of grid positive via its solar power system. A rainwater catchment system and on-site natural waste-water treatment likewise take the building off (sewer) grid with respect to water and waste treatment. Additional green features include natural daylighting in every room, natural and breathable earth block walls (made by the program’s students), purified rainwater for both potable and non-potable functions; and an on-site water purification and recycling system consisting of plants, algae, and bacteria.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Indoor</b> human <b>environments,</b> {{including}} homes, offices, schools, workplaces, {{transport systems}} and other settings, often harbor potentially unsafe microorganisms. Most {{previous studies of}} bioaerosols in <b>indoor</b> <b>environments</b> have addressed contamination with bacteria or fungi. Reports {{on the presence of}} viral aerosols in indoor air are scarce, however, despite the fact that viruses are probably {{the most common cause of}} infection acquired indoor. OBJECTIVE: This review discusses the most common respiratory (influenza viruses, rhino-viruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and enteroviruses) and gastrointestinal (noroviruses) viral pathogens which can be easily transmitted in <b>indoor</b> <b>environments.</b> RESULTS: The vast majority of studies reviewed here concern hospital and other health facilities where viruses are a well-known cause of occupational and nosocomial infections. Studies on other <b>indoor</b> <b>environments,</b> on the other hand, including homes, non-industrial workplaces and public buildings, are scarce. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of regulations, threshold values and standardized detection methods for viruses in <b>indoor</b> <b>environments,</b> make both research and interpretation of results difficult in this field, hampering infection control efforts. Further research will be needed to achieve a better understanding of virus survival in aerosols and on surfaces, and to elucidate the relationship between viruses and indoor environmental characteristics...|$|R
