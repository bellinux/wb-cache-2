40|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} equipment devices in the blast furnace iron making process. The temperature and duration of hot air are the crucial parameters to assess the performance of the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove. In order to sustain the desired high temperature air, it requires rapid completed combustion reaction, stable flue gas flow structure, and uniform temperature distribution throughout the regenerator. In the present work, a 3 D numerical model with all essential turbulence, heat transfer, and combustion considerations has been developed to assess the performance of a typical hot air stove. The flow field of the whole domain and temperature distribution within the regenerator were simulated using the model. The predicted results show that the velocity at each nozzle varies substantially due to the uneven pressure distribution in cavity of the traditional <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove, generating the eccentric vortex that leads to nonuniform temperature distribution in the regenerator. In order to solve this problem, a new structure design of top combustion regenerative <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove is proposed. Numerical simulations were then carried out to compare based on the performance of the new <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove design against the traditional <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove...|$|R

5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention of the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge's ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> process.

40|$|AbstractA {{large amount}} of energy is {{required}} in the production of steel where the preheating of <b>blast</b> in the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stoves for iron-making {{is one of the most}} energy-intensive processes. To improve the energy efficiency it is necessary to investigate how to improve the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove operation. In this work a mathematic model for evaluating the performance of the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove was developed using a finite difference approximation to represent the heat transfer inside the stove during operation. The developed model was calibrated by using the process data from the stove V 26 at SSAB Oxelösund, Sweden. As a case study, the developed model was used to simulate the effect of a new concept of OxyFuel technique to <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stoves. The investigation shows that,by using the OxyFuel technique, it is possible to maintain the blast temperature while removing the usage of coke oven gas. Additionally, the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> temperature increases while the flue gas temperature decreases, which allows for an increase of the blast temperature, leading to improved energy efficiency for the hot stove system...|$|R

40|$|An {{issue of}} {{improvement}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the operation of a block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stoves of the blast furnace in order to rise the temperature of the blast-furnace air was considered. It was shown that an increase of the temperature of the blast-furnace air without the use of natural gas and oxygen for combustion is possible due to the changing of the operation modes of a block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stoves and at the increase of the pressure of the exchange gas. An analysis of the recent researches and publications describing the methods for determining the parameters of the operation of the block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stoves of the blast furnace was performed; their advantages and disadvantages were described. The goal of the research was set. A database of process parameters of the block was processed to determine the main characteristics of the operation of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stoves of the blast furnace. Averaged values of the basic technical and design parameters were obtained; they characterize the operation of each <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove of the block with the use of which the adjustment of a mathematical model of the operation of each of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove of the block was achieved. A method for determining the main unit operating parameters on the block on the account of the desired blast temperature was designed. The values of the duration of the cycle "heating + air blasting" depending on the set-point temperature of the smoke at various values of air blasting temperatures were determined for each <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove of the block using a mathematical model. The authors suggested to use such dependencies to determine the temporal parameters of the operation of the block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stoves. The obtained values of the duration of heating periods and air <b>blasting</b> of each <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> stove of the block should be corrected if the continuity of the air blast supply to the blast furnace is not ensured. The examples of the use of this technique were given and the obtained results were described. It is shown that an increase of the pressure in the operating space {{in the course of the}} heating period of the checker the temperature of the <b>hot</b> air <b>blasting</b> can be increased due to a larger amount of heat accumulated by the checker.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} two methods of control over <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> supply into a blast furnace with constant pressure and constant amount (consumption). The analysis of these two methods was performed {{with the aim of}} determining their influence upon changes in gas pressure in the blast furnace top. The blast furnace was considered as a unity of vessels (furnace hearth, the top) and gas-dynamic resistance (a column of charge materials). A differential equation was obtained, with regard to the dynamic balance of gas flow at the inlet and outlet of the top; the equation relates the pressure and gas consumption at the top to the pressure and <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> consumption at the inlet and outlet of the furnace and to the resistance of the column of charge materials. The column of charge materials is considered as n-th number of channels through which gas flow inside the furnace moves and which resist to the flow. By the analysis of this equation at steady state (automatic stabilization of gas pressure in the top), the conditions were obtained to be satisfied with the specified value of gas pressure in the top. This value is equal to a half of the sum of the value of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> pressure at the inlet into the furnace and the value of pressure inside the collector of blast furnace gas. This conclusion is verified by the operation practice of blast furnaces in Ukraine. While analyzing the second method of controlling the supply of blast supply-stabilization of consumption (amount) of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> supplied into the furnace {{it has been shown that}} the method could be realized in condition of stabilization of the amount of blast furnace gas, going out of the furnace. As the resistance of the column of charge materials constantly changes it is necessary to change the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> pressure in order to ensure the constant amount of blast, supplied into the furnace. It is often connected with possible substantial pressure fluctuations of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> at the inlet of the furnace, which may result in stoppages in the motion of the column of charge materials. Due to it the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> pressure stabilization at the inlet of the furnace and the pressure stabilization in the top seem to be the most rational way to control the blast suppl...|$|R
