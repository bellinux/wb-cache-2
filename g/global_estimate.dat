25|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources has {{classified}} the markhor as {{an endangered}} species, meaning {{it is in}} danger of facing extinction in the near future if conservation efforts are not maintained. There have been different estimates as to how many markhors exist but a <b>global</b> <b>estimate</b> put the number at less than 2,500 mature individuals. There are reservations in Tajikistan to protect the markhors. In 1973, two reservations were established. The Dashtijum Strict Reserve (also called the Zapovednik in Russian) offers markhor protect across 20,000 ha. The Dashtijum Reserve (called the Zakasnik in Russian) covers 53,000 ha. Though these reserves exist to protect and conserve the markhor population, the regulations are poorly enforced making poaching common as well as habitat destruction. Although markhors still face ongoing threats, recent studies have shown considerable success with regards to the conservation approach. The approach began in the 1900s when a local hunter was convinced by a hunting tourist to stop poaching markhors. The local hunter established a conservancy that inspired two other local organizations called Morkhur and Muhofiz. The two organizations expect that their conversations will not only protect, but allow them to sustainability use the markhor species. This approach has been very effective compared to the protect lands that lack enforcement and security. In India, the markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} part of a cluster of five {{articles}} on <b>global</b> health <b>estimates.</b> How Did We Get Here? Global measurement has long been contentious. Three hundred years ago, the exact size and shape of the world were a matter of scientific controversy and estimation. New ways of measurement were developed, and by the early 18 th century that uncertainty ceased [1]. One hundred years ago, Sweden started to account for all deaths in its population,bycause,age,andsex[2],and annual summary tables based on individual death registration on a national basis have been published ever since. Today, despite increasing globalisation, there is still no similar universal individual registration of vital events in many countries, and consequently we find ourselves in an era of <b>global</b> <b>estimates</b> of population health. These <b>global</b> <b>estimates</b> are complex amalgams of detailed national measures from countries with universal registration and the best available data—which are often scanty—from other settings. Hopefully the long-term aim of the global health community is to move beyond this era of estimates, towards the relative certainty of accounting for individual health globally. Meanwhile, {{the purpose of this article}} is to explore issues and tensions around these currently necessary <b>global</b> <b>estimates.</b> As discussed previously [3], fundamental links between poverty and data availability mean that <b>global</b> <b>estimates</b> are not trivial to construct. Unlike <b>global</b> <b>estimates</b> of geophysical parameters, which have been revolutionised by remote sensing and satellite surveillance [4], population health estimates must continue to rely in some way on grassroots data about individual people. But lack of standards and different approaches are causing contention and confusion. The Essay section contains opinion pieces on topics of broad interest to a general medical audience...|$|R
