5000|$|The {{repayment}} schedule for Direct PLUS Loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 {{is the same}} as the schedule for Stafford loans. However, for Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed before July 1, 2008, the repayment period begins at the time the PLUS loan is fully disbursed, and the first payment is due within 60 days after the <b>final</b> disbursement. <b>Repayment</b> may be deferred while at least a half-time student; however, the unpaid interest is added to the principal.|$|R
50|$|Macaulay {{duration}} has the diagrammatic interpretation {{shown in}} figure 1. This represents the bond discussed in the example below - two year maturity with a coupon of 20% and continuously compounded yield of 3.9605%. The circles represent {{the present value of}} the payments, with the coupon payments getting smaller the further in the future they are, and the final large payment including both the coupon payment and the <b>final</b> principal <b>repayment.</b> If these circles were put on a balance beam, the fulcrum (balanced center) of the beam would represent the weighted average distance (time to payment), which is 1.78 years in this case.|$|R
40|$|Usually, loan {{transactions}} contracted {{in practice}} are nonrandom; {{that is to}} say, all amounts received (principal) and paid (period instalments) by the borrower are previously agreed with the lender, {{as well as their}} respective dates. In this paper, two new alternative loan models are introduced, depending on whether the borrower survives or not to fulfil all repayment obligations. In this way, either the initial or the <b>final</b> date of <b>repayments</b> can be subject to this contingency. Additionally, the different parameters of such random transactions are determined, as well as several measures of profitability/cost for the lender/borrower, respectively. These transactions can be attractive for both the lender and the borrower, which therefore make them worthy of consideration and subsequent implementation for the benefit of both parties...|$|R

2500|$|Germany, which {{up until}} the 1953 Debt {{agreement}} had {{to work on the}} assumption that all the Marshall Plan aid was to be repaid, spent its funds very carefully. Payment for Marshall Plan goods, [...] "counterpart funds", were administered by the Reconstruction Credit Institute, which used the funds for loans inside Germany. In the 1953 Debt agreement the amount of Marshall plan aid that Germany was to repay was reduced to less than 1 billion USD. This made the proportion of loans versus grants to Germany similar to that of France and the UK. The <b>final</b> German loan <b>repayment</b> was made in 1971. Since Germany chose to repay the aid debt out of the German Federal budget, leaving the German ERP fund intact, the fund was able to continue its reconstruction work. By 1996 it had accumulated a value of 23 billion Deutsche Mark.|$|R
40|$|There {{is no one}} entity solely {{responsible}} for the debt crisis Nigeria found itself in by the early 1980 s: not the Nigerian government, the banks, not the creditor governments. The increase in the Nigeria debt crises has been caused {{by a lot of}} factors that have forced their way into the country’s administration over the years. The major cause of Nigeria’s debt crises is the change in the economic fortune in the oil sector. One major obstacle for Nigeria’s economic development {{over the last two decades}} has been its crippling debt overhang. In April 2006, Nigeria ordered a <b>final</b> debt <b>repayment</b> to rich lending nations, completing Africa’s biggest debt relief deal. How do we assess the debt crisis in which Nigeria found itself? What are the lessons to be learned? Certainly, these are some of the most important questions to be studied as the country embarks with a clean slate with private and bilateral lenders after the long sought-after debt restructuring deal that came in April 2006. This paper analyzes the lessons to be learned from Nigeria’s debt history, looking especially at the phenomenon of oil-led spending and borrowing that occurred during 1986 - 2006. Its objective is to determine whether Nigeria received a higher credit-rating than its domestic and macroeconomic fundamentals would have otherwise justified due to its oil revenues, and whether the debt-repayment crisis arose because oil windfalls from the early 1980 s were not used to retire its debt...|$|R
50|$|The same scheme {{refers to}} an auto loan. It is {{extended}} for a fixed period during which a person makes repayments. The latter also includes principal and interest and a borrower gains the right for a vehicle {{as soon as the}} <b>final</b> <b>repayment</b> is made. However, closed-end credits of auto type differ from the mortgage ones as they are considerably shorter and in the majority of cases have got fixed interest rates.|$|E
50|$|He {{persuaded the}} {{legislature}} to authorize a one-million pound loan for public works that were never undertaken. The provincial bonds were sold in London through the Baring Brothers Bank, local and Buenos Aires-based British traders also acting as financial intermediaries. The borrowed money was in turn lent to these businessmen, who never repaid it. Of the original million pounds the Buenos Aires government received only £552,700.

During the war Britain lost many of its lucrative export markets and now confronted an annual balance of {{payments}} deficit of £1.2billion. As in World War I, Britain emerged from the war militarily triumphant but economically poorer (rationing did not end until 1953), and economist John Maynard Keynes was sent to America to negotiate a low-interest emergency loan of £3.75 billion to tide Britain over; the <b>final</b> <b>repayment</b> of £45.5m (then about $83m) was made on 31 December 2006.|$|E
50|$|A <b>final</b> <b>repayment</b> {{agreement}} was reached between UK, Netherlands and Icelandic negotiators, and a bill formally entitled Act 96/2009 {{was presented to the}} Icelandic parliament in June 2009. However, the Althing debate revealed wide opposition -even within the government- about the repayment conditions, and thus the parliament unilaterally added an amendment to the bill which set a maximum ceiling on the yearly repayments based on the country's Gross Domestic Product. On 28 August 2009, Iceland's parliament voted 34-15 (with 14 abstentions) to approve this amended bill (commonly referred to as the Icesave bill 1), which covered the conditions for the repayment to Great Britain and Netherlands of the €3.8bn minimum deposit guarantees stemming from the losses on the foreign Icesave deposit accounts. The repayment basically functioned as a states guaranteed repayment of the €3.8bn to UK and Netherlands, previously being owed to them by the at that point of time money drained Icelandic Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund (Tryggingarsjóður).|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} that the ability of {{students}} to repay their Canada Student Loan Program (CSLP) depends primarily on their future earnings {{rather than on the}} size of debt incurred. In fact, the amount of debt {{does not appear to have}} much of an effect, except when high loan amounts are combined with low incomes. In the case of those who consolidated in 1994 - 95, the loan amount had an effect on default rates only when it was greater than $ 20, 000 (federal CSLP portion) and the income of the students was lower than $ 40, 000. The relationship between income and default emerges soon after graduation and is a strong predictor of the <b>final</b> <b>repayment</b> outcome. Moreover, future earnings, as well as the probability of loan repayment, are strongly correlated with the type of education (type of degree, field of study, and type of institution). The type of program and local labour market conditions can be used to predict the risk of default of loans. ...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{corporate}} law reform introduced {{different types of}} financial instruments, while aiming at increasing the recourse to capital markets and meeting the diversified requests of emerging categories of professional and sophisticated investors. The aforementioned financial instruments came to fall in a wide grey zone between stock and corporate bonds, although they differ from both because destined to specific professional investors instead of retail investors. The following research presents an analysis of some particular kinds of financial instruments, called “participating financial instruments” by artt. 2346, 2349 and 2351, civil code. The {{first part of the}} paper explores the content of the adjective “participating” because {{it is not clear whether}} “participating” is to be referred to the social organization or to the exposure to risk that these instruments entail. The latter interpretation eventually prevails. Consequently, “participating” is referred to participation, through the financial instrument, to corporate losses or profits. The issue of participating financial instruments is considered one among other equity-raising activities because the contributions from the instruments flow in the equity and, consequently, are exposed to risk, although the investor does not have the right to a <b>final</b> <b>repayment.</b> The relationship between issuer and subscriber of participating financial instruments goes beyond the credit-debt phenomenon, which instead pertains to bonds and securities similar to bonds, ruled by art. 2411, co. 3, civil code. In fact, the previous instruments entail a repayment obligation, although depending on the level of corporate losses or profits. Participating financial instruments are considered quasi-equity. This legal nature justifies the legislative provision that leaves to contractual freedom the opportunity of the investor’s participation in the profits and, in case, some management rights (art. 2351 civil code). Moreover, the paper analyzes different typologies of possible subscriber contributions -in particular the characteristics of the contribution of services- as well as addressing their financial accounting and reporting in the balance sheet and the different and complex purposes that the issue of participating financial instruments intends to accomplish...|$|E
