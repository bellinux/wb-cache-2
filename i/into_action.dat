In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting {{with a sense of}} urgency, had decided to go <b>into</b> <b>action</b> without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E

At 11:30 am, the arms depot at the prison building was seized and the firearms were distributed among the demonstrators.|$|E

Having learned of the threat, Mega Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. Mega Man & Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other.|$|E
5|$|Attached to the 5th Light Infantry at Alexandra Barracks were a {{detachment}} of 97 Indian officers and {{men of the}} Malay States Guides Mule Battery. Raised in 1896 for the internal garrisoning of the Federated Malay States, the regiment was recruited from Sikhs, Pathans and Punjabis in both India and Malaya. The British officer commanding the battery was shot dead by an unknown sniper as he hastened to the gun park. The MSG gunners then dispersed when {{a large body of}} 5th LI mutineers approached their lines. The MSG artillery pieces were abandoned but not brought <b>into</b> <b>action</b> by the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed <b>into</b> <b>action.</b> These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters. The German intelligence had no knowledge of the sector operations rooms there. The rooms were above ground and had little protection. If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E
40|$|Temporal {{segmentation}} {{of human}} motion <b>into</b> <b>actions</b> {{is central to}} the understanding and building of computational models of human motion and activity recognition. Several issues contribute to the challenge of temporal segmentation and classification of human motion. These include the large variability in the temporal scale and periodicity of human actions, the complexity of representing articulated motion, and the exponential nature of all possible movement combinations. We provide initial results from investigating two distinct problems - classification of the overall task being performed, and the more difficult problem of classifying individual frames over time <b>into</b> specific <b>actions.</b> We explore first-person sensing through a wearable camera and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) for temporally segmenting human motion <b>into</b> <b>actions</b> and performing activity classification in the context of cooking and recipe preparation in a natural environment. We present baseline results for supervised and unsupervised temporal segmentation, and recipe recognition in the CMU-Multimodal activity database (CMU-MMAC) ...|$|R
