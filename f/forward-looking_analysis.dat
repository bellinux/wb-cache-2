The most recent version of the Web has become a platform, and building new business on this platform {{is no longer a}} multi-million dollar undertaking. Start-up companies are leveraging a decade of innovation of technology that is proven, or very nearly so. What is different is that the Web’s most recent innovative wave is driven by entrepreneurs not financiers. Search has provided a fundamental business model for many Internet-enabled companies. Past lessons led to building a new service that provides a sustainable revenue base from which to refine service offerings and the definition of a viable business model. Within this context, the volume examines the micro-economics of platform structure and firm competition within and between online markets, modern theoretical treatments of regulatory intervention in online markets and the consideration of <b>forward-looking</b> experimental <b>analysis</b> of demand for yet to be provided services. The volume is divided into three parts: innovation and competition in online markets; regulation, pricing and evaluation with real options; and empirical approaches to market analysis.

40|$|In any {{economic}} environment where decisions are decentralized, agents consider {{the risk that}} others might unfairly exploit informational asymmetries to their own disadvantage. Incomplete results, especially, {{lies at the heart}} of financial transactions in which agents trade real claims for promises of future real claims. Agents thus need to invest considerable resources to assess the trustworthiness of others with whom they know they can interact only under conditions of limited and asymmetrically distributed information. Thinking of finance as the complex of institutions and instruments needed to reduce the cost of trading promises among anonymous individuals who do not fully trust each other, the author analyzes how incomplete trust shapes the transaction costs in trading assets, and how it affects resource allocation and pricing decisions from rational, <b>forward-looking</b> agents. His <b>analysis</b> leads to core propositions about the role of finance and financial efficiency in economic development. He recommends areas of financial sector reform in emerging economies aimed at improving the financial system's efficiency in dealing with incomplete trust.

The study uses existing processing technologies and agricultural statistics. Bioethanol production is calculated from putrescible wastes and starch crops, and biodiesel production from rapeseed, tallow, wood and waste paper.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two questions: -Can Welfare-to-Work expand {{employment and}} -Has Britain"s New Deal {{for young people}} actually done so, and have its benefits justified the cost? There is ample evidence that unemployment (and employment) is affected by how the unemployed are treated. Other things equal, countries that offer unemployment benefits of long duration have more unemployment (and less employment). This is because employment depends on the effective supply of labour. Cross-sectional and time-series evidence is presented. The British New Deal for Young People is a policy that prevents young people from entering long-term unemployment. To get a crude estimate of its overall effects on the unemployment (and employment) rate of young people, we can take {{the change in the}} rate between April 1998 and April 2000 and subtract from it the change in the rate for adults aged 30 - 49.

This research examines disclosure patterns and determinants of these disclosures in three critical years: 1996, 2001 and 2006, which respectively represent periods of self-regulation, reaction to the 1997 Asian currency crisis, and response to post-Enron influences. A comprehensive index comprising 85 items is used to measure {{the extent of}} voluntary disclosure. There is a statistically significant increase in the extent of voluntary disclosure over the eleven-year period. Voluntary disclosure increases from 22. 97 % in 1996 to 34. 12 % in 2006. The largest increase occurs between 1996 and 2001, a time of great internal angst brought about from the 1997 crisis. Findings also reveal that global corporate scandals and the external regulatory pressures provided stimulus for greater voluntary disclosures, albeit moderate, increase between 2001 and 2006. Voluntary disclosures for all five key sub-categories rose from 1996 to 2006 with a marked increase in the disclosure of directors and senior management and social reporting information; and moderate growth in corporate and strategic, financial and <b>forward-looking</b> information. Regression <b>analysis</b> results show that a company‟s voluntary disclosure practice is positively responsive to the strength of corporate governance structure in post-crisis and post-Enron periods.

The paper describes a simple probabilistic model of the costs of synthetic crude oil produced from Canadian oil sands. Synthetic crude oil is obtained by upgrading bitumen that is first produced through mining or in-situ recovery techniques. This <b>forward-looking</b> <b>analysis</b> quantifies the effects of learning and production constraints on the costs of supplying synthetic crude oil. The sensitivity analysis shows that before 2035, the most influential parameters are the learning parameter in the case of in-situ bitumen and the depletion parameter in the case of mined bitumen. After 2035, depletion dominates in both cases. The results show that the social cost of CO 2 has a large impact on the total costs of synthetic crude oil, in particular in the case of synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen, due to the carbon intensity of the recovery techniques: taking into account the social cost of CO 2 adds more than half to the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from mined bitumen in 2050 (mean value), while the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen more than doubles...|$|E

This <b>forward-looking</b> <b>analysis</b> quantifies the effects of production constraints and experience on the costs of corn and sugar cane, which can then be converted to bioethanol. Land is a limited and heterogeneous resource: the crop cost model builds on the marginal land suitability, which is assumed to decrease as more land is taken into production, driving down the marginal crop yield. Also, the maximum achievable yield is increased over time by technological change, while the yield gap between the actual yield and the maximum yield decreases through improved management practices. The results show large uncertainties in the future costs of producing corn and sugar cane, with a 90 % confidence interval of 2. 9 - 7. 2 $/GJ in 2030 for marginal corn costs, and 1. 5 - 2. 5 $/GJ in 2030 for marginal sugar cane costs. The influence of each parameter on these supply costs is examined...|$|E
30|$|After the {{publication}} of various multi-regional input–output (MRIO) databases {{over the past years}} and related environmental and socio-economic footprint analyses, the interest in these global value chain analyses is ever increasing. In order to provide <b>forward-looking</b> <b>analysis</b> of policy impacts, it is necessary to take MRIO data one step further, projecting them into the future. This paper introduces a simple approach to implementing existing climate change scenarios, such as the IEA energy technology perspective scenarios, in MRIO models. Rather than forecasting the world economy, the methodology is based on a mix of econometric estimations on the demand side and using specific information regarding technology development and its classical implementation in input–output tables. We apply this “what if” scenario approach to the most recent version of the MRIO system EXIOBASE. We compare the development of consumption- and production-based CO 2 emissions up to 2030. As an additional example, we show that the energy dependency of Europe is reduced in the 2 -degree scenario compared to the 6 -degree scenario, while the material dependency is higher. We discuss the major shortcoming of the model, the assumption of constant shares if no better information is available, and suggest that this actually is an advantage for deducing policy implications.|$|E
