50|$|Wigen {{had served}} {{as head of the}} Tide and Current Survey for the Pacific coast and western Arctic. His work in the field of tsunami {{research}} from 1960 to 1985 helped establish current standards for tsunami <b>data</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
50|$|The IEEE 11073 {{family of}} {{standards}} use the object-oriented systems management paradigm. <b>Data</b> (<b>measurement,</b> state, and so on) are modeled {{in the form}} of information objects that are accessed and manipulated using an object access service protocol. Note that {{this does not mean that}} Agents or Managers must be implemented using object oriented programming languages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{sensor data}} are omnipresent and {{ubiquitous}} available. Additionally, sensor measurements were required in several domains such as disaster management or renewable energies. This paper presents a proposal how sensor <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> {{can be integrated}} in a standardized Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). Therefore we extended the SDI by the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) in order to compute and access sensor <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> served by a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) ...|$|R
30|$|In the following, we {{calibrate}} the MR-FDPF {{model in}} two cases. The first case is to calibrate the MR-FDPF model {{with all the}} available <b>measurement</b> <b>data,</b> while the second case is to calibrate it with {{only a part of}} the available <b>measurement</b> <b>data.</b> Intuitively, the prediction performance of the MR-FDPF model calibrated with all the <b>measurement</b> <b>data</b> should be better than that calibrated with only a part of the <b>measurement</b> <b>data</b> since more <b>measurement</b> <b>data</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|It then {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} using each approach in various practical and theoretical situations. Techniques discussed include historical studies, case studies, dialogues, language development, collecting <b>data,</b> <b>measurement,</b> controlling reliability, and validation. Arbnor & Bjerke further argue that qualitative research methods must {{be consistent with the}} epistemological presumptions of the researcher, the theory and the research problem.|$|E
50|$|A radio {{receiver}} receives its input from an antenna, uses electronic filters to separate a wanted radio signal {{from all other}} signals picked up by this antenna, amplifies it to a level suitable for further processing, and finally converts through demodulation and decoding the signal into a form usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital <b>data,</b> <b>measurement</b> values, navigational positions, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} least squares, {{which was used}} to {{minimize}} errors in <b>data</b> <b>measurement,</b> was published independently by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805), Robert Adrain (1808), and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1809). Gauss had used the method in his famous 1801 prediction of {{the location of the}} dwarf planet Ceres. The observations that Gauss based his calculations on were made by the Italian monk Piazzi.|$|E

40|$|The flow VLE {{apparatus}} {{designed and}} built for a previous project was upgraded and recalibrated for <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> for this project. The modifications include better and more accurate sampling technique, addition of a digital recorder to monitor temperature and pressure inside the VLE cell, and a new technique for remote sensing of the liquid level in the cell. VLE <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> for three binary systems, tetralin-quinoline, benzene [...] ethylbenzene and ethylbenzene [...] quinoline, have been completed. The temperature ranges of <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> were 325 C to 370 C for the first system, 180 C to 300 C for the second system, and 225 C to 380 C for the third system. The smoothed data {{were found to be}} fairly well behaved when subjected to thermodynamic consistency tests. SETARAM C- 80 calorimeter was used for incremental enthalpy and heat capacity measurements for benzene [...] ethylbenzene binary liquid mixtures. Data were measured from 30 C to 285 C for liquid mixtures covering the entire composition range. An apparatus has been designed for simultaneous measurement of excess volume and incremental enthalpy of liquid mixtures at temperatures from 30 C to 300 C. The apparatus has been tested and is ready for <b>data</b> <b>measurements.</b> A flow apparatus for measurement of heat of mixing of liquid mixtures at high temperatures has also been designed, and is currently being tested and calibrated...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{validation}} of BTF <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> by means used for BRDF measurements. First, we show {{how to apply}} the Helmholtz reciprocity and isotropy for a single data set. Second, we discuss a cross-validation for BRDF <b>measurement</b> <b>data</b> obtained from two different measurement setups, where the measurements are not calibrated or the level of accuracy is not known. We show the practical problems encountered and the solutions we have used to validate physical setup for four material samples. We describe a novel coordinate system suitable for resampling the BRDF data from one data set to another data set. Further, we show how the perceptually uniform color space CIELab is used for cross-comparison of BRDF <b>data</b> <b>measurements,</b> which were not calibrated...|$|R
50|$|Heteroskedasticity {{occurs when}} the amount of error is {{correlated}} with an independent variable. For example, in a regression on food expenditure and income, the error is correlated with income. Low income people generally spend a similar amount on food, while high income people may spend a very large amount or as little as low income people spend. Heteroskedastic can also be caused by changes in measurement practices. For example, as statistical offices improve their <b>data,</b> <b>measurement</b> error decreases, so the error term declines over time.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} Investigations {{curriculum}} is to help all children understand the fundamental ideas of number and arithmetic, geometry, <b>data,</b> <b>measurement</b> and early algebra. Unlike traditional methods, the original edition did not provide student textbooks to describe standard methods or provide solved examples. Instead, students were guided {{to develop their own}} invented algorithms through working with concrete representations of number such as manipulatives and drawings as well as more traditional number sentences. Additional activities include journaling, cutting and pasting, interviewing (for data collection) and playing conceptual games.|$|E
50|$|The Data Cap Integrity Act, {{also called}} the <b>Data</b> <b>Measurement</b> Integrity Act, is a bill {{introduced}} in the United States Senate by Senator Ron Wyden. The bill would require Internet service providers that have bandwidth caps to only apply caps on service to reduce network congestion rather than discourage Internet use, count all data usage equally toward caps, regardless of its source or content, and use a standard method of metering data use, {{which is to be}} defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC would also be required to provide software to allow users to monitor their bandwidth usage.|$|E

50|$|In present-day {{clinical}} neurology, various brain pathologies {{may be best}} {{detected by}} looking at particular measures of anisotropy and diffusivity. The underlying physical process of diffusion causes a group of water molecules to move out from a central point, and gradually reach {{the surface of a}}n ellipsoid if the medium is anisotropic (it would be the surface of a sphere for an isotropic medium). The ellipsoid formalism functions also as a mathematical method of organizing tensor <b>data.</b> <b>Measurement</b> of an ellipsoid tensor further permits a retrospective analysis, to gather information about the process of diffusion in each voxel of the tissue.|$|E
5000|$|Measurability, “otherwise {{the scheme}} {{will not be}} operational” {{according}} to Webster. While {{this would be an}} absolute ideal, its implementation can be next to impossible in some markets. The first barrier is, it often necessitates field research, which is expensive and time-consuming. Second, it is impossible to get accurate strategic data on a large number of customers. Third, if gathered, the analysis of the data can be a daunting task. These barriers lead most companies to use more qualitative and intuitive methods in measuring customer data, and more persuasive methods while selling, hoping to compensate for the gap of accurate <b>data</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{monitoring}} small water bodies, {{the land}} might influence {{the accuracy of}} the satellite data. The spatial resolution of these measurements might result in too rough data. WISP-3 is a hand-held, autonomous and close range optical device which allows in situ water quality monitoring and assessment, allowing more precise <b>data</b> <b>measurement.</b> At the same time, these measurements can be used for satellite data validation and to obtain reflection spectra of water bodies for remote sensing objectives.For instance, WISP-3 spectro-radiometer has been used for validation of atmospheric corrected HICO images, in the project called “Using HICO data for the preparation of the incoming Italian satellite hyper-spectral mission PRISMA”. It also has been used for monitoring activities of Blue-green algae in the IJsselmeer, in the Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|Radio systems need a {{transmitter}} {{to modulate}} (change) some {{property of the}} energy produced to impress a signal on it, for example using amplitude modulation or angle modulation (which can be frequency modulation or phase modulation). Radio systems also need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves, and radio waves into an electric current. An antenna {{can be used for}} both transmitting and receiving. The electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios allow individual stations to be selected. The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna. A radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital <b>data,</b> <b>measurement</b> values, navigational positions, etc. Radio frequencies occupy the range from a 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although commercially important uses of radio use {{only a small part of}} this spectrum.|$|E
50|$|TML captures {{when and}} where a sensor {{measurement}} or transmitter actuation occurs. Its system description describes not only individual data sources but also systems of components, including the specific types of components, the logical and physical relationships between the components, and the data produced or consumed by each of the components. Information captured includes manufacturer information, model numbers of specific items, serial numbers, how two devices may {{relate to each other}} both logically and physically (for example, a GPS system may provide location information for a camera and the GPS antenna may be located a certain distance away from the camera center), and the type of data being produced from those particular devices. Time stamps for each <b>data</b> <b>measurement</b> and other identifying information is also captured, making the TML system description particularly well suited for carrying data required for automated system discovery and to support data retrieval.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} approach to making human face models is proposed. It {{is a separate}} system with the input {{in the form of}} a range of data sets and a colour image of a human face. These two sources are processed individually to derive the information necessary to automatically synthesize a lifelike facial model. The information obtained from the facial range data set includes the anatomical sites of features and the geometrical data of the face. The information extracted from the facial colour image is the boundaries of facial features and the attributes of facial textures. These two sources are integrated to produce a volumetric facial model. The range imaging system contains benefits such as having problems become avoided through contact measurement. This would be easier to keep and is much safer. Other advantages also include how it is needless to calibrate when measuring an object of similarity, and also that the machine would be appropriate for facial range <b>data</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{foundations}} {{for the development of}} a behavioral approach to linear approximate modeling, are established. A particular data set, consisting of stable, discrete-time, purely exponential time series and a specific class of dynamical models are considered. A misfit function, between the <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> and a system, belonging to this model class, is defined and the problem of characterizing all members of our model class, for which the value of the misfit function remains below a prespecified error level, is addressed. The concept of the block Hankel matrix, constructed from the <b>data</b> <b>measurements,</b> is then introduced, and it is shown that the optimal Hankel-norm approximation theory provides the main tool for a partial solution of the above problem...|$|R

50|$|Advances in {{technology}} have allowed scientists and anthropologists to utilize statistical programs {{in order to}} estimate ancestry of a skull by taking measurements of various craniometric points. CRANID is a statistical program that is used when {{the source of a}} cranium is of unknown origin. Cranial measurements are taken and entered into a worldwide craniometric database that is compared to other known cranial metrics. This information allows the user to be able to estimate ancestry in archaeological, forensic, and repatriation context. It has highest accuracy when sex is able to be determined. Dolphin Imaging Cephalometric and Tracing Software is a cephalometric analysis that can measure airway dimensions and dentofacial parameters. It has been used for studies in obstructive sleep apnea. As cephalometry become more digitized by using different programs and scanners, caution should be taken when interpreting data. Objects measured by computer assisted methods may not be an exact match of the original. Scanning and surface reconstruction can produce some <b>data</b> <b>measurement</b> uncertainty. There have been known cases of different software producing different data even when the same skull is used under the same conditions. Software packages, AMIRA and TIVMI, were used for surface reconstructions. The mean difference between measurements was lower for TIVMI. AMIRA can produce up to 4% error in known measurements and 5% in dry skull measurements. Error rates should be taken into consideration when using digitized software for this purpose.|$|E
