5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with {{air and water}} and must be <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{cover for}} Thriller {{features}} Jackson {{in a white}} suit that belonged to photographer Dick Zimmerman. The gatefold sleeve reveals a tiger cub at Jackson's leg, which Zimmerman reported the singer mostly <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from his face fearing he would be scratched. Another picture from the shoot, with Jackson embracing the cub, {{was used for the}} 2001 special edition of Thriller.|$|E
5|$|The {{solar wind}} exerts a pressure, {{and if it}} could reach Earth's {{atmosphere}} it would erode it. However, it is <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> by {{the pressure of the}} Earth's magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10Earth radii out but the other side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond 200Earth radii.|$|E

5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|Henn {{left his}} job as Headmaster at Guildford Grammar School in 1925 and {{returned}} to England. However, {{he could not be}} <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from Western Australia and returned again to become founding warden of St. Georges College, within the University of Western Australia. Henn retired permanently to Perth in 1933 and died in 1955, age 90. Henn's ashes reside in the Guildford Grammar School Chapel, with a stone slab to commemorate this situated {{on the north side of}} the sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Robinson married Millie Wiggins Bruce and {{the couple}} settled in Los Angeles. When Robinson was sick with his various ailments, his son accused Robinson's wife of keeping him under the {{influence}} of medication to manipulate him. According to Ray Robinson Jr., when Sugar Ray's mother died, Sugar Ray could not attend his mother's funeral because Millie was drugging and controlling him. However, Robinson had been hospitalized the day before his mother's death due to agitation which caused his blood pressure to rise. Robinson Jr. and Edna Mae also claimed that they were <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from Robinson by Millie during the last years of his life.|$|E

5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, the flu was <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E

5|$|After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939, on the {{outbreak}} of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public eye as a market gardener. In 1946 he used his savings to buy a sweet shop in Blackpool. Although he generally <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity, he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman {{at the end of}} the Australians' 1948 tour. He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies, though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team, including their premier fast bowler Ray Lindwall. The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help heal the hurt he had felt over his treatment by the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat {{met up with}} the Ladybird, who also had a ship's dog. However Judy had to be <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} March 1942, the Eastern Fleet {{had been}} formed, {{under the command of}} Admiral James Somerville. The fleet was centred on a pair of fleet {{aircraft}} carriers, the elderly carrier , and five battleships, four of which were Royal Sovereign and her sisters; the fifth was Warspite. The fleet also included seven cruisers and sixteen destroyers. Despite the numerical strength of the Eastern Fleet, many of its units, including the four Revenge-class battleships, were no longer front-line warships. Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's powerful Kido Butai, composed of six carriers and four fast battleships, was significantly stronger than Somerville's Eastern Fleet. As a result, only the modernised Warspite could operate with the two fleet carriers; Royal Sovereign, her three sisters, and Hermes were <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from combat to escort convoys in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Model {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} as a capable officer with great potential. Early on in his military career, Model had written a book on the Prussian general August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. In addition, he was already known to Hans von Seeckt, head of the slimmed-down Reichswehr, from his staff postings during the war, and he was equipped with an excellent reference from Major-General Franz von Rantau, commander of the 36th Reserve Division. It was thus no surprise {{that he was one of}} the 4,000 officers retained in the Reichswehr. Model generally <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from politics in the chaotic period that marked the birth of the Weimar Republic, although as an army officer he was involved in the bloody suppression of the 1920 communist uprising in the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully <b>kept</b> <b>away</b> from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E
