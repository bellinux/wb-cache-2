5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E
5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
50|$|Urine (first voided {{specimen}} with dipstick {{test for}} ketones and reducing substances) may be analyzed. In patients with glycogen-storage disease type 0, urine ketones <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> positive, and urine-reducing substance <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> negative. However, urine-reducing substance <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> positive (fructosuria) {{in those with}} fructose 1-phosphate aldolase deficiency (fructose intolerance).|$|R
5000|$|Several {{radiographic}} <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> {{suggestive of}} DES, {{such as a}} [...] "rosary bead esophagus" [...] or [...] "corkscrew" [...] appearance on barium swallow x-ray, although these <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> not unique to DES.|$|R
50|$|Audits In September 2010, Coudersport Area School District was audited by the Pennsylvania Auditor General. Several <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> cited, {{including}} {{issues about}} professional credentials. Information {{pertaining to the}} assignment in question was submitted to the Bureau of School Leadership and Teacher Quality (BSLTQ), Department of Education, for its review. The <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> confirmed and the District was fined. In a 2009 performance audit, several <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> noted.|$|R
5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, cycle detection or cycle <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> the algorithmic {{problem of}} finding a cycle in a sequence of iterated function values.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some limited}} {{research}} that, like trauma, resilience is epigenetic—that is, {{it may be}} inherited—but the science behind this <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> preliminary.|$|E
40|$|In 29 {{patients}} with urinary obstruction due to prostatic enlargement, medium-fill water cystometry was performed before prostatectomy and again 3 months after. A {{high incidence of}} detrusor hyperreflexia was observed pre-operatively, but <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> essentially normal 3 months after resection of the prostate. Possible mechanisms to explain these <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> developed. However, {{it was clear that}} the cystometric <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> not related to prostatic size...|$|R
30|$|Patients were {{filtered}} {{from our}} PACS. Pathological HSG studies were re-evaluated. Indications for referral, technical success and diagnostic <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> analysed.

25|$|Human {{bones from}} the Neolithic show a {{presence}} of the bacteria. There have also been a claim of evidence of lesions characteristic of tuberculosis in a 500,000 years old Homo erectus fossile, although this <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> controversial.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{inequality}} {{is positively}} and {{significantly related to}} rates of homicide despite an extensive list of conceptually relevant controls. The fact that this relationship is found with the most recent data and using a different measure of economic inequality from previous research, suggests that the <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> very robust.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> a false localizing sign, {{the so-called}} Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateral cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers. This leads to Ipsilateral hemiparesis {{in reference to}} the herniation and contralateral hemiparesis with reference to the cerebral crus.|$|E
30|$|These <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> {{associated}} with poor cognitive function regarding working memory, psychomotor speed, and reaction time. These <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> explained by microglial activation due to viral infection leading to neuro-inflammation and {{changes at the}} level of brain neurotransmitters [21].|$|R
50|$|In January 2010 the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted}} a performance {{audit of the}} district. <b>Findings</b> <b>were</b> reported to the administration and school board.

25|$|Ammonia {{has been}} {{detected}} in the Draco Nebula and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which {{are associated with the}} high-latitude galactic infrared cirrus. The <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk.|$|E
25|$|KCNE1 is {{expressed}} in human heart (atria and ventricles), whereas in adult mouse heart its expression appears limited to the atria and/or conduction system. KCNE1 is also expressed in human and musine inner ear and kidneys. KCNE1 has been detected in mouse brain but this <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> a subject of ongoing debate.|$|E
25|$|Chest {{radiography}} may {{demonstrate a}} change in the morphology of the thoracic aorta which can be seen in aortic dissection. Classically, new widening of the mediastinum on radiograph is of moderate sensitivity for detecting an ascending aortic dissection; however, this <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> of low specificity, as many other conditions can cause apparent widening of the mediastinum.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} may {{be missed}} in most early cases because {{the examination of}} the ear, with the exception of pain with manipulation, is nearly normal. In some early cases, the most striking visual <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> the lack of earwax. As a moderate or severe case of external otitis resolves, weeks may be required before the ear canal again shows a normal amount of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{sound barrier}} {{may have been}} first {{breached}} by living beings some 150 million years ago. Some paleobiologists report that, based on computer models of their biomechanical capabilities, certain long-tailed dinosaurs such as Apatosaurus and Diplodocus may have possessed the ability to flick their tails at supersonic speeds, possibly used to generate an intimidating booming sound. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> theoretical and disputed by others in the field.|$|E
25|$|Antipsychotic {{medication}} {{have been}} shown to increase PPI in patients, with atypical antipsychotics having more effect. Patients display the same gender difference in PPI as healthy people: males have higher PPI compared to females. One notable <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> that patients are specifically deficient in PPI with 60 ms prepulse intervals relative to intervals of other lengths; this remains so even under antipsychotic treatment.|$|E

25|$|External {{physical}} shocks or constrainment due {{to growth}} in a restricted space, {{may result in}} unintended deformation or separation of cellular structures resulting in an abnormal final shape or damaged structures unable to function as expected. An example is Potter syndrome due to oligohydramnios. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> important for future understandings of how genetics may predispose individuals for diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cancer.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} symptoms of Norrie disease are ocular. The first visible <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> leukocoria, a grayish-yellow pupillary reflex that originates from {{a mass of}} unorganized tissue behind the lens. This material, which possibly includes an already detached retina, may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed pseudoglioma. However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and inconspicuous iris, anterior chamber, cornea and intraocular pressure.|$|E
25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find {{significant}} effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think {{that this can be}} because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E
