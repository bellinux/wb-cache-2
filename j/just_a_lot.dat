500|$|Fritz the Cat {{is set in}} a [...] "modern 'supercity' of {{millions}} of animals." [...] Stories begin simply and become increasingly chaotic and complex as the narrative responds to uncontrollable forces. The look of Fritz the Cat comics was characterized by the use of the Rapidograph technical pen and a simple drawing style Robert Crumb used to facilitate his story telling. Crumb states that much of the comic books he enjoyed as a child were funny animal comics, particularly those of Carl Barks. Crumb was later influenced by Walt Kelly's daily anthropomorphic funny animal comic strip Pogo; Crumb did not copy Kelly's comics directly, but states that he imitated his drawing style closely; Crumb admired Kelly's storytelling style, which [...] "seemed [...] plotless and casually done. The characters talked to each other and nothing much happened. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of foolishness takes place". Robert Crumb stated of his anthropomorphic work: ...|$|E
500|$|Production {{began in}} 1972. However, Steve Krantz {{had not yet}} paid Bakshi {{for his work on}} Fritz the Cat. Halfway through the {{production}} of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked Krantz outright when he would be paid, and Krantz responded that [...] "The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of noise." [...] Bakshi found Krantz's claims to be dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Because Bakshi did not have a lawyer, he sought advice from directors he had become friends with, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg, asking them how much they made on their films. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. Bakshi began pitching his next project, Harlem Nights, a film loosely based on the Uncle Remus story books. The idea interested producer Albert S. Ruddy during a screening of The Godfather.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic}} {{than the general}} consensus. Although The New Republic Sacha Zimmerman stated that the episode's aesthetic features were comparable to cinematic works, she affirmed that Mad Men lacked any substance, ultimately criticizing the cultural references and the character development presented in the episode. Mad Men seems to be attempting satire without a plan," [...] Zimmerman said. [...] "The mood is serious, not campy, and there aren't laugh-out-loud moments, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of groaners—at which point, the show simply becomes a reflection of its characters: depressing. It turns out that watching moody, cruel men and unsatisfied, put-upon women for an hour just isn't that much fun." [...] Similarly, Tim Shale of The Washington Post concluded that despite the evocative nature of the program, [...] "Smokes Gets in Your Eyes" [...] fell flat; [...] "The people in and around them spoil the show, gum up the works and shatter veracity." [...] To New York John Leonard, the installment felt like a [...] "fifties leftover".|$|E

500|$|The second sequel, Species III {{followed}} in 2004. It premiered on Sci-Fi Channel on November 27, 2004 with a DVD release on December 7.

Sara, an alien-human hybrid, seeks other hybrids to mate with. Henstridge cameos {{at the beginning of}} the film. Two out of six critics mentioned on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a positive rating, with DVD Talk's reviewer noting that it is [...] "a more cohesive and sensible flick than [...] is, but ultimately, it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the same old schtick", while Film Freak Central called it [...] "amateurish" [...] and [...] "vapid". A fourth film, Species: The Awakening was filmed in 2007, following the schedule of Species III of Sci-Fi Channel premiere and subsequent DVD release. None of the actors from the original film returned in this sequel, which instead starred Helena Mattsson as the alien-hybrid seductress.|$|E

In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot.

500|$|Jamie King {{was chosen}} as tour {{director}}. Tim Miller and Kevin Antunes served as director of production and musical director, respectively. Mark Foffano {{was chosen as}} the lightning director. Spears described the tour as [...] "like a Broadway show". The setlist included material from her first studio album ...Baby One More Time (1999) as well as seven songs from Oops!... I Did It Again. Spears explained, [...] "I've been singing the same material for so long now. It'll be nice to change it up a little bit."

The proscenium stage was much more elaborate than the stage of her previous tour and included video screens, movable platforms and different props. It cost $2.2 million to build. The tone of the show variated from the beginning: for the performance of [...] "Born to Make You Happy", Spears sang in a set resembling a children's bedroom, complete with large toys and a pillow fight routine. On the contrary, she unveiled a more sophisticated image for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", and followed it with raunchy performances for [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Oops!...

500|$|By {{the time}} Fritz the Cat was released, Bakshi {{had become a}} celebrity, but his {{reputation}} was primarily based upon his having directed the first [...] "dirty" [...] animated film. Facing criticism of his work on publicity tours and in trade publications, he began writing poetry to express his emotions. This became a tradition, and Bakshi wrote poems before beginning production on each of his films. The first of these poems was [...] "Street Arabs", which preceded the production of Heavy Traffic in 1972. Inspiration for the film came from penny arcades, where Bakshi often played pinball, sometimes accompanied by his 12-year-old son, Mark. Bakshi pitched Heavy Traffic to Samuel Z. Arkoff, who expressed interest in his take on the [...] "tortured underground cartoonist" [...] and agreed to back the film. Krantz had not compensated Bakshi {{for his work on}} Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, [...] "The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of noise." [...] Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills.

500|$|Some reviewers {{said that}} the second act of the game, {{taking place in the}} less-structured portion of the old Aperture facilities, may be {{confusing}} to some players. Young wrote that in the second act, the game [...] "cranks up the difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers", and said that particularly when traveling between chambers, he had [...] "absolutely no idea where I was supposed to head next". [...] Kohler wrote that while the player can explore the abandoned areas of Aperture, [...] "none of it ever does anythingit's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of sterile, duplicated, non-interactive environments". Watters wrote that the loading time between the game's levels, in contrast to earlier Valve games, are [...] "long enough to make you take notice and wish they were shorter". Watters also said that it was unfortunate that the game lacks [...] "stand-alone test chambers and leaderboards...but even so, Portal 2 is not light on content" [...] without these. Welsh {{said that the}} attempt to recapture the spirit of the song [...] "Still Alive" [...] at the end credits of Portal 2 [...] "was a mistake". Video game critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw named it the best game of 2011 in his review show Zero Punctuation. However he wrote in his Extra Punctuation column that, while Portal 2 was a [...] "very good game", it unnecessarily retconned portions of the origin game's story, and did not really further the game's concept. However, this criticism was directed solely at the campaign, and he stated that he found the game's co-op to be [...] "much more appealing and much more within the spirit of the original".|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
