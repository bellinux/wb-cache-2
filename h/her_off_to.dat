Bohemond was killed in a battle at the Ceyhan River in February 1130. After his death, Alice assumed the regency for Constance. According to rumors spreading in Antioch, Alice was planning to send Constance to a monastery or to marry <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a commoner. Bohemond's cousin, Roger II of Sicily, regarded himself as Bohemond's lawful successor because he was the senior member of the House of Hauteville.|$|E
5|$|Danielle later {{breaks down}} and tells Ronnie {{that she is}} {{pregnant}} by Paul, a barman she had a one-night stand with. She intended {{to tell him about}} her pregnancy until he reveals he has a girlfriend. Ronnie comforts Danielle and contacts Andy, suggesting that he take Danielle home but she resists in favour of staying close to Ronnie. She is dismayed when Ronnie confides in her that having her own child was the biggest mistake of her life. Danielle makes up with Stacey and decides to terminate her pregnancy. She is delighted when Ronnie accompanies her to the clinic but dismayed when she backs out of attending her second appointment. Following her abortion, Danielle visits her family for a while, but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford. Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her. She decides that she will tell Ronnie who she really is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is. Unknown to Danielle, Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter died as an infant, so in order to preserve his story, he convinces Danielle that Ronnie suffers from depression and she should keep quiet until he decides the time is right to make her revelation. Although Danielle continues to press Archie to reveal the truth, he repeatedly puts <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> maintain his lie. Eventually, believing that Archie has told Ronnie about her, Danielle tells her the truth but Ronnie refuses to believe her. Distraught, Danielle intends to leave Walford but Ronnie discovers that Archie has been lying and chases her. They are about to reconcile when Danielle is accidentally run over by a car driven by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Ronnie cradles Danielle and apologises for not believing her, saying that if she had known, she would never have given her up. Danielle passes away in Ronnie's arms as Roxy, Stacey and Janine watch on helpless, leaving Ronnie devastated. Danielle is buried and a grief-stricken Ronnie sings by her grave when alone.|$|E

25|$|In Greek mythology, {{the other}} gods feared that Aphrodite's beauty {{might lead to}} {{conflict}} and war, through rivalry for her favours; so Zeus married <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Hephaestus.

She {{played a role in}} the Eros and Psyche legend, and was both lover and surrogate mother of Adonis.|$|E
25|$|On 5 September 1975, a bomb {{exploded}} in the delicatessen, destroying it and the adjacent wine bar which was crowded with customers. The makers of the show made a bold move, killing several long running cast favourites, including Les, and Aldo and Roma Godolfus (Johnny Lockwood and Philippa Baker), and then revealing schemer Maggie Cameron as the bomber and sending <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> prison (she never planned for the bomb to kill anyone and merely wanted to scare residents into moving to facilitate a sale of the building). However, despite the publicity and major changes it brought, the bomb-blast storyline resulted in only a temporary boost to the program's ratings figures.|$|E
25|$|Bree was {{released}} from her psychiatric hospital and returned to Ferndale after Brooke's husband Boyd (Sam Bunkall) plead to her to donate a kidney to a sick Brooke. It soon turned out Bree {{had no intention of}} donating and blackmailed Boyd for thousands of dollars in exchange for the operation. Nonetheless, Bree bailed and Brooke paid <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> leave Ferndale. Bree returned claiming she had suffered another psychotic episode, though it was soon clear she had in fact murdered Travis Corfield (John Tui) and had returned to steal his money. Bree eventually confessed this to Brooke and tried to escape, only for her own sister to hand her into the police.|$|E

25|$|Yang Yi Ru is a {{workaholic}} {{who never had}} {{time to take a}} break. Her family and friends decided to pull a prank on her to slow her down.

She spent her first day on a sunny beach lamenting to a stranger that she wished she had the time to meet Mr. Right, get married and have kids. Unbeknownst to her, the stranger was a man from her past who was in love with her when they met years ago.

25|$|The notable {{example to}} this is the Hanafi school (the largest of the four {{classical}} schools of Islamic thought), which holds that a bride's permission is required if she has reached puberty. They also hold that if a bride was forced into marriage before reaching puberty; then upon attaining puberty, she has the option to nullify the marriage if she wishes. A wali other than the father or the paternal grandfather of the bride, then called wali mukhtar, needs {{the consent of the}} bride according to the majority of scholars. If the bride is silent about the issue, i.e. her wali expressed his intention to marry <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a certain man, and she did not object to it; then consent is assumed via her lack of objection.|$|E

The family later moved to Hudson. In 1878, he began school at Saint Mary's, but this was cut short in October 1882 when the family relocated again, to Burkhardt in Saint Croix County. In 1887, he left the farm {{for a series of}} jobs in his home state and in Minnesota, working as a lumberjack, a hospital orderly, a guard in the Minnesota state prison, and a street car operator in Superior. His time as a prison guard saw him befriend a couple of Jesse James' cohorts. At first, he desired married life, but the mother of a girl he had proposed to suddenly sent <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a boarding school.|$|E

25|$|Cecilia Gallerani was {{a member}} of a large family that was neither wealthy nor noble. Her father served for a time at the Duke's court. At the time her {{portrait}} was painted, she was about 16 years old and was renowned for her beauty, her scholarship, and her poetry. She was married at approximately age six to a young nobleman of the house of Visconti, but she sued to annul the marriage in 1487 for undisclosed reasons and the request was granted. Cecilia became the mistress of the Duke and bore him a son, even after his marriage to another woman 11 years previously, Beatrice d'Este. Beatrice was promised to the Duke when she was only 5, and married him when she was 16 in 1491. After a few months, she discovered the Duke was still seeing Cecilla, and forced the Duke to break off their relationship by marrying <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a local count named Bergamino.|$|E
25|$|In the German tale , Guinevere's brother Gotegrim kidnaps her and {{intends to}} kill her for refusing to marry Gasozein, who claims to be her {{rightful}} husband. In Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's , Valerin, King of the Tangled Wood, claims the right to marry her and carries <b>her</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> his castle in a struggle for power that reminds scholars of her prescient connections to the fertility and sovereignty of Britain. Arthur's company saves her, but Valerin kidnaps her again and places her in a magical sleep inside another castle surrounded by snakes, where only the powerful sorcerer Malduc can rescue her. All of these similar tales of abduction by another suitor – and this allegory includes Lancelot, who whisks her away when she is condemned to burn at the stake for their adultery – are demonstrative of a recurring Hades-snatches-Persephone theme, positing that Guinevere {{is similar to the}} Otherworld bride Étaín, who Midir, king of the Underworld, carries off from her earthly life after she has forgotten her past.|$|E

Victoria persuades Olivia's servant to disguise himself as her rich uncle, the original owner of the land that Laura now holds. He convinces Laura that the titles are worthless, so in a rage she rips them up. Victoria reveals herself to Don Carlos, who repents and pledges himself to her again.
