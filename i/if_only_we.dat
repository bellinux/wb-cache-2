25|$|On Market Fundamentalism:Even a {{call for}} {{discussing}} this amounts to demanding ‘obsolete’ practices of the interventionist state. If we hadn’t mucked around {{trying to get the}} state to play God for 50 years, {{none of this would have}} happened. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> had got it right and let the market play God instead.Based on the premise that the market is the solution to all the problems of the human race, it is, too, a very religious fundamentalism. It has its own Gospel: The Gospel of St. Growth, of St. Choice...Welcome to the world of Market Fundamentalism. To the Final Solution.|$|E

"Let us at {{the same}} time reflect, seeing that Providence rescues from its perils the world itself, which is no less mortal than we ourselves, that to some extent our petty bodies can be made to tarry longer upon earth by our own providence, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> acquire the ability to control and check those pleasures whereby the greater portion of mankind perishes. Plato himself, by taking pains, {{advanced}} to old age. To be sure, he was the fortunate possessor of a strong and sound body (his very name was given him because of his broad chest); but his strength was much impaired by sea voyages and desperate adventures. Nevertheless, by frugal living, by setting a limit upon all that rouses the appetites, and by painstaking attention to himself, he reached that advanced age in spite of many hindrances." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1957 {{a defense}} of some women's choice to wear pants was {{published}} under the title, [...] "Transvestism—A Cross-Cultural Survey". The November issue {{of the same year}} reprinted editorial sections from The San Francisco Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle that begged women not to wear pants: [...] "When ladies young and old wear sloppy slacks or tight pants on Market St. I wish I had a water pistol and could give each one of them a good squirt. Ladies, please be ladies." [...] However, in the same issue, an essay encouraged women to broaden their definition of femininity: [...] "Of course we can (accept our femininity) <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> enlarge our view to include all women: the gentle, the shy the brave, the meek, the enterprising, the flamboyant..." [...] The issue of pants was brought up again in 1959 with the reprint of a UPI story stating the women in pants was to become fashionable that year, and again when Gene Damon wrote an overview of women who had lived as men throughout Western history.|$|E
