5|$|The butcher Allen of Mayfair {{was founded}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shop</b> on Mount Street in 1830.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} an {{adaptation}} of <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area to socio-environmental changes using the concept of 'dynamic maintenance'. Different from an orthodox concept of maintenance, 'dynamic maintenance', which was proposed by N. Saito in 2003, refers to relations among structures, functions and changes of a system and can be applicable to social phenomena. Based on Saito(2009), we derived the next two point. First, if <b>shops</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area turnover time and again, {{it does not necessarily}} mean loss of identity of <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area. Second, because a process of 'dynamic maintenance' involves positive action for environments, <b>shops</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area eventually create their environment by themselves. Further we argue that cooperation among actors <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area is <b>a</b> fundamental condition for sustainability of <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area. On the ground of these theoretical discussions, we tried to empirically elucidate causality among cooperation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> are, commitments to <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area, and ties among shops. Using 'analysis of covariance structure', we tentatively concluded that 'cooperation' was generated from 'commitments' and 'ties' <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> area. 本稿では、斉藤(2009) のダイナミック・メンテナンスをめぐる議論を前提に、構造、機能および変動の問題を同時に考察する枠組みを商店街を例にとって考察した。まず最初に、商店街の同一性の問題をダイナミック・メンテナンスの視点から理論的に検討し、構成要素の頻繁な入れ替わりがあったとしても、同一のシステムとして存在しうることを議論した。また、社会システムの環境適応にプロセスについては、既存のメンテナンス概念ではとらえきれないことを手短かに整理し、環境受動的ばかりでなく、第 4 の特長としての”環境創造”の過程が存在しることを指摘した。これらの理論的検討を通じて、商店街のダイナミック・メンテナンスにおいては、協力性の存在がもっとも重要な条件であることを示した。最後に、これらの理論的検討を受ける形で、協力性が実際に商店街においてどのように形成され、またそれが愛着、つきあいなどの諸変数を規定するかに関して、共分散構造分析を用いて検討した。その結果、協力性は愛着、つながり、創業から年数によって促進されることがあきらかになった...|$|R

5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shop.</b> Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E

5|$|Pieces of {{the rope}} which was used to hang Corder sold for a guinea each. Part of Corder's scalp with an ear still {{attached}} was displayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shop</b> in Oxford Street. A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Smith Collyer {{was born}} on May 3, 1832 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. After his schooling, {{he took a job}} at the Pawtucket Post Office as a clerk and later was a store clerk <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shop.</b> He became a {{machinist}} and worked for a period of about seven years before becoming a partner in his uncle, Nathan S. Collyer. When Nathan Collyer died in 1877, the business passed to his wife and then to Samuel Collyer upon her death in 1879. Collyer would maintain control of the business until his death and he would serve on the board of water commissioners in charge of the development of the Pawtucket Water Works. He also played an active role in local administration {{as a member of the}} Town Council of North Providence, serving as its president for a period of three years. From 1848 to his death, Collyer was connected to the fire departments of North Providence and Pawtucket, rising to the rank of Chief Engineer in 1874. In 1851, he married Ellen Whipple and they would later have one daughter, Mary Collyer.|$|E

After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a key that hung around Reign's neck and used it to open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and push it off the stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shop</b> {{window in the}} third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges were placed on the glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London.

Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{records for}} Gardner Carpenter's life are sparse in detail, but the Vital records of Norwich, 1659-1848 Part II provide some information. Gardner Carpenter married Mary Huntington, {{daughter}} of Benjamin Huntington Jr., on October 29, 1791. Carpenter {{was a local}} business man who operated his mercantile business <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shop</b> that was shared with his brother, Joseph Carpenter, the silversmith. The Carpenters' shared shop is historically significant and {{is known as the}} Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop. A 1906 paper titled Norwich: early homes and history identified Gardner Carpenter as the builder of the store and noted that Gardner Carpenter {{was one of the first}} traders of Norwich. In 1793, the house which is now known as the Carpenter House was constructed on the property after a previous house on the land was removed. Gardner and Mary Carpenter would have six children together; their first son, George, was born in 1795 and their first and only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, in 1797. Another son, Gardner Carpenter, was born in 1802 and was followed by Henry in 1804, John in 1807 and Charles in 1810. Gardiner Carpenter served as a pay master in the 17th Connecticut Regiment in the American Revolutionary War and he was the postmaster of Norwich from 1799 to 1814, shortly before his death in 1815. His wife, Mary Carpenter, died in 1838. The house was sold to Joseph Huntington after Carpenter's death, who would add a third story around 1816. The house was sold again to Reverend Hiram P. Arms in 1841.|$|E
