25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we refuse to accept the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, but we <b>know</b> <b>too,</b> that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go, and we shall exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone, which will give to our country some confidence of being able to hold out until the tide of battle swings against the enemy.|$|E

The Chemical Brothers refer to [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] as their [...] "manifesto"; their 1996 track [...] "Setting Sun" [...] is a direct tribute to it.

500|$|Baconnaise {{has been}} {{featured}} on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart several {{times as a}} repeat joke. In 2009, Jon Stewart used it in a skit that drew negative attention from Seattle Post-Intelligencers Leslie Kelly. Stewart commented, [...] "Baconnaise, {{for people who want}} to get heart disease but, you <b>know,</b> <b>too</b> lazy to actually make bacon." [...] In 2010, Jon Stewart again lampooned Baconnaise with a fake clip of the billboard in Times Square that drew a response from J's Foods. According to J's Foods, a plan to run an actual billboard ad was made, but it was declined by Comedy Central. Using it as a prop in a later episode, Stewart referred to Baconnaise as [...] "capitalism's greatest triumph".|$|E

500|$|There was {{considerable}} controversy surrounding Darwin's prediction that a moth {{would be found}} in Madagascar with a long proboscis matching the nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale. An anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review of October 1862 by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, argued that Darwin's wording implied purpose, and concluded that [...] "We <b>know,</b> <b>too,</b> that these purposes and ideas are not our own, but the ideas and purposes of Another." [...] He considered Darwin's explanations the [...] "most unsatisfactory conjectures", and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative evolutionism. Emma Darwin thought that although Argyll was [...] "quite opposed" [...] to Darwin's views, [...] "he praises the Orchids in such an enthusiastic way that he will do it a good turn". Darwin was delighted to find that a well written article [...] "smashing" [...] Argyll's review was by one of Darwin's own nephews.|$|E
500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi {{likened the}} {{development}} of Chrono Trigger to [...] "play around with Toriyama's universe," [...] citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game {{that would have been}} [...] "impossible with something like Final Fantasy." [...] When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches. The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. The game's testers had previously complained that Chrono Trigger was too difficult; as Horii explained, [...] "It's because we <b>know</b> <b>too</b> much. The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily." [...] Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or [...] "travel through time again" [...] as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: [...] "Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details... I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest." [...] The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Bradley Artson, Dean of the Rabbinic School at American Jewish University, {{claims to}} have studied every {{reference}} he could find to homosexual activity mentioned in ancient Greek and Latin writers. Every citation he found described an encounter between males where one party, the master, physically abused another, the slave. Rabbi Artson {{could not find a}} single example where one partner was not subservient to the other. [...] "Homosexual relationships today," [...] Rabbi Artson says, [...] "should not be compared to the ancient world. I <b>know</b> <b>too</b> many homosexual individuals, including close friends and relatives, who are committed to one another in loving long-term monogamous relationships. I <b>know</b> <b>too</b> many same-sex couples that are loving parents raising good descent [...] ethical children.

2500|$|Like their Neolithic predecessors, the Shang used spindle-wheels to make textiles, but the Shang {{labour force}} was more {{formally}} organised. By Shang times, controlled workers produced silk in workshops for the aristocracy. Fields and workshops were manned by labour of {{varying degrees of}} servitude.

[...] Donovan said that he had two suicide pills, but then discovered he didn't. [...] "I must shoot first," [...] Donovan said. Bruce replied, [...] "Yes, sir, but can we do much against machine guns with our pistols?" [...] Donovan explained: [...] "Oh, you don't understand. I mean, if we are about to be captured, I'll shoot you first. After all, I am your commanding officer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Intersope Records {{signed the}} Pussycat Dolls, a sextet spun {{off from the}} burlesque group which was created by Robin Antin. After Universal Records dropped Almaze, the label was still very much {{interested}} in [...] "Don’t Cha". Doug Morris—then chairman of Universal Music Group—suggested that [...] "Don't Cha" [...] {{should be given to}} the Pussycat Dolls as the label was trying to reinvent the girl group. Initially Green was skeptical saying, [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>too</b> much about them , but when I found out that [...] Interscope Records was involved, that was an alliance I didn't hesitate to make." [...] The Pussycat Dolls version was recorded around March adding two verses from rapper Busta Rhymes. Lead singer Nicole Scherzinger admitted that two records sounded identical. [...] "I had [...] version as a guide. But ours is just a bit fresher." [...] This song was initially offered to both Sugababes and Paris Hilton, but both declined. In 2006, Hilton claimed that she was presented with the track, but was not impressed with it, commenting. [...] "I think I did hear the song, but not in the format that we all came to know and love.
