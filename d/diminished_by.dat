However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama).

5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective gravity is <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> the centrifugal force.

The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E

It is possible that this attack led to the village's decline in the years that followed.

5|$|Dating back to 1910, {{the route}} US6 follows was {{originally}} the Great White Way and River-to-River Road. Both were auto trails which connected Council Bluffs and Davenport. When the U.S. Highway System {{was created in}} 1926, the highway was designated U.S. Highway 32. US 32 was renumbered in 1931 as US6 was extended to the west coast. As the Interstate Highway System expanded in the 1950-1970s, US6's importance as a cross-state route was <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> I-80.

5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Heart of Darkness in 1998, Chahi left the video games industry to explore other interests, and subsequently developed a passion for volcanology. In the past, Chahi self-produced video games, as the PC market was independent games-orientated. However, the independent game's importance <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> 2006, so Chahi decided {{to work with a}} publisher instead. He presented the concept to Ubisoft in 2006. According to Chahi, it was not difficult to convince Ubisoft to fund the project, though initially there was hesitation and the proposal was rejected. After the company reversed its decision, the team spent approximately two years meeting with the key people within Ubisoft; development properly began in January 2008. The team initially only had three people, but it was expanded to about 15 to 20 people, which was considered a small team for Ubisoft.|$|E

On 8 July Vendôme led his troops before Castellfollit.

After that, the French army took the way to Hostalric and demolished its defenses, returning to Girona on 28 July.|$|E

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E

5|$|After {{turning back}} to the northwest, the {{convection}} around Linfa became even more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection <b>diminished.</b> <b>By</b> late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E

5|$|Bede was a Northumbrian, {{and this}} tinged {{his work with}} a local bias. The sources {{to which he had}} access gave him less {{information}} about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian Robin Fleming states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more men for {{the war and the}} hoarding of scarce grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 on, rural revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy <b>diminished</b> <b>by</b> military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize the gravity of the situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E

In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups.
