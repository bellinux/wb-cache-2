40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to investigate to what extent business cycles co-move in Germany, France and Italy. We use a large-scale database of non-stationary series for the euro area {{in order to assess}} the effect of common versus idiosyncratic shocks, as well as transitory versus permanent shocks, across countries over the 1980 :Q 1 to 2003 :Q 4 period. We apply the method-ology proposed by Bai (2004) and Bai and Ng (2004) to construct a coincident indicator of the euro area business cycle to which national developments appear to be increasingly correlated at business cycle frequencies (8 to 32 quarters), while more significant différences appear at lower frequencies which measures potential growth. The indicator is also shown to be related to <b>extra</b> <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> economic developments. Factor models; Non-stationary panel data models; Euro area business cycles. ...|$|E

This paper examines the geographical pattern of this great rebalancing. Specifically, we test whether <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> and non-euro area investors adjusted their holdings of debt securities of <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> stressed and non-stressed countries dis-proportionately relative to benchmarks derived from a standard gravity model for portfolio choice. We find that non-euro area investors under-invested in stressed <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> countries, but did not over-invest in non-stressed <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> countries. As regards intra-euro area flows, we do not find evidence for a disproportionate slowdown of capital flows from non-stressed into stressed <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> countries. Instead, our results suggest that investors in stressed <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> countries disproportionately shifted capital into debt securities of non-stressed <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> countries.

According to a simple benchmark from standard portfolio theory, <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> investors - in particular those from <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> low-rating economies - are overexposed to <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> securities. Instead, investors outside the EU are underexposed to <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> securities in their total portfolio, proportionally to their degree of home bias, but not in their foreign portfolio. Nevertheless, once we account for gravity factors, the largest foreign investors overweigh <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> securities, especially debt of <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> high rating economies. Crucially, this overexposure was resilient to the <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> crisis. Moreover, we show that institutions at home are important to explain exposure to <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> securities.

Oil price is determined according to supply and demand conditions in the world oil market. We get the following results. First, the impact of an increase in the price of oil depends upon the underlying source of variation. When the driver of higher oil prices is the increase in the aggregate demand in the trade partners of the <b>euro</b> <b>area,</b> both <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> GDP and CPI inflation increase. To the opposite, negative oil supply shocks and positive worldwide oil-specific demand shocks have stagflationary effects on the <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> economy. Second, a positive aggregate demand shock in <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> trade partners tends to generate a trade balance surplus and an oil trade deficit in the <b>euro</b> <b>area.</b> To the opposite, unanticipated increases in the oil-demand specific and unanticipated oil supply disruptions cause a trade balance deficit in the <b>euro</b> <b>area.</b> Third, oil price shocks have a large and immediate effect on the fuel component of <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> CPI and muted impact on the non-fuel component of <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> CPI and <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> GDP.

40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to explain}} the long-run {{determinants}} of <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> FDI to the United States during the period 1980 - 2001. The theoretical model developed in this paper incorporates the traditional FDI model based on the OLI-framework into the Tobin’s Q-model of investment. The model is estimated using the fixed effects panel estimator, with the <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> proxied by a panel involving most of the <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> countries. In accordance to the theoretical model, the investment climate in the <b>euro</b> <b>area,</b> as reflected in Tobin’s Q – including a measure adjusted for economic developments common to both the United States and the euro area- is found to influence <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> FDI to the United States. Moreover, {{the inclusion of the}} Tobin’s Q seems to enhance the traditional OLI framework specification by adding further explanatory power to the FDI equation. Overall, the empirical findings suggest that <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> patents (ownership advantage), various variables related to productivity in the United States (location advantage), the volume of bilateral telephone traffic to the United States relative to <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> GDP (location advantage), Tobin’s Q and the real exchange rate (capital gains) are statistically significant determinants of <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> FDI to the United States...|$|R

In particular, the evidence indicates that both the magnitude and the sign of the real-time estimates of the <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> output gap are very uncertain.
