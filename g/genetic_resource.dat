Many of the drugs in use today were originally uncovered in microbes; recent progress in mining the rich <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products. The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized.|$|E

The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991.

5|$|The Global Crop Diversity Trust is an {{independent}} international organisation which exists to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture Research Centers (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve germplasm from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest off site collections of plant genetic resources in trust for the world community. It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and agroforestry species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National germplasm storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resource</b> Centers.|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> in agriculture {{is an important}} aspect of biodiversity conservation. Knowledge of the value of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> can contribute to determining the appropriate focus and extent of conservation. This study reviewed and summarised literature on the economic value of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> using meta-analysis. Altogether, 22 studies were used to describe current knowledge on the value of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> Furthermore, 14 studies with 93 value observations were examined with a meta-regression model to identify variables that explain the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for or willingness-to-accept (WTA) loss of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> Grain <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> were ascribed lower value compared to animal <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> (AnGR) and agrobiodiversity, and the values of breeds or varieties and conservation programmes were higher than the value of individual attributes. Future research should address the gaps in knowledge that are relevant for policy-making. This particularly includes improving knowledge on the value of plant <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> (PGR), obtaining value estimates for maintaining genetic diversity in Europe and the United States, estimating the relative magnitude of use and non-use values and determining the value consumers place on <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and diversity in agriculture.

40|$|Abstract: Turkey is an {{important}} center for plant <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>genetic</b> diversity. In Turkey, the Black Sea Region is very rich in vegetable <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> due to its diverse geographical, climatic and ecological conditions. Conservation and maintenance of these valuable <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> is essential. In {{order to protect the}} highly threatened vegetable <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> in this region, it was very important to set up a collection, conservation, utilization and research system. The aim of this review was to outline some of the vegetable <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> of the Black Sea region; their distribution, their collection and characterization; and to describe cultivar breeding programmes from 1994 to 2009 and beyond. This overview will give the agricultural scientist an insight to into the large degree of genetic diversity in Turkey, and provide information about the distribution and potential utilization of these irreplaceable <b>genetic</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|R
