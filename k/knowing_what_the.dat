25|$|The {{selection}} of which pitch to use {{can depend on}} a wide variety of situations such as; the type of hitter that is being faced, whether there are any base runners, how many outs have been made in the inning, or the current score, among others. The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch was traditionally made by the catcher. However, current form is to have the manager or a coach relay the pitch selection to the catcher, via secret hand signals to prevent the opposing team from having the advantage of <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> next pitch will be.|$|E

This causes him to scream in agony, before he emerges outside of the Vault from dark energy, as the newest Dark One. Like Emma, he is greeted by a manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, who offers Hook a chance to seek revenge on the living Rumplestiltskin, but Hook is reluctant to take up the challenge, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> manifestation is, and not wanting to give in to the darkness.|$|E
25|$|Organisms need to {{replicate}} their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage {{is one of}} the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. Diploid individuals can repair a damaged section of their DNA via homologous recombination, since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged. A mutation in a haploid individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become resident, as the DNA repair machinery has no way of <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> original undamaged sequence was. The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.|$|E

Yasuda {{has said that}} she applied not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> job entailed but that she had submitted her application {{because she did not}} fancy employment in any of the other jobs available for most women at the time, such as bank teller or store clerk. Instead she took the opportunity to work in a creative field. She started out in the Toei finishing department, in the ink and paint section, where she worked on TV series and commercials as a tracer. In traditional animation a tracer is a person whose job involves transferring cleaned up line drawings onto the cels. Through her work and union activities at the company she made the acquaintance of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki whose careers also began at Toei, joining in 1959 and 1963 respectively.|$|E

Of Wolfgang he quoted a Prince of Brunswick as saying that many Kapellmeisters at the peak of their art would die without <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> boy knew at the age of nine.

His staff put in long hours, and University of California administrators sliced through red tape despite not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> project was about. Government officials began to view the development of atomic bombs in time to affect the outcome of the war as a genuine possibility. Vannevar Bush, the director of the OSRD, which was overseeing the project, visited Berkeley in February 1942, and found the atmosphere there [...] "stimulating" [...] and [...] "refreshing". On 9 March 1942, he reported to the president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, that {{it might be possible to}} produce enough material for a bomb by mid-1943, based on new estimates from Robert Oppenheimer that the critical mass of a sphere of pure uranium-235 was between 2.0 and 2.5 kilograms.|$|E

500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.|$|E
500|$|The mental {{element is}} taken to be either an {{intention}} to kill, or an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm is [...] "really serious" [...] harm. The extension of the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm has been criticised, although it has remained in place despite several legal challenges, and, {{in the case of}} [...] the minority judgments of Lord Diplock and Lord Kilbrandon which would have removed it. The judges there made reference to the abolition under the Homicide Act 1957 of constructive malice (causing death whilst committing a felony or resisting arrest), believing the rule for grievous bodily harm to be a hang-over of the old system. It can now be concluded that only legislative intervention could abolish this form of murder, and, although the Law Commission proposed a change in the law, none has yet been enacted. The current law was judged to be compatible with Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to Northern Ireland. It can also be defended with reference to the actor taking responsibility for his actions, even unforeseen consequences, or merely as an appropriate response in itself. Intent is subjective: that the defendant must surely have intended their actions because a reasonable person would, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> defendant knew, have foreseen death as a result, is insufficient. This seemed to have been allowed as a form of intent in DPP v Smith, but that case has been considered overturned following legislative changes, and more recent cases leave no room for doubt on this issue.|$|E
500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} {{that can be achieved}} by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to understanding them as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that got him into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct was the nature of [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] " [...] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E
