5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic Ocean {{from the}} west coast of Africa on September10. Tracking westward, the wave split into two portions, with the slower-moving northern portion ultimately developing into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine on September16. The southern portion crossed Venezuela and Colombia and <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific, where a large area of deep convection began to form. A well-defined low pressure area developed on September26, and organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1p.m.CDT) the same day while situated about 335mi (540km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero. Six hours later, after banding features became more defined and intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique showed a slight increase in intensity, the depression was classified as a tropical storm and was accordingly named Marty by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). At the time, the storm was moving slowly northward due to the influence of a large mid- to upper-level trough.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{weakening}} {{occurred as}} Dot neared Hainan Island on June9. The typhoon subsequently made landfall near Sanya on June10 and weakened to a tropical storm. Later that day, the storm <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Gulf of Tonkin before making its {{third and final}} landfall near Hai Phong, Vietnam. Once onshore, Dot quickly degraded over the mountainous terrain of northern Vietnam, and was last noted on June12.|$|E

5|$|Weakening as {{it crossed}} the peninsula, Dean <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Bay of Campeche and re-strengthened {{before making a}} second {{landfall}} in Veracruz. Although the second landfall did not bring winds as intense as the first, it brought more rainfall and caused devastating landslides in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Between the two landfalls, Dean caused MXN$2billion (US$184million; 2007dollars) of damage and killed 13people.|$|E
5|$|When {{the storm}} tracked across Nova Scotia {{and into the}} Northumberland Strait, {{it was still a}} Category1 hurricane, {{weakening}} to a tropical storm as it <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Wind gusts of 86mph (139km/h) were reported in Charlottetown and 67mph (107km/h) in the Iles de la Madeleine in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic Ocean {{from the}} west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving {{in the same direction as}} the upper-level winds.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic Ocean off {{the west}} coast of Africa during the last week of July. As it tracked across the Atlantic, it remained a well-defined system, but never organized into a tropical cyclone. On August8, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the following day, it developed a weak low-level circulation. The circulation became better defined later that day, and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that afternoon, when it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa and <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic Ocean on September11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September16. Convection steadily increased in both coverage and intensity, and by September19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800UTC on September19, while located 50miles (80km) north-northwest of San Andres Island.|$|E

5|$|A well {{organized}} tropical wave over northern Africa entered the Atlantic Ocean on May 31. The wave never {{showed signs of}} organization while crossing the Atlantic. It <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the eastern north Pacific on June 10. It was not until June 13 when the convection associated with the wave became better organized. On June 14, Tropical Depression Two-E formed at a location about 515.7miles (830km) from Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} a tropical depression on October16, while located south of Jamaica. Shortly thereafter, the depression made landfall in Clarendon Parish. It continued northward and made another landfall near Santa Cruz del Sur, Cuba on October17. The depression brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica and eastern Cuba. In the former, flooding caused damage to roads and forced many to evacuate their homes in western Kingston. Five fatalities were reported in Jamaica. Flooding in eastern Cuba resulted in seven deaths. After striking Cuba, the depression <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic and then crossed the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical low, {{the remnants of}} Ivan turned to the southeast and <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic Ocean, due to the building of an upper-level ridge to its east. As an extratropical cyclone, Ivan remained identifiable in both surface and upper-level data, and the system turned south and southwestward over the subsequent days. By September 20, the system was located off {{the east coast of}} Florida, producing scattered thunderstorms; unfavorable wind shear prevented tropical redevelopment, though forecasters indicated the possibility for more favorable conditions a few days later. On September 21 the low crossed southern Florida and <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Gulf of Mexico, and as it moved across the warm waters of the region the low began to re-acquire tropical characteristics; the low-level circulation became increasingly better defined, and convection redeveloped over the center. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated the low redeveloped into Tropical Depression Ivan late on September 22 while located about 175miles (280km) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, {{the forward}} speed of Dean {{continued}} to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Later that day, Dean <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.|$|E
5|$|As Carlos moved inland, {{it turned}} to the {{northwest}} {{in response to the}} anticyclone over Mexico, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status. By 12hours after landfall, there was little evidence of a circulation on satellite imagery. Late on June27, Carlos degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area near Acapulco. The circulation {{turned to the}} southwest and <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific Ocean; by 0000UTC on June29, the system dissipated completely.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Depression Two <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Bay of Campeche on June18, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for coastal areas between Punta El Lagarto and Barra Da Nautla. The watch was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning early on June19. Following the storm's intensification that day, the warning was expanded northward to Tuxpan. Officials dispatched 34,250workers to set up refugee camps throughout the state. Across Veracruz, approximately 2,000people sought refuge in shelters.|$|E

5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial forecasts, the cyclone {{failed to}} {{strengthen}} further due to interaction with Madagascar. Early on February14, Bingiza made landfall along the Masoala Peninsula with winds {{of at least}} 150km/h (90mph). It <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Antongil Bay, before moving ashore north of Manambolosy. It quickly weakened over land, although it produced heavy rainfall along its northern periphery. Early on February15, Bingiza weakened to a tropical depression. The center became difficult to locate over land, although it <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Mozambique Channel north of Besalampy as a tropical disturbance. After moving over waters, the system was able to re-intensify due to favorable water temperatures and inflow. It quickly organized into a tropical depression again, although strengthening was halted after it turned southward over western Madagascar due to a ridge to its north. It again moved into the Mozambique Channel, and Bingiza re-intensified into a tropical storm on February17. The storm developed a concentrated area of convection near the center, {{as well as a}} poorly defined eye. The re-intensification was short-lived after Bingiza made its final landfall just south of Morondava around 1330UTC on February17. Around that time, the circulation was dissipating over land, and its remnants left the island on February19.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danielle {{began as}} a {{vigorous}} tropical wave over Africa. As the wave <b>emerged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic, it quickly became more organized due to favorable conditions, including low wind shear. The circulation consolidated and spawned Tropical Depression Four {{on the morning of}} August13 south-southeast of the Cape Verde islands. The system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79°F (26°C); however, the low shear environment allowed the depression to continue to organize. Late that evening, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle.|$|E
