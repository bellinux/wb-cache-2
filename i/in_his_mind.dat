5|$|The episode {{ends with}} Ken writing in bed {{under a new}} pen name. Pete is shown back in his driver's ed class, {{watching}} helplessly as Hanson sits with the girl Pete had his eyes on, and the dripping sound of the leaky faucet replaying <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case. Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He takes pictures of his gloved hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear {{the same as the}} one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
5|$|In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At {{a stroke}} MacGregor lost his {{main source of}} income {{and the support of}} the {{influential}} Bowater family. His choices were, Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria's death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> unacceptably dull. His only real experience was military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there awkward at best.|$|E

60|$|As Lane {{stood on}} the ledge, knee-deep in the water, with the {{certainty}} {{that he had a}} perfect photograph of the field of tumbling waters below <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye, a strange voice seemed to whisper <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ear.|$|R
5|$|Though {{the witches}} do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, {{they use a}} subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person's mind, which he or she might either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand it over to someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|To save Robin and Gordon, Batman surrenders to Scarecrow and {{is taken}} to the ruins of Arkham Asylum. Scarecrow reveals Batman's secret {{identity}} to the world on television, before repeatedly injecting Batman with the fear toxin to break him before the public. Batman and the Joker then battle for control inside Batman's mind; Joker attempts to weaken Batman by recounting {{the people who have}} suffered and died because of Batman's crusade, but Batman triumphs and locks the pleading Joker away <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> forever to be forgotten— the Joker's only fear. Todd arrives and saves Batman, who subdues Scarecrow with his own fear toxin.|$|E

60|$|He held <b>his</b> head <b>in</b> both <b>his</b> {{hands to}} keep {{his eyes on the}} book. But the {{baseball}} mask bothered him.

5|$|Urey {{actively}} campaigned {{against the}} 1946 May-Johnson bill because {{he feared that}} {{it would lead to}} military control of nuclear energy, but supported and fought for the McMahon bill that replaced it, and ultimately created the Atomic Energy Commission. Urey's commitment to the ideal of world government dated from before the war, but the possibility of nuclear war made it only more urgent <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He went on lecture tours against war, and became involved in Congressional debates regarding nuclear issues. He argued publicly on behalf of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and was even called before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|Walker finally meets Konrad at his penthouse. Konrad {{appears to}} be the charismatic, villainous force behind the atrocities that Walker was hoping for, until Walker finds his {{decaying}} corpse on the penthouse deck. Walker finds that Konrad committed suicide after his failed evacuation effort, and he has been communicating with a traumatic hallucinatory Konrad, created <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> as a dissociative disorder upon the aftermath of the white phosphorus strike. Rationalizing the actions he had witnessed and carried out, Walker distorted many subsequent events of the game to make Konrad look responsible. With this revelation, 'Konrad' forces Walker, at gunpoint, to decide once and for all if he is to blame for his actions in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organization; their manuscript thickness is 15cm.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The drink {{has done}} it in your case, surely enough,' he said, as he saw <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye a trim figure behind the bar of a country public-house, {{and looked at the}} coarse, bloated, untidy {{creature}} before him.' ...|$|R
50|$|This helped Angulimala focus <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> on <b>his</b> basic {{meditation}} subject. Before, {{there would}} always appear <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye, {{the place in}} the jungle where he had slain so many people. After performing the Act of Truth, he was seen to bring safety to people and people started to approach him and provide him with almsfood.|$|R
5|$|Malgudi is a fictional, semi-urban town in {{southern}} India, conjured by Narayan. He created {{the town in}} September 1930, on Vijayadashami, an auspicious day to start new efforts and thus chosen for him by his grandmother. As he mentioned in a later interview to his biographers Susan and N. Ram, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> he first saw a railway station, and slowly the name Malgudi came to him. The town was created with an impeccable historical record, dating to the Ramayana days when {{it was noted that}} Lord Rama passed through; it was also said that the Buddha visited the town during his travels. While Narayan never provided strict physical constraints for the town, he allowed it to form shape with events in the various stories, becoming a reference point for the future. Dr James M. Fennelly, a scholar of Narayan's works, created a map of Malgudi based on the fictional descriptors of the town from the many books and stories.|$|E
5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E
5|$|The party {{continues}} {{to travel to}} the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness — human emotions — and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.|$|E
60|$|Fraser {{gazed at}} her <b>in</b> amaze. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind’s</b> eye he still saw {{the deck of the}} Golden Cloud; but Poppy’s deck-chair was empty, and Flower, in place of exchanging glances with her, was walking about in a state equally compounded, of wrath and bewilderment.|$|R
60|$|I went {{on talking}} {{until at last}} the skipper asked me whether he was {{wandering}} <b>in</b> <b>'is</b> <b>mind,</b> or whether I was. The mate came up from the cabin just then, and o' course he 'ad to tell me there was somebody knocking at the gate.|$|R
60|$|It is impossible, I think, for {{a drawing}} {{to be made}} on this method unless the artist had a clear image <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye of what he was about to draw, and was able, in some degree, to project it on the paper or slate.|$|R
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E
5|$|Khanna acted {{opposite}} Akshay Kumar in two action films: International Khiladi and Zulmi (both 1999). In {{the former}} {{she played a}} news reporter {{who falls in love}} with a criminal whom she interviews. Both performed poorly at the box office. She was paired with Daggubati Venkatesh in the Telugu film Seenu (1999). Khanna played the lead role in Baadshah (1999), featuring Shah Rukh Khan as a detective. In the same year, she acted opposite Saif Ali Khan in Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan, a romantic comedy directed by Mahesh Bhatt. She was paired opposite Aamir Khan in Dharmesh Darshan's Mela (2000). Similar to The Seven Samurai in story, it was an average grosser at the box office. In October 1999, along with Juhi Chawla, Shah Rukh and Salman Khan, she performed at Awesome Foursome concert held as Shah Alam Outdoor Stadium, Malaysia. Chal Mere Bhai (2000) featured her in a special appearance beside a leading role in the comedy Joru Ka Ghulam, opposite Govinda. She also acted in the David Dhawan-directed comedy Jodi No.1 (2001). Her acting in the film met with poor reviews. Film director Karan Johar admitted in an interview that Khanna was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> for the role of Tina in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, but she refused it, and thus Rani Mukerji was signed. She left the industry after her marriage to Kumar in 2001, citing that she did not enjoy the acting profession anymore. Her last film was Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega (2001), a remake of the Telugu movie Money (1993). It featured her opposite Fardeen Khan and was an average grosser at the box office.|$|E

60|$|He never glanced her way, for {{the reason}} that Mrs. Schomberg, in her night attire, looked the most unattractive object in existence--miserable, insignificant, faded, crushed, old.

60|$|I notice {{above the}} subject of his last marine picture, the Wreck-buoy, and I am well persuaded that from that year 1818, when first he saw a ship rent asunder, he never beheld one at sea, without, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye, at the same instant, seeing her skeleton.|$|R
60|$|Barney smiled, a bit ruefully, however, for <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye he saw {{a future}} moment when the proud old Prince von der Tann would know {{the truth of the}} imposture that had been played upon him, and the young man foresaw that he would have a rather {{unpleasant}} half-hour.|$|R
25|$|The arch did not, in his view, justify such expenditure, and {{although}} he expressed his regret at the passing of a major monument of the early railway age, there was no practical alternative <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

25|$|While {{returning}} {{from a trip to}} Las Vegas in January 1965, Francois, fascinated by the American shows, decided to take them as a model, and eventually the project of performing on the stage with a female dancer band became clear <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
