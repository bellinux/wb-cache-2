Following the Second World War, it was {{available only in}} select archives. In 1992, the memorandum was published for first time with an introduction by University of Pennsylvania historian Arthur Waldron. Although it had been suppressed and largely disregarded {{at the time it}} was written, MacMurray's analysis was considered prescient by later generations of scholars and diplomats. George F.

Approximately 10% of declared sanctuaries were on university campuses and 1% on seminaries.

2500|$|In March 2015, Steve Cohen {{boycotted the}} speech of the Prime Minister of Israel to Congress, writing: [...] "While Americans and members of Congress may {{disagree}} on anything, even foreign policy, providing a forum of such immense prestige and power to the leader of another country who is opposing our nation’s foreign policy is [...] It endangers the negotiations, insults the good faith of the other nations involved in the negotiations and emboldens Iran who may well view this schism <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>government</b> {{as an opportunity for}} advantage.

It was a great responsibility, and many feared that great changes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>government</b> might result. But the fears proved groundless.

60|$|It is {{far from}} {{impossible}} to reconcile, {{if we do not}} suffer ourselves to be entangled in the mazes of metaphysic sophistry, the use both of a fixed rule and an occasional deviation,--the sacredness of an hereditary principle of succession <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>government</b> with a power of change in its application in cases of extreme emergency. Even in that extremity, (if we take the measure of our rights by our exercise of them at the Revolution,) the change is to be confined to the peccant part only,--to the part which produced the necessary deviation; and even then it is to be effected without a decomposition of the whole civil and political mass, for the purpose of originating a new civil order out of the first elements of society.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Today's media {{contains}} the sobering news that an asylum seeker known as Latifa has been detained separately from her week old infant Farus, who is suffering respiratory problems. She {{is permitted to}} visit him between 10 am- 4 pm but is otherwise detained {{with her husband and}} two other children. Farus' father has not been permitted to visit. The reaction to the treatment of Latifa, Farus and their family has focused on the cruelty of separating a mother and sick infant. I agree with this assessment, but I am always interested to observe the essentialising of women's role as mother. I think that it is worthwhile to look more deeply into this picture to tease out what values are at stake <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>government's</b> treatment of this woman, her child and the child's father...|$|R
40|$|It is {{imperative}} to underscore {{the urgent need for}} values-based leadership worldwide – <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>governments,</b> academic institutions, and businesses. The lack thereof explains the collapse of global companies such as Enron, Tyco, Lehman Brothers, WorldCom, and Global Crossing due to unethical practices. This clarion call to inject principled decision-making in all forms of life and work is demarcated by inspiring examples of ethical leaders including Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mother Teresa. It places emphasis more on the “means” of attainment rather than on “ends” to excel as ethical leaders. It outlines the characteristics of values-based leaders and justifies the relevance of values-based leadership in today’s world. It concludes with the postulate that creating a better legacy for future generations is predicated upon living one’s values and principles...|$|R
5000|$|In first-wave feminist discourse, either Elizabeth Cady Stanton or Margaret Fuller (it {{is unclear}} who was first) {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} matriarchy and the discourse was joined in by Matilda Joslyn Gage. Victoria Woodhull, in 1871, called for men to open the U.S. government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a year; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected President in 1872. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in 1911 and 1914, argued for [...] "a woman-centered, or better mother-centered, world" [...] and described government by women. She argued that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other, both genders being [...] "useful ... and should <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>governments</b> be alike used", because {{men and women have}} different qualities.|$|R

I make you an offer which you yourself must consider a wonderful one. You come to this country as an enemy, and I offer you my hand as a friend.

'Leave them to themselves, and their government will soon dissolve.' Will not the wise and good strive hard to avert this evil?

60|$|The {{body with}} which the king came most {{immediately}} into conflict in this long struggle for ascendency, was the Parliament. And here American readers are very liable to fall into a mistake by considering the houses of Parliament as analogous to the houses of legislation in the various governments of this country. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>governments</b> the chief magistrate has only to execute definite and written laws and ordinances, passed by the Legislature, and which the Legislature may pass with or without his consent; and when enacted, he must be governed by them.

60|$|The {{sense of}} that {{quotation}} condensed is this: that this slavery element is a durable element of discord among us, and that we shall probably not have perfect peace in this country with it until it either masters the free principle <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>government,</b> or is so far mastered by the free principle as for the public mind {{to rest in the}} belief {{that it is going to}} its end. This sentiment, which I now express in this way, was, at no great distance of time, perhaps in different language, and in connection with some collateral ideas, expressed by Governor Seward. Judge Douglas has been so much annoyed by the expression of that sentiment that he has constantly, I believe, in almost all his speeches since it was uttered, been referring to it. I find he alluded to it in his speech here, as well as in the copyright essay. I do not now enter upon this for the purpose of making an elaborate argument to show that we were right in the expression of that sentiment. In other words, I shall not stop to say all that might properly be said upon this point, but I only ask your attention to it for the purpose of making one or two points upon it.|$|E
