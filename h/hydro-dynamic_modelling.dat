To study the main driver of the species selection, we used a trait-based model that keeps phenotypic variability through physiological trait parameterization. Next, we validated the results by using the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum which is a toxic species.

Analysis of the results indicate sporadic internally trapped waves travelling northward along the East Australian coast may be the "cold dirty water" described by local fishermen and whose sediment transport budget impact may be under-estimated by current coastal <b>hydro-dynamic</b> <b>models.</b> Further investigations are underway. The system being discussed and described in this paper upgrades this labour intensive methodology as it allows for data downloading to be undertaken leaving the instruments in-situ. By including an acoustic modem between the seabed unit and a surface buoy and {{with the addition of a}} Campbell Scientific CR 1000 and wireless modem link a mesh radio network can be established linking the seabed unit to the shore. Real-time interrogation of the unit can then occur allowing for immediate confirmation of the equipment functioning correctly and for management decisions to be made using current and up to date data. Whilst the fundamentals of this system are not new, the novel capability is the addition of additional units into the monitoring area which are immediately picked up and added to the mesh network. Utilising this capability, a series of monitoring stations can be daisy chained away from the shore based receiver station allowing for a comprehensive array of sensors covering a wide area.

40|$|Connectivity {{throughout}} {{the life cycle}} of flatfish remains an open question, especially during the early life stages. Their effective management requires understanding of how spawning grounds and nurseries are connected and what processes influence larval retention and dispersal. The case of sole (Solea solea L.) is of particular interest because {{it is one of the}} most valuable commercial species in the North Sea, although stocks are chronically overexploited and variability in interannual recruitment is high. The transport of sole larvae from the spawning grounds to the nurseries is driven by hydrodynamic processes, but the final dispersal pattern and larval survival/abundance might be influenced by both behavioral and environmental factors. Therefore it is important to understand the relative impact of hydrodynamics, environment, behavior and ecophysiology on sole larval dispersal. Here we use a particle-tracking transport model coupled to a 3 D <b>hydro-dynamic</b> <b>model</b> of the North Sea to investigate interannual variability of the transport of sole larvae over a 12 -year period (1995 - 2006). A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative impact of hydrodynamics, temperature and behavior on the recruitment dynamics to the nurseries. Four scenarios have been tested: (i) constant forcing of sea surface temperature during all years but varying meteorological forcing and river runoff, (ii) constant meteorological forcing during the whole period but varying sea surface temperature and river runoff, (iii) no vertical migration and (iv) an extended drift period (max. 30 days) before settlement if the larvae are not close to a suitable sediment type. Results suggest that year-to-year variability of larval supply to the nurseries is high, both in terms of abundance and larval source (balance between retention and dispersal). Sensitivity analysis shows that larval abundance at the end of the larval stage increases considerably if a settling delay is included. The impact of vertical migration on larval transport and the variations in larval retention at the nurseries due to varying meteorological conditions and sea surface temperature forcing are not spatially consistent...|$|R

The storage capacity is mobilised through active flow control automatically regulated by an Artificial Intelligence system using local level monitoring. The effects of climate change, population growth and urbanisation are putting increasing pressure on sewer and drainage networks both in the UK and overseas. The capacity of networks to cope with runoff at the required rate often falls short of requirements leading to localised floods and/or increased CSO spills to receiving waters. Smart Water/ Wastewater Network technologies {{have the potential to}} deliver improved service to customers and cost-effective performance improvements for the water industry. CENTAUR aims to provide an innovative, cost effective, local autonomous data driven in-sewer flow control system whose operation will attenuate peaks and reduce the risk of surface water flooding. The system enables the capacity of existing infrastructure to be utilised more efficiently as a very economical alternative to capital-intensive solutions, for example building extra storage capacity. The system is also quick to implement with virtually no enabling works prior to installation. CENTAUR comprises level monitors which relay data to an intelligent controller, which instructs a flow control device regulated by a novel and robust artificial intelligence routine based on Fuzzy Logic. The level monitors and intelligent controller are located locally and utilise real time data to provide effective real time control (RTC).

40|$|The {{process of}} prey capture by {{inertial}} suction was studied in three species of sunfishes (Lepomis auritus, L. macrochirus, and L. gibbosus) by the simul-taneous recording of buccal and opercular cavity pressures {{in order to}} test current hydrodynamic models of feeding in fishes. Synchronous high-speed films permitted the correlation of kinematic patterns of jaw bone movement with specific pressure waveforms. Opercular cavity pressures averaged one-fifth buccal pressures and pressure magnitude was correlated with prey type. Peak buccal and opercular pressures were — 650 cm H 2 O and — 150 cm H 2 O respectively; peak rate of pressure change was — 100 cm H 2 O/ms. Buccal pressure magnitude varied inversely with degree of predator satiation. Opercular pressure waveforms have an initial positive phase followed by a prolonged negative phase and then a final positive phase. The initial positive pressure may be absent during slow strikes at worms. Buccal pressure waveforms show considerable variability. The modal waveform consists of a sharp negative pressure pulse followed by a positive phase and finally by another pressure reduction. Delayed opercular abduction relative to mouth cavity compression correlates with the presence of a positive buccal phase. The second buccal negative pressure is the result of rapid mouth closing causing a pressure reduction (water hammer effect) as water flow continues posteriorly. These data indicate that (1) the buccal and opercular cavities are functionally separated by a gill curtain of high resistance, (2) that inertial effects of water are important in the description of the suction feeding process, (3) that a reverse flow of water (opercular to buccal cavity) may occur during the early phase of mouth opening prior to establishment of a buccal to opercular flow regime, and (4) current models of respiratory pressure and flow pattern cannot be applied to feeding.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past {{throughout}} the Mediterranean area, many extreme events such as floods, debris flows and landslides occurred. Mediterranean ephemeral streams have specific features compared to other river systems; their basins are small and highly torrential and may generate flash-floods (Camarasa-Belmonte & Soriano-Garcia, 2012). Moreover, the rapid transformation processes of urban areas induced the increase of catchment imperviousness and the derived increase of surface runoff generated during rainfall events. However, flooding events in urban areas occur quite frequently {{as a consequence of}} rain events of lower intensity than the design one, even in case of correct network dimensioning. The use of a reliable flood forecasting model in urban areas can {{play an important role in}} managing land and water resources. The purpose of this work is the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) for flash flood warning in an urban area. Usually, flood warning systems are based on on-line hydrological and/or hydraulic models in order to provide forecasts of water stages or discharges at critical river sections (Martina et al., 2006; Diakakis, 2012; Wu et al., 2015). This procedure is inappropriate for flash flood warning in urban areas or in catchments with a small area. According to the approach proposed by [Amadio et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2015], in this study the rainfall threshold has been estimated in an urban area by coupling results of <b>hydro-dynamic</b> <b>model</b> in terms of water stage and flooding area. Particularly, dependency of the antecedent soil moisture conditions has been neglected because urban areas are characterized by imperious surfaces This study proposes a methodology to point out in urban areas rainfall thresholds used in flash flood warning which should be influenced by the uncertainties in the rainfall characteristics, including rainfall duration, depth and storm pattern. Particularly, the methodology here developed has a modular structure consisting of different modules: synthetic hyetographs definition to gain the hydrological input to the hydraulic model; transformation of flood discharge to inundated area through a two-dimensional hydraulic model the FLURB- 2 D model (Aronica & Lanza, 2005) and, finally, quantification of threshold rainfall associated with specific inundation criteria...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{upcoming}} ALICE experiment, a dedicated detector to study ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the present thesis {{has been devoted to}} the study of Elliptic Flow, i. e. the azimuthal anisotropy in the momenta distribution of the final state particles produced in the collision. The anisotropic flow is a key observable to study the thermodynamic properties and the Equation of State of the system created in the collision: the final momenta anisotropy can be connected to the spatial anisotropy of the initial state only by assuming that the system's constituents are strongly coupled and the system behaves as a relativistic fluid. The expected values of elliptic flow and charged multiplicity have been extrapolated to LHC energy (for lead-lead collision at 5. 5 TeV per nucleon) in two independent ways; in the Low Density Limit approximation and with the Relativistic <b>Hydro-Dynamic</b> <b>model,</b> producing different impact parameter dependences of the elliptic flow. These predictions have been used as an input for events simulations in the AliRoot framework, to develop and test a flow analysis package for the ALICE environment. The analysis code is based on the event plane method, which has been already successfully used for flow study in other heavy ion experiments at lower energy, such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven, and the NA experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. One of the biggest experimental uncertainties in measuring flow at LHC is the magnitude of non-flow effects, i. e. azimuthal correlations between collision products not due to collective flow, and therefore not correlated with the reaction plane. Depending on the analysis method, non-flow effects can introduce a systematic error in the flow measurement. Non-flow effects have been simulated using the Hijing event generator, which implements all known physics effects from a superposition of proton-proton collisions. Comparison between the expected magnitude of elliptic flow and the estimated magnitude of non-flow contributions defines the applicability of the Event Plane analysis. The study also showed that non-flow effects are less important when the genuine flow or the multiplicity are large, leading to the conclusion that only peripheral reactions are heavily affected by non-flow, while the best sensitivity is achieved in semi-central collisions. It has also been observed that non-flow contributions change significantly for different particle selections and for different definitions of sub-events. Therefore, with different analysis settings, it is possible to minimize them...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of long, weakly nonlinear internal waves in a stratified gas is studied. Hydrodynamic equations for an ideal fluid {{with the perfect}} gas law describe the atmospheric gas behaviour. If we neglect the term Ͽ dw/dt (product of the density and vertical acceleration), {{we come to a}} so-called quasistatic model, while we name the full <b>hydro-dynamic</b> <b>model</b> as a nonquasistatic one. Both quasistatic and nonquasistatic models are used for wave simulation and the models are compared among themselves. It is shown that a smooth classical solution of a nonlinear quasistatic problem does not exist for all t because a gradient catastrophe of non-linear internal waves occurs. To overcome this difficulty, we search for the solution of the quasistatic problem in terms of a generalised function theory as a limit of special regularised equations containing some additional dissipation term when the dissipation factor vanishes. It is shown that such solutions of the quasistatic problem qualitatively differ from solutions of a nonquasistatic nature. It is {{explained by the fact that}} in a nonquasistatic model the vertical acceleration term plays the role of a regularizator with respect to a quasistatic model, while the solution qualitatively depends on the regularizator used. The numerical models are compared with some analytical results. Within the framework of the analytical model, any internal wave is described as a system of wave modes; each wave mode interacts with others due to equation non-linearity. In the principal order of a perturbation theory, each wave mode is described by some equation of a KdV type. The analytical model reveals that, in a nonquasistatic model, an internal wave should disintegrate into solitons. The time of wave disintegration into solitons, the scales and amount of solitons generated are important characteristics of the non-linear process; they are found with the help of analytical and numerical investigations. Satisfactory coincidence of simulation outcomes with analytical ones is revealed and some examples of numerical simulations illustrating wave disintegration into solitons are given. The phenomenon of internal wave mixing is considered and is explained from the point of view of the results obtained. The numerical methods for internal wave simulation are examined. In particular, the influence of difference interval finiteness on a numerical solution is investigated. It is revealed that a numerical viscosity and numerical dispersion can play the role of regularizators to a nonlinear quasistatic problem. To avoid this effect, the grid steps should be taken less than some threshold values found theoretically...|$|R

Emission from plasma ascending along loops rooted on the visible solar disk should be often dominated, at least temporally, by a blue-shifted emission.

The main aim of the work was to explain why numerous flares do not show blue-shifted spectra. The synthesized BCS spectra of the flares were compared with the relevant observed BCS spectra. We conclude that stationary component of the spectrum should be observed almost for all flares during their early phases of evolution. In opposite, the blue-shifted component of the spectrum could be not detected in flares having plasma rising along the flaring loop even with high velocity due to the geometrical dependences only.

We present three strategies: best node, best neighbour, and random selection, for job deviation. A number of experiments are conducted for the comparison of the three strategies, and the results show that the best neighbour strategy is the best among the proposed strategies. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm with best neighbour strategy is better than the traditional round robin algorithm in term of processing delay, and the proposed algorithm needs very limited system information and is robust. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of the European Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD), authorities face the problem of repeatedly performing area-wide surveying of all kinds of inland waters. Especially for mid-sized or small rivers this is a considerable challenge imposing insurmountable logistical efforts and costs. It is therefore investigated if large-scale surveying of a river system on an operational basis is feasible by employing airborne hydrographic laser scanning. In cooperation with the Bavarian Water Authority (WWA Weilheim) a pilot project was initiated by the Unit of Hydraulic Engineering at the University of Innsbruck and RIEGL Laser Measurement Systems exploiting the possibilities of a new LIDAR measurement system with high spatial resolution and high measurement rate to capture about 70 km of riverbed and foreland for the river Loisach in Bavaria/Germany and the estuary and parts of the shoreline (about 40 km in length) of lake Ammersee. The entire area surveyed was referenced to classic terrestrial cross-section surveys with the aim to derive products for the monitoring and managing needs of the inland water bodies forced by the EU-WFD. The survey was performed in July 2011 by helicopter and airplane and took 3 days in total. In addition, high resolution areal images were taken to provide an optical reference, offering a wide range of possibilities on further research, monitoring, and managing responsibilities. The operating altitude was about 500 m to maintain eye-safety, even for the aided eye, the airspeed was about 55 kts for the helicopter and 75 kts for the aircraft. The helicopter was used in the alpine regions while the fixed wing aircraft was used in the plains and the urban area, using appropriate scan rates to receive evenly distributed point clouds. The resulting point density ranged from 10 to 25 points per square meter. By carefully selecting days with optimum water quality, satisfactory penetration down to the river bed was achieved throughout the project. During the data processing meshes for multiple purposes like monitoring sediment transport or accumulation and <b>hydro-dynamic</b> numeric <b>modeling</b> were generated.

40|$|In water-quality {{modelling}} {{several different}} directions {{can be distinguished}} according to the strategy employed and the disciplinary background used for analysis. A precise classification {{would be difficult to}} make, but the manifest difference between transport-oriented and ecology-oriented water-quality models creates at least two obvious groups. In the first case, the description of biological and chemical processes is oversimplified, while in the second, the same applies to transport phenomena. Both approaches determine the level of involvement of the respectively less emphasised phenomena by a priori assumptions. This paper discusses this apparent gap and how to overcome it. No overall procedure is given; instead, a framework is suggested which is based on establishing the relative importances of the various subprocesses determining water quality and proceeding to the corresponding model structure. This should allow the proper combination of knowledge gained from theory and observations, and, furthermore, the elaboration of essential modelling steps such as parameter estimation and model identification. To illustrate, two examples are presented [...] one concerns heavy-metal pollution of a river, the second involves a lake for which the wind-induced interaction between water and sediment was analysed. In the first situation, a one-dimensional, coupled <b>hydro-dynamic</b> [...] water-quality <b>model</b> for three cadmium compartments was adopted. For the second problem, it was necessary to determine the unknown boundary condition at the lake bottom. This latter was achieved by simplifying the governing transport equation into an ordinary differential equation and introducing some simplifying hypotheses. Given data from regular, intensive observations, the calibration, identification, and validation of this model were carried out using the extended Kalman filtering technique...|$|R
40|$|Depending on its {{hydraulic}} characteristics {{the control}} of run-of-river-hydro-schemes sets high standards to the operator of these systems. The main reasons are strong nonlinear properties of the fundamental hydrodynamic process with its large and variable dead time between a change of inflow into the system and a change of the controlled water level {{at the other end}} of the hydro scheme. If in addition the water level has to be kept within a tight tolerance band conventional governors regularly fail to guarantee a reliable operation within the set limits. Based on this experience operators frequently call for a model based control of theses hydro schemes similar to process control applications in the chemical and petrochemical industry, particularly because there is hardly any hardware difference between model based and conventional process control systems today. Model based governors promise to show a better control of nonlinear processes due to their built in process knowledge. They are not limited to a single design point like conventional PI-controllers but offer a wide process range. Unfortunately no methods have been published so far to develop model based controllers for the hydro business and to specify its abilities. In order to obtain results about the control quality of conventional and modern approaches this thesis analyzes a variety of both kinds of control methods in their general suitability as far as their weaks and strengths. In this context some new aspects arise even for the definition of regulation parameters and boundary conditions for the design of conventional governing concepts. For the reliable control of ambitious hydro schemes especially when combined with high demands in process quality only MPCs (Model Predictive Control) show to be sophisticated enough to deal with these conditions. Core element of a model-integrated regulation is an appropriate <b>hydro-dynamic</b> simulation <b>model.</b> Usually a one dimensional simulation should be sufficient. As suitable simulation methods for integration into a regulation concept characteristic procedures, finite difference methods and finite volume models are determined. This thesis continues with an evaluation of structure and variants of a MPC concept and defines boundary conditions to be considered. The theoretical approach is confirmed by the discussion of characteristic applications on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations. These simulations show in an impressing way the attainable efficiency and quality of a MPC concept, especially compared with conventional governing methods. MPCs have not been used for real hydro control yet. Therefore additional comments and relevant information are given for a practical implementation in future...|$|R
