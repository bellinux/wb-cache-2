5|$|The {{climate of}} Level Mountain is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, casting a rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and <b>flat</b> <b>profile,</b> it has subtle differences in climate, particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates from which to choose.|$|E

In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{evolution of}} thirteen regions of massive star formation is studied through single-dish and interferometer line observations at submillimeter wavelengths. The wealth of CH 3 OH and H 2 CO lines covering a large range of excitation conditions {{allows us to}} calculate radial abundance profiles, using the physical structures of the sources derived earlier from submillimeter continuum and CS lines. The data indicate three types of abundance profiles: <b>flat</b> <b>profiles</b> at CH 3 OH/H 2 ~ 10 ^- 9 for the coldest sources, profiles with a jump in its abundance from ~ 10 ^- 9 to ~ 10 ^- 7 for the warmer sources, and <b>flat</b> <b>profiles</b> at CH 3 OH/H 2 ~few 10 ^- 8 for the hot cores. The location of the jump at T~ 100 K {{suggests that it is}} due to evaporation of grain mantles, followed by destruction in gas-phase reactions in the hot core stage. In contrast, the H 2 CO data can be well fit with a constant abundance of a few x 10 ^- 9 throughout the envelope, providing limits on its grain surface formation. These results indicate that T_rot(CH 3 OH) can be used as evolutionary indicator during the embedded phase of massive star formation, independent of source optical depth or orientation.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{lightweight}} {{materials in the}} transport industry is fuelling the research of high performing components. Extruded aluminium profiles intended for crash components are examined in this project. The objective in this work {{is to examine the}} microstructure and the mechanical properties, in order to further determine if the profiles behaves as expected. Both <b>flat</b> <b>profiles</b> and 2 -chamber box profiles are studied. Three Al-Mg-Si alloys: C 20 -Y 1, C 24 -X 1 and C 28 -C 2 are inspected in this study. These are evaluated in three different tempers states: T 4 /W, T 6 and T 7. The characterization of the microstructure by light optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy is completed. In addition, the mechanical properties of the materials are considered through tensile and bending tests. The characterization showed a fully recrystallized microstructure in the C 20 -Y 1 alloy, and fibrous microstructure in the C 24 -X 1 and C 28 -C 2 alloy. A typical deformation texture is observed in the two fibrous alloys. The recrystallized C 20 -Y 1 alloy displays a strong cube texture. Large primary particles are present in the C 28 -C 2 alloy, and the smallest particles are seen in the C 20 -Y 1 alloy. For all alloys the particles are elongated in the extrusion direction. C 28 -C 2 displayed a loss of strength in T 7 -state compared to the other materials, presumably the highly alloyed profile reaches peak strength earlier. Reached true strain at max load by the recrystallized C 20 -Y 1 is noticeably higher than the fibrous alloys. The true strain of this alloy is seen to be highly dependent of the temper state it is in. The fibrous microstructure is less affected by it temper state, which is likely connected to its subgrain structure. The C 24 -X 1 shows the best bendability, assumed due to the combination of smaller primary particles and sub grain structure. The <b>flat</b> <b>profiles</b> systematically reached the highest bending angles. It is also noticed the <b>flat</b> <b>profiles</b> consistently achieved higher true strain at max load in the T 6 - and T 7 -state.

The {{character}} of the profile is indeed much altered by the accidental nature of the surface decoration; but {{the importance of the}} broad difference between the raised and <b>flat</b> <b>profile</b> will be felt on glancing at the examples 1 to 6 in Plate XII. The three upper examples are the Romanesque types, which occur as parallels with the Byzantine types, 1 to 3 of Plate XI. Their plans would be nearly the same; but instead of resembling flat leaves, they are literally spurs, or claws, as high as they are broad; and the third, from St. Michele of Pavia, appears to be intended to have its resemblance to a claw enforced by the transverse fillet. 1 is from St. Ambrogio, Milan; 2 from Vienne, France. The 4th type, Plate XII., almost like the extremity of a man's foot, is a Byzantine form (perhaps worn on the edges), from the nave of St. Mark's; and the two next show the unity of the two principles, forming the perfect Italian Gothic types,--5, from tomb of Can Signorio della Scala, Verona; 6, from San Stefano, Venice (the base 11 of Plate XI., in perspective). The two other bases, 10 and 12 of Plate XI., are conditions of the same kind, showing the varieties of rise and fall in exquisite modulation; the 10th, a type more frequent at Verona than Venice, in which the spur profile overlaps the roll, instead of rising out of it, and seems to hold it down, {{as if it were a}} ring held by sockets. This is a character found both in early and late work; a kind of band, or fillet, appears to hold, and even compress, the centre of the roll in the base of one of the crypt shafts of St. Peter's, Oxford, which has also spurs at its angles; and long bands flow over the base of the angle shaft of the Ducal Palace of Venice, next the Porta della Carta.|$|E
