5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with <b>glucose</b> <b>intolerance.</b> The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
5|$|While the {{detection}} of Mups excreted by other animals has been well studied, the functional role in the producing animal is less clear. However, in 2009, Mups were shown {{to be associated with}} the regulation of energy expenditure in mice. Scientists found that genetically induced obese, diabetic mice produce thirty times less Mup RNA than their lean siblings. When they delivered Mup protein directly into the bloodstream of these mice, they observed an increase in energy expenditure, physical activity and body temperature and a corresponding decrease in <b>glucose</b> <b>intolerance</b> and insulin resistance. They propose that Mups' beneficial effects on energy metabolism occurs by enhancing mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Another study found Mups were reduced in diet-induced obese mice. In this case, the presence of Mups in the bloodstream of mice restricted glucose production by directly inhibiting the expression of genes in the liver.|$|E

To address in vivo impact of this IRS- 1 variant on whole body glucose homeostasis and insulin signalling, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing it (Tg 972) and evaluated insulin action in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and assessed glucose homeostasis both under a normal diet and a high-fat diet. We found that Tg 972 mice developed age-related <b>glucose</b> and insulin <b>intolerance</b> and hyperglycaemia, with insulin levels comparatively low. Glucose utilization and insulin signalling were impaired in all key insulin target tissues in Tg 972 mice. There were no differences in pancreatic morphology between Tg 972 and wild-type mice, however when insulin secretion was evaluated in isolated islets, it was significantly reduced in Tg 972 mice islets at any glucose concentration tested. Under a high-fat diet, Tg 972 mice had increased body and adipose tissue weight, and were more prone to develop diet-induced <b>glucose</b> and insulin <b>intolerance.</b> So, we believe that Tg 972 mice may represent a useful model to elucidate the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in insulin resistance pathogenesis.

40|$|SummaryHepatic steatosis, the {{accumulation}} of lipids in the liver, is widely believed to result in insulin resistance. To test the causal relationship between hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, we generated mice that overexpress acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT 2), which catalyzes the final step of triacylglycerol (TG) biosynthesis, in the liver (Liv-DGAT 2 mice). Liv-DGAT 2 mice developed hepatic steatosis, with increased amounts of TG, diacylglycerol, ceramides, and unsaturated long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs in the liver. However, they had no abnormalities in plasma glucose and insulin levels, glucose and insulin tolerance, rates of glucose infusion and hepatic glucose production during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, or activities of insulin-stimulated signaling proteins in the liver. DGAT 1 overexpression in the liver also failed to induce <b>glucose</b> or insulin <b>intolerance.</b> Our results indicate that DGAT-mediated lipid accumulation in the liver is insufficient to cause insulin resistance and show that hepatic steatosis can occur independently of insulin resistance...|$|R

25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 and, to a lesser degree, PLSCR1 are critical to the normal regulation of fat accumulation in mice. In addition to blood cells, PLSCR3 is expressed to a significantly higher level in fat and muscle cells, which are actively involved in fat metabolism. PLSCR3 knockout mice showed an aberrant abdominal fat accumulation, <b>glucose</b> <b>intolerance,</b> insulin resistance, and dyslipidema as compared to controlled mice. Cultured fat cells from PLSCR3 knockout mice were engorged with neutral lipids. Blood plasma of these mice showed elevated levels of non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and leptin, but low adiponectin content. Abdominal fat accumulation {{with the formation of}} enlarged lipid engorged adipocytes has emerged as the key risk factor for the onset of type 2 diabetes, which is often a manifestation of a broader underlying metabolic disorder termed as metabolic syndrome. Further studies on the regulation of lipid metabolism by PLSCRs are required to understand the risk for development of similar diseases in humans when PLSCR genes are mutated, leading to a defective expression and/or function of PLSCR proteins.|$|E

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} is a chronic inflammatory condition accompanying obesity or high fat diets {{that leads to}} type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that lipids and gut bacterial compounds in particular contribute to metabolic inflammation by activating the immune system; however, the receptors detecting these “instigators” of inflammation remain largely undefined. Here, we show that circulating activators of NOD 1, a receptor for bacterial peptidoglycan, increase with high fat feeding in mice, suggesting that NOD 1 could be a critical sensor leading to metabolic inflammation. Hematopoietic depletion of NOD 1 did not prevent weight gain but protected chimeric mice against diet-induced <b>glucose</b> and insulin <b>intolerance.</b> Mechanistically, while macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue persisted, notably these cells were less pro-inflammatory, had lower CXCL 1 production, and consequently, lower neutrophil chemoattraction into the tissue.

Material and Methods:This cross-sectional study was carried out on 1754 individuals who were a subsample of the 1 st phase of Isfahan Healthy Heart Program. Basic characteristics such as age, sex, education, smoking status and physical activity were collected using a questionnaire. Dietary assessment was done with a single 24 hour recall questionnaire and glycemic index and glycemic load were calculated. Weight, height, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and 2 hour post-prandial glucose (2 hpp) were measured. Results:Energy intake and GL, but not glycemic index had a negative association with diabetes type 2, <b>intolerance</b> <b>glucose</b> test (IGT) (P< 0. 05).

In the present study, we found that CR of mice (60 % of the diet consumption compared with ad libitum mice) reduces the expression levels of Grb 2 in skeletal muscle, an insulin target tissue that accounts for 85 % of insulin-stimulated blood glucose clearance. To determine whether Grb 2 downregulation contributes to increased insulin sensitivity in the regulation of glucose metabolism, we generated C 2 C 12 cell lines in which the expression of Grb 2 is suppressed by RNA interference. Suppressing Grb 2 expression in C 2 C 12 myoblasts enhances insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) - 1, tyrosine phosphorylation, and Akt phosphorylation, which is associated with decreased IRS- 1 serine phosphorylation at residues 307, 612, and 636 / 639.
