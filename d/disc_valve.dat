50|$|Like IFA, Engineer Daniel Zimmermann (born 1902) {{based his}} ZPH engine on the pre-war DKW RT-125 which he heavily {{modified}} {{by adding a}} <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> that allowed asymmetric port timing with a longer duration inlet phase. Zimmermann also used a new crankshaft providing 'square' bore and stroke dimensions (54mm x 54mm) and used stuffing rings to boost the primary compression ratio. However, the East German government didn't like the competition between the two East Germans and persuaded Zimmermann to reveal his engine's secrets to Kaaden.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{evaluate}} midterm {{results of}} mechanical valves in pulmonary position {{in patients with}} pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction {{as an alternative to}} bioprostheses. Patients: Mechanical <b>valves</b> (six tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> and two bileaflet valves) were implanted in eight patients previously operated on for tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7) and truncus arteriosus (n = 1), with severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by massive pulmonary regurgitation. Results: All patients survived prosthesis implantation and are currently well. At follow-up (3 months to 9 years), they do not show signs of valve failure, and right ventricular function has dramatically improved in all but one, who still shows moderate ventricular hypokinesia. Conclusion: After operative correction of congenital heart defects in selected patients who show severe dysfunction of the right ventricle caused by pulmonary regurgitation/stenosis, mechanical valves may represent an alternative to bioprosthetic valves. The selection of the valve type is still a matter of debate. However, according to literature data, complications seem to have occurred only in patients with bileaflet mechanical valves in the pulmonary position, whereas no thromboembolic episodes or valve failure is reported in subjects with tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> in the right ventricular outflow. Tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> might perform better in the right ventricular outflow than bileaflet valves. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 115 : 1074 - 9...|$|R

50|$|Loop scavenging, <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> and {{expansion}} chambers {{worked in a}} highly coordinated way to significantly increase the power output of two-stroke engines, particularly from the Japanese manufacturers Suzuki, Yamaha and Kawasaki.

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{advanced}} for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} rotary <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.|$|E

The A1 had two Mikuni carburetors located on the engine's left and right sides and inline with the crankshaft. The carburetors were enclosed and protected from the elements by carburetor covers fixed to the crankcase. Inboard of each carburetor, and supporting each carburetor, was the disc cover.

40|$|AbstractMore than 300 {{epicardial}} Doppler color flow mapping {{studies on}} 23 {{different types of}} clinical and preclinical valves were performed after implantation in the mitral position in sheep. The transducers were placed directly on the heart to obtain the greatest possible resolution. Studies were performed in each animal under different hemodynamic conditions by varying heart rate and cardiac output. Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The valves included 3 types of ball and cage valves, 3 types of <b>disc</b> and cage <b>valves,</b> 7 types of tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves,</b> 1 type of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical valve, 13 types of porcine aortic valves and 5 types of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. Ball and cage and <b>disc</b> and cage <b>valves</b> had high velocity peripheral jets and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. Tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus. Bileaflet hemidisc valves had three jets, which decayed 1. 5 cm downstream. Porcine aortic and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves had high velocity, turbulent, nonaxisymmetric jets (more severe for the latter). These observations are similar and complementary to those obtained by in vitro flow visualization techniques and those obtained by laser Doppler anemometry. As such, they provide an important interface between the in vitro assessment of prosthetic valve function and the clinical utility of Doppler color velocity flow imaging technology...|$|R
