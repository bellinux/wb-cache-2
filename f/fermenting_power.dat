The {{objective}} of this study has been to understand the metabolic interrelationship between yeast growth, regulation of glycolytic/gluconeogenic flux and accumulation of glycosyl donors for polysaccharide synthesis in brewing yeast (Saccharomyces uvarum) fermentations. Loss of <b>fermenting</b> <b>power</b> of a brewing yeast population may be created by a condition that inhibits growth by limiting amino acid formation and protein synthesis. In commercial strains of S. uvarum this loss may be transitory, or, if not corrected, may ultimately lead to yeast degeneration. The potential industrial impact is realised for fermentation systems which may limit yeast growth, eg. continuous systems, use of pressure and, particularly, systems utilizing immobilised cells...|$|E
40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} micronutrient in the metabolism of almost all living organisms; however, its deficiency is well documented especially in pregnant women and in children. Iron salts as a dietary supplement have low bioavailability and can cause gastrointestinal discomforts. Iron enriched yeasts can provide a supplementation of this micronutrient to the diet because this mineral has a better bioavailability when bonded to yeast cell macromolecules. These yeasts {{can be used as}} feed supplement for human and animals and also as baker's yeast. Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cultivated in a reactor employing yeast media supplemented with 497 mg ferrous sulfate. L- 1, and the resultant biomass incorporated 8 mg Fe. g- 1 dry matter. This biomass maintained its <b>fermenting</b> <b>power</b> regarding both water displace measurement through carbonic dioxide production and bakery characteristics. The bread produced using the yeast obtained by cultivation in yeast media supplemented with iron presented six times more iron than the bread produced using the yeast obtained by cultivation without iron supplementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{aromatic}} {{quality of}} wines depends on several factors. Some are intrinsic factors of the grape variety, others {{are linked to}} conditions such as climate and terroir, {{as well as the}} technological process of production. In this context, the yeasts have considerable importance. In oenology, there is a growing interest for the study of new yeast strains characterized by a good fermentative capacity and a favorable contribute to the sensory quality of wine. In this study, we compared six different Saccharomyces strains (3 S. cerevisiae e 3 S. bayanus), focusing on the fermentation performance and production of volatiles in white neutral wine from Trebbiano grapes. It is included in the study a new strain (ECA 5 TM) to deepen its fermentation ability and metabolite production in order to evaluate its possible employment in winemaking. A total of 39 compounds were quantified by gas chromatography (alcohols, higher alcohols, C 6 -alcohols, higher alcohol acetates, esters, fatty acids and terpenic compounds) in the wines obtained by fermentation with different yeats strains. The obtained results show that the tested strains are very similar regarding production of ethanol, glycerol, and aromatic compounds. However, ECA 5 TM strain showed a lower <b>fermenting</b> <b>power,</b> even though the ethanol content (% v/v) in the wine was similar to the others strains. Moreover, ECA 5 TM, as well as Lavlin 71 B, positively influenced the aromatic profile, showing a higher content of some volatiles...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the antibacterial properties of the isolated strains of traditional Armenian dairy products including cheese and traditional yogurts (Matson) and Richal  shiri as a traditional dairy products from Iran. Material and method: In the present experimental study, bacterial strains were isolated, and subsequently the antibacterial activity of supernatants of strains on several types of spoilages bacteria such as Salmonella  was assessed. In addition, isolated strains from Rachel shiri showed  a good  antibacterial properties against Salmonella typhimurium. Results: The isolated strains were significantly reduced food contamination and increased the shelf -life. Furthermore, isolated strains from Richal shiri showed a good antibacterial properties against Salmonella typhimurium Conclusion: LAB strains isolated with appropriate inhibition, <b>fermented</b> <b>power</b> as a natural preservative and pragmatic as new products may be used in the dairy industry...|$|R
50|$|The {{music of}} Santana and Osibisa also {{influenced}} this new form as evidenced {{in the use}} of guitars, keyboards, horns and percussion. At that time too, the society was in nationalist <b>ferment.</b> The Black <b>Power</b> and Rastafarian Movements, with their black pride, pro-African and anti-colonial ideological positions, influenced the young musicians tremendously. This was reflected in the music in terms of band names such as Wafrikai, Black Machine, Black Roots, Black Affairs and Black Blood, a definitive identification with blackness, with Africa. This was reflected in the melody, {{in the use of}} certain instruments such as keyboards, guitars and horns. This was also reflected in lyrical content, the positive, nationalist and social commentary of cadence-lypso. Cadence-lypso reflected and exuded the nationalist ferment of the seventies.|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{estimation of}} ferments is beset by many difficulties {{which do not}} obtain {{in the case of}} substances which can be directly weighed or measured. Since, in the present state of our knowledge, ferments can only be recognized through their effects, and since these effects vary greatly with many conditions, it has been difficult to develop standard methods which possess reasonable accuracy {{and at the same time}} are not too cumbersome. The effects of ferment action vary with the time over which the reaction proceeds, the concentration of the substrate and the concentration of the enzyme as well as with other factors. Most of the methods have been based on the principle of varying one factor while others are kept constant, and the strength of the enzyme is usually expressed in terms of the degree to which the substrate has been effected. The details of the many procedures which have been devised may be read in Oppenheimer's elaborate treatise (1) or in the briefer compendium of Waksman and Davison (2). With regard to pepsin the usual procedure has been to allow decreasing quantities of ferment (gastric juice) to act on a uniform amount of substrate (such as a soluble protein) over a standard length of time and to determine the smallest amount of ferment which completely digests (as digestion may be defined) the unit of substrate. Thus, if 0. 01 cc. of ferment completely digests the unit of substrate it is assumed that 1 cc. of <b>ferment</b> has the <b>power</b> of digesting 100 units. As various workers have shown, however, this assumption is entirely erroneous (3) since activity does not vary in direct proportion to the concentration of ferment. Methods based on this general plan must therefore be discarded. Northrup and Hussey recently have pointed out (4) that the time required to cause a given percentage change in the viscosit...|$|R
40|$|The in-bottle {{fermentation}} of sparkling wines {{is currently}} triggered by few commercialized Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. This lack {{of diversity in}} tirage yeast cultures leads to a prevalent uniformity in sensory profiles of the end products. The {{aim of this study}} has been to exploit the natural multiplicity of yeast populations in order to introduce variability in sparkling wines throughout the re-fermentation step. A collection of 133 S. cerevisiae strains were screened on the basis of technological criteria (<b>fermenting</b> <b>power</b> and vigor, SO 2 tolerance, alcohol tolerance, flocculence) and qualitative features (acetic acid, glycerol and H 2 S productions). These activities allowed the selection of yeasts capable of dominating the in-bottle fermentation in actual cellar conditions: in particular, the performances of FX and FY strains (isolated in Franciacorta area), and OX and OY strains (isolated in Oltrepò Pavese area), were compared to those of habitually used starter cultures (IOC 18 - 2007, EC 1118, Lalvin DV 10), by involving nine wineries belonging to the two Consortia of Appellation of Origin. The microbiological analyses of samples have revealed that the indigenous strains showed an increased latency period and a higher cultivability along the aging time than the commercial starter cultures do. Results of chemical analyses and sensory evaluation of the samples after 18 months sur lies have shown that significant differences (p < 0. 05) were present among the strains for alcoholic strength, carbon dioxide overpressure and pleasantness, whereas they were not observed for residual sugars content, titratable acidity or volatile acidity. Indigenous S. cerevisiae exhibited comparable values respect to the commercial starter cultures. The ANOVA has also proven that the base wine formulation is a key factor, by significantly affecting (p < 0. 01) some oenological parameters of wine, like alcoholic strength, volatile acidity, carbon dioxide overpressure, titratable acidity and dry extract. The use of native yeast strains for the re-fermentation step can be considered a convenient way for introducing differentiation to the final product without modifying the traditional technology. In a perspective of “precision enology,” where the wine is designed on specific vine cultivars and microorganisms, this work underlines that exploring yeast biodiversity is a strategic activity to improve the production...|$|E
50|$|After {{drinking}} a potion {{to seal the}} deal, the host's (in this case Setsuna's) heart will absorb the combined power of the Oni tribe and will <b>ferment</b> increasing that <b>power</b> until it ripens after one year. However, demons {{will be able to}} sense the power and want to eat the heart themselves to gain that power even if the Banrikou Heart isn't fully ripe yet. So to protect the heart and determine who gets to eat it {{at the end of the}} year (thus becoming the new leader of the Oni,) the princesses guard and live with the host for the year with the winner being decided by which one is summoned the most to protect the heart. However, the one summoned is whichever one the host feels or thinks about more at that time. Any demon is allowed to try to steal the heart without it being a crime as the contestants are only considered fit to rule if they can protect the Heart. But while protecting the Heart the contestants can do whatever they please, up to and including death, to any demon making an attempt to steal the Heart. The host has to be human, has to know that they're going to die at the end of the year, be suicidal enough to be willing to die but not so much as to kill themselves before the Heart is harvested, and drink the potion of their own free will without threats or coercion. In exchange they'll (or rather whoever they will it to) receive 10 million Yen once the Heart is harvested. Advanced payment or the contestants using any of their share of the Oni Family money during that year is against clan law. Thus the host has to provide for the contestants out of their own pocket, although receiving money from the contestants earning it by doing jobs is ok.|$|R
