5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hemimetabolous</b> insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are <b>hemimetabolous,</b> metamorphosing {{gradually}} to the adult form. The first two instars, called larvae or nymphs, are like small wingless adults (often confused with springtails) without genitalia; these feed on plant tissue. In the Terebrantia, {{the third and}} fourth instars, and in the Tubulifera also a fifth instar, are non-feeding resting stages similar to pupae: in these stages, the body's organs are reshaped, and wing-buds and genitalia are formed. The adult stage can be reached in around 8–15 days; adults can live for around 45 days. Adults have both winged and wingless forms; in the grass thrips Anaphothrips obscurus, for example, the winged form makes up 90% of the population in spring (in temperate zones), while the wingless form makes up 98% of the population late in the summer. Thrips can survive the winter as adults or through egg or pupal diapause.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemimetabolous,</b> or {{incomplete}} metamorphosis. The terrestrial {{young are}} called nymphs and aquatic young are called naiads. Insect young are usually {{similar to the}} adult. Wings appear as buds on the nymphs or early instars. When the last moult is completed the wings expand to the full adult size, e.g. Order: Odonata (Dragonflies).|$|E
25|$|Head lice, {{like other}} insects {{of the order}} Phthiraptera, are <b>hemimetabolous.</b> Newly hatched nymphs will moult three times before {{reaching}} the sexually-mature adult stage. Thus, mobile head lice populations contain members of up to four developmental stages: three nymphal instars, and the adult (imago). Metamorphosis during head lice development is subtle. The only visible differences between different instars and the adult, other than size, is the relative length of the abdomen, which increases with each molt. Aside from reproduction, nymph behavior {{is similar to the}} adult. Nymphs feed only on human blood (hematophagia), and cannot survive long away from a host.|$|E
25|$|This {{would also}} {{affect the way}} their {{offspring}} looked like in the early instars, resembling earlier ametabolous generations even after they had started {{to adapt to a}} new way of living, in a habitat where they actually could have some good use for flaps along their body. Since they matured {{in the same way as}} thysanurans with plenty of moultings as they were growing and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are <b>hemimetabolous</b> or holometabolous), there probably wasn't much room for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. Also, it would have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E
25|$|So proto-insects had to {{specialize}} and focus their whole existence on improving a single lifestyle {{in a particular}} niche. The older the species and the single individuals became, the more would they differ from their original form as they adapted to their new lifestyles better than the generations before. The final body-structure was no longer achieved while still inside the egg, but continued to develop for most of a lifetime, causing a bigger difference between the youngest and oldest individuals. Assuming that mature individuals most likely mastered their new element better than did the nymphs who had the same lifestyle, it {{would appear to be}} an advantage if the immature members of the species reached adult shape and form as soon as possible. This may explain why they evolved fewer but more intense instars and a stronger focus on the adult body, and with greater differences between the adults and the first instars, instead of just gradually growing bigger as earlier generations had done. This evolutionary trend explains how they went from ametabolous to <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects.|$|E
500|$|Mayflies are <b>hemimetabolous</b> (they have [...] "incomplete metamorphosis"). They {{are unique}} among insects {{in that they}} moult one more time after {{acquiring}} functional wings; this last-but-one winged (alate) instar usually lives {{a very short time}} and is known as a subimago, or to fly fishermen as a dun. Mayflies at the subimago stage are a favourite food of many fish, and many fishing flies are modelled to resemble them. The subimago stage does not survive for long, rarely for more than 24 hours. In some species, it may last for just a few minutes, while the mayflies in the family Palingeniidae have sexually mature subimagos and no true adult form at all.|$|E
500|$|Grasshoppers are insects of the {{suborder}} Caelifera {{within the}} order Orthoptera, which includes crickets {{and their allies}} in the other suborder Ensifera. They are likely the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects, {{dating back to the}} early Triassic around 250 million years ago. Grasshoppers are typically ground-dwelling insects with powerful hind legs which enable them to escape from threats by leaping vigorously. They are <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects (they do not undergo complete metamorphosis) which hatch from an egg into a nymph or [...] "hopper" [...] which undergoes five moults, becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage. At high population densities and under certain environmental conditions, some grasshopper species can change colour and behaviour and form swarms. Under these circumstances they are known as locusts.|$|E
500|$|Mole crickets are <b>hemimetabolous</b> {{meaning they}} undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis; when nymphs hatch from eggs, the nymphs increasingly resemble the adult form {{as they grow}} and pass {{through a series of}} up to ten moults. After mating, there may be a period of one or two weeks before the female starts laying eggs. She burrows into the soil to a depth of , ( [...] has been seen in the laboratory), and lays a clutch of 25 to 60 eggs. Neoscapteriscus females then retire, sealing the entrance passage, but in Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla species, the female has been observed to remain in an adjoining chamber to tend the clutch. Further clutches may follow over several months, according to species. Eggs need to be laid in moist ground and many nymphs die because of insufficient moisture in the soil. The eggs hatch in a few weeks, and as they grow, the nymphs consume a great deal of plant material either underground or on the surface.|$|E
500|$|Earwigs are <b>hemimetabolous,</b> {{meaning they}} undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, developing {{through a series}} of 4 to 6 molts. The developmental stages between molts are called instars. Earwigs live for about a year from hatching. They start mating in the autumn, and can be found together in the autumn and winter. The male and female will live in a chamber in debris, crevices, or soil [...] deep. After mating, the sperm may remain in the female for months before the eggs are fertilized. From midwinter to early spring, the male will leave, or be driven out by the female. Afterward the female will begin to lay 20 to 80 pearly white eggs in 2 days. Some earwigs, those parasitic in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina, are viviparous (give birth to live young); they would be fed by a sort of placenta. When first laid, the eggs are white or cream-colored and oval-shaped, but right before hatching they become kidney-shaped and brown. Each egg is approximately [...] tall and [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Dragonflies are <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects; they do {{not have}} a pupal stage and undergo an {{incomplete}} metamorphosis with a series of nymphal stages from which the adult emerges. Eggs laid inside plant tissues are usually shaped like grains of rice, while other eggs are the size of a pinhead, ellipsoidal, or nearly spherical. A clutch may have as many as 1500 eggs, and they take about a week to hatch into aquatic nymphs or naiads which moult between six and 15 times (depending on species) as they grow. Most of a dragonfly's life is spent as a nymph, beneath the water's surface. The nymph extends its hinged labium (a toothed mouthpart similar to a lower mandible, which is sometimes termed as a [...] "mask" [...] as it is normally folded and held before the face) that can extend forward and retract rapidly to capture prey such as mosquito larvae, tadpoles, and small fish. They breathe through gills in their rectum, and can rapidly propel themselves by suddenly expelling water through the anus. Some naiads, such as the later stages of Antipodophlebia asthenes, hunt on land.|$|E
2500|$|Arthropods {{are known}} to {{regenerate}} appendages following loss or autotomy. Regeneration among arthropods is restricted by molting such that <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects are capable of regeneration only until their final molt whereas most crustaceans can regenerate throughout their lifetimes. [...] Molting cycles are hormonally regulated in arthropods, although premature molting can be induced by autotomy. Mechanisms underlying appendage regeneration in <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects and crustaceans is highly conserved. During limb regeneration species in both taxa form a blastema following autotomy with regeneration of the excised limb occurring during proecdysis. Arachnids, including scorpions, {{are known to}} regenerate their venom, although {{the content of the}} regenerated venom is different than the original venom during its regeneration, as the venom volume is replaced before the active proteins are all replenished.|$|E
5000|$|Like other Orthoptera, Tetrigidae have a <b>hemimetabolous</b> development, {{in which}} eggs hatch into nymphs. Unlike other {{temperate}} Orthoptera, however, temperate Tetrigidae generally overwinter as adults.|$|E
5000|$|The {{entire life}} cycle of the black webspinner is {{typically}} completed within a year. They are a <b>hemimetabolous</b> insect species, meaning that they have incopmlete metamorphosis ...|$|E
5000|$|Euphorines are solitary or rarely gregarious koinobiont endo{{parasitoid}}s. Unlike {{most other}} parasitoid wasps, Euphorinae {{have a broad}} host range and attack adult insects or nymphs of <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} insect forms showed direct development (ametabolism), and {{the evolution}} of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2). Some early ametabolous [...] "true insects" [...] are still present today, such as bristletails and silverfish. <b>Hemimetabolous</b> insects include cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and true bugs. Phylogenetically, all insects in the Pterygota undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult. These insects either have <b>hemimetabolous</b> development, and undergo an incomplete or partial metamorphosis, or holometabolous development, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, including a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} {{have been proposed}} to explain the evolution of holometaboly from hemimetaboly, mostly centering {{on whether or not}} the intermediate <b>hemimetabolous</b> forms are homologous to pupal form of holometabolous forms.|$|E
50|$|C. brunneus are <b>hemimetabolous.</b> Females {{lay eggs}} over a 10-week {{period in the}} soil. Eggs hatch as early as April. Hatchlings {{typically}} go through four nymphal stages before becoming adults. Adults can live into the late autumn.|$|E
50|$|Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are insects with an {{incomplete}} metamorphosis (<b>hemimetabolous).</b> The aquatic larva or nymph hatches from an egg, and develops through eight to seventeen instars {{before leaving the}} water and emerging as the winged adult or imago.|$|E
5000|$|Arthropods {{are known}} to {{regenerate}} appendages following loss or autotomy. Regeneration among arthropods is restricted by molting such that <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects are capable of regeneration only until their final molt whereas most crustaceans can regenerate throughout their lifetimes.

5000|$|Like other termites, the Kalotermitidae are eusocial. However, their caste {{distinction}} is relatively flexible and they lack a true worker caste; instead, pseudergates ("false workers") serve as workers before developing into adult soldiers or alates. The appearance of immature {{workers in the}} Kalotermitidae is possible because of their <b>hemimetabolous</b> lifecycle; these immatures are [...] "false" [...] workers because, unlike in the holometabolous eusocial groups, no pupal stage clearly demarcates immaturity and adulthood, and their role as workers is temporary. Pseudergates can be differentiated from other categories of immatures {{by the absence of}} wing buds (which are already present in most <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects in their first instar) and are not necessarily the only constituent of the general work force in a kalotermitid colony.|$|E
50|$|Whiteflies share a {{modified}} form of <b>hemimetabolous</b> metamorphosis, {{in that the}} immature stages begin life as mobile individuals, but soon attach to host plants. The stage before the adult is called a pupa, though it shares {{little in common with}} the pupal stage of holometabolous insects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemimetabolous,</b> or {{incomplete}} metamorphosis. The terrestrial {{young are}} called nymphs and aquatic young are called naiads. Insect young are usually {{similar to the}} adult. Wings appear as buds on the nymphs or early instars. When the last moult is completed the wings expand to the full adult size, e.g. Order: Odonata (Dragonflies).|$|E
50|$|Zootermopsis nevadensis is {{a species}} of eusocial termite (Isoptera) in the family Termopsidae, a group known as the dampwood termites. It is a <b>hemimetabolous</b> organism. Despite eusociality has evolved {{independently}} from different insect orders, directed by different selection pressures, termites and other eusocial insects from Hymenoptera have evolved similar on the physiological and social fields.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Two {{types of}} {{metamorphosis}} are shown. In a complete (holometabolous) metamorphosis the insect passes through four distinct phases, which produce an adult {{that does not}} resemble the larva. In an incomplete (<b>hemimetabolous)</b> metamorphosis an insect does not go through a full transformation, but instead transitions from a nymph to an adult by molting its exoskeleton as it grows.|$|E
50|$|For most insect species, an instar is the {{developmental}} {{stage of the}} larval forms of holometabolous (complete metamorphism) or nymphal forms of <b>hemimetabolous</b> (incomplete metamorphism) insects, but an instar can be any developmental stage including pupa or imago (the adult, which does not moult in insects).The number of instars an insect undergoes depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Lower temperatures and lower humidity often slow the rate of development.|$|E
50|$|In <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects, {{immature}} stages {{are called}} nymphs. Development proceeds in repeated stages {{of growth and}} ecdysis (moulting); these stages are called instars. The juvenile forms closely resemble adults, but are smaller and lack adult features such as wings and genitalia. The size and morphological differences between nymphs in different instars are small, often just differences in body proportions {{and the number of}} segments; in later instars, external wing buds form.|$|E
50|$|Hemiptera is {{the largest}} order of <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects (not {{undergoing}} complete metamorphosis) containing over 75,000 named species; orders with more species all have a pupal stage, Coleoptera (370,000 described species), Lepidoptera (160,000), Diptera (100,000) and Hymenoptera (100,000). The group is very diverse. The majority of species are terrestrial, including {{a number of important}} agricultural pests, but some are found in freshwater habitats. These include the water boatmen, pond skaters, and giant water bugs.|$|E
50|$|The hog louse spends {{its entire}} life cycle on its host. The life cycle is {{completed}} in about 5 weeks. H. suis are <b>hemimetabolous</b> (gradual metamorphosis). The metamorphosis of hog lice includes 3 nymphal instars. Once hatched, young lice molt {{and move to}} tender areas {{of the body to}} feed. Nymphs tend to remain concentrated near the head region. After 10 days, the lice are sexually mature and ready to begin another life cycle.|$|E
50|$|Mealybugs {{are sexually}} dimorphic: females appear as nymphs, exhibiting reduced morphology, and lack wings, {{although}} unlike many female scale insects, they often retain legs and can move. Males are smaller, gnat-like and have wings. Since mealybugs (as {{well as all}} other Hemiptera) are <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis in the true sense of the word. However, male mealybugs do exhibit a radical change during their life cycle, changing from wingless, ovoid nymphs to wasp-like flying adults.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of most braconids are {{internal}} or external primary parasitoids of other insects, especially the larval stages of Coleoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera, but also some <b>hemimetabolous</b> insects such as aphids, Heteroptera, or Embiidina. Most species kill their hosts, though some cause the hosts to become sterile and less active. Parasitism on adult insects (particularly on Hemiptera and Coleoptera) is also observed. Members of two subfamilies (Mesostoinae and Doryctinae) are known to form galls on plants.|$|E
50|$|The Phasmatodea {{life cycle}} is <b>hemimetabolous,</b> {{proceeding}} {{through a series}} of several nymphal instars. As is the case with hatching, if the nymph is caught in the encasing of a cast skin or egg capsule, it will likely die because it cannot free itself. Once emerged, the nymphs will eat the cast skin. Adulthood is reached for most species after several months and many molts. The lifespan of Phasmatodea varies by species, but ranges from a few months to up to three years.|$|E
5000|$|All three {{categories}} of metamorphosis {{can be found in}} the diversity of insects, including no metamorphosis ("ametaboly"), incomplete or partial metamorphosis ("hemimetaboly"), and complete metamorphosis ("holometaboly"). While ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms (also known as [...] "direct development"), both <b>hemimetabolous</b> and holometabolous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in holometabolus organisms, of a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.|$|E
50|$|Most hemipterans feed on plants, {{using their}} sucking and {{piercing}} mouthparts to extract plant sap. Some are parasitic {{while others are}} predators that feed on other insects or small invertebrates. They live {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, generally terrestrial, though some species are adapted to life in or on the surface of fresh water. Hemipterans are <b>hemimetabolous,</b> with young nymphs that somewhat resemble adults. Many aphids are capable of parthenogenesis, producing young from unfertilised eggs; this helps them to reproduce extremely rapidly in favourable conditions.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was thought}} that they breed both sexually and through parthenogenesis, this however has {{recently}} been proved to not be true. Whilst unmated females will lay eggs, they are infertile. Development takes {{six to nine months}} from egg to adult and life span for the adult is about two years. The first molt occurs at about two weeks [...] Development is <b>hemimetabolous,</b> meaning that there is no metamorphosis between a larval phase and an adult phase. The young are called nymphs, and appear to be small adults.|$|E
