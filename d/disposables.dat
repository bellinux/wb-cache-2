25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily <b>disposables)</b> are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E

40|$|Conventional <b>disposable</b> cups, made of fossil-based {{plastic or}} paper with inner lining of fossil-based plastic, are {{typically}} associated with an unnecessary use of scarce resources and a superfluous production of waste. An alternative has become available in <b>disposable</b> cups from bio-based and biodegradable materials, so-called biocups, made from bioplastic or paper with inner lining of bioplastic. Many stakeholders consider <b>disposable</b> biocups as more environmental friendly than fossil-based <b>disposable</b> cups, though other stakeholders prefer reusable cups over <b>disposable</b> cups.
