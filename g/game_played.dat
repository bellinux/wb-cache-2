40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between pass-set-attack sequences to {{the total number of}} sequence opportunities ratios for in-class <b>game</b> <b>play</b> and after-class <b>game</b> <b>play</b> in volleyball. University students enrolled in two co-educational beginning volleyball classes were used for this study. Each game was videotaped and then analyzed using the number of pass-set-attack sequences to total opportunities. A t-test was used to determine if a difference existed between both in-class and after-class games. The result of this study indicated that when both in-class <b>game</b> <b>play</b> and after-class <b>game</b> <b>play</b> were analyzed by total pass-set-attack sequences to total sequence opportunities ratios, after-class <b>game</b> <b>play</b> produced more pass-set-attack sequences than in-class <b>game</b> <b>play.</b> This study led me to conclude that offensive and defensive strategies should be kept as simple as possible until skills can be used appropriately and consistently in <b>game</b> <b>play</b> situations.

40|$|Internet gaming {{disorder}} is currently {{listed in the}} DSM—not in order to diagnose such a disorder but to encourage research to investigate this phenomenon. Even whether it is still questionable if Internet Gaming Disorder exists and can be judged {{as a form of}} addiction, problematic <b>game</b> <b>play</b> is already very well researched to cause problems in daily life. Approaches trying to predict problematic tendencies in digital <b>game</b> <b>play</b> have mainly focused on playing time as a diagnostic criterion. However, motives to engage in digital <b>game</b> <b>play</b> and obsessive passion for <b>game</b> <b>play</b> have also been found to predict problematic <b>game</b> <b>play</b> but have not yet been investigated together. The present study aims at (1) analyzing if obsessive passion can be distinguished from problematic <b>game</b> <b>play</b> as separate concepts, and (2) testing motives of <b>game</b> <b>play,</b> passion, and playing time for their predictive values for problematic tendencies. We found (N = 99 males, Age: M = 22. 80, SD = 3. 81) that obsessive passion can be conceptually separated from problematic <b>game</b> <b>play.</b> In addition, the results suggest that compared to solely playing time immersion as playing motive and obsessive passion have added predictive value for problematic <b>game</b> <b>play.</b> The implications focus on broadening the criteria in order to diagnose problematic playing...|$|R

5|$|There {{had been}} a degree of cross-fertilization between Canadian and American leagues earlier in the 20th century. A number of CFL–NFL interleague games were held in Canada. As well, eleven neutral-site CFL games have been played on American soil. The {{earliest}} of these dates to 1909, while the bulk occurred between 1951 and 1967. The 1909 game, featuring the Ottawa Rough Riders and Hamilton Tigers, {{was sponsored by the}} New York Herald and played at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx; this in the era when the Canadian game was more similar to rugby football and did not feature modern rules such as the forward pass. The next game, a 1951 match-up between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts in Buffalo, was billed as the first true all-Canadian <b>game</b> <b>played</b> in the United States and drew more than 18,000, a decent crowd for the era. In 1958, Hamilton defeated Ottawa in a regular-season contest in front about 15,000 in Philadelphia's cavernous Municipal Stadium, 24–18. It remains the only CFL <b>game</b> <b>played</b> outside Canada, involving two Canadian teams, that actually counted in the standings.|$|E
