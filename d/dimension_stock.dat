40|$|A {{tolerance}} chart is {{an effective}} tool {{used to determine the}} working dimensions and tolerances in process planning. Its kernel are the tolerance chains among the machining cuts through which the component will be manufactured. Identifying tolerance chains is a painstaking job. In this paper, a coordinate system is set up for the component in question so that all surfaces of the component are expressed with their coordinates and the tolerance chart is parameterised. Then an object-oriented model is developed so that each blueprint dimension is represented as a blueprint object while each working dimension is expressed as a machining-cut object. Each object has a special attribute, the surface chain, which is made up of all surfaces involved in the tolerance chart. The surface-chain model is very helpful in identifying the tolerance chains. By establishing the linear equations of the working <b>dimensions,</b> the <b>stock</b> removals and the blueprint dimensions, the tolerance chains among the machining cuts are derived automatically. The working dimensions and tolerances then can be determined easily once the tolerance chains are identified. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{automatic}} vine detection from airborne Infrared Color (IRC) images is addressed. An automatic method was designed, {{based on a}} separate modeling of the textural and spectral information extracted from the data. A multi-resolution analysis associated with a wavelet transform allows the separation of spectral and spatial information. After {{a description of the}} vine detection problem, the automatic method is described. An example application is proposed and a quantitative evaluation of the results achieved is presented. The analysis of the results demonstrates the efficiency of the method. The square system of planting is the main source of errors. But this growing technique is now nearly abandoned in France due to mechanization. Thus, this method may help photointerpreters in the updating or definition of agricultural registers of vineyards as defined by the European Commission. Background The automatic characterization of heterogeneous environ-ments with regular structures are of interest for cultures such as orchards, vineyards, and market gardens, and is of tremen-dous importance for the establishment and the survey of national or European registers. The diversity of objects that compose these environments (plants, soil, shadow, grass, stones, and organic residues) makes it a very complex process. This paper focuses on automatic vine detection. This problem is representative, at an easily accessible scale in the field, of the complexity of these environments. Only a few studies have been conducted in the field of remote sensing for vine detection (Riom, 1992). Boissard (1972; 1973) has shown that the textural and structural elements in avine parcel can be accessed by the Fou-rier transformation of airborne photographs. These elements lead to the characterization of the stocks of vine and of their structure (orientation of the rows, distance between the <b>stocks,</b> <b>dimension</b> of the <b>stocks,</b> and leaves).

Programs of exploration for porphyry ore de-posits can clearly benefit from the application of a model of this sort.

40|$|Fish {{stocks have}} an {{important}} role in providing cheap protein food, income and employment to millions of people in the world. Judicious management and exploitation of the renewable fish resources is important for sustained production over years. Over fishing leads to disappearance of the renewable fish stocks. Assessment of fish stocks is the first step to determine the level of exploitation necessary for arriving at maximum sustainable yields from the fish resources. Assessment of stocks and study of impact of present level of exploitation on exploited stocks are necessary for maintenance of stocks at maximum sustainable level. Many mathematical and statistical models have been developed and used for fish stock assessment studies. The unique features of fish stocks are, they do not come under visual horizon for direct evaluation of stock sizes, their distribution over space, time and species varies at higher <b>dimension</b> and fish <b>stocks</b> are affected by fishery dependent factors such as effort exerted, size at first capture and fishery independent factors like salinity, temperature, water current etc. The models to study fish stocks should consider the three aspects namely, size of the stock, level of exploitation and effect of fishery independent factors.

The study focused {{on the development of}} inventory management processes for laboratory consumables. The pharmaceutical R&D process is characterized by a dynamic project portfolio, which results in a great diversity of stock-keeping-units, low repeat order rates and high variability in consumption rates. These factors create significant challenges for the design of inventory management processes. We first present an assessment and diagnosis of the current state of inventory management at NIBR, using data gathered from various NIBR sites as well as other companies. We discuss underlying drivers that influence current behavior, and identify opportunities for improvement. We then develop alternative models for inventory management and compare these models along several <b>dimensions</b> such as <b>stock</b> room location & control, inventory ownership and replenishment options. We recommend the use of consolidated department level stock rooms as the most suitable option for NIBR. Detailed implementation plans are then developed and validated through a case study.
