2500|$|When a [...] "viscous" [...] damper {{is added}} to the model this outputs a force that is {{proportional}} to the velocity of the mass.

2500|$|The {{solution}} to this equation depends {{on the amount of}} damping. [...] If the damping is small enough, the system still vibrates—but eventually, over time, stops vibrating.

40|$|Added-mass (alpha) and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> (beta) of a {{tethered}} spherical float undergoing oscillatory {{motion in}} sinusoidal waves, have been {{derived from the}} motion generated velocity potential for one degree-of-freedom (surge) using potential flow theory. Variations of added-mass and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> with respect to water depth, wave period and float size have been obtained. Variations of added-mass and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> with wave period show that these hydrodynamic coefficients are frequency dependent, and this is because motion generated velocity potential {{is associated with the}} generation of surface gravity waves by the oscillating float. The added-mass and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> are unaffected by water depth, but increase with size of the float.

40|$|Abstract. Vibrations {{of a mass}} are {{analyzed}} when the mass is connected with the support in succession of two elastic elements characterized by stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients.</b> It is demonstrated that upon harmonic excitation of the mass and considering different values of stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> the system can respond differently {{in comparison to the}} case when the mass is connected to the support by means of single elastic element. Reduction of stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> of a pair of elements to a single one (as it is proposed in calculations of considered systems) can lead to incorrect results.

2500|$|When {{dealing with}} rubber {{components}} with mold bonded metal sleeves, swaging {{provides a more}} controlled and cost-effective alternative to 'shooting' the rubber part into a metal sleeve, where an intensive and less dependable secondary operation is needed to finish the product. [...] A metal can with a bonding component (such as phosphate) is painted to the inside diameter, and molten rubber is injected into the metal sleeve. This creates a product that when cooled may be swaged to the desired size. [...] The second {{reason for this is}} that the product is more reliable, and during the swaging process the rubber is more relaxed when the outside can to which the rubber is bonded has its diameter reduced, changing the springrate (K) values and <b>damping</b> <b>coefficient</b> (C) of the rubber. [...] After swaging, any inconsistencies in the metal and rubber have been minimized.|$|E

A mechanism for creating a single vertical dust string is described. It is shown that the oscillation amplitudes, resonance frequencies, <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients,</b> and oscillation phases of the dust particles separate into two distinct groups.

40|$|This paper generalizes {{existing}} {{approaches for}} free-surface wave damping via momentum sinks for flow simulations {{based on the}} Navier-Stokes equations. It is shown in 2 D flow simulations that, to obtain reliable wave <b>damping,</b> the <b>coefficients</b> in the <b>damping</b> functions must be adjusted to the wave parameters. A scaling law for selecting these <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> is presented, which enables similarity of the damping in model- and full-scale. The influence of {{the thickness of the}} damping layer, the wave steepness, the mesh fineness and the choice of the <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> are examined. An efficient approach for estimating the optimal damping setup is presented. Results of 3 D ship resistance computations show that the scaling laws apply to such simulations as well, so the <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> should be adjusted for every simulation to ensure convergence of the solution in both model and full scale. Finally, practical recommendations for the setup of reliable damping in flow simulations with regular and irregular free surface waves are given.

40|$|The {{mass and}} {{stiffness}} {{of the upper}} and lower structures of a powerhouse are different. As such, the first two vibration modes mostly indicate the dynamic characteristics of the upper structure, and the precise seismic response of a powerhouse is difficult to obtain on the basis of Rayleigh <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> acquired using the fundamental frequencies of this structure. The damping ratio of each mode is relatively accurate when the least square method is used, but the accuracy of the damping ratios that contribute substantially to seismic responses is hardly ensured. The error of dynamic responses may even be amplified. In this study, modes that greatly influence these responses are found on the basis of mode participation mass, and Rayleigh <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> are obtained. Seismic response distortion attributed to large differences in Rayleigh <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> because of improper modal selection is avoided by using the proposed method, which is also simpler and more accurate than the least square method. Numerical experiments show that the damping matrix determined by using the Rayleigh <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> identified by our method is closer to the actual value and the seismic response of the powerhouse is more reasonable than that revealed through the least square method...|$|R
