However, Goebbels acceded to Harlan's insistence on rewriting the script and Harlan spent from November 1939 to March 1940 revising the script although he kept much of what Metzger and Möller had written.|$|E

A prodigy, she built Koboi Laboratories, a technology company, which she used to crush her father's company. Featured in several of the Artemis Fowl books as the main antagonist. She detests Foaly, as he won a science competition in college over her, and she believes the judges chose Foaly instead <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> male.

25|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny – that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers – {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorised to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; if the voter cast a vote at a general election in more than one electoral division; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicised or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

The headline screamed, [...] "Wear yellow and die," [...] and was accompanied by photos of the mob beating Salcedo to death.

2500|$|The Italian {{national}} Anti-mafia Prosecutor, Piero Grasso, {{said that}} Mattarella was killed because [...] "he {{was trying to}} accomplish a new political and administrative project, a true revolution, which, through a deep change {{in the management of}} the Region, aimed at breaking well established relations between bureaucracy, politics, business and the mafia. His policy of radical moralization of public life, {{based on the idea that}} Sicily needed to present itself with 'the papers in order', had upset the system of public procurement, with stunning moves, never seen before in the Island". Judge Giancarlo Caselli, Chief Prosecutor in Palermo for many years, described Mattarella as [...] "a honest and courageous Christian democrat, killed <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> honest and courageous".|$|E
2500|$|During the trial, Safarov's lawyers {{attempted}} {{to convince the}} judge {{that he had an}} unstable mind, and claimed that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. They argued that he had gone through psychological trauma during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. However, this contradicted a statement Safarov had made when he said he had been studying in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku and in Turkey from 1992 to 1996. A mental health examination conducted by an Azerbaijani doctor concluded that he was not [...] "entirely sane." [...] Another examination found that Safarov was of stable mind {{at the time of the}} murder, and the judge chose to believe this assessment. An Azerbaijani physician alleged, based on his supposed personal conversations with Safarov, that his motives stemmed from his belief that Margaryan had insulted (in some versions, that he had urinated on) the Azerbaijani flag in front of other participants in the NATO seminar. However, in both his interrogation and his court trial Safarov said he murdered Margaryan <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an Armenian. No witnesses were ever called by the defense during the trial to corroborate these allegations in court and prosecution lawyers strongly disputed that they had taken place.|$|E

2500|$|The Prince {{from the}} 2008 reboot was well {{received}} by video game critics, but criticized by {{fans of the}} series, whose main complaint was the performance of North in the role. In {{an article about the}} sexuality of the Prince of Persia reboot, Gamasutra editor Tom Cross stated that he finds the rejection of both the game and its protagonist incomprehensible. He compared Uncharted protagonist Nathan Drake to the Prince, stating that it was not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> voiced by , but also because the sexual tension that [...] holds reminded him of the prince. He addressed the criticism of his voice, stating that people found it annoying and improper for him to sound so much like a Han Solo-type character considering the video game is located in the Middle East. Cross found this criticism unfair, arguing that no one criticized female protagonist Elika's North American accent and added that the prince was a harder character to like than Nathan Drake, due to him being an [...] "unrepentant jerk" [...] instead of a [...] "lovable jerk," [...] but that merely makes him a harder sell.|$|E
2500|$|Atlantis and Máscara Dorada defeateed La Pestre con Amour when Máximo {{tried to}} kiss Atlantis to {{distract}} him, {{but ended up}} kissing Mr. Niebla instead, distracting Mr. Niebla so he lost to a quick roll-up and pinfall. The most talked about storyline of the evening {{took place in the}} second quarter final match as Místico and Averno took on Volador Jr. and El Terrible. Up until that night Místico and Volador Jr. (Along with La Sombra had formed a trio called [...] "Super Sky Team", but on the night of January 22 that partnership ended in a surprising fashion. During the match Místico wrestled a much more aggressive, Rudo style especially when in the ring with Volador Jr. Mistico would tear up Volador's mask and win by cheating. Following the match Místico kept attacking Volador Jr. The semi-final match once again saw Místico continue his newly found Rudo ways, tearing at Máscara Dorada's mask and wrestling a more brutal style than he usually wrestled. In the end Atlantis forced Averno to submit to win a place in the finals of the match. Initially it was thought that Místico's rudo tactics were <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> teamed up with Averno, leaving his true aliegeance up in the air at that moment.|$|E
