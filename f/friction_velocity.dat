To investigate the circulation over such slopes, a Boussinesq fluid is adopted and a constant eddy diffusivity parameterization is assumed for small-scale mixing. The equations of motion are scaled to determine the range of slopes over which a strong local circulation due to slope winds can exist. For nighttime conditions, the estimated range compares well with the observed range of slopes favored by coalesced dark streaks. For daytime conditions, the slope wind solution is not valid.

40|$|The {{viscous flow}} field near {{the surface of a}} {{hovering}} rotor blade was studied for blade twist distributions typical of a till rotor blade and a conventional helicopter rotor blade. Three blade geometries were studied, including a tilt rotor blade twist distribution (baseline), conventional helicopter rotor blade twist distribution, and the baseline twist distribution with 2 deg of precone. The results give insight into the delayed stall phenomenon often observed for highly twisted rotors. Calculations were performed for a high thrust condition near stall using the thin-layer Navier-Stokes CFD code TURNS. Effects of built-in twist on section force coefficients, skin <b>friction,</b> <b>velocities,</b> surface pressures, and boundary layer shape factor are discussed. Although the rotor thrust coefficient was nominally the same for the cases using the two twist distributions, large differences were found in the section in-plane and normal force coefficients. These preliminary results imply that the blade outboard region, rather than the inboard region, provides the majority of the performance advantage of the baseline case over the low twist case.

For physical crusts damaged by wind the size of erodible crust pieces is important along with the roughness. The presence of cyanobacteriallichen soil crusts roughens the surface, and the biological fibrous growth aggregates soil particles.

40|$|Biological soil crusts, {{consisting}} of cyanobacteria, green algae, lichens, and mosses, {{are important in}} stabilizing soils in semi-arid and arid lands. Integrity of these crusts is compromised by compressional disturbances such as foot, vehicle, or livestock traffic. Using a portable wind tunnel, we found threshold <b>friction</b> <b>velocities</b> (TFVs) of undisturbed crusts well above wind forces experienced at these sites; consequently, these soils are not vulnerable to wind erosion. However, recently disturbed soils or soils with less well-developed crusts frequently experience wind speeds that exceed the stability thresholds of the crusts. Crustal biomass is concentrated in the top 3 mm of soils. Sandblasting by wind can quickly remove this material, thereby reducing N and C inputs from these organisms.
