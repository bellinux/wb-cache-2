This was preceded in 1946 by the Bhore Commission that recommended basic health services be provided for all through Primary Health Centres (PHCs). In line with the recommendations, PHCs were set up all across the country, <b>each</b> <b>serving</b> <b>about</b> 30, 000 inhabitants in its vicinity. At the time, the urban population of India was less than 18 per cent. Since then, the urban population has grown over fourfold to 285 million of over the 1 billion people living in India. 22. 6 per cent of this 285 million live in slums (GOI 2001). As {{in the case of}} health services, provision of education for all in India has also largely been envisaged within the public delivery system even though this sector has a significant presence of private providers. Since independence the government has launched various schemes and programmes for increasin...|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{wireless}} ad hoc network with n nodes distributed uniformly on [0, 1] 2. The transport capacity (TC) of such {{a wireless}} network scales like n. To achieve this, <b>each</b> node should <b>serve</b> <b>about</b> n distinct information flows. So the routing table of each node should be of the order n bits.

30|$|The dental {{technicians}} {{who responded}} to this questionnaire have {{an average of about}} 17  years of experience in the field, indicating that they possess an adequate level of fabrication experience. In light of the reality that dental implant treatment is a comparatively new field, these personnel can be proficient with digital techniques as they differ from past generations of technicians who practiced the craft. On average, <b>each</b> dental technician <b>serves</b> <b>about</b> 36.5 customers, although that number varies depending on the scale of the fabrication lab at which they work. While implant laboratory work consists of complex processes, the fees are high, and labs generate a stable flow of revenue given a constant stream of work requests (Q 1).|$|R

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, war and {{political}} upheaval had left Cambodia with lim-ited health care infrastructure, especially in rural areas. The numbers of paramedical and management staff were adequate, but training {{and quality of}} care were inconsistent, and morale was low (Bhushan, Keller, and Schwartz 2002). The primary health care system was unable to deliver an adequate level of services. For example, only 39 percent of children between 12 and 23 months of age were fully immunized (NIS and ORC Macro 2000). To address these issues, the Cambodian government obtained a loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the restructuring and broad-ening of the primary health care system through {{the development and implementation}} by the Ministry of Health of a coverage plan modeled on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The plan included the con-struction or rehabilitation of health centers, <b>each</b> designed to <b>serve</b> <b>about</b> 10, 000 people, and the merger of small administrative districts into opera-tional districts with an average population of about 150, 000. It also defined a minimum package of activities for health centers. This consisted of basic preventive and curative services, including immunization, birth spacing, antenatal care, provision of micronutrients, and simple curative care for diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, and tuberculosis...|$|R
