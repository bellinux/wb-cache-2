50|$|The code of PowerMILL {{originates}} {{from the}} software DUCT which {{was developed in}} 1973 by Donald Welbourn and Ed Lambourne along {{with the help of}} <b>Delta</b> <b>Metal</b> Group, whose funding aided the transferral of the system into industry. DUCT was initially developed with the sponsorship of Control Data in Germany in the form of access to their time-sharing computing resources. The advancement of mini computers from 1982 meant that it became economically viable to design complex 3D shapes using a computer.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, {{surviving}} industries were mainly concentrated on the western side of the peninsula, between the river and the A102 Blackwall Tunnel southern approach road. They included Alcatel, a Tunnel Refiners/Amylum glucose plant (from 1976 until about 2008 part of Tate & Lyle) which closed in 2009, and two large marine aggregate terminals on the <b>Delta</b> <b>Metals</b> and Victoria Deep Water Terminal sites. One of the two gas holders also remains.|$|R
50|$|Another notable vessel {{delivered}} in 1897 {{was not significant}} in size, but the customer and structure makes it noteworthy. It was small steamship Peterhof, ordered by the Russian czar Nikolai II, who used it for travelling between the capital and Peterhof Palace. The ship was almost entirely built from brass alloy called <b>delta</b> <b>metal,</b> anti-magnetic material, which would not activate potential naval mines set by terrorists. The structures on the deck were decorated by gold plated mouldings. The ship was 61' long, 10.5* wide and its draught was 5'2". The 185-hp steam engine gave speed of 13 knots.|$|E
50|$|Vigier {{produces}} {{all their}} instruments in France. Vigier makes each guitar or bass {{in three to}} five months—partly by hand and partly with machines. Woods—such as alder, maple, and ash—come from French forests. Rosewood and mahogany are imported from India and Honduras respectively. Pre-cut raw wood logs are sorted and dried naturally for three to seven years to achieve the desired moisture content. Bodies and necks are drawn on the blanks using templates—then cut, dried, and stored in a controlled environment. In addition to wood, Vigier uses other materials such as copper and steel alloys (<b>Delta</b> <b>metal</b> and iMetal) and Phenowood, a resin-based composite material.|$|E
50|$|The son of Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote, Inskip succeeded to the Viscountcy on {{the death}} of his father in 1947. Educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, he served in the RNVR during World War II gaining the DSC. When peace {{returned}} he was a Lecturer in Electrical Engineering at Cambridge University and after that Managing Director of English Electric Aviation. He was instrumental in setting up the British Aircraft Corporation and also Chairman of the <b>Delta</b> <b>Metal</b> Company and Investors in Industry.

50|$|The {{peninsula}} was steadily industrialised {{from the}} early 19th century onwards. In 1857 a plan was presented to Parliament for a huge dock occupying much of the peninsula, connected to Greenwich Reach {{to the west and}} Bugsby's Reach to the east, but this came to nothing. Early industries included Henry Blakeley's Ordnance Works making heavy guns, with other sites making chemicals, submarine cables, iron boats, iron and steel. Henry Bessemer built a steel works in the early 1860s to supply the London shipbuilding industry, but this closed {{as a result of a}} fall in demand due to the financial crisis of 1866. Later came oil mills, shipbuilding (for example the 1870 clippers Blackadder and Hallowe'en built by Maudslay), boiler making, manufacture of Portland cement and linoleum (Bessemer's works became the Victoria linoleum works) and the South Metropolitan Gas company's huge East Greenwich Gas Works. Early in the 20th century came bronze manufacturers <b>Delta</b> <b>Metals</b> and works making asbestos and 'Molassine Meal' animal feed.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1860s, Priddy's Hard {{ordnance}} depot had an [...] gauge manually-propelled tramway installed {{for moving}} powder and ammunition from 'C' Magazine through the Laboratory complex. Known as the 'powder line', it {{grew into a}} single line system with spurs into all magazines, explosives stores, cartridge filling rooms, and landing sheds. It extended out on the New Powder Pier in a double line. The rails were made of <b>delta</b> <b>metal,</b> an alloy of copper and zinc, (brass) plus a little iron, as a precaution against sparks; they were grooved rails (set flush with ground level). In 1904 it had 78 trucks. In time it was largely superseded by the [...] narrow gauge line; but part continued in use inside some workshops and stores to about 1960.|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in the following pages was carried out at various sites in the Rod Division of the <b>Delta</b> <b>Metal</b> Company. Extensive variation {{in the level of}} activity in the industry during the years 1974 to I 975 had led to certain inadequacies being observed 1 n the traditional cost control procedure. In an attempt to remedy this situation it was suggested that a method be found of constructing a system to improve the flexibility of cost control procedures. The work involved an assimilation of the industrial and financial environment via pilot studies which would later prove invaluable to home in on the really interesting and important areas. Weaknesses in the current systems which came to light made the methodology of data collection and the improvement of cost control and profit planning procedures easier to adopt. Because of the requirements of the project to investigate the implications of Cost behaviour for profit planning and control, the next stage of the research work was to utilise the on-site experience to examine at a detailed level the nature of cost behaviour. The analysis of factory costs then showed that certain costs, which were the most significant exhibited a stable relationship with respect to some known variable, usually a specific measure of Output. These costs were then formulated in a cost model, to establish accurate standards in a complex industrial setting in order to provide a meaningful comparison against which to judge actual performance. The necessity of a cost model was •reinforced {{by the fact that the}} cost behaviour found to exist was, in the main, a step function, and this complex cost behaviour, the traditional cost and profit planning procedures could not possibly incorporate. Already implemented from this work is the establishment of the post of information officer to co-ordinate data collection and information provision...|$|E
40|$|This volume {{provides}} an illustrated {{catalogue of the}} metalwork (weapons, personal ornaments and tools) and metalworking evidence from the later Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Periods from the key site of Tell el-Dab’a XV a in the eastern Nile Delta. Through extensive discussion of both parallels and contrasts, the main groups of material are set {{in the context of}} the metalwork styles characteristic of both Egypt and the east Mediterranean during the first half of the second millennium BC. Discussion of the form and technology of the metallurgical remains - moulds, ingots, crucibles, tuyeres and industrial waste - illuminates the nature of metal processing on the site, and provides evidence of the relationship between types of mould and specific products. Data on the chemical composition of a range of silver and copper-alloy artefacts demonstrates that the relationship between form and alloy is complex, and is not solely determined by mechanical concerns. The evidence highlights various characteristics of the metal industry in the Nile Delta, which render it distinctive from those of both the Levant and the Nile Valley. Stylistic analysis highlights the extent to which metalwork characteristic of the Delta drew its ultimate inspiration from forms documented in north-west Syria during the EB IV period. This is not to argue that common styles indicate common meanings. Rather, a combined consideration of style, technology and context facilitates discussion of the role of metal artefacts in symbolic communication. Thus metalwork is seen in terms of its place within specific local cultural practices. Given the strong connections of the acquisition of raw materials and the production and consumption of metalwork to the political economy, both stylistic developments and differential access to specific classes of artefact are seen as being implicated in the creation of social difference, through systems of elite representation, and thus to symbolic dimensions of power. It is argued that the evidence from Tell el-Dab’a XV represents merely one element in a wider process which entailed the appropriation and recontextualisation in various parts of the east Mediterranean during the late third and earlier second millennia BC, of styles of elite representation originating in third millennium Syria. In the <b>Delta,</b> <b>metal</b> artefacts gained a particular significance through their linkage to specific ways representing elite male status. The reproduction over a number of generations of this distinctive local system of meaning contributed to the marked emphasis upon the deposition of elements such as warrior equipment and equids in mortuary contexts. The close similarity between metalwork produced in the Delta and that occurring in the southern Levant, if understood as connected with common modes of expressing high status, may be a material indicator of regional political networks. ...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of optical}} spectroscopies to study {{surfaces}} is hindered by {{the difficulty of}} disentangling bulk and surface contributions to the signal. According to Fresnel formulae, the a and p reflectances R of a semi-infinite system obey the simple relation Delta = R-s(2) - R-p = 0 when the incidence angle is 45 degrees. Deviations from this result {{can be related to}} microscopic surface contributions to R. In this paper we study theoretically <b>Delta</b> for <b>metal</b> surfaces. For a semi-infinite nat jellium we obtain the contributions to Delta from electronic excitations at the surface.

40|$|The {{thermoelectric}} {{properties of}} bismuth telluride based thermoelectric (TE) materials are well-characterized, but comparatively {{little has been}} published on the thermomechanical properties. In this paper, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry data for bismuth telluride based TE materials is presented. The TE materials' tan delta values, indicative of viscoelastic energy dissipation modes, approached that of glassy or crystalline polymers, were greater than ten times the tan <b>delta</b> of structural <b>metals,</b> and reflected the anisotropic nature of TE materials. DMA thermal scans showed changes in mechanical properties versus temperature with clear hysteresis effects.

Exceptional agreement between calculation and experiment defines a path forward for understanding {{electronic structure}} aspects of Pu based materials. The photoemission results show two separate regions of 5 f electron spectral intensity, one at the Fermi energy and another centered 1. 2 eV below the Fermi level. The results for PuCoGa 5 clearly indicate 5 f electron behavior on the threshold between localized and itinerant. Comparisons to <b>delta</b> phase Pu <b>metal</b> show a broader framework for understanding the fundamental electronic properties of the Pu 5 f levels in general within two configurations, one localized and one itinerant.

40|$|Properties of a {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) RNA ribozyme system, {{which consists}} of three RNA oligomer strands (substrate 8 -mer; enzyme 16 -mer plus 35 -mer) and contains a hybrid sequence of genomic and antigenomic RNA cores, are reported. Effects of Mg 2 + concentration, divalent metal ion species, pH, and temperature on the cleavage activity were examined. The substrate cleavage activity increased with increasing Mg 2 + concentra-tion (0 - 100 mM). Ca 2 + and Mn 2 + ions were the most effective divalent cations and Mg 2 * was less effective. The cleavage activity increased with increasing pH (5 - 7. 5). The optimum temperature for the cleavage activity was 25 - 40 'C. The Mg*+ concentration, pH and temperature dependencies {{are different from those}} reported for the single-strand ribozymes (about 90 -mer) although the divalent metal ion preference is very similar. Conformational change induced by Mg 2 + ion titration was monitored by CD. The CD data and the activity-Mg*+ concentration data were analyzed by curve-fitting analysis using equations derived for multiple metal ion binding mechanisms. The data can be explained by a model in which three Mg 2 + ions bind to one ribozyme unit. Key words: hepatitis <b>delta</b> virus, <b>metal</b> binding, oligonucleotide, ribozyme, RNA...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} magnetic properties of a magnetic <b>metal</b> <b>delta</b> layer embedded into a nonmagnetic nondegenerated semiconductor, {{taking into account the}} diffusion smearing, that is unavoidable in the case of delta doping. The system of interest is modeled by the delta layer core, enriched in metal atoms, and a nearly depleted smeared periphery. Confinement states in the form of two-dimensional spin-polarized subbands within the semiconductor band gap arise from potential and exchange scattering of carriers at the core. The mechanism of indirect exchange between impurity spins placed within the peripheral region of the delta layer, via partially occupied confinement states, is analyzed. It is shown that, {{in the case of a}} ferromagnetic core, the impurity spins align parallel or antiparallel to the core magnetization, due to the polarization of carriers in the confinement states. Allowing for the confinement mechanism of interaction between the impurity spins as well as for the exchange mechanism through deep levels of the semiconductor host, the magnetic configuration of the impurity spins in the peripheral region of the delta layer is obtained in the framework of a phenomenological approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{complexation}} reactions between Ag- and {{a series}} of enantiopure ligands belonging to the CHIRAGEN (from CHIRAlity GENerator) family (L 1, L 2, L 3, based on (-) - 5, 6 -pinene bipyridine) have been studied in solution. It has been shown that the length of the bridge plays a fundamental role in the self-assembly processes leading to different compounds: mononuclear complexes (with L 3), mixtures of polynuclear complexes (with L 2) and circular helicates (with L 1). Although the absolute configuration of the chiral centres in all three ligands is the same, the metal-centred chirality of L 3 (delta) is inverted with respect to that in the other two complexes with L 1 and L 2 (<b>delta).</b> The <b>metal</b> configuration is thus opposite in the mononuclear complex with respect to the polynuclear species. Detailed thermodynamic studies were carried out for the Ag+ and L 1 ligand system by 1 H and 109 Ag NMR spectroscopy (as a function of concentration, temperature and pressure). At low temperature and high pressure, the [Ag 6 L 1 (6) ] 6 + hexanuclear circular helicate forms a tetranuclear circular helicate [Ag 4 L 1 (4) ] 4 +: 2 [Ag 6 L 1 (6) ] 6 + 3 [Ag 4 L 1 (4) ] 4 +. The thermodynamics parameters, obtained by temperature and pressure variation, have the following values: K 298 = (8. 7 +/- 0. 7) x 10 (- 5) mol x kg(- 1), deltaHo = - 15. 65 +/- 0. 8 kJ x mol(- 1), deltaSo = - 130. 2 +/- 3 J x mol(- 1) x K(- 1) and deltaVo(256 K) = - 160 +/- 12 cm 3 x mol(- 1). The reaction volume calculated according to Connolly's method indicates that the calculated structure of [Ag 4 L 1 (4) ] 4 + is plausible. Both the signs and large magnitudes of deltaSo and deltaVo are counterintuitive, yet can be understood by modelling methods...|$|R
40|$|Elbow {{assemblies}} {{and adjacent}} piping from the loops A and B core spray injection lines of Quad Cities Units 1 and 2 Boiling Water Reactors {{have been examined}} {{in order to determine}} the nature and causes of coolant leakages and flaw indications detected during hydrostatic tests and subsequent ultrasonic inspections. The elbow assemblies were found to contain multiple intergranular cracks in the weld heat-affected zones. The cracking was predominantly axial in orientation in the forged elbow and wedge components, whereas mixed axial and circumferential cracking was seen in the wrought piping pieces. In at least two instances, axial cracks completely penetrated the circumferential weld joining adjacent components. Based upon the observations made in the present study, the failures were attributed to intergranular stress corrosion cracking caused by the weld-induced sensitized microstructure and residual stresses present; dissolved oxygen in the reactor coolant apparently served as the corrosive species. The predominantly axial orientation of the cracks present in the forged components is believed to be related to the banded microstructure present in these components. The metallographic studies reported are supplemented by x-radiography, chemical analysis and mechanical test results, determinations of the degree of sensitization present, and measurements of weld <b>metal</b> <b>delta</b> ferrite content...|$|R
40|$|Density {{functional}} {{theory is}} {{used to determine the}} electronic structures, geometries, and periodic trends in metal-metal bonding in the homo- and heterobimetallic d(3) d(3) edge-shared systems M(2) Cl(10) (4 -), M(2) Cl(6) (PH(3)) (4), and M(2) Cl(6) (H(2) PCH(2) PH(2)) (2) (M = Cr, Mo, W). The much shorter metal-metal distances in these complexes relative to M(2) Cl(10) (4 -) (M = Mo, W) are shown to arise solely from electronic differences between chlorine and phosphine donors. Due to inversion of the delta and delta orbitals, the complexes M(2) Cl(6) (PH(3)) (4) and M(2) Cl(6) (H(2) PCH(2) PH(2)) (2) (M = Mo, W) are found to possess formal metal-metal double bonds. The periodic trends in metal-metal bonding in these systems are rationalized in terms of the energetic contributions of orbital overlap (DeltaE(ovlp)) and spin polarization (DeltaE(spe)). The reduction in DeltaE(spe) and increase in DeltaE(ovlp) on replacement of axial chlorides with phosphine both favor stronger metal-metal bonding in the phosphine-based complexes. The strong linear dependence observed between DeltaE(spe) and DeltaE(ovlp) enables the metal-metal bonding in these systems to be predicted simply from single-ion spin-polarization energies. The antiferromagnetic coupling in M(2) Cl(6) (H(2) PCH(2) PH(2)) (2) (M = Mo, W) and MoWCl(6) (H(2) PCH(2) PH(2)) (2) is shown to be mostly due to coupling of the <b>metal</b> <b>delta</b> electrons, with a smaller contribution from the pi electrons, particularly for the dimolybdenum complex...|$|R
