5000|$|According to A. F. Burns: Business cycles are {{not merely}} {{fluctuations}} in aggregate economic activity. The critical feature that distinguishes them from the commercial convulsions of earlier centuries or from the seasonal and other short term variations of our own age is that the fluctuations are widely diffused over the economy - its industry, its commercial dealings, and its tangles of finance. The economy {{of the western world}} is a system of closely interrelated parts. He who would understand business cycles must master the workings of an economic system organized largely in a network of free <b>enterprises</b> <b>searching</b> for profit. The problem of how business cycles come about is therefore inseparable from the problem of how a capitalist economy functions.|$|R
