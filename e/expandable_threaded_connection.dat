The invalidation of screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> will lead to mechanical failure or even retirement. Vibration tapping is essentially a kind of high-energy impact cutting which increases the rigidity of the tool.

At the same time, vibration tapping process does not reduce the strength of screw thread. As the screw thread can be more uniformed cut at different depths, vibration tapping enhances the strength of screw thread slightly...|$|R

40|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>connections</b> are {{responsible}} assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> with a diameter of 19 mm have been created. Screw connections were loaded by axial force and torque make-up. Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in pin thread becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the thread coupling, resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Retraction, atrophy and fatty {{infiltration}} {{are signs}} subsequent to chronic rotator cuff tendon tears. They {{are associated with}} an increased pennation angle and a shortening of the muscle fibers in series. These deleterious changes of the muscular architecture are not reversible with current repair techniques and are the main factors for failed rotator cuff tendon repair. Whereas fast stretching of the retracted musculotendinous unit results in proliferation of non-contractile fibrous tissue, slow stretching may lead to muscle regeneration in terms of sarcomerogenesis. To slowly stretch the retracted musculotendinous unit in a sheep model, two here described tensioning devices have been developed and mounted on the scapular spine of the sheep using an <b>expandable</b> <b>threaded</b> rod, which has been interposed between the retracted tendon end and the original insertion site at the humeral head. Traction is transmitted in line with the musculotendinous unit by sutures knotted on the <b>expandable</b> <b>threaded</b> rod. The threaded rod of the tensioner is driven within the body through a rotating axis, which enters the body on the opposite side. The tendon end, which was previously released (16 [*]weeks prior) from its insertion site with a bone chip, was elongated with a velocity of 1 [*]mm/day. Results After several steps of technical improvements, the tensioner proved to be capable of actively stretching the retracted and degenerated muscle back to the original length and to withstand the external forces acting on it.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the actual}} {{guideline}}s, {{for example the}} German VDI guideline 2230 [1] or the EUROCODE 3 [2], the fatigue assessment of bolted connections and bolts {{is based on the}} nominal stress approach. The FKM guideline for analytical strength assessment [3] does not include concepts for a <b>threaded</b> <b>connection,</b> it refers to the existing guidelines as [1]. At present there does not exist any guideline, which provides a damage assessment for general <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> by applying local concepts. In the present paper the basics of such a concept are outlined. The investigated metal is 34 CrNiMo 6, which is generally used for screw threads. The experimental determination of the local stress-strain behaviour in mechanically <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> is practically not feasible and needs a numerical approach. This numerical attempt consists of two main tasks, namely the description of the material properties and finite element (FE) analysis. The first one is concerned with the identification of material parameters, which are necessary for the FE analysis, especially for the advanced material model. The experimental work is given by determining the initial monotonic stress- strain curve, the initial unloading curve, the cyclic stress relaxation and cyclic creep. The parameter identification is accomplished using the software MATLAB, which includes the essential nonlinear optimization algorithms. The obtained parameters are entered in the FE software, which is used for the further FE analysis. The distinctive features of the FE analysis are the nonlinearity, especially nonlinear material behaviour, nonlinear contact algorithms and the consideration of large deformations, the high number of load steps and the various load ratio values (R = 0. 06 and R = 0. 71). The results of the FE analysis are used for the assessment of <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> The damage assessment is realized with the local strain approach based on the damage parameters PSWT and PJ. Finally the result of the simplified method according to Schneider is applied on a high preloaded bolt connection (R = 0. 71) and compared with the result achieved with the advanced material model...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} usable engineering design approach to the fatigue analysis of <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> Although primarily concerned with the fatigue-fracture mechanics behaviour of screw threads, a broad review of stress analysis investigations in such connections is reported. Connection types, their functions and standardisation authorities are presented {{with the purpose of}} familiarising the reader with the subject and the options available to the design of threaded fasteners. Fatigue crack initiation is discussed with reference to the specific setting of a critical thread root. A crack initiation model is adapted for employment in thread root design. A novel weight function approach is developed for use in the determination of stress intensity factors for <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> A generic solution is proposed valid for the fatigue crack growth from any thread root under any symmetrical stress system. Its development and discussion is examined in detail, remaining close to its proposed application. Two engineering situations where the chief structural components are comprised of threaded members are taken as case studies. The background to each situation is elaborated in detail and full-scale fatigue tests were conducted on the critical components. In all, fourteen full-scale tests under constant and variable amplitude loading are reported. The results of these are analysed and used to validate the fatigue crack initiation and propagation models. Useful observations which are helpful to understanding the fracture mechanisms operating during the fatigue of <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> are reported. Material and environmental considerations are examined and a survey of relevant materials and their behaviour in environments associated with threaded fasteners is presented. The merits or otherwise of some common engineering practices are discussed with regard to fatigue.
