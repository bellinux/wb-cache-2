40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> or water before viewing an optokinetic rotation drum on the severity of motion sickness and abnormal gastric myoelectric activity. Methods: There were 27 subjects who drank 300 ml of milk or water, or drank nothing, in three separate sessions with 2 -d intervals between every two sessions. Subjects in each session then viewed a vertically striped optokinetic rotation drum for 16 min. Symptoms of motion sickness and electrogastrograms (EGGs) were measured. Results: Subjects reported {{no significant difference in}} symptoms of motion sickness among sessions of <b>drinking</b> <b>milk,</b> water, or nothing. EGG recordings indicated that subjects in sessions of <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> and water significantly increased normal gastric myoelectric activity at ECG 3 cycles per minute (cpm). Subjects in all three sessions increased abnormal EGG activity at 4 - 9 cpm during drum rotation period, however, the ratios of EGG 4 - 9 cpm of drum rotation and baseline periods were not significantly different among sessions. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> or water before viewing an optokinetic rotation drum exhibited no effect on the severity of symptoms of motion sickness and abnormal gastric myoelectric activity...|$|R
40|$|Border measures—tariffs and tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) —provide {{high levels}} of support to Japan’s {{producers}} of milk for manufacturing purposes and keep consumer prices for dairy products in Japan high by world standards. Since <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> is not easily traded, Japan’s <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> market is largely autonomous from the world market. High farm costs of milk produc-tion and relatively high costs for processing and distributing <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> keep consumer prices of <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> high. Production quotas, designed to limit supplies and keep market prices stable, guide the volume of milk produced. A direct, fixed payment per kilogram of milk is provided from the Government budget to farmers for their quota production of manufacturing milk. A fund sharing farm and Government contributions pays farmers {{a portion of the}} difference between the current annual price and a historical average price when manufacturing milk prices fall. Japan’s Government controls trade within the largest TRQ and imposes extremely high tariffs on imports outside the TRQs reserved for private traders.

40|$|Background: Findings {{regarding}} {{the association between}} milk consumption and all-cause mortality reported by studies carried out in Western populations have been inconsistent. However, no {{studies have been conducted}} in Japan on this issue. The present study aimed to investigate the association of <b>milk</b> <b>drinking</b> with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in Japan. Methods: The data were obtained from the Japan Collaborative Cohort (JACC) study. A total of 94 980 Japanese adults aged 40 - 79 years who had no history of cancer, stroke, or chronic cardiovascular diseases were followed between 1988 and 2009. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of mortalities were assessed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model and taking the lowest milk consumption group as the reference. Results: During a median of 19 years of follow-up, there were 21 775 deaths (28. 8 % and 35. 3 % from cardiovascular diseases and cancer, respectively). <b>Drinking</b> <b>milk</b> 1 - 2 times a month was associated with lower all-cause mortality in men compared to those who never drank milk (multivariable-adjusted HR 0. 92; 95 % CI, 0. 85 - 0. 99). In women, those who drank 3 - 4 times a week also had a lower mortality risk compared with those who never drank milk (HR 0. 91; 95 % CI 0. 85 - 0. 98). Inverse associations between <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> and mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancer were found only in men. Conclusions: <b>Drinking</b> <b>milk</b> at least 1 - 2 times a month was associated with lower all-cause mortality in men compared to never <b>drinking</b> <b>milk.</b> An inverse association was also found between <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> and mortality from both cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, lower all-cause mortality in women was found only in those who drank milk 3 - 4 times/week...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the {{findings}} of an economic analysis of the present state of the food system for milk and dairy products in Japan in connection with Hokkaido, the largest raw milk producing area. The main results obtained are as follows: (1) Through input and output analysis, it was shown that the food system for milk and dairy products greatly contributes to the rural economy of Hokkaido. (2) While the structures of the <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> and cheese industries are bipolar, the butter and skimmed milk industries are oligopolies. (3) The food poisoning occurrence caused by Snow Brand Milk Products Co., Ltd. happened under pressure from severe competition among the three big milk products companies. (4) Concerning the demand structures of <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> and cheese, the price elasticity of both and the income elasticity of <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> were low. The growth of cheese demand was remarkable, but has stagnated recently. (5) <b>Drinking</b> <b>milk</b> prices show two directions of very high price and low price. (6) It was made clear that the food system for milk and dairy products in Hokkaido is having a stabilizing effect on the system nationwide. (7) Product differentiation for raw milk is one of the ways to further develop the food system for milk and dairy products in Japan...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{research}} milk and kefir microbiological indicators according to microbiological risk factors in the milk processing company A. Work tasks: to analyze <b>drinking</b> <b>milk,</b> ultra high temperature pasteurized milk and kefir descriptions and factors of the risk in technological process schemes; microbiological factors of the risk control schemes; samples of these products microbiological indicators according to company’s self-control plan. Conclusion: The main microbiological risk factors in <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> is total bacterial count, coliform bacteria, Salmonella; in the kefir – coliform bacteria, yeasts and moulds. Principals control points in <b>drinking</b> <b>milk,</b> ultra high temperature pasteurized milk and kefir technological schemes are: reception of the raw cow’s milk; freezing of the raw cow’s milk, storage and keeping; pasteurization of milk and freezing, pasteurized milk compound storage and keeping; milk warming, deaeration, homogenization, sterilization and refreshing (only for ultra high temperature pasteurized milk); repeated thermal treatment, cooling up to inoculation temperature (only for kefir); inoculation and incubation (only for kefir); storage. In the company’s A self-control plan preview principal control points microbiological risk factors are controlled by keeping a check of heating and freezing stages temperature and duration, monitoring of microbiological parameters are made not less than 4 times per year. Coliform bacteria and total bacteria count in <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> was above standard limits in January of 2004 (P≤ 0. 05).
