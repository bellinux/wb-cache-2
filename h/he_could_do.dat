5|$|Here and there, {{there are}} some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} better than any other football player I ever saw.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> things faster than ordinary human beings, and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more at night.|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} been his nature to share them with Alfred, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> so without saying where he had been, and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do,</b> so <b>he</b> gave one to Dick, and {{swallowed}} the rest {{to keep out the}} cold.|$|R
6000|$|Charlie said [...] "Nobody could," [...] {{and then}} 'e walked {{along with her}} hanging on to 'is arm, arf {{wondering}} {{whether it would be}} wrong to shove 'er under a bus that was passing, and arf wondering whether <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it if it wasn't.|$|R
6000|$|... ''Old 'ard, old gal!' says master, and 'Gently then!' says I, But {{an engine}} won't 'eed coaxin' an' it ain't {{no use to}} try; So first 'e pulled a lever, an' then 'e turned a screw, But the thing kept crawlin' forrard spite of all that <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Constantine was {{reluctant}} to leave England, his poor health necessitated a return to Trinidad, but before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so {{he died of a}} heart attack, probably brought about by bronchitis, on 1 July 1971. His body was flown to Trinidad, where he received a state funeral before being buried in Arouca. He was posthumously awarded Trinidad's highest honour, the Trinity Cross. Later in the month, a memorial service was held in London in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Mike McCarthy, New Orleans' {{offensive}} coordinator, Herman Edwards, a Tampa Bay assistant coach, and Marvin Lewis, Baltimore's defensive coordinator, {{were mentioned}} as possible replacements for Palmer. Policy {{also met with}} Butch Davis, the {{head coach of the}} University of Miami's football team. After rejecting an initial offer in December, Davis accepted the job the following month. Davis had turned around Miami's football program and put the team back in championship contention; Policy and Lerner hoped <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the same in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|Novelist Inez Asher {{was among}} those who wrote for the series, while other scripts were {{produced}} by writers blacklisted during the heyday of McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee. These writers included Robert Lees (credited as J. E. Selby) and Adrian Scott, one of the Hollywood Ten who went to prison for contempt of the United States Congress. His wife, Joan Scott writing as Joanne Court, attended story conferences and gave her husband notes so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> rewrites.|$|E
60|$|He {{started by}} sneering {{at the little}} game that Squire Brown 'ad left, but all <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> didn't seem to make much difference; things {{disappeared}} in a most eggstrordinary way, and the keepers went pretty near crazy, while the things the squire said about Claybury and Claybury men was disgraceful.|$|R
60|$|He {{was gone}} before Lemuel <b>could</b> stop him; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> {{anything}} but follow.|$|R
60|$|There {{was almost}} nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do,</b> and <b>he</b> now imitated {{the voice of}} Hook.|$|R
5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{had begun}} with an {{unsuccessful}} expedition against Naxos, {{a joint venture}} between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Milesian tyrant Aristagoras. In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies. Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons' {{family members}} that showed up {{took some time}} to be made, but the staff enjoyed the results. All of the male Simpson family members that showed up were voiced by Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer. He had asked for the {{recording}} tape to be run for about 20 minutes, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> many different voice variations that would fit the different men, but still be close to Homer's voice.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Tsukasa Masuko, with arrangements by Masuko and Tatsuya Nishiwaki. Masuko considered Shin Megami Tensei {{to be an}} experimental work: {{it was the first}} time he had created music for the Super Famicom, so he was not familiar with the console's specifications. During composition, he needed to check the specifications repeatedly to see what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> within the hardware limitations. For the PC Engine port, the music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E

60|$|Philip {{said all}} this to himself, but <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> it. <b>He</b> simply <b>could</b> not. <b>He</b> knew himself.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> and <b>did</b> {{play every}} position. He also {{went on to}} {{represent}} NSW in State of Origin.|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} improved for {{the following}} race in Bahrain though, as Webber picked up his first point for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him starting 14th and {{marked the first time}} he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1. He was unable to continue his point scoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in San Marino and a lack of grip in Spain meant that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> no better than 13th and 12th in those races.|$|E
5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said there was nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 804, Harun {{dispatched}} another raid {{under his}} general Ibrahim ibn Jibril. The Arabs crossed into Asia Minor through the Cilician Gates and raided freely. Nikephoros {{set out to}} meet them, but was forced to return before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, due to some unspecified event at his back (Warren Treadgold surmises news of a possible conspiracy). On his march home, however, the Arabs launched a surprise attack at Krasos in Phrygia and defeated his army. According to al-Tabari, the Byzantines lost 40,700 men and 4,000 pack animals, while the Emperor himself was wounded three times. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor confirms that the imperial army lost many men and that Nikephoros was almost killed himself; saved only by the bravery of his officers.|$|E

5|$|Later Hurley brings Jack and Charlie water, {{he notes}} Charlie doesn't look well but Jack covers for him {{saying that he}} has the flu. Hurley tells him to get better and Charlie looks thankful to Jack. He sees Locke and asks him for his heroin and Locke gives it back. Charlie looks at it for a moment before tossing it into the fire, smiling. Locke tells Charlie he's proud of him and that he always knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. Charlie and Locke see a moth flying away.|$|E
5|$|Not {{wanting a}} tainted victory, Cena broke the hold and {{attacked}} Laurinaitis. As Cena {{returned to the}} ring, Punk performed a Go to Sleep on Cena and pinned him to win the WWE Championship. McMahon ordered {{the winner of the}} Raw Money in the Bank match, Alberto Del Rio, to cash in his contract on Punk. When Del Rio ran out and tried to cash in his contract for an immediate WWE Championship match, Punk performed a roundhouse kick on Del Rio before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so. After blowing a kiss to a distraught McMahon, Punk fled the arena and left as WWE Champion.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian revolt {{had begun}} with an {{unsuccessful}} expedition against Naxos, {{a joint venture}} between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Miletus tyrant Aristagoras. In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities, ripe for rebellion, followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies. Aristagoras then appealed to the states of Mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.|$|E
60|$|Still {{receiving}} no reply, {{he started}} to put {{the key in the}} lock and found that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> so.|$|R
60|$|Martin solemnly promised that, {{as far as}} <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> would <b>do</b> so; that, at {{any rate}} as far as himself was concerned, he would never quarrel with him.|$|R
60|$|He {{was getting}} so {{tightened}} up in situation that as yet <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>do</b> as <b>he</b> was told, and keep his temper {{as well as}} <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft expected to return to his role in Mission Control. He would have been lead flight director on the first manned Apollo mission (later known as Apollo 1), which was scheduled to launch in early 1967. However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was in Mission Control, but under the circumstances there was little <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the starting line. In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> no better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
