5|$|In {{his second}} {{game of the}} 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for {{throwing}} six wild pitches in a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished {{the game with a}} 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory. He won his first four decisions that season but those victories were followed by four losses. He continued to accumulate strikeouts and finally began to walk fewer batters on average, exhibiting greater control over his pitching. Richard evened out his record at seven wins and seven losses by pitching a complete game three-hit shutout against the Padres on June 30. By the All-Star break, Richard had 7wins, 10losses, a 3.52 earned run average and 158strikeouts in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> over 157innings of work. By July 25, his record stood at eight wins and 11 losses, but after he pitched nine straight complete games (including two-hit and three-hit shutouts on August 27 and September 6, respectively) through September 6 and worked 86 consecutive innings without the need of a relief pitcher, which set an Astros club record, {{it was clear that he}} was on a winning streak. On September 21, in a game against the Reds, he pitched 11innings and matched a career high of 15strikeouts, which he also reached earlier in the season on August 3 in a game against the Braves. He closed out the season against the Dodgers by winning his 11th straight game against the team, with his last loss coming on June 23, 1976. He was honored as the National League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 4–1 with a 1.24ERA, four complete games, two shutouts and 69strikeouts in 53innings pitched during the stretch.|$|E

25|$|On May 7, 1995, Miller scored {{eight points}} in 8.9 seconds in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Knicks, leading the Pacers to a {{stunning}} 107–105 victory. With 18.7 seconds remaining and the Pacers trailing 105–99, Miller took the inbounds pass from Mark Jackson, made a 3-pointer, stole the inbounds pass from Anthony Mason, dribbled {{back behind the}} arc and tied the game with another 3, stunning the crowd at Madison Square Garden. On the ensuing possession, Knicks guard John Starks was fouled by Sam Mitchell. Starks missed both free throws, and although Patrick Ewing {{managed to get the}} offensive rebound, his shot was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> long and hit the back rim. Miller got the rebound and was fouled with 7.5 seconds left. He made both free throws. Trailing by 2, New York had one last chance to win the game, but failed to get a shot off, giving the Pacers a shocking 1–0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Pacers outlasted the Knicks in seven games before losing to the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals in seven games, just like the previous year. Near the end of the 1996 season, Miller fell to the floor and suffered an eye injury, leaving him unable to play in the playoffs until Game 5 of the first round against the Atlanta Hawks, where he wore goggles. The Pacers lost to the Hawks and were eliminated.|$|E

Live instrumentations, from members of the Chicago Symphony and Chicago Lyric Opera Orchestra, were added where needed. The soundtrack features a wide range of sounds, O'Donnell described it as, [...] "Gregorian chant, string orchestra, percussion and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a 'Qawwali voice'". Working closely with level designers, O'Donnell divided the music [...] "into chunks".

Two reviewers of the Goosebumps books did not feel that the books were high quality literature. U.S. News & World Reports Marc Silver thought the series was [...] "quite tame". He called the Goosebumps books [...] "subliterature", stating the plotting in the books was careless and that characters in the stories rarely grew. Roderick McGillis, from the academic journal , described the books as camp, writing the books [...] "are so artificial, so formulaic, so predictable, so repetitive". McGillis also felt that the content of the Goosebumps series is [...] "thin in the extreme".|$|E
500|$|The reverse was {{designed}} by the assistant engraver who would succeed Morgan on his death in 1925, John R. Sinnock. It is an adaptation of the Seal of Illinois, an eagle perched on a rock mound, with the rising sun beyond it. The bird holds in its beak a scroll with the Illinois state motto, STATE SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL UNION and it clutches the Federal shield. An olive branch is seen, but without any arrows representing war, even though these symbols are often paired on U.S. coins. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen suggested [...] "their presence on a coin designed during the concluding months of World War I might have been considered <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> raw". The reverse also bears the legends, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, E PLURIBUS UNUM (the national motto, meaning [...] "out of many, one") and HALF DOLLAR.|$|E

500|$|Allosaurus {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} since {{the early years of}} the 20th century. It is top predator in both Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel, The Lost World, and its 1925 film adaptation, the first full-length motion picture to feature dinosaurs. Allosaurus was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film The Beast of Hollow Mountain, and the 1969 film The Valley of Gwangi, two genre combinations of living dinosaurs with Westerns. In The Valley of Gwangi, Gwangi is billed as an Allosaurus, although Ray Harryhausen based his model for the creature on Charles R. Knight's depiction of a Tyrannosaurus. Harryhausen sometimes confuses the two, stating in a DVD interview [...] "They're both meat eaters, they're both tyrants... one was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> larger than the other." [...] A male individual also appears in [...] as the main antagonist, bent on making a meal out of the main characters. It also appears in a flashback in the 2007 TV series.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, but wrote: [...] "Flashes of brilliance aside, the result sounds {{an awful lot}} like something Yorke dashed off to pass the time before delving into the new Radiohead album." [...] Mark Beaumont of the Guardian called it [...] "deviously understated", but found that its unconventional release was [...] "more impactful than the product." [...] Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "There's precious little to grab on to in terms of melody and feeling, and you won't find yourself humming along to anything here. That said, certain elements of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, if given the right amount of attention, can be enjoyable to luxuriate in." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times found the album too similar to Yorke's 2006 solo album The Eraser and his work with Atoms for Peace, writing that [...] "it’s <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> disappointing that Yorke's path seems short on new directions." ...|$|E

500|$|Commented {{longtime}} former Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox on Bagwell – {{who opposed}} {{him from the}} dugout for the entirety of his career, including numerous times in the playoffs: [...] "Jeff Bagwell was [...] {{for so long and}} starred every year. [...] For me a guy that dominated like that for one team, even in the league stats through the years. [...] His are up there with anybody's. [...] I would put him in right away. [...] So he would get my vote on the first ballot." [...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} months of 1944, Robey {{returned}} to the role of Falstaff when he appeared in the film version of Henry V, produced by Eagle-Lion Films. [...] The American film critic Bosley Crowther had mixed opinions of the film. Writing in The New York Times in 1946, he thought that it showcased [...] "a fine group of British film craftsmen and actors", who contributed to [...] "a stunningly brilliant and intriguing screen spectacle". Despite that, he considered the film's additional screenplay poor and called Falstaff's deathbed scene [...] "non-essential and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> grotesque." [...] Late in 1944, he appeared in Burnley in a show entitled Vive Paree alongside Janice Hart and Frank O'Brian. In 1945, Robey starred in two minor film roles, as [...] "Old Sam" [...] in The Trojan Brothers, a short comedy film in which two actors experience various problems as a pantomime horse, and as [...] "Vogel" [...] in the musical romance Waltz Time. He spent 1947 touring England, while the following spring he undertook a provincial tour of Frederick Bowyer's fairy play The Windmill Man, which he also co-produced with his wife.|$|E

500|$|Chris Cabin at Collider {{called the}} short film [...] "dark, funny, and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> punkish", and {{compared}} it to a Saturday Night Live skit. He {{thought it was a}} smart move from Fox to release [...] "a taste of what [...] love" [...] about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great way to keep the buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was [...] "not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was [...] "a fun one", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, [...] "At the very least, [...] we can expect the same irreverent humor in" [...] Deadpool 2 as was in the first film.|$|E
500|$|Darren begins {{an affair}} with Hannah's mother, Suzanne (Suzanne Hall), whose son Rhys (Andrew Moss) is Darren's friend. The Daily Star {{announced}} this storyline on 23 May 2010. Suzanne is upset and [...] "Darren is {{more than happy to}} give her a shoulder to cry on. But he soon can’t believe the mess he gets himself into with his mate's mum. He tries everything he can to put her off but Suzanne is not having any of it". Dawson explained the romance, saying, [...] "They're both lonely and there's a bit of a thrill for Darren as she's an older woman. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of fun for both of them". Darren supports Suzanne through her marital problems; they grow close and begin an affair, until Rhys exposes them. Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea), Suzanne's husband, throws her out of her home, forcing Darren to allow her to move in with him. Suzanne decides to leave Darren and move to Spain with Neville. When asked who Darren would choose between Suzanne and Cindy, Dawson said, [...] "Cindy any time". In early 2011, Suzanne returns, and announces that she's pregnant with Darren's twins. She gives birth to twins before she moves in with Darren and girlfriend Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox). Nancy ends her relationship with Darren. In March, Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) returns and pays Suzanne to leave the village so she can have Darren to herself, which Suzanne accepts.|$|E
500|$|After its release, Evita {{garnered}} critical appreciation. Zach Conner from Time magazine commented, [...] "It's {{a relief}} to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." [...] Madonna won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the role. She released three singles from the Evita soundtrack album, including [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997) and [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, Madonna gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: [...] "Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public." [...] Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997; she declared that they were [...] "better off as best friends." ...|$|E
