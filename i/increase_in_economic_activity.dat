500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E

ZESCO {{was established in}} 1970 and is wholly owned by the Government of the Republic of Zambia. However, ZESCO operates as an autonomous entity that is monitored by the Government, through the Board of Directors, to ensure that performance benchmarks are met. The Company is mandated to generate, transmit, distribute and supply electricity throughout Zambia. With the view of improving the transmission and distribution infrastructure throughout ZESCO‟s four divisions namely; Lusaka, Copperbelt, Northern, and Southern, ZESCO proposes to undertake an electricity {{transmission and distribution system}} rehabilitation program. These rehabilitation works will be implemented through the Zambia Transmission and Distribution Rehabilitation Project (TDRP). Of critical importance is addressing the rehabilitation needs of Lusaka, considering that 40 % of the non-mining loads are concentrated in this area. In recent years, Lusaka has been experiencing load shedding because the demand for power has outstripped the supply. This <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> demand is due to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> various sectors such as mining, agriculture, tourism and domestic use.

In particular, I examine the extent to which Ireland fits into a pattern of declining correlation between GDP and well- being at later stages of development, a phenomenon known as the Easterlin Paradox.

The study also concluded that if the tax base were eroded by 10% due to tax evasion, tax avoidance, and/or legislative adjustments, the average rate would be 34% (53% tax-exclusive) for the 10-year period.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} a production and consumption-based empirical macroeconomic-climate assessment of Sweden’s CO 2 emissions. The core methodology {{is based on}} three complementary quantitative methods, namely energy-economy-environment indicators, econometric analyses, and a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) sectoral model. Based on the latest available data (1971 – 2011), indicators show a sharp decarbonisation of Sweden’s energy supply mix pre- 1990, and reductions or reversals in energy intensity, CO 2 intensity and energy use post- 1990. Reductions in energy intensity are mostly attributed to substantial <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> rather than reductions in energy use. Econometric results show that variability of CO 2 emissions is best explained by CO 2 intensity than any other tested variable. The MRIO model shows that the Swedish emissions trading balance is negative with both the European Union {{and the rest of}} the world (i. e. embodied CO 2 emissions in imports are higher than embodied emissions in exports).
