The main sub-systems of mobile decontamination system are: pre-wash, chemical wash and post wash systems respectively. The pre-wash system consists of a 3000-litre stainless steel water tank and a fast suction pump. A high-pressure jet with a capacity of 3400 l/hour and a low-pressure jet with a capacity of 900 l/hour and 1600 l/hour are included. The chemical wash system is capable of mixing two powders and two liquids with variable feed rates and has a five-litre per minute slurry <b>emulsion</b> <b>flow</b> rate. The post wash system consists of a high-pressure hot water jet, a hot water shower for personnel and provision of steam for decontamination of clothing. The decontamination systems have been introduced into the services. The system is under production for the Army at DRDO's partnering firms, with the DRDO itself manufacturing the pilot batch.|$|E

40|$|Emulsions are {{the basis}} for many {{commercial}} products such as foodstuffs and paint {{due in part to}} their highly tunable flow properties. It is qualitatively understood that factors such as the dispersed phase droplet size and size distribution should affect how an emulsion flows because they influence how droplets can deform or pack. Since standard emulsification techniques such as blending and homogenization cannot produce emulsions with well-defined size distributions, little work has been done to, in particular, quantitatively determine the influence of droplet size distribution on <b>emulsion</b> <b>flow</b> properties. Consequently, in this investigation we have probed how the droplet size distribution affects <b>emulsion</b> <b>flow</b> properties by using model monodisperse emulsion systems with narrow, controllable droplet size distributions. Using a microfluidic flow focusing device, dodecane-in-water emulsions with diameters between 50 to 100 m with polydispersities less than 5 % were produced, as characterized by pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance and optical microscopy. Due to the relatively large size of the droplets, it was only possible to examine the creamed phase of the emulsion. Samples of known polydispersity were made by mixing known quantities of two monodisperse emulsions. The monodisperse and bimodal emulsions were then subjected to rotational and oscillatory shear flow using a controlled stress rheometer {{to determine the effects of}} droplet size and size distribution on <b>emulsion</b> <b>flow</b> properties. Rotational and oscillatory rheological experiments showed that the monodisperse emulsions had two distinct behaviours: foam-like with appreciable thixotropy and yield stresses as well as emulsion-like with no evident thixotropy. The transition between these two behaviours appears to happen at a critical droplet radius between 33 and 37 micrometres. The rheological properties of the bimodal emulsions was split into three distinct behaviours. In samples that could be considered a matrix of large droplets perturbed by smaller droplets, the flow properties were similar to those of the constituent emulsion with the larger droplets. Increasing the number fraction of smaller droplets to a 1 : 1 ratio creates an entirely new phase with significantly reduced elastic properties. Surprisingly, when the emulsion primarily consists of small droplets, the flow properties are most similar to that of the large droplets. Additionally, despite the microstructural differences, all emulsions showed flow characteristics typical of soft glassy materials above the glass transition temperature. These results demonstrate the significant influence of microstructure on emulsion rheology, where altering the droplet size or polydispersity essentially creates a new phase with its own unique flow properties that is not simply a combination of the properties of the individual monodisperse components that make up the sampl...|$|E
40|$|Working fluids possess several {{applications}} in manufacturing processes, for instance lubricants in metals machining. Typical metal working fluids are formulated as oil-in-water emulsions. The {{maintenance of the}} physical stability of the working fluid during operation is a key factor for the sustainability of the relevant process. Therefore, continuous control of the working fluids stability and performance during machine operation is an essential tool for maintenance of the process performance. Turbidity measurement (TM) is a process technique for emulsion stability and quality assessment, where light transmission and absorption of an emulsion system is analyzed. However, for in-process measurement and fluid quality detection during the machine operation by TM, {{it is necessary to}} implement a transmission inline sensor into the working fluid flow line. The continuous flow measurement may cause problems for long-term sensor operation regarding, e. g., biofouling of the sensor optical glasses or erroneous measurements due to emulsion droplets segregation effects.

30|$|Different typical {{configurations}} of an emulsion may {{be categorized as}} O/W, W/O or a more complex dispersion. In complex dispersion phase a dispersed phase is embedded within each droplet already dispersed in a continuous phase, such as the case of oil-in-water-in-oil emulsions. In porous media, it is of great interest for petroleum engineers {{to know how the}} <b>emulsions</b> <b>flow</b> in porous media and the flow rate changes with pressure drop during <b>flowing.</b> <b>Emulsions</b> (O/W and W/O emulsions) are formed in situ under adequate conditions in porous media. A third component often present in an emulsion is an emulsifier or surfactant, which can reduce interfacial tension between liquids and can stabilize emulsions. In oil reservoirs, the added chemicals, or crude oil components such as asphaltenes, waxes, resins, and naphthenic acids act as emulsifying agents. These emulsifiers or stabilizers suppress the emulsion breakdown process (Fingas and Fieldhouse 2004). Many researchers carried out experimental investigation on injection of W/O or O/W emulsion as a selective plugging agent to improve oil recovery in water flooding (McAuliffe 1973 a, b; Thomas and Ali 1989). During alkali flooding, alkali can penetrate into heavy oil in porous media by the formation of W/O emulsions in situ. In this connection, rheological properties of emulsions {{play an important role in}} efficient oil recovery. Due to high viscosity of W/O emulsions, the resistance to water flow in high water saturation zones can be increased significantly to improve sweep efficiency and thus oil recovery. Most of the cases the power-law model is the simplest representation of the viscosity of non-Newtonian fluids.|$|R

A Newtonian silicone oil was used as the dispersed phase, while three different water-based fluids, a Newtonian and two Boger fluids, were used as the continuous phase.

An appropriate mathematical model was fitted to express each response {{as a function of}} the proportions of the blend components that are able to empirically predict the response to any blend of combination of the components. The synergistic interaction effect of the ternary XG:CMC:LBG blends at approximately 33 - 67 % XG levels was shown to be much stronger than that of the binary XG:LBG blend at 50 % XG level (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, an antagonistic interaction effect became significant as CMC level in blends was more than 33 % (p < 0. 05).
