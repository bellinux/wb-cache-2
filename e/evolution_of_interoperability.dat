40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{interoperability}} of eGovernment {{policy in the}} European Union (EU). Are the EU institutions building up regional integration through the interoperability of eGovernment policy? To address this issue, the article analyzes the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>interoperability</b> policy making from its inception in 1995 to date. It also outlines the principal implementation instruments deployed by the EU institutions to foster interoperability across member states ’ public administrations, as well as employing a sample of key case studies to illustrate them. Results confirm {{the existence of an}} integrated approach to the interoperability of eGovernment policy fostered at EU level. They also corroborate the utilization of the open method of coordination (OMC) as the governance system operating within this policy field. Finally, and more importantly, this work pinpoints the growing role of interoperability policy for advancing the regional integration process within the multilevel and mutinational governance system epitomized by the EU...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEven if the {{research}} domain related to interoperability {{has been developed}} {{for more than ten}} years and particularly for the last eight years, the different kinds of interoperability and the different problems to solve need to be consolidated in order to define a real science. Moreover, because of the continuous evolution of enterprises in supply chains, interoperability problems must continuously be considered and solved in order to reach a sustainable interoperability. The objective of this prospective research paper is to discuss how System Theory (ST), applied to System of Systems, is able to support the development of Sustainable Enterprise Interoperability Science Base. After an introduction which reminds the definition of Enterprise Interoperability and the development of this domain in Europe, the system theory concepts are introduced.

40|$|Abstract. Business {{transactions}} {{are governed by}} legally established contracts. Contractual obligations are to be fulfilled by executing business processes of the involved parties. To enable this, contract terms and conditions need to be semantically mapped to process concepts and then analyzed for compliance with existing process models. To solve the problem, we propose a methodology that, using a layered contract ontology, deduces contract requirements into a high-level process description named Contract Workflow Model (CWM). By applying a set of transformation rules, the CWM is then compared for compli-ance with existing, executable process models. By the use of its concepts, the methodology enables comprehensive identification and <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> require-ments for <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> processes of the contracting parties. ...|$|R
40|$|According to the United Nations’ International Strategy for Disaster Reduction “natural hazards are {{processes}} or {{phenomena that}} may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, {{social and economic}} disruption, or environmental damage”. They are at the interface between human and natural systems. From this perspective natural hazards are a multidimensional domain including environmental issues, {{the private and public}} sector as well as citizens and governance ranging from local to supra-national. The vast amount of information and data necessary for comprehensive hazard and risk assessment presents many challenges regarding the lack of accessibility, comparability, quality, organisation and dissemination of natural hazards spatial data. In order to mitigate these limitations an interoperability framework has been developed and published in the INSPIRE Data Specification on Natural Risk Zones – Technical Guidelines (DS) document. This framework provides means for facilitating access, integration, harmonisation and dissemination of natural hazard data from different domains and sources. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the paper highlights the key aspects <b>of</b> the <b>interoperability</b> to the various natural hazard communities and illustrates the applicability <b>of</b> the <b>interoperability</b> framework developed in the DS. And secondly, the paper “translates” into common language the main features and potentiality <b>of</b> the <b>interoperability</b> framework <b>of</b> the DS for a wider audience of scientists and practitioners in the natural hazard domain. In this paper the four pillars <b>of</b> the <b>interoperability</b> framework will be presented. First, the adoption of a common terminology for the natural hazard domain will be addressed. A common data model to facilitate cross domain data integration will then follow. Thirdly, the common methodology developed to express qualitative or quantitative assessments of natural hazards is presented. Fourthly, the extensible classification schema for natural hazards developed from a literature review and key reference documents from the contributing community of practice is discussed. Furthermore, the applicability <b>of</b> the <b>interoperability</b> framework for the various stakeholder groups is illustrated. This paper closes discussing main advantages, limitations and next steps regarding the sustainability and <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interoperability</b> framework. JRC.
