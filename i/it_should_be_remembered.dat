25|$|Grand Treasurers {{supervised}} lesser officials {{such as the}} Master of the Mint (mincerz), dyspensators, kurators, tax collectors (poborca podatkowy), superintendents (overseer {{of customs}} officers), customs officers (celnik) and subkolektors. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that, in those times, goods—as well as people—were taxed not only at borders but at bridges, crossroads and city gates.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that in {{the early}} part of the 20th century matches were a {{necessity}} for smoking and the lighting of stoves and gas appliances among other uses and therefore demand for them was highly inelastic, meaning that a monopolist could raise prices (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold.|$|E
25|$|In Wisconsin, Schurz {{soon became}} {{immersed}} in the anti-slavery movement and in politics, joining the Republican Party. In 1857, he was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for lieutenant-governor. In the Illinois campaign {{of the next year}} between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, he took part as a speaker on behalf of Lincoln—mostly in German—which raised Lincoln's popularity among German-American voters, though <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Senators were not directly elected in 1858, the election being decided by the Illinois General Assembly.|$|E

25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works. While it has been criticized as the least {{substantial}} of the composer's three ballets, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Tchaikovsky was restricted by a rigorous scenario supplied by Marius Petipa. This scenario provided no opportunity {{for the expression of}} human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, at its best, the melodies are charming and pretty, and by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E
25|$|The Tang dynasty {{was a time}} {{of major}} social and {{probably}} linguistic upheavals. Thus, the genre may be divided into several major more-or-less chronological divisions, based on developmental stages or stylistic groupings (sometimes even on personal friendships between poets). <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that poets may be somewhat arbitrarily assigned to these based on their presumed biographical dates (not always known); furthermore that the lifetimes of poets toward the beginning or end of this period may overlap with the preceding Sui dynasty or the succeeding Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The chronology of Tang poetry may be divided into four parts: Early Tang, High Tang, Middle Tang, and Late Tang.|$|E
25|$|Hand axes {{are most}} {{commonly}} made from rounded pebbles or nodules, {{but many are}} also made from a large flake. Hand axes made from flakes first appeared {{at the start of}} the Acheulean period and became more common with time. Manufacturing a hand axe from a flake is actually easier than from a pebble, it is also quicker as flakes are more likely to be closer to the desired shape. This allows easier manipulation and fewer knaps are required to finish the tool, it is also easier to obtain straight edges. When analysing a hand axe made from a flake <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that its shape was predetermined (by use of the Levallois technique or Kombewa technique or similar). Notwithstanding this, it is necessary to note tools characteristics: type of flake, heel, knap direction.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>should,</b> however, <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Escape <b>was</b> {{part of a}} {{wider and}} at the time quite vibrant {{environment}} in British comics and that artists did move freely from publication to publication.

25|$|Batting averages in One Day International (ODI) cricket tend to {{be lower}} than in Test cricket, {{because of the need}} to score runs more quickly and take riskier strokes and the lesser {{emphasis}} on building a large innings. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> especially in relation to the ODI histogram above, that there were no ODI competitions when Bradman played.|$|R

25|$|Occlusal splints {{are divided}} into partial or full-coverage splints {{according}} to whether they fit over {{some or all of}} the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower splints are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. Another problem with wearing a splint can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the splint about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. As an added measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the splint so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal level of sensitivity from the teeth, although <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.|$|E
500|$|When {{assessing}} Lady Rosebery's behaviour to {{her children}} <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that she lived {{in an era of}} plentiful nannies, wet nurses, nursemaids and governesses which the upper classes employed as the norm. These people were employed regardless of the mother's affection towards her children; it was inconceivable that a countess would nurse her own children, and to do so would have been breaking social conventions. Hence her seeming lack of attention {{to her children}} was not unusual– she was following the upper class conventions and [...] "stiff upper lip" [...] philosophies of her era. However, in spite of their prolonged absences from their children, the Roseberys do not appear to have been very distant or remote figures in the earliest stages of their children's lives. Margot Asquith records how Rosebery loved to play and romp on the floor with the children.|$|E
500|$|But {{despite the}} {{continuity}} – {{or perhaps because}} of it – all was apparently not well. In 1188 Gerald of Wales accompanied Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, on a tour of Wales, the primary object being a recruitment campaign for the Third Crusade, a secondary one to establish his authority over the whole Welsh church. Gerald’s vivid account of the journey is the first great European travel book. Gerald visited Llanbadarn Fawr, and described the college of secular canons under a lay abbot (Ednowain [...] "bishop of Llanbadarn"), in not especially flattering terms; <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Gerald was a zealous reformer, critical of anything of which he disapproved, as he did of Llanbadarn: the abbot was described as [...] "a certain old man, waxen old in iniquity". The account of his visit was subsequently published in the Itinerarium Cambriae (1191), and was followed by the Descriptio Cambriae in 1194.|$|E

5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> where {{matters of}} {{detailed}} wording are concerned, {{that there is}} some uncertainty in the Gospel texts themselves, as textual criticism of the gospels is still an active field, which cannot even decide, for example, on Mark's original ending. Such issues often intersect with the synoptic problem; for example, Streeter famously dismissed many of the [...] "minor agreements" [...] so troublesome for the two-source theory by appealing to textual corruption driven typically by harmonization.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{his being}} an ardent {{supporter}} of American expansionism {{during his time}} in the Cabinet, only Alaska was added to U.S. territory during Seward's service as Secretary of State. [...] (<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that the purchase of Alaska from Russia was not inevitable; the land had the same latitude as Siberia and was very difficult to farm, while neither gold nor oil nor any other important mineral was discovered there until years after Seward's death.) [...] Nevertheless, his influence extended to later American acquisitions. One of his friends, Hamilton Fish, in 1875 signed the trade reciprocity treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii that eventually led to American annexation of the islands. [...] William Everts, another Seward friend, in 1877 signed a treaty of friendship with the Samoan Islands, laying the groundwork for another American acquisition. [...] A young friend and protege of Seward, Lincoln's assistant private secretary, John Hay, served as a successor of Seward from 1898 to 1905, during which time the U.S. acquired Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Philippines, and the Panama Canal Zone.|$|E
500|$|It is {{believed}} that Shankly wanted {{a seat on the}} Liverpool board, following the precedent of Matt Busby who joined the Manchester United board after he retired as manager in 1969. But, again, what Shankly did not understand was that his relations with the board had often been acrimonious with several resignation threats and a statement made by Shankly that: [...] "At a football club, there's a holy trinity – the players, the manager and the supporters. Directors don't come into it. They are only there to sign the cheques". Although some club officials like secretary Peter Robinson wanted bygones to be bygones, Tommy Smith summarised the board's view as [...] "Right, that's it, we've got rid of him at last". <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Shankly was [...] "an overpowering figure" [...] who would certainly have used a position on the board to be a [...] "back-seat driver" [...] and the board were well aware that Matt Busby's time as a Manchester United director was disastrous, the team just having been relegated. Whilst Liverpool's treatment of Shankly may have seemed disrespectful, they were acting {{in the best interests of}} the club and its new manager by pursuing the same relentless winning ethic that Shankly himself had instilled. In any event, their perceived ruthlessness was vindicated by the unprecedented haul of League Championship titles and European Cups won over the next decade under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan.|$|E
500|$|At {{his press}} conference in 2008, Semyon Gluzman said that the surplus in Ukraine of {{hospitals}} for inpatient treatment {{of the mentally ill}} was a relic of the totalitarian communist regime and that Ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow Ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including the Pavlov Hospital where beds in its children's unit alone were more than in the whole of Great Britain. In Ukraine, public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry. There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law. But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country. The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients. They wrote to newspapers, yelled in busy places and around them, behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors. Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20-30 people standing by a window of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with red flags, portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard: [...] "Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine!" [...] Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the mental health system. But in general, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists. The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units: hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat-hospice for helpless [...] "chronic patients" [...] unable to live on their own. And between hospital and internat-hospice is desert. That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so-called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications. A similar pattern is in internats. A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses. They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms, nursing homes, [...] "halfway houses". Ukraine does not have anything like that.|$|E

25|$|Resist dyeing {{was common}} {{from the late}} Roman period for those outside the Court, and woodblock {{printing}} dates to at least the 6th century, and possibly earlier - again this would function as a cheaper alternative to the woven and embroidered materials of the rich. Apart from Egyptian burial-cloths, rather fewer cheap fabrics have survived than expensive ones. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that depicting a patterned fabric in paint or mosaic {{is a very difficult}} task, often impossible in a small miniature, so the artistic record, which often shows patterned fabrics in large-scale figures in the best quality works, probably under-records the use of patterned cloth overall.|$|R
