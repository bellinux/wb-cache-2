Hours later <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> boardroom grilling from Sir Alan after the wedding task. I was shaking with nerves convinced I was about to throw up all over Sir Alan and his sidekicks, Nick and Margaret." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Allen's opinion, she couldn't learn {{fast enough}} to make a first-rate movie, {{although}} she thought Marnie did have some good scenes in it. She took a lot of the responsibility for what is considered a very flawed movie, since Hitchcock loved her script so much so that he did not make as good a movie as he should have. Hitchcock would have made her a director but she told him no. Said Allen: [...] "It seems perfectly clear to me that any project takes a minimum of a year to direct. I like to get things on and over with. ... Did you ever hear the phrase, 'the lady proposes, the studio disposes'? I didn’t make it up. I would never propose myself as a director." [...] Under Hitchcock's mentoring, Allen developed the screenwriting talent she would use the rest of her career. Allen wrote that she never felt discriminated against. While being one of the rare female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1960s, she said [...] "almost all of the men I worked with were supportive. If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> bum rap somewhere, I didn’t know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Alfred. [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> bit oldish--but I'm not. It's {{the things}} you've got as gets worn out, it's not you yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, Lord Robert," [...] he begged. [...] "I do not {{remember}} you, it <b>is</b> true, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> old man. My memory sometimes plays me strange tricks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never argue," [...] she said. [...] "I {{only state}} facts. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little bored. Some {{one must be}} very amusing at dinner-time or I shall have a headache." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; {{how stupid}} of me! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little deaf, and this air {{makes me so}} sleepy in the morning. Now, just tell me again, what is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knocked {{against the}} latch of the coal-place, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> raker in the dark, because the candle blew out." [...] Her two small {{children}} {{looked up at her}} with wide, dismayed eyes. They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the unconscious tragedy they felt.|$|E
60|$|I {{was quite}} at home now in society, and knew nearly every one, {{and enjoyed the}} {{conversation}} now as much, or more, than the dancing. Ada told me one morning, when I had been there about five weeks, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> perfect flirt--quite as bad as she was--indeed worse, because quieter--and therefore much more dangerous.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> {{little tired}} of this. [...] "But the glacier is there, sir," [...] I said, [...] "and I am taking out ice every day, and {{have reason to}} believe that I can {{continue}} to take it out {{for the rest of my}} life. With such facts as these before me, I am bound to say, sir, that I don't care in the least about reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little girl," [...] he advised, [...] "run away in {{and take}} care of your throat. Remember that {{everything}} depends upon the next few hours. As for me, perhaps <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Tom, [...] "it {{will be a}} long journey, so I {{had better}} start at once. Good-bye, Miss Ellie; you know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> big boy, and I must go out and see the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have chosen}} your husband {{among the men}} who pulled us down, and nothing can be quite the same between you and me," [...] he said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> old man, and may never see you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"As far as I know, I haven't {{opened my}} lips in your hearing," [...] I affirmed with perfect truth. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little angry, too, at {{the absurdity of}} this encounter. It strikes me now I have {{never in my life}} been so near a beating--I mean it literally; a beating with fists. I suppose I had some hazy prescience of that eventuality being in the air. Not that he was {{actively}} threatening me. On the contrary, he was strangely passive--don't you know? but he was lowering, and, though not exceptionally big, he looked generally fit to demolish a wall. The most reassuring symptom I noticed was a kind of slow and ponderous hesitation, which I took as a tribute to the evident sincerity of my manner and of my tone. We faced each other. In the court the assault case was proceeding. I caught the words: [...] "Well--buffalo--stick--in the greatness of my fear. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{was kept}} {{carefully}} {{out of every}} one's way for weeks, and only taken out for exercise by my trainer. Poor Bill! I was fond of him, {{and he was so}} good to me that I never have forgotten him, though he broke his neck years ago. A few nights before the great race, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> good sleep, carefully tucked away in my roomy stall, some one stole in and gave me a warm mash. It was dark, I was half awake, and I ate it like a fool, though I knew by instinct that it was not Bill who fed it to me. I was a confiding creature then, and as all sorts of queer things had been done to prepare me I thought it was all right. But it was not, and that deceit has caused me to be suspicious about my food ever since, for the mash was dosed in some way; it made me very ill, and my enemies nearly triumphed, thanks to this cowardly trick.|$|E
60|$|Fires {{interested}} me considerably, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal of}} an insurance business started, and was also training some horses and building some steam fire-engines, {{with an eye to}} a paid fire department by and by. The priests opposed both my fire and life insurance, on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of God; and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least, but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck, they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of God, and was just as bad. So they managed to damage those industries more or less, but I got even on my Accident business. As a rule, a knight is a lummox, and some times even a labrick, and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger, but even he could see the practical side of a thing once in a while; and so of late you couldn't clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] the Princess answered, [...] "only <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little bored, {{and if you}} had any yokels of the Mr. Andrew sort, {{with just}} a little more polish, they might be entertaining. You three men <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> deadly dull." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Watson," [...] said he, [...] "if {{it should}} ever strike you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper 'Norbury' in my ear, and <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> {{infinitely}} obliged to you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} set of a certain distinguished author's works prepared for a certain distinguished architect, which I hope he will accept, as a slight, though very inadequate, etc. etc.; affectionate, etc.; so heartily and kindly taking so much interest, etc. etc.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they took}} it down--the whole blessed village took it down. At the cost of sitting up stiff and stern, as much like those sitting Egyptian images one sees as I could manage, for pretty nearly twelve hours, I should guess at least, on end, I got over it. You'd hardly think what it meant in that heat and stink. I don't think any of them dreamt of the man inside. I was just a {{wonderful}} leathery great joss that {{had come up with}} luck out of the water. But the fatigue! the heat! the beastly closeness! the mackintosheriness and the rum! and the fuss! They lit a stinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought in a lot of gory muck--the worst parts of what they were feasting on outside, the Beasts-- and burnt it all in my honour. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> bit hungry, but I understand now how gods manage to do without eating, what with the smell of burnt-offerings about them. And they brought {{in a lot of the}} stuff they'd got off the brig and, among other stuff, what I was a bit relieved to see, the kind of pneumatic pump that was used for the compressed air affair, and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and danced about me something disgraceful. It's extraordinary the different ways different people have of showing respect. If I'd had a hatchet handy I'd have gone for the lot of them--they made me feel that wild. All this time I sat as stiff as company, not knowing anything better to do. And at last, when nightfall came, and the wattle joss-house place got a bit too shadowy for their taste--all these here savages are afraid of the dark, you know--and I started a sort of 'Moo' noise, they built big bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut, free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over, and feel just as bad as I liked. And Lord! I was sick.|$|E
50|$|IRENE: Well, {{who says}} I don't {{want to buy}} a dress? It's about time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> new formal, anyhow. I haven't got a rag that's fit to be seen.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{no answer}} to my question. Do you {{understand}} that at this moment <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> fall which will break every bone in my skin and put any other climbing {{out of the question}} as far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned?

6000|$|... "True enough," [...] she admitted, [...] "but oughtn't that to {{make one}} all the more careful? I loved seeing you when I came in, and I have loved our few minutes together, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little nervous. Do you {{see that it is}} past two o'clock?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} he heard {{someone at the}} door, and adroitly {{changing}} his tone said: “You do not like these colours for a bed-quilt?

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> bit {{sick of the}} admin side of it. Initially I did it {{to release}} our own music, and then I {{realised}} I wasn't actually writing any music of looking after the label. So Tim was really keen to get more involved, so I trained {{him up in the}} business stuff and he's been going great guns since.|$|E
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} the lyrics was summed up by Jagger in the liner notes to the 1993 {{compilation}} Jump Back; [...] "The idea of the song {{has to do with}} our public persona at the time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> bit tired of people having a go, all that, 'oh, it's not as good as their last one' business. The single sleeve had a picture of me with a pen digging into me {{as if it were a}} sword. It was a lighthearted, anti-journalistic sort of thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ashe {{began working}} as a {{stripper}} in Seattle. Never finishing high school, she started stripping {{at the age of}} seventeen using a fake ID. [...] In an interview, Ashe once explained her career choice: [...] "I guess I'm an exhibitionist. But that's not quite true. Part of the reason is that I developed huge breasts at an early age and breasts are a very sexualized thing. At an early age <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> lot of sexualized attention. Eventually, I just felt that stripping kind of put all that stuff out on the table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go away now, my boy, {{the blow}} {{has been too}} much for me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> old man, {{and this is the}} second great blow I have had. Do not take to heart the wild words of poor little Alice. You see she {{scarcely}} knows what she is saying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} {{expected}} {{this from the}} regular officials of the law, Mr. Quest," [...] he admitted, [...] "but I must say that in your hands I had hoped--but there, there! Excuse me! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an old man, Mr. Quest. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little irritable. Disappointments affect me quickly. <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> patient. <b>I</b> will <b>be</b> patient." ...|$|R
5000|$|Holmes excuses {{himself and}} Watson, and, that evening, {{after they have}} {{returned}} to Baker Street, says:"Watson, if it should ever strike you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little overconfident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper 'Norbury' in my ear, and <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> infinitely obliged to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Until {{about two}} years ago, I tried {{to stay away from}} certain subjects. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> feeling from {{everyone}} - from the fans right through my wife and family - that if you write about hookers, you must go to hookers, and if you write about drugs, you must take drugs. I got this reputation for sinister black humour after things like Whistle Rymes, when I was getting up at six in the morning to feed my son, Christopher, and then sitting down at the piano at seven to write songs about peeping Toms and suicide cases." ...|$|E
5000|$|Carmen Salvino, {{along with}} 32 others, was a {{founding}} member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA). However, before the PBA's founding in 1958, Salvino began his professional bowling career when in 1953 he won the National Match Game Doubles with his partner Joe Wilman. According to Salvino, “The National Doubles title really kicked off my career nationally, by the time I was 21, I had won the Chicago Match Game tournament, had an ABC Tournament team title and was Chicago Bowler of the Year, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> reputation as a pretty good bowler by that time.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Director John A. Davis hired Johns to co-executive {{produce the}} 2006 computer-animated film, The Ant Bully. In a {{professional}} twist, Johns had actually fired Davis from the production staff of Olive, the Other Reindeer {{in the late}} 1990s due to tactical and budgetery reasons. Davis spoke of the unusual situation {{in an interview in}} 2010 explaining, [...] "Alex was in the uncomfortable position of telling me I was being replaced, but to hear his spin, it sounded like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> promotion! He was awesome...He did such a great job firing me, I had to hire him! The Ant Bully." [...] The film went on to gross more than $28 million at the U.S. domestic box office.|$|E
