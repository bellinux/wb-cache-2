5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage is a 1974 {{spoken word}} concert album by American singer and {{musician}} Elvis Presley. The album consists entirely of byplay and banter by Presley from between songs during a live concert—primarily jokes, with the songs themselves {{removed from the}} recording.|$|E
5|$|Presley himself {{disapproved of}} the album, {{and it was}} later {{withdrawn}} at his request. Despite this, <b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage reached number 130 on the Billboard 200, peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot Country LPs, and spawned bootleg copies along with a fan-made sequel.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} ploy by Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to self-release an Elvis Presley album through his own label, Boxcar Records. As it would not consist of content that contractually belonged to RCA Records, Parker was {{theoretically}} able to retain the profits from the album. <b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage was first distributed at Elvis Presley concerts, but RCA would later package and distribute it.|$|E

25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was <b>having</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E
25|$|After {{her death}} Mead's Samoan {{research}} was criticized by anthropologist Derek Freeman, who {{published a book}} that argued against many of Mead's conclusions. Freeman argued that Mead had misunderstood Samoan culture when she argued that Samoan culture did not place many restrictions on youths' sexual explorations. Freeman argued instead that Samoan culture prized female chastity and virginity and that Mead had been misled by her female Samoan informants. Freeman's critique was met with a considerable backlash and harsh criticism from the anthropology community, whereas it was received enthusiastically by communities of scientists who believed that sexual mores {{were more or less}} universal across cultures. Some anthropologists who studied Samoan culture argued in favor of Freeman's findings and contradicted those of Mead, whereas others argued that Freeman's work did not invalidate Mead's work because Samoan culture had been changed by the integration of Christianity in the decades between Mead's and Freeman's fieldwork periods. While Mead was careful to shield the identity of all her subjects for confidentiality Freeman was able to find and interview one of her original participants, and Freeman reported that she admitted to having wilfully misled Mead. She said that she and her friends were <b>having</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> Mead and telling her stories.|$|E
500|$|<b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage {{has been}} {{considered}} to be Presley's worst album; critics felt that the compilation of banter was incoherent, and lacked context due to {{the removal of the}} songs that his remarks related to. In their 1991 book, Jimmy Guterman and Owen O'Donnell named <b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage the worst rock and roll album of all time, duly noting its lack of actual [...] "rock and roll".|$|E

500|$|<b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage {{has been}} {{described}} as the worst album of Elvis Presley's career. Critics felt that the album's material was spliced in a manner lacking any continuity and nearly devoid of comprehensibility, let alone humor. Mark Deming of AllMusic states that [...] "some have called <b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage thoroughly unlistenable, but actually it's worse than that; hearing it is like witnessing an auto wreck that somehow plowed into a carnival freak show, leaving onlookers at once too horrified and too baffled to turn away." [...] Nick Greene, a writer for Mental Floss, felt that the material presented on the record is [...] "so incoherent, you don't really get an idea of his stage presence, despite the fact that all the audio comes from his shows." [...] Rock critics Jimmy Guterman and Owen O'Donnell, writing in their 1991 book The Worst Rock and Roll Records of All Time, named it the worst rock album ever, although one could easily note the lack of [...] "rock and roll" [...] in the record.|$|E
500|$|Hemlock Hoax, the Detective was {{produced}} by the Lubin Manufacturing Company, a company founded by German-American film pioneer Siegmund Lubin.

[...] Writing for his own website, he speculated that a scene portraying the singer and the two fellow women pulling a towel from a man's waist could feature Stan's real-life boyfriend Bogdan Stăruială.|$|E

500|$|The album {{peaked at}} number 130 {{on the main}} Billboard album chart, and peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot Country LPs chart. At the request of Presley, the album was {{eventually}} deleted. However, bootlegs of the album are popular, and an anonymous person created a <b>Having</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>With</b> Elvis on Stage, Part Two record that has been circulated.

Backed by synthesizers and keyboards, it is Suzuki's first English language recording and her vocals are processed through pro-tools such as autotune and vocoder.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera also commented {{about the}} album during an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest, [...] "It's really a fun, fun record. Really futuristic. I {{was inspired by a}} lot of electronic music, electronic artists, and so you'll hear all those elements". She added, [...] " [...] different textures and things with my voice that I was really playing around with and <b>having</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> on this record that I never even knew I could do, vocally".

Michaels met with Penguins' owner Mario Lemieux {{and sat with}} former Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive lineman Brett Keisel during the game. Keisel also gave Michaels {{a tour of the}} city including at the Steelers headquarters and having lunch at Primanti Brothers in the city's Strip District.

500|$|During the {{introduction}} sequence, Seifer cuts Squall across {{the left side}} of his face with his gunblade, leaving a scar. Squall retaliates with a backhand slash that leaves Seifer with a mirrored scar. At the following field exam in Dollet, Seifer acts independently from his teammates Squall and Zell, abandoning them; consequently, he fails and is not promoted to SeeD. Spurred by dreams of a brighter future, he defects to Sorceress Edea so he could be her [...] "knight". From his point of view, Squall and the others are [...] "evil" [...] and he recognizes himself as a hero. As Seifer is brainwashed by the sorceress, he alienates himself from his friends. Eventually, Fujin and Raijin abandon him and he is defeated shortly afterward. Following Edea's defeat, the party confronts Seifer one last time as he now serves Ultimecia, and either they or Gilgamesh defeat him. Seifer escapes, kidnapping Rinoa and bringing her to Adel.

500|$|... "Free Free" [...] was written, composed, arranged, {{produced}} and recorded by Nakata himself. Musically, [...] "Free Free" [...] {{is the creation}} of a newly founded genre by Nakata titled Eropop, which he generated by combining 1980s pop, house and disco music; furthermore, the single also incorporates influences of contemporary EDM. In a review by CD Journal, an editor agreed, and also noted the songs style as [...] "80s nostalgic" [...] and [...] "ultra-pop". Conversely, Kyle from Arama Japan noticed its strong influence of house music, and branded it a [...] "J-electro" [...] track. The track was recorded with [...] "Super Music Maker" [...] between June–July 2007 at Nakata's home studio and Avex Studios in Tokyo, Japan, and was co-distributed by Nakata's record label Contemode, which was owned by Avex and Yamaha. Suzuki's vocals were processed with pro-tools such as autotune and vocoder, all programmed and managed to Nakata. The lyrical content of the recording is based on the theme of freedom and <b>having</b> <b>fun.</b> <b>With</b> that said, erotica is another factor that inspired the tracks lyrics and Suzuki's image for the track; she commented [...] "the theme [...] is to sound erotic,".
