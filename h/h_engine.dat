50|$|Despite {{the name}} {{it is not}} an <b>H</b> <b>engine</b> or {{horizontally}} opposed engine, but a slanted inline-4. The <b>H</b> <b>engine</b> was introduced in 1981 in the Saab 900 and was also used in the Saab 99 from 1982 onwards. It continued in use in the 900/9-3, 9000, and 9-5. The 2003 GM Epsilon-based 9-3 switched to the GM Ecotec engine, leaving the 9-5 as the sole user of the <b>H</b> <b>engine.</b> The last model year for this family of engines was 2009. The tooling and know-how was sold to BAIC.|$|E
5000|$|The 1H is {{not related}} to the later <b>H</b> <b>engines.</b> It was also an all-iron, OHV engine, {{licensed}} from Austin (B engine). With a bore and stroke of 73 and 89 mm it displaced 1,489 cc, power was [...] at 4,400 rpm in 1956, but this increased to [...] in August 1958. The license agreement terminated in the late 1950th and the Nissan G engine was a more compact replacement, which in turn became replaced by the (below) Nissan <b>H</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

The H-4 and H-6 engines produced by Subaru are not <b>H</b> <b>engines</b> at all, but boxer engines. The Subaru H-4 and H-6 designs are so named because they are horizontally opposed pistons.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the more}} {{powerful}} S 3/6 express locomotive had been available since 1908, the number of S 3/5 <b>H</b> <b>engines</b> had climbed to 30 by 1911, partly because there was insufficient funding for the expensive S 3/6.

50|$|The Rapier was {{the first}} of Napier's <b>H</b> {{cylinder}} <b>engines.</b> The rationale for the H is fairly straightforward, in that rather than having an engine with fewer large cylinders, more small cylinders could simply be added. It was believed that an <b>H</b> pattern <b>engine</b> would provide substantially more power and higher RPM's for the same frontal area as a large liquid-cooled V engine. The maximum RPM in a dive was 4,800.|$|R
5000|$|... in 1923 the North British Railway {{became part}} of the LNER, during the {{superheating}} programme. The LNER designation for Class <b>H</b> <b>engines</b> was Class C11. However, as six engines were not yet superheated, and therefore inherited by the LNER as Class I engines, these were given LNER designation of Class C10. They reverted to the C11 designation, one by one, as their superheaters were installed between 1923 and 1925.|$|R
