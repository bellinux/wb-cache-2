25|$|The superiorâ€“subordinate {{relationship}} {{is an important}} relational factor. Employees who perceive they have a higher-quality relationship with their supervisors are more often to use articulated dissent. They feel their supervisors respect their opinions {{and that they have}} mutual influence and persuasion over the outcome of organizational decisions. Conversely, employees that perceive their relationship with their supervisor as low-quality will resort to latent dissent. They <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no room to voice their opinions (Kassing, 2000).|$|E
25|$|Other {{opinion polls}} have shown Romanians {{to be more}} {{intolerant}} with regard to homosexuality, including a 2003 poll conducted by Gallup for the Institute for Public Policies. In the poll, 45% of respondents said homosexuals should not be treated the same as others in society; 37% thought homosexuality should be criminalized; and 40% thought homosexuals {{should not be allowed}} to live in Romania. The Soros Foundation also conducted in June 2011 a survey where 80% of the respondents <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no justification for the acceptance of homosexuality even though it has not been illegal since 2001.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E

500|$|Writer Glen Morgan {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Duchovny {{challenged}} us to do a [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] for him. The {{show had}} been so dark and bleak, and Jim and I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a side to the paranormal that's very hopeful. We {{wanted to do that}} side of it. I {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity for Duchovny, but then the situation came up with Gillian's pregnancy. We needed to get her off her feet anyway." [...] Consequently, Gillian Anderson, who had just given birth to her daughter Piper days before this episode spent the majority of the episode in a hospital bed.|$|E
500|$|While some of {{the members}} lacked {{conventional}} musical skills, they were [...] "politically very right" [...] and quickly adapted to improvising. Because of the nature of free improvisation, the women were able to perform together without concerns about competency. Georgie Born said that FIG functioned very differently from a mixed group: [...] "when you are playing with men, {{there is an element of}} competition; they tend to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a threat from women. In an all-women band we are released from that kind of pressure." [...] Born added that without men, women are more honest and open with each other, and are more receptive to what each member of the group is doing.|$|E

2500|$|Quine's chief {{objection}} to analyticity {{is with the}} notion of synonymy (sameness of meaning), a sentence being analytic, just in case it substitutes a synonym for one [...] "black" [...] in a proposition like [...] "All black things are black" [...] (or any other logical truth). The {{objection to}} synonymy hinges upon the problem of collateral information. We intuitively <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a distinction between [...] "All unmarried men are bachelors" [...] and [...] "There have been black dogs", but a competent English speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to collateral information bearing on the historical existence of black dogs. Quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or analytic truths.|$|E
2500|$|In one of {{his first}} such cases, in 1894, he {{represented}} Alice N. Lincoln, a Boston philanthropist and noted crusader for the poor. He appeared at public hearings to promote investigations into conditions in the public poor-houses. Lincoln, who had visited these poor-houses for years, saw inmates dwelling in misery and the temporarily unemployed thrown in together with the mentally ill and hardened criminals. Brandeis spent nine months and held fifty-seven public hearings, at one such hearing proclaiming, [...] "Men are not bad. Men are degraded largely by circumstances....It is the duty of every man...to help them up and let them <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some hope for them in life." [...] As a result of the hearings, the board of aldermen decreed that the administration of the poor law would be completely reorganized.|$|E
2500|$|... "Disorders of sex development" [...] (DSD) is a contested term, defined {{to include}} {{congenital}} {{conditions in which}} development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their [...] "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". While it adopted the term, to open [...] "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested {{the adoption of the}} terminology and its implied status as a [...] "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{neurotic}} person's self {{is split}} between an idealized self {{and a real}} self. As a result, neurotic individuals feel that they somehow do {{not live up to}} the ideal self. They <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a flaw somewhere in comparison to what they [...] "should" [...] be. The goals set out by the neurotic are not , or indeed possible. The real self then degenerates into a [...] "despised self", and the neurotic person assumes that this is the [...] "true" [...] self. Thus, the neurotic is like a clock's pendulum, oscillating between a fallacious [...] "perfection" [...] and a manifestation of self-hate. Horney referred to this phenomenon as the [...] "tyranny of the shoulds" [...] and the neurotic's hopeless [...] "search for glory". She concluded that these ingrained traits of the psyche forever prevent an individual's potential from being actualized unless the cycle of neurosis is somehow broken, through treatment or, in less severe cases, life lessons.|$|E
2500|$|In a May 2017 {{interview}} with Rockbook, frontman James LaBrie stated that Dream Theater plans to release their fourteenth studio album in 2018. He commented: [...] "We're pretty psyched because {{we already know}} what we're gonna do. But I'm not gonna tell you. It's really important for us that the new album will be our best effort. It should be who we are at that particular moment. We still want to create something that's better than what we did before. That's what keeps you interested in what you do. But if along the way we <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> another album we should recognize once again, then we'll do it." [...] LaBrie also stated that the band will concentrate on [...] "one album {{at a time and}} not thinking in a concept", and added, [...] "Unless we wanna write an epic song that has multiple parts in it. Doing something like that might be cool. Something like A Change of Seasons. But a whole album again, no." [...] The album is currently slated for early 2019.|$|E
2500|$|Kim Skotte of Politiken {{wrote that}} [...] "there are imagesâ€”many imagesâ€”in Melancholia which {{underline}} that Lars von Trier {{is a unique}} film storyteller", and [...] "the choice of material and treatment of it underlines Lars von Trier's originality." [...] Skotte also compared it to the director's previous film: [...] "Through its material and look, Melancholia creates rifts, but unlike Antichrist I don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a fence pole in the rift which is smashed directly down into the meat. You sit on your seat in the cinema and mildly marveled go along {{in the end of}} the world." [...] Berlingskes Ebbe Iversen wrote about the film: [...] "It is big, it is enigmatic, and now and then rather irritating. But it is also a visionary work, which makes a gigantic impression." [...] The critic continued: [...] "From time to time the film moves on the edge of kitsch, but with Justine played by Kirsten Dunst and Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourg as the leading characters, Melancholia is a bold, uneven, unruly and completely unforgettable film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eliot's {{childhood}} {{infatuation with}} literature can be ascribed to several factors. Firstly, {{he had to}} overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double inguinal hernia, he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socializing with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books and was absorbed in tales depicting savages, the Wild West, or Mark Twain's thrill-seeking Tom Sawyer. In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot [...] "would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living." [...] Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: [...] "It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something in having passed one's childhood beside the big river, which is incommunicable {{to those people who}} have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London." ...|$|E
