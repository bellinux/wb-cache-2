40|$|Solid Waste Management {{is one of}} the {{essential}} services provided by local bodies to keep the urban areas clean. Often it is poorly rendered as it is unscientific, out-dated and inefficient. With the rapid increase in population, livening standards, the generation rates of solid waste are increasing drastically. The landfill waste includes both organic and inorganic wastes as it is not often effectively segregated before disposal. The problem is acute in developing countries such as India. Bangalore city, with a population of about 10. 18 million and more than 2000 industries, generates about 4, 500 TPD of municipal solid waste. Of this Presently, various municipal solid waste processing units in Bangalore can handle only about 2100 TPD of waste. Mavallipura landfill developed and operated by M/s. Ramky Environmental Engineers, located 40 km away from Bangalore, is being used for disposing of about 1000 TPD, the installed capacity being only 600 TPD of waste. There are also a few dumps in around Bangalore due to historical reasons and insufficient capacity of various designated landfills. To reclaim the old dump sites/closed landfill sites for infrastructural development, it is necessary to know their geotechnical characteristics. Within the Landfill, the characteristics of the waste may change with depth due to degraded wastes as it has been dumped over a period of time. The physical parameters, chemical properties as well as the geotechnical behaviour of the waste change with depth. MSW is known to be a heterogeneous material of varying constituent types and dimensions, containing elements that degrade with time. To consider MSW as a geo-material to support the foundation of structures such as buildings and pavement, an analysis of the bearing capacity of the foundation and further long-term settlement of MSW is essential. The MSW samples are retrieved from a Mavallipura landfill site, Bangalore and analysed for important geotechnical properties such as compaction characteristics, shear strength, permeability, compressibility behaviour and dynamic properties of MSW using ultrasonic and cyclic triaxial tests. This research thus aims to provide valuable information about landfill sites for reclamation, closure and infrastructural development after the closure of landfills. Scanty data are available on the geotechnical properties of waste from landfill sites with varying degrees of degradation. This landfill site is selected as there is a huge environmental concern regarding the soil and groundwater contamination in the area and also can represent a typical landfill scenario in tropical regions. Quantification, quality assessment, consequent treatment and management of leachate have become a monstrous problem world over. In this context, the present study envisages to study the physicochemical and biological characterization of representative urban municipal landfill leachate and nearby water bodies and attempts to figure out relationships between the various parameters together with understanding the various processes for chemical transformations. The analysis shows intermediate leachate age (5 - 10 years) with higher nutrient levels i. e. 10, 000 - 12, 000 mg/l and ~ 2, 000 - 3, 000 mg/l of carbon (COD) and nitrogen (TKN) respectively. Elemental analysis and underlying mechanisms reveal chemical precipitation and co-precipitation as the vital processes in leachate pond systems resulting in accumulation of trace metals in these systems. The microbial analysis also correlated with specific factors relevant to redox environments that show a gradient in nature and the abundance of biotic diversity with a change in leachate environment. Finally, the quality and the contamination potential of the sampled leachate were performed with the help of potential leachate index (LPI) analysis and water quality index (WQI) analysis for surrounding water bodies (namely surface pond and open well) of Mavallipura landfill site. A geotechnical testing program has been drawn to evaluate the engineering properties of municipal solid waste samples retrieved from a landfill at Mavallipura at various depths through augur within the landfill dumped area. Laboratory studies included are composition, moisture content, particle size analysis, compaction, permeability, direct shear test, consolidation, triaxial compression test. For the laboratory tests, we had considered maximum particle sizes of less than 4. 75 mm only. Standard Proctor Compaction tests yielded a maximum dry density of 7. 0 kN/m 3 at 50 % optimum moisture content. The permeability of MSW results shows in the range of 4 x 10 - 4 cm/sec. Compression index of MSW is 0. 46980 and recompression index of MSW is 0. 09454. Results obtained from the rectangular hyperbola method are compared with Casagrande and Taylor methods to prove that this method is reliable equally, and results are reasonably accurate. Based on direct shear tests, the MSW sample exhibited continuous strength gain with an increase in shear strain (16 %) to define strength. The cohesion of MSW was 10 kPa and friction angle is 34 °. Based on the elastic constants results obtained from the direct shear test found to be very soft material. In the triaxial test, the MSW sample exhibited continuous strength gain with an increase in axial strain. The frictional component is increased due to sliding and rolling of fibrous particles over one another resulting in the development of apparent cohesion due to antiparticle bonds within the MSW material. Landfills {{are an integral part of}} waste management, and disastrous consequences can happen if seismic vulnerability of these landfills is not considered. Dynamic properties of MSW are required to perform seismic response analysis of MSW landfills, but there is no good understanding of the dynamic shear strength of MSW in literature. A comprehensive laboratory cyclic triaxial testing program has been taken up to determine the properties at different densities, confining pressures and shear strains. MSW degrades with time, and its shear modulus and damping are expected to vary with time and degradation. For the density of 6 kN/m 3 the dynamic shear modulus values for MSW varied from 0. 68 MPa to 5. 38 MPa and damping ratio varied from 20 % to 40 % for MSW. For the density of 7 kN/m 3 the dynamic shear modulus values for MSW varied from 1. 8 MPa to 7. 5 MPa and Damping ratio varied from 23 % to 40 % for MSW. For the density of 8 kN/m 3 dynamic shear modulus values for MSW varied from 2. 46 MPa to 8. 00 MPa and damping ratio varied from 16 % to 33 % for MSW. Also, the ultrasonic testing method was used for determining the dynamic properties at low strains. The Ultrasonic test results indicated that with an increase in density of the sample and with decreased void ratio, the pulse propagation velocity (Vp) increases. With an increase in the density, the shear wave velocity and elastic constants (elastic modulus and shear modulus) increase. The elastic constant values obtained from the ultrasonic test are higher compared to values obtained from unconsolidated-undrained triaxial tests. Also, the carbon stored in the buried organic matter in Mavallipura landfill is estimated. Total organic carbon increases steeply with an increase in depth and is significantly high at a depth of 6 m. Subsurface properties cannot be specified but must be analysed through in-situ tests. The in-situ testing that are carried out in a landfill are boring, sampling, standard penetration test (SPT), dynamic cone penetration test (DCPT) and plate load tests (under static and cyclic condition). A correlation between corrected SPT ‘N’ values and measured using shear wave velocities has been developed for Mavallipura landfill site. Results show that the corrected SPT- N values increase with depth. Corrected N-values are used in the landfill design, so they are consistent with the design method, and correlations are useful. The results obtained from the dynamic cone penetration tests shows lower value when to compare with standard penetration test. The unit weight profile with depth ranged from a low unit weight of 2. 48 kN/m 3 near the surface to a highest value of approximately 9. 02 kN/m 3 at a depth of 6 m. The highest temperatures for landfills were reported at mid-waste elevations with temperatures decreasing near the top. The bearing pressure-settlement curves for plate size 75 cm and 60 cm presented similar behaviour while the plate size of 60 cm curve presents a lesser settlement of 70 mm, compared to with plate size of the 75 cm curve with the settlement of 80 mm and failure mode could be classified as punching shear. The cyclic plate load test with plate size of 60 cm and 75 cm were carried out on the soil cover. The elastic constants were found to be 73. 87 and 96. 84 kPa/mm and for 60 and 75 cm plates respectively. Geophysical testing may not be as precise but has the benefit of covering large areas at small costs and sometimes can locate features that might be missing by conventional borings. Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) is an indirect geophysical method used in the landfill for the characterization of the municipal solid waste site. The Mavallipura landfill was surveyed up to the length of about 35 m at the top level. A series of one-dimensional and two-dimensional MASW surveys used active seismic sources such as sledgehammer (5 kg) and propelled energy generator (PEG- 40) was used. This hammer was instrumented with geophones to trigger record time. All the testing has been carried out with geophone spacing of 1 m and recorded surface wave arrivals using the source to first receiver distance as 5 m with recording length of 1000 millisecond and the recording sampling interval of 0. 5 milliseconds (ms) were applied. Results shows that the PEG- 40 hammer can generate the longest wavelength with a maximum depth of penetration. The shear wave velocity varies from 75 to 155 m/s with an increase in depth of about 27. 5 m. Based on the site characterization at the landfill site, it was found that the Mavallipura landfill site can be categorized as very loose, and it is still in a continued stage of degradation. Shear wave and P-wave velocity profile for eight major locations in the study area were determined and variation of waste material stiffness corresponding to the in-situ state with depth, was also evaluated. Also, MASW survey has been carried out to develop dispersion curve on another landfill site at Bhandewadi, Nagpur. MASW system consisting of 24 channels geode seismograph with 24 geophones of 4. 5 Hz capacity is used in this investigation. The seismic waves were created by sledgehammer with 30 cmx 30 cmx 2 cm size <b>hammer</b> <b>plate</b> with ten shots. These waves were captured by the geophones/receivers and further analyzed by inversion. The results indicated that near surface soils(less than 3 m depth) approximately the to 5 mm, and with 85 % of dry weight basis of waste particles with sizes less than 10 mm, the shear wave velocity varies from 75 to 140 m/s (frequency ranges from 30 to 23 Hz). With the increase in 6. 5 m depth, the shear wave velocity ranged from 140 to 225 m/s (frequency ranges 23 to 13 Hz). Overall, the results of the study showed that seismic surveys have the potential to capture the changes in dynamic properties like shear wave velocity and Poisson’s ratio of the depth of MSW landfill to infer the extent of degradation and provide dynamic properties needed for seismic stability evaluations. Based on the in situ and laboratory results of this study and a review of the literature, the unit weight, shear wave velocity, strain-dependent normalized shear modulus reduction and material damping ratio relationships for Mavallipura landfill are developed and also validated using semi-empirical methods. Finally, seismic response analysis of Mavallipura landfill has been carried out using the computer programs like SHAKE 2000 and DEEPSOIL. Results show that the unit weight is increased with depth in response to the increase in overburden stress. The proposed material damping ratio and normalized shear modulus reduction curve lie close to the profile given in the literature for landfills composed of waste materials with 100 % particles sized less than 20 mm. Peak spectral acceleration at 5 % damping value is 0. 7 g for 0. 07 sec in SHAKE 2000 and peak spectral acceleration at 5 % damping value is 0. 63 g for 0. 04 sec in DEEPSOIL. Amplification ratio is 6. 11 at 1. 1 l Hz in SHAKE 2000 and 4. 65 at 2. 67 Hz in DEEPSOIL. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) for the landfill site, it is observed PGA has decreased from 0. 3 g to 0. 15 g in DEEPSOIL and PGA has decreased from 0. 33 g to 0. 15 g in SHAKE 2000. The studies presented in the thesis brought out the importance of characterization of municipal solid waste leachate regarding metabolism and treatment/degradation of Mavallipura landfill leachate. For municipal solid waste of with sizes ranging from 0. 08 coefficient of permeability being about 10 - 4 cm/sec, the compression index was about 0. 47. A more reliable method of calculating the coefficient of consolidation has been recommended. Correlations between shear wave velocity and SPT-N values has been developed for the Mavallipura landfill site. The results showed that the dynamic cone penetration tests values are lower than indicated by standard penetration tests. The cyclic plate load tests carried out with plate sizes of 75 cm and 60 cm showed that elastic constants of 96. 84 kPa/mm and 73. 87 kPa/mm respectively. MSW properties evaluated in this thesis are compared with those of soft clays. The MSW properties showed higher values (strength and SBC) and lower values of compressibility, compared with those of soft clays. Thus foundation improvement on MSW is less challenging than foundations on soft soils. Also stabilization of MSW with other solid wastes such as fly ash can be considered as an economical option. Based on detailed studies the importance of unit weight, shear wave velocity, strain-dependent normalized shear modulus reduction and material damping ratio relationships for landfill waste have been developed. Based on the site characterization, the waste landfill has been categorized as very loose material, which is still in a degradation process. SHAKE 2000 software shows higher PGA value comparing with DEEPSOIL...|$|E

40|$|Today {{large amounts}} of good quality cold stored foods are thrown away due to {{expiration}} of labeled static shelf life. In order to minimize waste and improve product safety {{there is a need}} to study the concept of a dynamic shelf life. One approach in this area is the three year Vinnova funded innovation project DYNAHMAT (in Swedish: Dynamiskt Hållbarhetsdatum för Minimerat Svinn), operated by Lund University together with the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology (SIK) and Malmö University. The project goal is to develop intelligent logistics- and packaging systems that communicate and predict quality and product safety of cold stored food in real-time. Since shelf-life of such products most often is limited by microbial action models describing growth of the specific organism responsible for spoilage must be applied. For the models to predict time to spoilage an input variable representing the initial amount of the specific spoilage organism (SSO) is needed. The aim of this thesis work is to determine the initial concentration of the SSO responsible for spoilage of modified atmosphere packed (MAP) cod, previously identified as Photobacterium phosphoreum. With the starting concentration known, the purpose is furthermore to validate an existing shelf-life predictive model that is ought to be applied in the DYNAHMAT project. Moreover, the intention is to identify and characterize the general spoilage flora of MAP cod. Initial cultivation and storage studies revealed aerobically incubated Long and <b>Hammer</b> <b>plates</b> as the most appropriate method for determination of the initial amount of the SSO. Partial 16 s rRNA gene sequencing identified glass-like colonies growing on these plates as members of the Photobacterium family, but was unfortunately not enough to distinguish P. phosphoreum from other closely related Photobacterium species. Based on the assumption that observed glass-like colonies are P. phosphoreum, performed long term storage study resulted in an initial concentration of 2. 15 log (cfu/g) for fish fillets packed in an modified atmosphere immediately after filleting. Shelf-life model validation revealed that the model is able to accurately illustrate growth of P. phosphoreum and based on existing sensory rejection evaluation hence predict shelf-life of MA-packed cod. Future studies including multi-locus gene analysis need to be performed in order to reliably conclude that glass-like colonies aerobically cultivated on Long and <b>Hammer</b> <b>plates</b> exclusively belong to the specie P. phosphoreum. If the outcome of these studies reveals a mixed Photobacterium flora the respective species must be inoculated into fresh cod and spoilage development must be studied in order to confirm P. phosphoreum as the SSO of MA-packed cod and exclude other species contribution to fish spoilage. Last but not least, the performed long term storage study needs to be repeated in order to find a truly representative initial concentration of the SSO that hence can be used to accurately predict shelf-life of MA-packed cod in the DYNAHMAT project...|$|R

50|$|For instance, two {{processes}} {{were used}} in constructing iron armor. In the first, hammering, large lumps of iron of scrap or puddled iron were heated to welding temperature and placed under heavy steel hammers. Repeated blows welded these lumps into one solid plate and shaped it to the required form and dimensions. <b>Hammered</b> iron <b>plate</b> was the armor used in the earliest ironclad vessels, including HMS Warrior. The second method, rolling, involved stacking iron lumps atop one another, heating them to welding temperature and passing them between two iron rollers to become one plate of the required size. Rolled iron was difficult to produce initially, as it required machinery of immense size and great power. However, when the Special Committee tested both types of plate in 1863, it found that rolled iron was superior to hammered due to greater uniformity in quality. The committee and iron manufacturers worked together on how to more easily produce rolled plate, which became standard use in warships beginning in 1865.|$|R

The male adult of B. flavomarginata is distinguished from its congeners by the blackish-brown body color and distinct head marking, hemitergal triangular chitin plates, and a median semicircular smooth subgenital <b>plate</b> (<b>hammer)</b> on the abdominal sternum IX. The female adult has a large and round subgenital plate which extends to the posterior margin of the abdominal sternum X. The nymph can be distinguished by the relatively small compound eyes and the body covered by many long stout setae and short golden brown hair-like setae. This species is known in southwestern China (Yunnan Province) and northern Vietnam (Lao Cai Province, Cao Bang Province) ...|$|R
5000|$|Having never {{experienced}} adversity, he has fewer {{of the tools}} for coping {{than some of the}} others. Though he tries to keep such thoughts from surfacing, he's scared. He's over his head in this mission; he thought he'd be gone for a month and then go home to share his adventures with his folks. But what has happened is unthinkable, and often he has the sensation that it's just a bad dream, that he will wake up in his bedroom at home, to the sound of his mother singing in the garden, and his father <b>hammering</b> copper <b>plate</b> for sculpture. Rick Berman, Michael Piller, Jeri Taylor, Harry Kim's description, Star Trek: Voyager Bible, 1995 The character went through more than one name prior to casting, with it being called Jay Osaka at one point. The series bible for Star Trek: Voyager described Kim as being a sheltered individual who had sought to repay the love of his parents through fulfilling their expectations for him at Starfleet Academy. [...] Winrich Kolbe, the director of the Voyager pilot [...] "Caretaker", was involved in the casting process and found Kim difficult as there wasn't a great number of young Asian actors to choose from. He said that the role was an [...] "inexperienced, naive character", and that the actor cast as Kim would need to fight to stay in the forefront of episodes.|$|R
25|$|The {{entire process}} is reconstructed by Brekle as follows: First, the inscription's text was {{engraved}} {{with an iron}} stylus into an even copper or bronze block, with its letters facing the opposite direction and running from right to left. The displaced material rose up {{on both sides of}} the letter grooves forming two sharp, parallel ridges. In the second step, the inscribed side of the stamp block was placed on the plane gold sheet and sufficient pressure, either manually or by <b>hammering</b> onto a <b>plate</b> laid on top, was exerted from above to transmit the text. What produced the print image were the ridges caused by the material displacement; these left shallow double lines in the foil, thus creating the text. The actual, sunken letter lines were not transferred during the imprinting procedure, since they did not enter the surface of the foil.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an available method of seismic prospecting especiallydesigned for engineering purposes. To explore minute geological structures and to study physical properties of rocklayers, seismic prospectings in the adit have been employed. But experiments in theadit are attended generally with the trouble about velocity lowering {{in the wall}} bythe wethering effect and the trouble about the experimental apparatus, and much timeand much expense are used up. In order to keep away these troubles, the field works were performed on the groundsurface in stead of in the adit and the measurements in the borehole were made withthree component installations of geophones clamped {{on the wall of}} the cased boreholein any depth. The small explosion shots were detonated in shot holes to observe P wavesand S waves, and the <b>plate</b> <b>hammering</b> shots were smitten at the mouth of the measuringhole and the geophone was moved to get S wave distribution along the hole...|$|R
5000|$|The method {{utilizes}} equipment typically {{employed in}} seismic refraction surveys. This equipment {{consists of a}} seismograph, geophones placed in an array, and a seismic source. An array consists of 6 to 48+ geophones placed at some interval along the ground surface to measure the propagating waves and are connected to a seismograph that records the data. Rayleigh waves are generated from seismic sources described to be active, passive, {{or a combination of}} both. For example, active sources can be generated sources from a sledge <b>hammer</b> striking a <b>plate</b> or other sources that are created near the traverse. Passive sources can be nearby highway traffic, construction equipment working in the distance, etc. Several recordings (typically 15 to 60+ seconds long) are captured and stored for later analysis. As multiple traverses are performed along the ground surface, the 1-D profiles can be compiled to generate a 2-D profile of the subsurface conditions. It is worth noting that since seismic traverses typically [...] "average" [...] conditions along the traverse length to some extent, the expectations and limitations of geophysical methods should be realized.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{prognosis}} {{of double}} penetrating ocular trauma is usually guarded. We report the good anatomical and functional outcome {{in a patient}} with double-penetrating ocular trauma associated with intraorbital foreign body. A 58 -year-old man presented at the emergency room complaining of blurred vision of the left eye with stinging pain after he <b>hammered</b> an iron <b>plate.</b> Best-corrected visual acuity was hand movement/ 30  cm. Subconjunctival hemorrhage with one 1. 4 -mm laceration wound was noted over the nasal conjunctiva. Fundus examination showed vitreous hemorrhage with one whitish patch over the nasal retina. Orbital computed tomography scan revealed one metallic foreign body at the posterior nasal upper orbit. Double-penetrating globe injury with intraorbital foreign body was impressed, and immediate vitrectomy surgery with endolaser photocoagulation was carried out. One exit wound nasal to the disc was noted during operation. The intraorbital metallic foreign body was left alone. Vision recovered to 6 / 8. 6 without ocular complication after a 20 -month follow-up. Prompt, careful preoperative evaluation and meticulous vitrectomy intervention are essential in the successful management of such patients. Posteriorly located intraorbital metallic foreign body should be managed conservatively. Long-term regular electroretinography evaluation is needed for possible retinal toxicity from intraorbital foreign body...|$|R
40|$|For the {{modeling}} of percussive (non‐sustained) sounds, the excitation signal {{can be estimated}} from an original sound in several ways, usually by a time‐domain deconvolution process. The source signal obtained by such a process cannot {{be compared with the}} original excitation because it is usually unknown. Hence in most of the approaches available in the literature, the validation of the deconvolution process is quantifed in terms of spectral flatness, i. e. a source signal is considered as a good estimation of the excitation when most of the resonant content has been removed. However, the excitation signal is usually a percussive burst, the time domain properties of which are known to be very important, at least perceptually speaking. To evaluate the time domain properties of the estimated excitation, we propose in this paper to compare the estimated excitation to the recording of the acceleration of the <b>hammer</b> hitting a <b>plate.</b> In the recordings considered, the evolution of the acceleration of the hammer has a specifc pattern with several peaks due to the bouncing of the hammer on the suspended plate. This specifc pattern allows us to propose a metric that can be useful for objectively measuring the quality of the estimation process...|$|R
