However, across certain offshoring arrangements, types of firms, and types of jobs I find that tax incentives {{have little or no}} association with where offshored U. <b>S.</b> <b>jobs</b> are moved suggesting that there is cross sectional variation in the importance of tax incentives in labor offshoring decisions.

50|$|The {{issue is}} {{illustrated}} by an example from Smith/Goldman’s later paper “Doing the Best One Can”. A graduate student asks faculty member S for comments on a paper he plans to present at a <b>job</b> interview. If <b>S</b> agrees and comments on the paper, the student will improve the paper substantially, have a highly successful interview, and receive an offer for a three-year <b>job.</b> If <b>S</b> accepts the task but fails {{to comment on the}} paper in time, the student will make no revisions, have a dismal interview, and receive no <b>job</b> offer. If <b>S</b> declines to provide comments, the student will elicit comments from a less expert faculty member, make less helpful revisions on the paper, have a moderately successful interview, and receive a one-year <b>job</b> offer. Clearly <b>S’s</b> accepting the task would enable her to follow the ideal course of action, namely reading and commenting on the paper in a timely way, resulting in the student’s receiving a three-year job. However, in reality if S accepted the task, she would actually fail to comment on the paper in time, either because she would misunderstand the deadline, or because she of her time-consuming administrative chores. In this case the student would receive no job offer. Possibilism recommends that S agree to comment, that would support her intent to follow the best course of action. Actualism takes a more realistic stance: it recommends that S decline since that would lead to a better outcome. Smith argues this case requires the same reasoning as a prudential decision, such as deciding to drive carefully to avoid a crash.|$|R
