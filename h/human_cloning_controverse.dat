This research explores the discursive basis for support and opposition to <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> by examining the role of abortion-related rhetoric in constructing the concept of <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> within the American press. An in-depth content analysis of <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> news coverage was conducted on a sample of articles collected from the mainstream press as well as advocacy publications with either a pro-science or Christian fundamentalist orientation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the moral, ethical and legal aspects of reproductive <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> After examining {{the facts about}} cloning, this thesis tackles the difficult question of whether <b>humans</b> should be <b>cloned.</b> This is explored through an in-depth analysis of the moral and ethical acceptability of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> The author concludes that <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> should never be attempted and that consequently such a practice should be permanently prohibited by a legal norm. This thesis then surveys national legislation and international law {{to see if there}} presently exists a prohibition of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> This thesis then examines possible future legal action regarding <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> and suggests a legislative scheme. Finally, possible constitutional challenges to future Canadian legislation prohibiting <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> are analyzed. This analysis focuses on the right to liberty and the right to security of the person entrenched in section 7 and the right to equality embodied in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

40|$|Abstract In 1998, the Council for Science and Technology {{established}} the Bioethics Committee and asked {{its members to}} examine the ethical and legal aspects of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> The Committee concluded in 1999 that <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> should be prohibited, and, based on the report, the government presented a bill for the regulation of <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> in 2000. After a debate in the Diet, the original bill was slightly modified and issued on December 6, 2000. In this paper, I {{take a closer look}} at this process and discuss some of the ethical problems that were debated. Also, I make a brief analysis of the concept “the sprout of human life. ” Not only people who object to <b>human</b> <b>cloning,</b> but also many of those who seek to promote research on <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> admit that a human embryo is the sprout of human life and, hence, it should be highly respected.

40|$|International audienceThe {{issue of}} <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> has {{featured}} in the national science policy agendas in both the United States and the United Kingdom since the announcement in 1997 of Dolly the cloned sheep's birth in Scotland.
