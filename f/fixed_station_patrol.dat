40|$|International audienceMobile {{sensors can be}} {{interesting}} {{in the context of}} monitoring of noise levels and airborne pollutant concentrations, to obtain measurements over a large zone with one single sensor, and to increase the spatial accuracy of predictions, while avoiding some expensive modelling. Mobile sensors can be combined to classical <b>fixed</b> <b>station,</b> to improve the accuracy and the reliability of predictions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore how mobile measurements should be processed to obtain reliable estimations in spite of the strong variability of the data collected. Mobile measurements have been collected on a bicycle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), in an area of Gent (Belgium). The 1 s-sound pressure levels and 1 s-black carbon concentrations evolutions were measured. In addition, 5 continuous monitoring <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> were placed at building facades.

25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{established}} in a permanent structure with equipment {{that is not}} intended for portable operation {{is referred to as}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>station.</b> This is {{the most common form of}} amateur radio station, and can be found in homes, schools, and some public buildings. A typical <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> is equipped with a transceiver and one or more antennas. For voice communications, the station will be equipped with a microphone; for communications using the Morse code, a telegraph key is common; and for communications over digital modes such as RTTY and PSK31, a station will be equipped with a specialized interface to connect the transceiver to a computer sound card. While not a requirement for radiocommunications, most <b>fixed</b> amateur radio <b>stations</b> are equipped with one or more computers, which serve tasks ranging from logging of contacts with other stations to various levels of <b>station</b> hardware control. <b>Fixed</b> <b>stations</b> might also be equipped with amplifiers, antenna rotators, SWR meters, and other station accessories.|$|R

However, mobile stations support neither enough volume of storage and processing power nor enough capacity of battery to do reliable communication for a long period. Moreover, wireless communication channels are less reliable. Hence, the communication channels with the mobile stations are often disconnected. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} multiple mobile stations to take checkpoints synchronously since the communication channels with the mobile stations may be disconnected even during taking the checkpoints. We have proposed hybrid checkpointing where checkpoints are taken asynchronously by the mobile stations and synchronously by the <b>fixed</b> <b>stations.</b> In addition, the mobile stations record messages for getting local states consistent with the checkpoints taken by the <b>fixed</b> <b>stations.</b> In this [...] ...|$|R
