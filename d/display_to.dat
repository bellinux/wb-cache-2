5|$|Both {{the male}} and female adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the {{rodent-run}} <b>display</b> <b>to</b> distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 it was {{discovered}} that the town owns an original version of Magna Carta, potentially worth about £20m, rather than a copy worth only £10,000. In 2015, the copy went on <b>display</b> <b>to</b> the general public at the town's Alexander Centre – the first time it had been on display for 715 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, {{the work was}} {{temporarily}} withdrawn from <b>display</b> <b>to</b> undergo significant conservation work. Completed in October 2009, the restoration {{was followed by the}} work's relocation in 2010 to the entrance area of the new gallery building, where it is intended to be the first work seen by visitors to the gallery.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, male {{variegated}} fairywrens {{have been}} observed carrying brightly coloured petals to <b>display</b> <b>to</b> females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow. Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, after visiting the planet Kreetassa, Captain Archer's (Scott Bakula) dog Porthos falls ill with an unknown pathogen. Archer stays overnight in sickbay to look after his dog with Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley) knowing that afterwards he must take part in an elaborate apology <b>display</b> <b>to</b> the Kreetassans.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} books and manuscripts are on <b>display</b> <b>to</b> the general public in the Sir John Ritblat Gallery which is open {{seven days a week}} at no charge. Some of the manuscripts in the {{exhibition}} include Beowulf, the Lindisfarne Gospels and St Cuthbert Gospel, a Gutenberg Bible, Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (King Arthur), Captain Cook's journal, Jane Austen's History of England, Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, Charles Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby, Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway and a room devoted solely to Magna Carta, as well as several Qur'ans and Asian items.|$|E

5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the <b>display</b> <b>to</b> be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate to <b>display</b> <b>to</b> females, {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel <b>display</b> <b>to</b> replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E

5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), and shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.), {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), feral {{cats and}} black rat (Rattus rattus). The variegated fairywren readily adopts a 'rodent-run' <b>display</b> <b>to</b> distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E

5|$|Marie-Thérèse {{married her}} cousin Louis Antoine on 9 June 1799 at Jelgava Palace. Louis XVIII ordered {{his wife to}} attend the {{marriage}} ceremony in Courland without her long-time friend (and rumoured lover) Marguerite de Gourbillon. Queen Marie Joséphine lived apart from her husband in Schleswig Holstein. Louis XVIII was trying desperately to <b>display</b> <b>to</b> the world a united family front. The queen refused to leave her friend behind with unpleasant consequences that rivalled the wedding in notoriety. Louis XVIII knew that his nephew Louis Antoine was not compatible with Marie-Thérèse. Despite this, he still pressed for the marriage, which proved to be quite unhappy and produced no children.|$|E

5|$|On 8 September 2007, Chaser members Taylor and Andrew Hansen {{launched}} a competing fireworks <b>display</b> <b>to</b> {{coincide with the}} official APEC fireworks display, which was only to be viewed by the APEC officials. The two displays were close to each other, with the official fireworks {{launched a}}t the Sydney Harbour Bridge, while the rival fireworks were fired from Woolwich. The team lit up a large screen with the text Screw APEC. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode; and in the DVD commentary on the episode Morrow said the display was hard to orchestrate and not cheap.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Dinorwig Slate Quarry is now {{within the}} Padarn Country Park, {{and the other}} part houses the Dinorwig power station in caverns under the old quarry workings. The National Slate Museum is located {{in some of the}} quarry workshops. The museum has {{displays}} including Victorian slate-workers' cottages that once stood at Tanygrisiau near Blaenau Ffestiniog. As well as many exhibits, it has the multi-media <b>display</b> <b>To</b> Steal a Mountain, showing the lives and work of the men who quarried slate here. The museum has the largest working water wheel in the United Kingdom, which is available for viewing via several walkways, and a restored incline formerly used to carry slate waggons uphill and downhill.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{remained}} in Kells until 1654. In that year, Cromwell's cavalry was quartered {{in the church}} at Kells, and {{the governor of the}} town sent the book to Dublin for safekeeping. Henry Jones, who later became bishop of Meath after the Restoration, presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, and it has remained there ever since, except for brief loans to other libraries and museums. It has been on <b>display</b> <b>to</b> the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page <b>display</b> <b>to</b> their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie {{provides}} information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up <b>display</b> <b>to</b> determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to <b>display</b> <b>to</b> the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
